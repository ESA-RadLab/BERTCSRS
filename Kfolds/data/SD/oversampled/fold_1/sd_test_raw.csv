1414,"Three previously healthy persons with a stress fracture A 42-year-old man presented with a one-month history of pain in his left knee, due to a fracture of the left medial tibia plateau, following a footrace. A 24-year-old man, also a jogger, had had increasing pain in his right lower leg for 4 months, which turned out to be due to a fracture of the posteromedial border of the tibia at the insertion of the flexor digitorum longus muscle. A 35-year-old woman presented with pain in her left foot and ankle that was due to a march fracture of the second metatarsal bone after over 5 hours of intermittent use of the clutch in a traffic jam. In all 3 patients, temporary cessation of the causative activity was sufficient for complete recovery after 3 months. Stress fractures are easily missed on X-rays. Treatment is conservative and consists of the elimination of causative factors to allow adequate healing. In selected cases, a splint or brace may be indicated. Furthermore, certain high risk and displaced fractures should be considered for surgical fixation. Return to the causative activity should be gradual with attention being paid to other potential risk factors.",Excluded
2158,"Evaluate of the effect of low tube voltage on the radiation dosage using 640-slice coronary CT angiography BACKGROUND: 640-slice coronary CT angiography is becoming an accurate and reliable method of diagnosing coronary heart disease. However, how to reduce the radiation dosage while ensuring the clinically acceptable image quality remains a quite challenging issue., OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of low tube voltage on radiation dosage under 640-slice coronary CT angiography (CCTA)., METHODS: Four hundred patients (236 males, 164 females) with coronary heart disease and underwent CCTA using DCVT were classified into A1 (tube voltage: 120 kV; exposure phase window: 30-80%), B1 (120 kV; 70-80%), A2 (100 kV; 30-80%) and B2 group (100 kV; 70-80%), respectively. Image qualities and effective dose (ED) were assessed and compared., RESULTS: No significant differences were observed among the groups in terms of age, height, weight and body mass index (BMI) (P > 0.05). ED were significantly lower in 100 kV group (P < 0.05). CT values of coronary artery in 100 kV groups were 13.5% and 17.3% higher than 120 kV group. ED in B1 group were 64.5% and 67.0% lower than A1 group. ED in B2 group were 65.4% and 65.2% lower than A2 group., CONCLUSION: When using a 640-slice CCTA prospective ECG-gating scanning mode, it is preferable to use a 100 kV tube voltage setting because compared to 120 kV tube voltage protocol, it seems to significantly decrease the mean effective radiation dose, without significantly lowering both the subjective and objective image quality.",Excluded
1982,"Perfusion MRI detects rCBF abnormalities in early stages of HIV- cognitive motor complex Objective: To evaluate patients with early HIV-cognitive motor complex (HIV-CMC) for possible regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) abnormalities on perfusion MRI (pMRI). Background(s): Nuclear medicine techniques have demonstrated global and focal cerebral perfusion abnormalities in patients with HIV dementia. Ultrafast pMRI enables the measurement of rCBF throughout the brain without the need to apply radioactive tracers or ionizing radiation. Method(s): pMRI was used to measure the rCBF in 19 patients with early stages of HIV-CMC and 15 healthy seronegative control subjects. The rCBF maps were registered to high-resolution anatomic MRI scans and transformed into Talairach space. Statistical analysis of the rCBF maps was performed with SPM96. Result(s): Compared with the control subjects, the patients with HIV had statistically significantly decreased rCBF bilaterally in the inferior lateral frontal cortices (right: -15%, p < 0.002; left: -12%, p < 0.005) and in the inferior medial parietal brain region (-15%, p < 0.0009). In contrast, rCBF was increased bilaterally in the posterior inferior parietal white matter (right: +19%, p < 0.0001; left: +17%, p < 0.001). Furthermore, rCBF abnormalities correlated significantly with clinical disease severity as measured by CD4 count, plasma viral load, Karnofsky score, and HIV dementia scale. Discussion(s): Our results are consistent with previous findings from PET and SPECT studies. Furthermore, pMRI can detect rCBF abnormalities that correlate with disease severity in HIV-CMC. Because pMRI is more cost-effective, faster, and safer than nuclear medicine techniques for monitoring rCBF changes, pMRI may be more feasible for monitoring the effects of therapy for HIV-CMC.",Excluded

1538,"Diagnostic accuracy of small intestine ultrasonography using an oral contrast agent in Crohn's disease: comparative study from the UK AIM: To evaluate the usefulness of small intestine contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (SICUS) using an oral contrast agent in routine clinical practice by assessing the level of agreement with the established techniques, small bowel follow-through (SBFT) and computed tomography (CT), and diagnostic accuracy compared with the final diagnosis in the detection of small bowel Crohn's disease (CD) and luminal complications in a regional centre., MATERIALS AND METHODS: All symptomatic known or suspected cases of CD who underwent SICUS were retrospectively reviewed. The level of agreement between SICUS and SBFT, CT, histological findings, and C-reactive protein (CRP) level was assessed using kappa (kappa) coefficient. Sensitivity was demonstrated using the final diagnosis as the reference standard defined by the outcome of clinical assessment, follow-up, and results of investigations other than SICUS., RESULTS: One hundred and forty-three patients underwent SICUS of these 79 (55%) were female. Eighty-six (60%) were known to have CD and 57 (40%) had symptoms suggestive of intestinal disease with no previous diagnosis. Forty-six (55%) of the known CD patients had had at least one previous surgical resection. The sensitivity of SICUS in detecting active small bowel CD in known CD and undiagnosed cases was 93%. The kappa coefficient was 0.88 and 0.91 with SBFT and CT, respectively. SICUS detected nine patients who had one or more small bowel strictures and six patients with a fistula all detected by SBFT or CT., CONCLUSION: SICUS is not only comparable to SBFT and CT but avoids radiation exposure and should be more widely adopted in the UK as a primary diagnostic procedure and to monitor disease complications in patients with CD.

1313,High-dose continuous infusion folinic acid and bolus 5-fluorouracil in patients with advanced colorectal cancer: a phase II study Encouraging results have recently been reported for studies using folinic acid in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in the treatment of patients with gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies. Thirty-six patients with advanced colorectal cancer with unequivocal evidence of progression while treated with fluoropyrimidines were treated with a six-day continuous infusion of 500 mg/m2/d of folinic acid initiated 24 hours before a five-day course of 5-FU administered as an intravenous (IV) bolus of 370 mg/m2/d. An initial dose of 250 mg/m2/d of 5-FU was used in patients previously treated with ionizing radiation and/or a nitrosourea. Three objective partial responses were observed. The overall median duration of survival was 8.1 months. Toxicity was acceptable and not in excess of that expected for 5-FU alone.,Excluded
1762,"Quantification of Acute Skin Toxicities in Patients With Breast Cancer Undergoing Adjuvant Proton versus Photon Radiation Therapy: A Single Institutional Experience Purpose: Acute skin toxicity in the form of radiation dermatitis (RD) or skin hyperpigmentation (SH) is a common problem experienced by patients undergoing breast irradiation. Proton radiation has been thought to deliver higher doses to skin compared with photon radiation because of differences in the physical properties between photons and protons; however, limited literature exists directly comparing toxicity outcomes. Methods and Materials: The highest recorded grades of acute RD and SH were analyzed in 86 patients undergoing adjuvant radiation therapy to the breast with or without regional lymph nodes after lumpectomy (breast-conserving surgery) or mastectomy with either proton pencil-beam scanning (n = 39) or photon (n = 47) radiation therapy within a single institution to analyze differences in severity of acute skin reactions. For 34 of 47 photon and 33 of 39 proton patients, a ""skin"" contour was retroactively created in our treatment planning systems, and multiple dosimetric parameters were calculated to quantify objective radiation doses received by skin. Result(s): On chi2 analysis, the highest reported grade of RD was significantly higher in women undergoing proton radiation compared with photon radiation; grade >=2 RD was present in 69.2% versus 29.8% of patients receiving proton and photon therapy, respectively (P =.002). Rates of grade 3 RD were 5.1% versus 4.3% for proton versus photon radiation, respectively (P =.848). Overall, there were no significant differences in rates of SH between modalities. There were no grade 4 to 5 toxicities in either cohort. Conclusion(s): In a comparison with patients receiving photon radiation, a significantly higher rate of grade >=2 RD was observed in patients undergoing proton radiation, with very low rates of grade 3 toxicity in both groups. Rates of SH did not differ significantly between modalities. Women should be counseled regarding the possibility of increased grade 2 toxicities, although this might present a dosimetric advantage for physicians when treating patients in the postmastectomy setting or when skin was involved on presentation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1383,"Informatics in radiology: use of a C-arm fluoroscopy simulator to support training in intraoperative radiography Mobile image intensifier systems (C-arms) are used frequently in orthopedic and reconstructive surgery, especially in trauma and emergency settings, but image quality and radiation exposure levels may vary widely, depending on the extent of the C-arm operator's knowledge and experience. Current training programs consist mainly of theoretical instruction in C-arm operation, the physical foundations of radiography, and radiation avoidance, and are largely lacking in hands-on application. A computer-based simulation program such as that tested by the authors may be one way to improve the effectiveness of C-arm training. In computer simulations of various scenarios commonly encountered in the operating room, trainees using the virtX program interact with three-dimensional models to test their knowledge base and improve their skill levels. Radiographs showing the simulated patient anatomy and surgical implants are ""reconstructed"" from data computed on the basis of the trainee's positioning of models of a C-arm, patient, and table, and are displayed in real time on the desktop monitor. Trainee performance is signaled in real time by color graphics in several control panels and, on completion of the exercise, is compared in detail with the performance of an expert operator. Testing of this computer-based training program in continuing medical education courses for operating room personnel showed an improvement in the overall understanding of underlying principles of intraoperative radiography performed with a C-arm, with resultant higher image quality, lower overall radiation exposure, and greater time efficiency.

2201,"Do clinical criteria reflect pathologic complete response in rectal cancer following neoadjuvant therapy? Background: Clinical complete response (cCR) in rectal cancer is being evaluated as a tool to identify patients who would not require surgery in the curative management of rectal cancer. Our study reviews mucosal changes after neoadjuvant therapy for rectal cancer in patients treated at our center. Method(s): Pathology reports were retrieved for patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (CRT) or high-dose rate brachytherapy (HDRBT). The macroscopic appearance of the specimen was compared with pathologic staging. Result(s): This study included 282 patients: 88 patients underwent neoadjuvant CRT and 194 patients underwent HDRBT; all patients underwent total mesorectal excision (TME). There were 160 male and 122 female patients with a median age of 65 years (range 29-87). The median time between neoadjuvant therapy and surgery was 50 and 58 days. Sixty patients (21.2%) were staged as ypT0N0, 21.2% had a pathologic complete response (pCR), and only 3.2% had a cCR. Of the 67 patients with initial involvement of the circumferential radial margin (CRM), 44 converted to pathologic CRM-. Two hundred seventy-three patients (96.8%) had mucosal abnormalities. Of the 222 patients with residual tumor, 70 patients had no macroscopic tumor visualized but an ulcer in its place. Conclusion(s): Most patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy for rectal cancer have residual mucosal abnormalities which preclude to a cCR as per published criteria from Brazil. Further studies are required to optimize clinical evaluation and MRI imaging in selected patients.Copyright © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
1345,"Treatment of limited small cell lung cancer: An old or new challenge? Purpose of review: This review highlights how progress has been made in treating limited small cell lung cancer and outlines current challenges to overcome for improved cure rates. Recent findings: There is a rationale for the tumour, node, metastasis staging system to replace the current convention of limited versus extensive stage. Positron emission tomography may aid in staging but prospective validation in larger series of patients is needed. Cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy has yet to be superseded by either newer cytotoxic drugs or targeted agents. More progress has been made for radiotherapy but questions of optimal dose, schedule, timing and treatment volume remain unanswered. Summary: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is associated with a one in four chance of cure. Two ongoing phase III trials have been designed to address the optimal radiotherapy regimen to combine with cisplatin and etoposide. Close collaboration between radiation and medical oncologists is needed to make further progress and to improve patient access to curative intent concurrent chemoradiotherapy regimens. © 2011 Wolters Kluwer Health Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Excluded
1531,"Harderian Gland Tumorigenesis: Low-Dose and LET Response Increased cancer risk remains a primary concern for travel into deep space and may preclude manned missions to Mars due to large uncertainties that currently exist in estimating cancer risk from the spectrum of radiations found in space with the very limited available human epidemiological radiation-induced cancer data. Existing data on human risk of cancer from X-ray and gamma-ray exposure must be scaled to the many types and fluences of radiations found in space using radiation quality factors and dose-rate modification factors, and assuming linearity of response since the shapes of the dose responses at low doses below 100 mSv are unknown. The goal of this work was to reduce uncertainties in the relative biological effect (RBE) and linear energy transfer (LET) relationship for space-relevant doses of charged-particle radiation-induced carcinogenesis. The historical data from the studies of Fry et al. and Alpen et al. for Harderian gland (HG) tumors in the female CB6F1 strain of mouse represent the most complete set of experimental observations, including dose dependence, available on a specific radiation-induced tumor in an experimental animal using heavy ion beams that are found in the cosmic radiation spectrum. However, these data lack complete information on low-dose responses below 0.1 Gy, and for chronic low-dose-rate exposures, and there are gaps in the LET region between 25 and 190 keV/mum. In this study, we used the historical HG tumorigenesis data as reference, and obtained HG tumor data for 260 MeV/u silicon (LET ~70 keV/mum) and 1,000 MeV/u titanium (LET ~100 keV/mum) to fill existing gaps of data in this LET range to improve our understanding of the dose-response curve at low doses, to test for deviations from linearity and to provide RBE estimates. Animals were also exposed to five daily fractions of 0.026 or 0.052 Gy of 1,000 MeV/u titanium ions to simulate chronic exposure, and HG tumorigenesis from this fractionated study were compared to the results from single 0.13 or 0.26 Gy acute titanium exposures. Theoretical modeling of the data show that a nontargeted effect model provides a better fit than the targeted effect model, providing important information at space-relevant doses of heavy ions.",Excluded
2375,"Effects of Probiotics with or without Honey on Radiation-induced Diarrhea Background: Diarrhea is a well-recognized side effect associated with pelvic radiation; however, there is not any effective common treatment for radiation-induced diarrhea. A popular alternative is probiotics, which have been used in several gastrointestinal disorders. Probiotics are live microbial food supplements. Furthermore, honey is a putative nutritional with a variety of health effects, including antibacterial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and prebiotic. The present study evaluated the effects of probiotic with or without honey on radiation-induced diarrhea. Material(s) and Method(s): Sixty-seven adult patients with pelvic cancer underwent radiotherapy for four weeks. They randomized to receive probiotic (n = 22), probiotic plus honey (n = 21) or placebo (n = 24) from one week before radiotherapy for five weeks. Diarrhea grade and stool consistency score were recorded weekly according to the Common Toxicity Criteria system and the Bristol scales, respectively. Result(s): The results showed a decrease in the daily number of bowel movements (p = 0.003 and 0.006), diarrhea grade (p = 0.001 and 0.001) and the need for antidiarrheal medication (p = 0.021 and 0.041) also an increase in the stool consistency (p = 0.004 and 0.005) in patients who either used probiotic or probiotic plus honey (respectively), these were significant in weeks 4 and 5 of treatment. Conclusion(s): Probiotics with or without honey can reduce the incidence of radiation-induced diarrhea and the need for antidiarrheal medication.",Excluded
2317,"Imaging signs and diagnosis of bone echinococcosis Objective: To evaluate the value of imaging investigations in the diagnosis of bone echinococcosis by analysing the X-ray, CT and MRI signs. Method(s): Imaging data of 7 patients aged from 23 to 56 years (mean age 39.5 years) with bone echinococcosis were analysed retrospectively. All cases underwent X-ray plain film examination (frontal view and lateral view); 4 cases were examined with CT; 3 cases received MRI scan. Result(s): The echinococcosis located in skull (1 case), vertebrae (3 cases), sacrum (1 case), ilium (1 case) and ribs (1 case) respectively. X-ray signs: 5 cases appeared as expanding destructive lesion, two of them were solitary cystic lesions, the others were multiple cystic lesions. Lytic destruction was showed in 2 cases. Sclerotic margin, calcification, soft tissue mass was visible in 5, 1 and 4 cases respectively. CT signs: 3 of 4 cases were expanding destructive lesions, including 2 multiple cystic lesions and 1 solitary cystic destruction. The other one showed lytic destruction. 3 had sclerotic margin; calcification was identified in 2 cases, 4 cases accompanied with soft tissue mass. MRI signs: All of 3 cases occurred at vertebrae, solitary cystic lesion in one and multiple cystic lesions in two. Lesions showed low signal on T1WI image, high signal on T2WI image and appeared as grape shapes. Involved vertebrae showed wedge-shaped. Conclusion(s): Imaging modalities were significantly valuable in the diagnosis of bone echinococcosis. Combination of X-ray radiography, CT, MRI and epidemiological information is helpful in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of the bone echinococcosis.",Excluded
2289,"Lower body negative pressure counters posture induced increases of intraocular pressure and intracranial pressure Purpose: Recent ophthalmic evaluations of seven astronauts after six-month missions to International Space Station show unexpected vision impairment. In addition, lumbar punctures in four astronauts with optic disc edema showed moderate elevations of cerebral spinal fluid pressure after returning to Earth. This Visual Impairment Intracranial Pressure (VIIP) syndrome is likely related to a headward body fluid shift that elevates intracranial pressure (ICP). We hypothesized that a moderate level of lower body negative pressure (LBNP) would counteract head down, body-tilt, induced elevations in IOP and ICP. Method(s): Twenty-five normal healthy non-smoking volunteers participated in this study (mean age: 31 years). Right and left IOP, ICP (non-invasive ultrasound pulsed phase locked loop), arm blood pressure, and heart rate were measured during the last minute of each testing condition. Subjects were positioned supine (5 mins), sitting (5 mins), 15-degrees head-down tilt (HDT) (5 mins) and ten minutes of HDT with LBNP (25 mmHg). The order of HDT and HDT+LBNP tests were balanced. The right and left IOP values were averaged and used for statistical analysis (significance accepted at p<0.05). Data are presented as mean +/- standard deviation. The change from supine was calculated for IOP values. Result(s): IOP significantly decreased from supine to sitting posture by 3.2 +/- 1.4 mmHg, and increased by 0.9 +/- 1.3 mmHg from supine to the HDT position. LBNP during head-down-tilt significantly lowered IOP to supine levels (difference from supine, 0.3 +/- 1.1 mmHg). In addition, added LBNP during HDT significantly decreased ICP-related pulse amplitudes of transcranial ultrasound waveforms by 2.1+/-3.4 microns (n=9). Mean blood pressure and heart rate did not change significantly across all conditions. Conclusion(s): These data demonstrate that short duration exposures to HDT increase IOP and ICP significantly and further, that LBNP counteracts these elevations of IOP and ICP. Therefore, spaceflight countermeasures that shift fluid to lower body may mitigate vision problems.",Excluded
2412,"Outcomes of Trimodal Therapy for cT2-3 Urothelial Carcinoma in a Racially Diverse Population: A Single Institution Experience in the Bronx BACKGROUND: Radical cystectomy (RC) is the historical 'gold standard' treatment for cT2-3 urothelial carcinoma (UC). However, recent evidence supports comparable outcomes of bladder preserving trimodal therapy (TMT) to RC in select patients. OBJECTIVE(S): To assess the oncologic outcomes of our institutional TMT experience. METHOD(S): We retrospectively identified all patients that received radiation therapy (RT) for cT2-3 UC from 2012 to 2018. Clinicopathologic data was then extracted from the patients' medical records. We included patients who underwent RT with or without concurrent chemotherapy for curative intent after diagnostic TURBT, with or without re-staging TURBT. Patient clinical (age, sex, race) and pathologic/disease characteristics of bladder cancer (stage, presence of hydronephrosis, concurrent carcinoma in-situ) were collected. Primary outcomes were: response to TMT (complete response [CR], partial response [PR], progression), recurrence-free, and overall survival. We also analyzed rates of salvage cystectomy and associated disease-specific outcomes. Response was based on the first surveillance imaging, cystoscopy, or TURBT after completion of TMT. RESULT(S): 24 patients underwent TMT during the study period. 29.2% of patients were black/non-hispanic, 37.5% were latino/hispanic, and 20.8% were white/non-hispanic. 58.3% of patients were female. 19 (79.2%), 3 (12.5%), and 2 (8.3%) patients experienced CR, PR and progression after TMT, respectively. At a median follow-up of 22.4 months, 19 (79.2%) patients were recurrence-free, 3 were alive with disease (12.5%), and 2 expired from other causes (8.3%; 1 with and 1 without disease present). Overall, 22 (92.7%) patients were still alive at last follow-up. No clinical variables were significant predictors of CR to TMT. CONCLUSION(S): In concordance with prior reports, TMT offers excellent tumor response rates for patients seeking definitive therapy for cT2-3 UC. Extended follow-up is needed to assess the durability of response and long-term survival after TMT.Copyright © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.",Excluded

1694,"Trend dynamics of thyroid cancer incidence among China and the U.S. adult population from 1990 to 2017: a joinpoint and age-period-cohort analysis BACKGROUND: Thyroid cancer (TC) is the most common malignant disease of the endocrine system. Based on the previously published reports, the incidence of TC has been increasing in the past 25 years, and the reason for the increase is not yet clear. The present study aims to reveal the long-term trends and age-period-cohort effects for the incidence of TC in China and the U.S. from 1990 to 2017., METHODS: We examined the trends of TC incidence and the average annual percentage change (AAPC) of rate using the Joinpoint regression analysis in the two countries, for the different genders (men/women) in the Global Burden of Disease (GBD 2017). We further used an age-period-cohort model to analyze age-period-cohort effects on TC incidence., RESULTS: The ASIR of China increased markedly with AAPC of 4.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): 4.0, 5.0%) and 1.8% (1.6, 2.0%) for men and women during 1990-2017. The ASIR of the U. S increased by 1.4% (1.0, 1.8%) and 1.3% (0.9, 1.7%) for men and women from 1990 to 2017.TC increased with the age and period. Aging was one of the most influential factors of TC in China. The age effect increased markedly in the U.S. compared with China. The period effect showed an increase in China while that tended to grow steadily during 1990-2017 in the U.S. The cohort effect peaked in 1963-1967 birth cohorts for men and women in China and declined consistently in the birth cohort in the U.S., CONCLUSION: From 1990 to 2017, due to ionizing radiation and over-diagnosis, age-standardized TC incidence rates in both genders rose in China and the U.S. The standardized incidence rate of women is higher than that of men. It is necessary to provide women with reasonable prevention and protection measures for TC. We need to apply for health services and screening to reduce ionizing radiation.",Excluded
2231,"Calcium imaging and selective computed tomography angiography in comparison to functional testing for suspected coronary artery disease: the multicentre, randomized CRESCENT trial AIMS: To compare the effectiveness and safety of a cardiac computed tomography (CT) algorithm with functional testing in patients with symptoms suggestive of coronary artery disease (CAD)., METHODS AND RESULTS: Between April 2011 and July 2013, 350 patients with stable angina, referred to the outpatient clinic of four Dutch hospitals, were prospectively randomized between cardiac CT and functional testing (2 : 1 ratio). The tiered cardiac CT protocol included a calcium scan followed by CT angiography if the Agatston calcium score was between 1 and 400. Patients with test-specific contraindications were not excluded from study participation. By 1 year, fewer patients randomized to cardiac CT reported anginal complaints (P = 0.012). The cumulative radiation dose was slightly higher in the CT group (6.6 +/- 8.7 vs. 6.1 +/- 9.3 mSv; P < 0.0001). After 1.2 years, event-free survival was 96.7% for patients randomized to CT and 89.8% for patients randomized to functional testing (P = 0.011). After CT, the final diagnosis was established sooner (P < 0.0001), and additional downstream testing was required less frequently (25 vs. 53%, P < 0.0001), resulting in lower cumulative diagnostic costs (369 vs. 440; P < 0.0001)., CONCLUSION: For patients with suspected stable CAD, a tiered cardiac CT protocol offers an effective and safe alternative to functional testing. Incorporating the calcium scan into the diagnostic workup was safe and lowered diagnostic expenses and radiation exposure. Copyright Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

The volumes of the optic nerve receiving doses of more than 7.5 or 12 Gy, respectively, were defined. Optic nerve circumference included in the 30%, 40%, 50%, or 80% isodose (ON%) and retina included in 30% or 40% were determined as quantal effects. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed for clinical variables as well as probit analysis to define EDx (doses where a positive response is expected in x% of the cases)., RESULTS: Median follow-up was 90.0 (interquartile range 69.0-98.0) months. Fifty-two (71%) and 49 (67%) patients developed radiation retinopathy and optic neuropathy (any grade). Age, length of follow-up and diabetes were significant parameters regarding retinopathy. Optic neuropathy was significantly influenced by age, length of follow-up, and ON30. The probability of optic neuropathy (any grade and grade >= 2) significantly increases with the dose (p ranges from 0.0126 to 0.0211)., CONCLUSION: Treatment planning should aim at minimizing encompassing isodoses particularly in the low dose region, without compromising PTV coverage.

Patients and Methods: A total of 222 prospectively analyzed patients with various HN malignancies were treated with conventional and intensity-modulated RT. Stimulated individual parotid gland flow rates were measured before RT and 1 year after RT using Lashley cups at both centers. A flow ratio <25% of pretreatment was defined as a complication. The data were fitted to the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman model. Result(s): A total of 384 parotid glands (Michigan: 157; Utrecht: 227 glands) was available for analysis 1 year after RT. Combined NTCP analysis based on mean dose resulted in a TD50 (uniform dose leading to 50% complication probability) of 39.9 Gy and m (steepness of the curve) of 0.40. The resulting NTCP curve had good qualitative agreement with the combined clinical data. Mean doses of 25-30 Gy were associated with 17-26% NTCP. Conclusion(s): A definite NTCP curve for parotid gland function 1 year after RT is presented, based on mean dose. No threshold dose was observed, and TD50 was equal to 40 Gy.

1397,"UCP-3 uncoupling protein confers hypoxia resistance to renal epithelial cells and is upregulated in renal cell carcinoma Tumor cells can adapt to a hostile environment with reduced oxygen supply. The present study aimed to identify mechanisms that confer hypoxia resistance. Partially hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-resistant proximal tubular (PT) cells were selected by exposing PT cultures to repetitive cycles of H/R. Thereafter, H/R-induced changes in mRNA and protein expression, inner mitochondrial membrane potential (DELTAPSI(m)), formation of superoxide, and cell death were compared between H/R-adapted and control PT cultures. As a result, H/R-adapted PT cells exhibited lower H/R-induced hyperpolarization of DELTAPSI(m) and produced less superoxide than the control cultures. Consequently, H/R triggered DELTAPSI(m) break-down and DNA degradation in a lower percentage of H/R-adapted than control PT cells. Moreover, H/R induced upregulation of mitochondrial uncoupling protein-3 (UCP-3) in H/R-adapted PT but not in control cultures. In addition, ionizing radiation killed a lower percentage of H/R-adapted as compared to control cells suggestive of an H/R-radiation cross-resistance developed by the selection procedure. Knockdown of UCP-3 decreased H/R- and radioresitance of the H/R-adapted cells. Finally, UCP-3 protein abundance of PT-derived clear cell renal cell carcinoma and normal renal tissue was compared in human specimens indicating upregulation of UCP-3 during tumor development. Combined, our data suggest functional significance of UCP-3 for H/R resistance.",Excluded
2135,"Treatment of locally recurrent carcinoma of the nasopharynx Forty-two patients with recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma in the primary site and/or neck nodes were treated at the University of California, San Francisco, between 1940 and 1974. Sixty-nine per cent of the recurrences appeared within 3 years and 83% within 5 years after initial treatment. Retreatment included external radiotherapy and/or intercavitary radium or cobalt beads in the majority of cases. The actuarial survival rate was 41% at 5 years after first recurrence. Survival rates increased proportionally with increasing time between initial treatment and recurrence. There was no statistically significant difference in survival rates with respect to age, sex, race, or histology. Local soft-tissue or bone necrosis developed in 9 patients, but both conditions were tolerated well.",Excluded
1706,"Conditional survival among patients with oropharyngeal cancer treated with radiation therapy and alive without recurrence 5 years after diagnosis Background: Risk of recurrence among patients with oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) who survive 5 years is low. The goal of this study was to assess long-term survival of patients with OPC alive without recurrence 5 years after diagnosis. Method(s): This study included newly diagnosed patients with OPC, who had been treated with radiation and were alive without recurrence 5 years after diagnosis. Overall survival (OS) probabilities beyond 5 years were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Factors associated with OS were determined using Bayesian piecewise exponential survival regression. Standardized mortality ratios for all-cause death were estimated controlling for study year, age, and sex in the US general population. Result(s): Among 1699 patients, the additional 2-year, 5-year, and 10-year OS probabilities were 94%, 83%, and 63%, respectively, and were lower than those in the general population. Patients who were older, were current or former smokers, had other than tonsil or base of tongue tumors, or had T4 tumors had a higher risk of death. Patients who had base of tongue tumors and had received intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or lower-radiation doses had a lower risk of death. Standardized mortality ratios were higher among current and heavy smokers and lower among recipients of IMRT and lower radiation doses. Conclusion(s): In this large cohort, long-term survival among patients with OPC was good but lower than predicted for the general population. Patients treated with IMRT and those with less tobacco exposure had better outcomes.Copyright © 2020 American Cancer Society",Excluded
2441,"Percutaneous computed tomography-guided lung biopsies: preliminary results using an augmented reality navigation system AIMS AND BACKGROUND: ""Augmented reality"" is a technique to create a composite view by augmenting the real intervention field, visualized by the doctor, with additional information coming from a virtual volume generated using computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance or ultrasound images previously acquired from the same patient. In the present study we verified the accuracy and validated the clinical use of an augmented reality navigation system produced to perform percutaneous CT-guided lung biopsies., METHODS: One hundred and eighty consecutive patients with solitary parenchymal lung lesions, enrolled using a nonrandom enrollment system, underwent percutaneous CT-guided aspiration and core biopsy using a traditional technique (group C, 90 patients) and navigation system assistance (group S, 90 patients). For each patient we recorded the largest lesion diameter, procedure time, overall number of CT scans, radiation dose, and complications. The entire experimental project was evaluated and approved by the local institutional review board (ethics committee)., RESULTS: Each procedure was concluded successfully and a pathological diagnosis was reached in 96% of cases in group S and 90% of cases in group C. Procedure time, overall number of CT scans and incident x-ray radiation dose (CTDIvol) were significantly reduced in navigation system-assisted procedures (P <0.001; z = 5.64) compared with traditional CT-guided procedures. The percentage of procedural complications was 14% in group S and 17% in group C., CONCLUSION: The augmented reality navigation system used in this study was a highly safe, technically reliable and effective support tool in percutaneous CT-guided lung biopsy, allowing to shorten the procedure time and reduce the incident x-ray radiation dose to patients and the rate of insufficient specimens. Furthermore, it has the potential to increase the number of procedures executed in the allocated time without increasing the number of complications.",Excluded

2266,"Biologic dosimetry in thyroid cancer patients after repeated treatments with iodine-131 UNLABELLED: To estimate a cumulative dosimetric index that reflects the dose to the circulating lymphocytes after repeated treatments with 131I, biologic dosimetry was applied to 18 patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma and neck relapse or lung metastases., METHODS: Chromosomal aberrations were scored in peripheral blood samples that were obtained before and 4 days after each administration of 3.7 GBq 131I according to two methods, conventional cytogenetics and chromosome 4 painting., RESULTS: The mean dosimetric index was equal to 0.5 Gy by both methods after the administration of 3.7 GBq 131I. Repeated administrations of 131I delivered the same dose each time, resulting in a cumulative dose from 1-3.5 Gy in the patients who had two to seven treatments. However, the estimated dose, based on the number of chromosomal aberrations on Day 4 and, above all, from the third treatment on, was considerably lower than the real dose absorbed by the lymphocytes. This may be linked to the phenomenon of apoptosis, which results in a loss of information during the course of repeated irradiation., CONCLUSION: Both chromosomal painting and conventional cytogenetics underestimate the cumulative dose after repeated 131I treatments. A complementary test measuring apoptosis may improve the dose estimates.",Excluded
2356,"Prediction of restenosis based on hemodynamical markers in revascularized femoro-popliteal arteries during leg flexion Endovascular therapy in patients suffering from peripheral arterial disease shows high rates of restenosis. The poor clinical outcomes are commonly explained by the demanding mechanical environment due to leg movements, but the mechanisms responsible for restenosis remain unknown. In this study, we hypothesized that restenosis following revascularization is associated with hemodynamical markers derived from blood flow during leg flexion. Therefore, we performed personalized computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses of 20 patients, who underwent routine endovascular femoro-popliteal interventions. The CFD analyses were conducted using 3D models of the arterial geometry in straight and flexed positions, which were reconstructed from 2D angiographic images. Based on restenosis rates reported at 6-month follow-up, logistic regression analyses were performed to predict restenosis from hemodynamical parameters. Results showed that severe arterial deformations, such as kinking, induced by leg flexion in stented arteries led to adverse hemodynamic conditions that may trigger restenosis. A logistic regression analysis based solely on hemodynamical markers had an accuracy of 75%, which showed that flow parameters are sufficient to predict restenosis (p = 0.031). However, better predictions were achieved by adding the treatment method in the model. This suggests that a more accurate image acquisition technique is required to capture the localized modifications of blood flow following intervention, especially around the stented artery. This approach, based on the immediate postoperative configuration of the artery, has the potential to identify patients at increased risk of restenosis. Based on this information, clinicians could take preventive measures and more closely follow these patients to avoid complications.Copyright © 2019, The Author(s).",Excluded
1780,"Combining paratransgenesis with SIT: impact of ionizing radiation on the DNA copy number of Sodalis glossinidius in tsetse flies BACKGROUND: Tsetse flies (Diptera: Glossinidae) are the cyclical vectors of the causative agents of African Trypanosomosis, which has been identified as a neglected tropical disease in both humans and animals in many regions of sub-Saharan Africa. The sterile insect technique (SIT) has shown to be a powerful method to manage tsetse fly populations when used in the frame of an area-wide integrated pest management (AW-IPM) program. To date, the release of sterile males to manage tsetse fly populations has only been implemented in areas to reduce transmission of animal African Trypanosomosis (AAT). The implementation of the SIT in areas with Human African Trypanosomosis (HAT) would require additional measures to eliminate the potential risk associated with the release of sterile males that require blood meals to survive and hence, might contribute to disease transmission. Paratransgenesis offers the potential to develop tsetse flies that are refractory to trypanosome infection by modifying their associated bacteria (Sodalis glossinidius) here after referred to as Sodalis. Here we assessed the feasibility of combining the paratransgenesis approach with SIT by analyzing the impact of ionizing radiation on the copy number of Sodalis and the vectorial capacity of sterilized tsetse males., RESULTS: Adult Glossina morsitans morsitans that emerged from puparia irradiated on day 22 post larviposition did not show a significant decline in Sodalis copy number as compared with non-irradiated flies. Conversely, the Sodalis copy number was significantly reduced in adults that emerged from puparia irradiated on day 29 post larviposition and in adults irradiated on day 7 post emergence. Moreover, irradiating 22-day old puparia reduced the copy number of Wolbachia and Wigglesworthia in emerged adults as compared with non-irradiated controls, but the radiation treatment had no significant impact on the vectorial competence of the flies., CONCLUSION: Although the radiation treatment significantly reduced the copy number of some tsetse fly symbionts, the copy number of Sodalis recovered with time in flies irradiated as 22-day old puparia. This recovery offers the opportunity to combine a paratransgenesis approach - using modified Sodalis to produce males refractory to trypanosome infection - with the release of sterile males to minimize the risk of disease transmission, especially in HAT endemic areas. Moreover, irradiation did not increase the vector competence of the flies for trypanosomes.",Excluded
1857,"Retrospective assessment of self-reported exposure to medical ionizing radiation: results of a feasibility study conducted in Germany BACKGROUND: Exposure to medical ionizing radiation has been increasing over the past decades and constitutes the largest contributor to overall radiation exposure in the general population. While occupational exposures are generally monitored by national radiation protection agencies, individual data on medical radiation exposure for the general public are not regularly collected. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of assessing lifetime medical ionizing radiation exposure from diagnostic and therapeutic procedures retrospectively and prospectively within the framework of the German National Cohort study., METHODS: Retrospective assessment of individual medical radiation exposure was done using an interviewer-based questionnaire among 199 participants (87 men and 112 women) aged 20-69 randomly drawn from the general population at two recruitment locations in Germany. X-ray cards were distributed to 97 participants at one recruitment center to prospectively collect medical radiation exposure over a 6-month period. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used to test differences in self-reported median examination frequencies for the variables age, sex, and recruitment center. To evaluate the self-reported information on radiological procedures, agreement was assessed using health insurance data as gold standard for the time period 2005 to 2010 from 8 participants., RESULTS: Participants reported a median of 7 lifetime X-ray examinations (interquartile range 4-13), and 42% (n = 83) reported having had a CT scan (2, IQR = 1-3). Women reported statistically significant more X-ray examinations than men. Individual frequencies above the 75th percentile (>=15 X-ray examinations) were predominantly observed among women and in individuals >50 years of age. The prospective exposure assessment yielded a 60% return-rate of X-ray cards (n = 58). 16 (28%) of the returned cards reported radiological examinations conducted during the 6-month period but generally lacked more detailed exposure information. X-ray examinations reported for the period for which health insurance data were available provided a moderately valid measure of individual medical radiation exposure., CONCLUSIONS: The assessment of more recent medical examinations seems in the German National Cohort study feasible, whereas lifetime medical radiation exposure appears difficult to assess via self-reports. Health insurance data may be a potentially useful tool for the assessment of individual data on medical radiation exposure both retrospectively and prospectively.",Excluded
2023,"Assessment of real-world data surrogate for the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) OBJECTIVES: The 21stCentury Cures Act calls for the incorporation of real-world evidence (RWE) into the drug labeling process. Critics cite deficiencies of RWE as compared to randomized controlled trials (RCT). We aimed to assess whether subjectively reported best response to treatment differed from responses based on radiographic measurements of target lesions. METHOD(S): Electronic case report forms (eCRF) were fielded to assess clinical response to systemic therapy in a rare malignancy. A comparison of subjectively reported best response with radio-graphic measurements of target lesions was performed to assess responses. RESULT(S): Fifteen physicians with experience treating this malignancy participated in a CRF-based analysis of patterns of care. Treatment response for each line of therapy was collected for each of the 59 patients via CRF. For 9 patients (15%) with reported partial remission (PR), CRFs were augmented with bi-dimensional measurements of sentinel tumors from pre-treatment and best response radiographs (reports). Treatment response was calculated using sum of diameters according to RECIST and compared to the corresponding physician-reported response. Measurement-based response revealed 4 PR, 2 stable disease, and 3 progressive disease, and a concordance of 44.4% (95% CI: 15.3%, 77.4%) between response assessment methods. Reasons cited for variance include availability of previous scans for comparison, inconsistency in target lesions imaged, bone metastases difficult to follow, and use of diameter vs SUV (standardized uptake value) on positron emission topography (PET) scans. CONCLUSION(S): Subjective assessments of response collected via manual chart extraction, electronic medical record (EMR) review via natural language processing, or CRF may be problematic and limit the potential role of RWE in drug label expansion. The collection of target lesion measurements by CRF presents an attractive alternative to elevate the quality and accuracy of clinical response assessment in oncologic patients, but limitations exist.",Excluded
1574,"Intensity-modulated radiation therapy reduces radiation-induced trismus in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma BACKGROUND: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) provides better temporomandibular joint (TMJ) sparing and, thus, may reduce the incidence of radiation-induced trismus after radiotherapy. The objectives of this study were to evaluate radiation-induced trismus in patients with NPC who had received IMRT and to assess the pretreatment factors, relevant treatment factors, and dosimetry parameters associated with trismus. METHOD(S): A prospective, single-arm measurement study with more than 5 years of follow-up was designed. Patients with newly diagnosed stage I through IVB NPC who received treatment with IMRT were eligible. Patients received 66 to 70 grays (Gy) to the gross tumor volume. The maximal interincisal distance (MID) was measured at baseline and 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, and 5 years after they completed IMRT. RESULT(S): The trial enrolled 211 consecutive patients from 2001 to 2004. The mean dose to the TMJ ranged from 6.18 Gy to 51.36 Gy (median dose, 29.88 Gy). Compared with baseline MID levels, normalized MID levels at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, and 5 years after IMRT were 94.6% +/- 9.9%, 92.5% +/- 10.5%, 92% +/- 10.6%, 92.2% +/- 10.5%, 92.1% +/- 10.2%, and 90.3% +/- 11.4%, respectively (P <.001). According to a revised subjective-objective management-analytical (SOMA) scale, grade 1/2 trismus was identified in 12 of 211 patients (5.7%), and no grade 3/4 trismus was observed. There was an increasing risk of trismus after IMRT when the MID was <40.5 mm at baseline compared with an MID >40.5 mm (P =.007). No dosimetric parameter was associated with trismus. CONCLUSION(S): IMRT was able to reduce the radiation dose to the TMJ and likely reduced the incidence and severity of radiation-induced trismus after radiotherapy.

1257,"Pharyngocutaneous fistula after salvage laryngectomy: IMPACT of interval between radiotherapy and surgery, and performance of bilateral neck dissection Background Pharyngocutaneous fistula is a serious complication of total laryngectomy. The purpose of this study was to examine predisposing factors at our institution. Methods We conducted a retrospective review of 94 consecutive patients undergoing total laryngectomy. Cases with hypopharyngeal primary tumors or undergoing extended hypopharyngeal resection with flap augmentation of the pharynx were excluded. Results Seventy-four cases met inclusion criteria. A total of 25.7% patients developed a pharyngocutaneous fistula. The fistula rate was higher after salvage laryngectomy than after primary surgery (34.0% vs 11.1%; p =.05). Among salvage laryngectomies, performance of laryngectomy within 1 year of completion of radiotherapy (p =.006) and performance of concomitant bilateral neck dissection (p =.02) were significant risk factors for development of a fistula. Radiation dose, addition of chemotherapy, use of pectoralis major myofascial flap, preoperative tracheostomy, primary puncture, primary tumor subsite, and initial T classification were not significant.

2358,"Creating percutaneous radiocephalic arteriovenous fistulas at the wrist Background: The first arteriovenous fistulas were created at the wrist more than 60 years ago. Basic surgical construction techniques remain unchanged with mobilization and repositioning of the vessels followed by a sutured anastomosis. We used the Ellipsys device to construct percutaneous radiocephalic-arteriovenous fistulas at the wrist and report the results. Method(s): Data were reviewed retrospectively for all patients who had a percutaneous radiocephalic-arteriovenous fistula created during a 6-month period. Each individual underwent ultrasound vessel mapping in addition to physical examination. When a radiocephalic-arteriovenous fistula was feasible and a communicating vein 2 mm in diameter was noted in the distal forearm along with a radial artery 2 mm, a percutaneous radiocephalic-arteriovenous fistula was considered and reviewed with the patient. Result(s): Four individuals met the criteria to consider a percutaneous radiocephalic-arteriovenous fistula and all elected to have the procedure performed. Ages were 54-85 years. Three were diabetic and one was female. All percutaneous radiocephalic-arteriovenous fistulas were technically successful. Two individuals had not yet started dialysis therapy. Successful and repetitive cannulation for the two individuals with catheters was initiated at 4 and 8 weeks post procedure. The two pre-dialysis patients had physiologic arteriovenous fistula maturation (6 mm vein diameter and >500 mL/min flow) at 4 and 12 weeks. There were no procedural or late complications and none required intervention. Follow-up was 8-23 months (mean 16 months). Conclusion(s): The success of these percutaneous radiocephalic-arteriovenous fistulas suggests that use of the Ellipsys device will be applicable at the wrist in selected patients where appropriate vessel sizes and configurations are found.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.",Excluded
2355,"'Plan of the day' adaptive radiotherapy for bladder cancer using helical tomotherapy Background and purpose: This study assessed the potential of tomotherapy based Image Guided Radiotherapy (IGRT) to increase the accuracy of bladder irradiation using a 'plan of the day' adaptive radiotherapy (ART) technique. Material(s) and Method(s): Ten patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer underwent bladder preservation with trimodality therapy in an ongoing trial. All patients received 64 Gy/32# to the whole bladder and seven of them received a boost of 68 Gy/32# to the tumour bed. The ART technique entailed the generation of six IMRT plans for each patient, using six isotropic PTVs of 5-30 mm applied to the bladder volume (CTV) to generate the PTVs. Megavoltage CT (MVCT) imaging was done to correct positioning errors and choose the 'plan of the day'. Result(s): Post treatment MVCT scans (315 scans) were used to generate multiple anisotropic PTVs for three hypothetical scenarios. Overall, coverage of anterior and superior walls required larger margins than other walls. Maximum geographical miss, in spite of IGRT, was noted for the superior (13.8%) and anterior walls (10.3%). Conclusion(s): Plan of the day ART is a feasible and promising technique for optimal treatment and dose escalation in bladder cancer. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd All rights reserved.

2299,"Screening for lung cancer using low dose CT scanning BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer related death in Ireland. The majority of lung cancers are inoperable at the time of diagnosis and consequently the overall 5 year survival is less than 10%. The objective of the ProActive Lung Cancer Detection (PALCAD) study was to evaluate whether low dose chest computed tomographic scanning (LDCCT) can detect early stage asymptomatic lung cancer in a high risk urban population., METHODS: Four hundred and forty nine subjects of median age 55 years (range 50-74) with a median pack year smoking history of 45 years (range 10-160), with no previous cancer history and medically fit to undergo thoracic surgery were recruited. After informed consent, LDCCT was performed on all subjects. Non-calcified nodules (NCNs) of >/=10 mm in diameter were referred for biopsy. Follow up with interval LDCCT at 6, 12 and 24 months to exclude growth was recommended for NCNs <10 mm in diameter., RESULTS: Six (1.3%) NCNs of >/=10 mm were detected of which one (0.23%) had non-small cell lung cancer stage 1; 145 NCNs of <10 mm were detected in 87 (19.4%) subjects. Mediastinal masses were detected in three subjects (0.7%)-one small cell lung cancer and two benign duplication cysts. Incidental pathology was noted in 276 patients (61.5%), most commonly emphysema and coronary artery calcification., CONCLUSION: The prevalence of resectable lung cancer detected by LDCCT at baseline screening was low at 0.23%, but there was a high rate of significant incidental pathology.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: Cone beam CT (CBCT) is a widely available technique with possible indications in carpal ligament injuries. The accuracy of CBCT arthrography in diagnosing traumatic tears of the scapholunate ligament has not been reported., QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) What is the diagnostic accuracy of CBCT and how does it relate to the accuracy of multislice CT arthrography and conventional arthrography in diagnosing scapholunate ligament tears? (2) What is the estimated magnitude of skin radiation doses of each method?, METHODS: This secondary analysis of a previous prospective study included 71 men and women with suspected scapholunate ligament tears and indications for arthroscopy. Preoperative imaging was conventional arthrography and either MSCT arthrography for the first half of patients to be included (n = 36) or flat-panel CBCT arthrography for the remaining patients (n = 35). Index tests identified therapy-relevant SLL tears with dorsal or complete SLL ruptures, and these tears were compared with relevant SLL tears which were determined through arthroscopy as Geissler Stadium III and IV by probing the instable SL joint with a microhook or arthroscope. These injuries were treated by open ligament repair and Kirschner wire fixation. Accuracy values and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Additional estimates of the radiation skin doses of each CBCT exam and two MSCT protocols were subsequently calculated using dose area products, dose length products, and CT dose indices., RESULTS: The diagnostic accuracy was high for all imaging methods. 95% CIs were broadly overlapping and therefore did not indicate differences between the diagnostic groups: Sensitivity of CBCT arthrography was 100% (95% CI 77 to 100), specificity was 95% (95% CI 76 to 99.9), positive predictive value was 93% (95% CI 68 to 99.8), and negative predictive value was 100% (95% CI 83 to 100). For MSCT arthrography, the sensitivity was 92% (95% CI 64 to 99.8), specificity was 96% (95% CI 78 to 99.9), positive predictive value was 92% (95% CI 64 to 99.8), and negative predictive value was 96% (95% CI 78 to 99.9). For conventional arthrography, the sensitivity was comparably high: 96% (95% CI 81 to 99.9). Specificity was (81% [95% CI 67 to 92]); the positive predictive value was 77% (95% CI 59 to 89) and negative predictive value was 97% (95% CI 86 to 99.9). Estimated mean (range) radiation skin doses were reported in a descriptive fashion and were 12.9 mSv (4.5 to 24.9) for conventional arthrography, and 3.2 mSv (2.0 to 4.8) for CBCT arthrography. Estimated radiation skin doses were 0.2 mSv and 12 mSv for MSCT arthrography, depending on the protocol., CONCLUSION: Flat-panel CBCT arthrography can be recommended as an accurate technique to diagnose scapholunate ligament injuries after wrist trauma. Estimated skin doses are low for CBCT arthrography and adapted MSCT arthrography protocols., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, diagnostic study.

Optimal treatment strategies for newly diagnosed localized ENKL have not been fully defined. Here we retrospectively analyzed 72 patients with newly diagnosed stage IE/IIE ENKL treated with gemcitabine, dexamethasone, and cisplatin (GDP) regimen chemotherapy with sandwiched radiotherapy in our department between May 2012 and September 2014. After 2 cycles of GDP induction chemotherapy, the complete response rate (CRR) and overall response rate (ORR) were 30.6% (22/72) and 91.7% (66/72). After whole treatment completion, the CRR and ORR were 81.9% (59/72) and 91.7% (66/72), respectively. With a median follow-up of 57.8 months (Interquartile Range 54.0-64.5 months), the 5-year progression-free survival rate was 70.9% (95% CI, 60.1% to 81.7%), and the 5-year overall survival rate was 72.0% (95% CI, 61.6% to 82.4%), respectively. Patients with CRR after treatment had better prognosis than their counterparts. The major adverse events were myelosuppression, liver dysfunction, gemcitabine-related skin rash, and digestive tract toxicities. Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were 18.0% (13/72) and 15.3% (11/72), respectively. No treatment related deaths were observed.

Aim To test the association of UV exposure with the rates and severity of IBD hospitalisation. Methods We conducted a retrospective nationwide analysis of 649 932 Crohn's disease (CD), 384 267 ulcerative colitis (UC), and 288 894 297 non-IBD hospitalisations in the US between 1998 and 2010. Mean UV exposure was assigned to each hospitalisation using surface measures from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Relative rates across UV exposures were estimated for IBD hospitalisations, prolonged hospitalisations, bowel surgeries and deaths. Results Among IBD patients, lower UV exposures had increased hospitalisation rates for CD (217.8 vs. 182.5 per 100 000 overall hospitalisations with low and very high UV, respectively; P trend <0.001) and UC (123.2 vs. 113.8 per 100 000; P trend = 0.033). Low UV groups had greater relative rates of prolonged hospitalisations [CD: 1.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-1.19; UC: 1.21, 95% CI 1.13-1.30], bowel surgeries (CD: 1.24, 95% CI 1.16-1.32; UC: 1.21, 95% CI 1.09-1.33), and CD deaths (CD: 1.76, 95% CI 1.14-2.71; UC: 1.24, 95% CI 0.92-1.67). Among non-IBD patients, low UV was associated with prolonged hospitalisations (1.09; 95% CI 1.07-1.11) and deaths (1.13; 95% CI 1.09-1.17), but not bowel surgeries (1.01; 95% CI 0.99-1.03). Conclusions Lower ultraviolet exposure is associated with greater rates of hospitalisation, prolonged hospitalisation and the need for bowel surgery in IBD. This trend for bowel surgery was not seen with non-IBD encounters. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Excluded
2078,"Clinical efficacy of cyberknife in patients with primary large hepatocellular carcinoma over 70 years old Objective: To analyze the clinical efficacy and safety of cyberknife in the treatment of patients with primary large hepatocellular carcinoma over 70 years old. Method(s): A total of 82 patients (58 males and 24 females) with large hepatocellular carcinoma aged over 70 years (70 to 85 years, (75+/-4) years) with a median tumor diameter of 6.7 cm (5.0~10.0 cm) were retrospectively collected. All patients were diagnosed by pathology or radiography in the Cancer Radiotherapy Center of the Fifth Medical Center of the PLA General Hospital from March 2014 to December 2018, and treated with cyberknife stereotactic radiotherapy. Progression free survival rate (PFS), local control rate (LC), overall survival rate (OS) and adverse reactions were observed at 1, 2 and 3 years. Kaplan-Meier was used for survival analysis, and Cox regression model was used to analyze survival-related factors. Result(s): All 82 patients successfully completed radiation therapy with a median survival time of 20 months, a median PFS of 10 months, an objective response rate of 64.63% (53/82), and a disease control rate of 85.37% (70/82). After treatment, the PFS at 1, 2, and 3 years were 39.0% (32/82), 22.1% (18/82), and 17.1% (14/82), respectively; the LC at 1, 2, and 3 years were 95.1% (78/82), 92.3% (76/82), and 92.3% (76/82), respectively; and the OS at 1, 2, and 3 years were 68.3% (56/82), 48.8% (40/82) and 31.7% (26/82), respectively. Nine patients suffered from radiation-induced liver disease (RILD), and there were no deaths due to RILD.

1431,"Sex, amyloid, and APOE epsilon4 and risk of cognitive decline in preclinical Alzheimer's disease: Findings from three well-characterized cohorts INTRODUCTION: Our objective was to investigate the effect of sex on cognitive decline within the context of amyloid beta (Abeta) burden and apolipoprotein E genotype., METHODS: We analyzed sex-specific effects on Abeta-positron emission tomography, apolipoprotein, and rates of change on the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite-5 across three cohorts, such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle, and Harvard Aging Brain Study (n = 755; clinical dementia rating = 0; age (standard deviation) = 73.6 (6.5); female = 55%). Mixed-effects models of cognitive change by sex, Abeta-positron emission tomography, and apolipoprotein epsilon4 were examined with quadratic time effects over a median of 4 years of follow-up., RESULTS: Apolipoprotein epsilon4 prevalence and Abeta burden did not differ by sex. Sex did not directly influence cognitive decline. Females with higher Abeta exhibited faster decline than males. Post hoc contrasts suggested that females who were Abeta and apolipoprotein epsilon4 positive declined faster than their male counterparts., DISCUSSION: Although Abeta did not differ by sex, cognitive decline was greater in females with higher Abeta. Our findings suggest that sex may play a modifying role on risk of Alzheimer's disease-related cognitive decline. Copyright © 2018 the Alzheimer's Association. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2263,"Multiple cervical lymph node involvement and extra-capsular extension predict for contralateral nodal recurrence after ipsilateral radiotherapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the tonsil Background: Ipsilateral radiotherapy is an established technique for treating well-lateralised tonsillar tumours. Concerns exist regarding the risk of contralateral nodal failure, particularly in patients with ipsilateral nodal involvement at presentation. In this study, we retrospectively reviewed the clinical outcomes of patients treated with ipsilateral radiotherapy aiming to identify factors that predispose to a higher risk of contralateral nodal recurrence. Method(s): Retrospective case note review of all patients with tonsillar cancer who were treated using ipsilateral radiotherapy between September 1995 and September 2011 was performed. Demographics, T and N stage, involvement of soft palate and/or tongue base, presence of extra-capsular spread (ECS) and treatment details were recorded. Kaplan-Meier curves for treatment outcomes were generated. Result(s): A total of 136 patients were identified. Median follow-up was 4.2 years. Twelve (9%) patients had loco-regional recurrence. Eight patients (6%) had contralateral recurrence. N2b disease, ECS and number of pack-years of smoking were associated with contralateral nodal recurrence. Five-year overall survival was 89%, loco-regional disease-free survival 90%, disease-free survival 86% and distal recurrence-free survival 96%. Conclusion(s): N2b disease, ECS and a greater than 10 pack-year smoking history are risk factors for contralateral nodal recurrence in well-lateralised tonsillar cancers. Prophylactic irradiation of the contralateral neck should be recommended in this group of patients.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1484,"Use of preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and intraoperative gamma-probe detection for identification of the sentinel lymph node in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma AIMS: Lymph node metastases for papillary thyroid carcinoma are associated with an increased incidence of locoregional recurrence. The use of preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and intraoperative gamma probe detection to localize the sentinel lymph node in papillary thyroid carcinoma was investigated., METHODS: From February 2004 to December 2005 the sentinel lymph node technique was studied in 64 consecutive patients with cytological evidence of papillary thyroid carcinoma. The day before surgery, patients were submitted to US-guided peri-tumoural injection of the radiotracer and a lymphoscintigraphy was performed. In the operating room a total thyroidectomy was done, and thanks to a hand-held gamma probe the sentinel lymph node and all lymph nodes, belonging to the sentinel node compartment, were removed., RESULTS: The gamma probe identified the sentinel lymph node in 62 patients (96.8%). We found 48 (77.5%) sentinel lymph node without metastases; 12 (19.3%) with metastases and 2 (3.2%) with micrometastases. In 7 cases (11.3%), with a negative sentinel lymph node, metastases in other nodes of the same region were recorded. In 22 cases (34.3%) the ultrasound give an erroneous indication (P=0.004). Five patients (8.0%), 4 with multifocal cancer, had a positive postoperative lymphoscintigraphy., CONCLUSION: This study shows that the sentinel lymph node technique for papillary thyroid carcinoma is feasible, repeatable, and more accurate than preoperative ultrasound. In cases of multifocal thyroid lesions more patients should be enrolled to establish the utility of the radio-guided technique.",Excluded
1348,"In balloon kyphoplasty for osteoporotic vertebral body fractures, the potential of reduction is depending on the time to surgery PURPOSE: For the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral body fractures, balloon kyphoplasty has been shown to be highly efficient in pain reduction. This technique can restore patient mobility and enhance quality of life. Fracture reduction is resulting in part from positioning of the patient and from balloon expansion. This prospective study tries to investigate whether the potential of reduction is depending on the time to surgery in these patients. METHOD(S): Inclusion criteria: t-score < 1.0, thoracolumbar fractures types. Exclusion criteria: more than two fractures, previous fractures, additional posterior instrumentation, age > 90 years, cardiac arrhythmia. 71 patients (47 female, 24 male; average age 74 years) with 101 fractures were included. 62 patients concluded followup (FU) at 2 years post op. The following clinical and radiological data were collected pre and post op, after 6 weeks, and after 3, 6, 12 and 24 months: Bisegmental endplate angle, anterior vertebral body height, Visual-Analog-Score (VAS; 0 no pain; 100 worst possible pain), Oswestry-Disability-Questionnaire (ODQ). Surgical technique follows the standard protocol for balloon-kyphoplasty (Medtronic). Fractures were defined acute, if fracture age was less than two weeks. Fractures were defined chronic, if fracture age was two weeks or more. Conventional X-rays were provided in an upright position during all post op FU visits. RESULT(S): 61 patients suffered from osteoporosis, 10 from osteopenia. For the acute fracture group (n=54), bisegmental endplate angle was improved by 8,6degree on average. For the chronic fracture group (n=47), however, bisegmental endplate angle was improved by 3,7degree only. This difference between groups is statistically significant (p<0.05). For the acute fracture group, anterior vertebral body height was restored from 48% to 81% (p<0.05). For the chronic fracture group, anterior vertebral body height was restored from 41% to 60% (not significant). CONCLUSION(S): If osteoporotic vertebral body fractures are being surgically treated within the first two weeks of injury, restoration of the sagittal spinal profile is significantly improved as compared to older fracture age. The pain reducing effect of the procedure, however, occurs independent of fracture age. As the leading clinical sign for osteoporotic fracture augmentation is persistent pain, cement injection remains an option even in older fractures with reduced potential for sagittal correction.",Excluded
1794,"Anatomy versus physiology-guided ablation for persistent atrial fibrillation Background: Pulmonary vein isolation remains the cornerstone of atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation. However, due to high recurrence rates, especially in patients with persistent AF, PV antral isolation, complemented by linear ablation, autonomic modulation, and ablation of complex fractionated electrograms, have been attempted to increase the odds of success. However, the optimum approach for a complementary strategy in addition to PVI for persistent AF is unknown. Method(s): We performed a prospective randomized trial by assigning 92 patients with persistent AF in 1:1 ratio to pulmonary-vein isolation plus ablation of electrograms showing complex fractionated activity (45 patients), or pulmonary-vein isolation plus additional linear ablation across the left atrial roof and mitral valve isthmus (47 patients). The duration of follow-up was five years. The primary endpoint was freedom from any documented recurrence of atrial fibrillation after a single ablation procedure. Result(s): At a 12-month follow-up, 9 (23%) patients had AF recurrence in the linear ablation and 8 (21%) patients in the CFAE groups. At a mean follow-up duration of 59+/-36 months, 48.3% of patients in the linear ablation group and 44.6% of patients in the CFAE group were free from AF (p=0.403). There were no significant differences between the two groups for independent predictors of freedom from AF. The overall procedure time and radiation exposure were higher in the PVI+linear ablation group. There were five adverse events noted, two in the linear group (pericardial effusion not requiring drain) and 3 in the CFAE group (1 pseudoaneurysm, one effusion requiring pericardiocentesis and one effusion nor requiring drain). Conclusion(s): Among patients with persistent atrial fibrillation, we found no difference in maintenance of sinus rhythm in either linear ablation or ablation of complex fractionated electrograms was performed in addition to pulmonary vein isolation in short- and long-term follow-up.Copyright © 2020 CardioFront LLC.

2217,"Nucleoid sedimentation analysis of DNA superstructure, gamma-radiation-induced damage and repair in human and chacma baboon (Papia ursinus) peripheral lymphocytes The use of the chacma baboon (Papio ursinus) in radiobiological investigations justifies special attention because it answers many of the criteria of parallelism to the human. The present study was undertaken to establish whether in vitro gamma-radiation effects in chacma baboon and human lymphocytes are comparable. The sensitive and rapid nucleoid sedimentation technique was employed to evaluate in vitro DNA superstructure, damage and repair in readily obtainable radiosensitive peripheral lymphocytes. Dose-response curves after 60Co gamma-irradiation were obtained, and by applying single-hit kinetics of the target theory, an estimation of molecular masses of the supercoiled domains was made. The baboon and human lymphocytes produced analogous results, while an ethidium bromide intercalation study also revealed a similarity in average DNA superhelical density. Lymphocyte DNA repair after 0.5-4.0 Gy gamma-irradiation and repair times from 0.5 to 5.0 h were evaluated. The repair data obtained from baboon and human cells after 2.0 Gy irradiation compared favourably in extent of DNA repair as well as the profiles of the kinetic curves. These findings indicate that the chacma baboon would be a useful and relevant model for further in vivo radiobiological studies on lymphocytes. The effects of sedimentation conditions and advantages of using vertical-tube rotors in the nucleoid sedimentation technique are also discussed.",Included
2316,"Hybrid resistance to parental bone marrow grafts in nonlethally irradiated mice Resistance to parental bone marrow (BM) grafts in F1 hybrid recipients is due to natural killer (NK) cell-mediated rejection triggered through ""missing self"" recognition. ""Hybrid resistance"" has usually been investigated in lethally irradiated F1 recipients in conjunction with pharmacological activation of NK cells. Here, we investigated BM-directed NK-cell alloreactivity in settings of reduced conditioning. Nonlethally irradiated (1-3 Gy) or nonirradiated F1 (C57BL6 x BALB/c) recipient mice received titrated doses (5-20 x 106) of unseparated parental BALB/c BM without pharmacological NK cell activation. BM successfully engrafted in all mice and multilineage donor chimerism persisted long-term (24 weeks), even in the absence of irradiation. Chimerism was associated with the rearrangement of the NK-cell receptor repertoire suggestive of reduced reactivity to BALB/c. Chimerism levels were lower after transplantation with parental BALB/c than with syngeneic F1 BM, indicating partial NK-mediated rejection of parental BM. Activation of NK cells with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid sodium salt poly(I:C), reduced parental chimerism in nonirradiated BM recipients but did not prevent hematopoietic stem cell engraftment. In contrast, equal numbers of parental lymph node cells were completely rejected. Hence, hybrid resistance leads to incomplete rejection of parental BM under reduced conditioning settings.Copyright © 2018 The Authors American Journal of Transplantation published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons",Excluded
1620,"Patterns of long-term swallowing dysfunction after definitive radiotherapy or chemoradiation Objectives To identify patterns of long-term, radiation-induced swallowing dysfunction after definitive radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy (RT or CHRT) and to determine which factors may explain these patterns over time. Material and methods The study population consisted of 238 consecutive head and neck cancer patients treated with RT or CHRT. The primary endpoint was >=grade 2 swallowing dysfunction at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after treatment. Cluster analysis was used to identify different patterns over time. The differences between the mean dose to the swallowing organs at risk for each pattern were determined by using dose maps. Results The cluster analysis revealed five patterns of swallowing dysfunction: low persistent, intermediate persistent, severe persistent, transient and progressive. Patients with high dose to the upper pharyngeal, laryngeal and lower pharyngeal region had the highest risk of severe persistent swallowing dysfunction. Transient problems mainly occurred after high dose to the laryngeal and lower pharyngeal regions, combined with moderate dose to the upper pharyngeal region. The progressive pattern was mainly seen after moderate dose to the upper pharyngeal region. Conclusions Various patterns of swallowing dysfunction after definitive RT or CHRT can be identified over time. This could reflect different underlying biological processes.Copyright © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

1248,"Mechanisms for discomfort glare in central vision PURPOSE: The presence of a bright light source in the visual field can generate visual discomfort. Based on empirical observations we can predict to a reasonable degree of accuracy how uncomfortable a given lighting installation is likely to be; yet very little is known about the mechanism or physiological underpinnings that lead to visual discomfort. This study attempts to elucidate some of the underlying mechanisms by controlling the amount of light reaching the retina and by varying photometric properties of the glare source., METHODS: The participants were required to view a source of light presented against a simulated residential street background in the form of uniform flashes of light of varying intensity. Discomfort-glare thresholds were estimated using a staircase procedure; the dependent variable was retinal illuminance. The size of the glare source and the luminance of the surrounding background were varied systematically., RESULTS: Across glare-source sizes or background luminances the discomfort-glare threshold varied less in terms of retinal illuminance than it did in terms of pupil-plane illuminance or light flux. A two-stage model based on saturation of photoreceptors followed by summation of an edge response signal that defines the edges of the glare-source accurately predicted the data., CONCLUSIONS: Discomfort glare in central vision is more closely associated with the spatial properties of the glare source, such as contrast-defined edges, than the overall amount of light entering the eye. The results suggest that discomfort glare in lighting installations could be reduced while maintaining adequate illuminance levels by an appropriate choice of illuminant source size.

2146,"The age-dependent effect of high-dose X-ray radiation on NFkappaB signaling, structure, and mechanical behavior of the intervertebral disc Purpose: Ionizing radiation damages tissue and provokes inflammatory responses in multiple organ systems. We investigated the effects of high-dose X-ray radiation on the molecular inflammation and mechanical function of the intervertebral disc (IVD). Methods: Functional spine units (FSUs) containing the vertebrae-IVDs-vertebrae structure extracted from 1-month, 6-month, and 16-month-old NFkappaB-luciferase reporter mice and from 6-month-old myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-null mice. After a preconditioning period in culture, the FSUs were subjected a single dose of ionizing X-ray radiation at 20 Gys, and then NFkappaB expression was monitored. The IVDs were then subjected to mechanical testing using dynamic compression, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) quantification, and histological analyses. Results: In the 1-month-old FSUs, the NFkappaB-driven luciferase activity was significantly elevated for 1 day following the exposure to radiation. The 6-month-old FSUs showed increased NFkappaB activity for 3 days, while the 16-month-old FSUs sustained elevated levels of NFkappaB activity throughout the 10-day culture period. All irradiated groups showed significant loss of disc height, GAG content, mechanical function and changes in structure. Ablation of MyD88 blunted the radiation-mediated NFkappaB signaling, and preserved GAG content, and the IVDs' structure and mechanical performance. Conclusions: These results suggest that high-dose radiation affects the IVDs' NFkappaB-dependent inflammatory processes that subsequently lead to functional deterioration. Blocking the transactivation potential of NFkappaB via MyD88 ablation preserved the structure and mechanical function of the FSUs. The long-term effects of radiation on IVD homeostasis should be considered in individuals susceptible to occupational and medical exposure.",Included
2467,"Low-dose MDCT for surveillance of patients with severe homogeneous emphysema after bronchoscopic airway bypass OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of low-dose MDCT for radiologic monitoring of patients who have undergone placement of bronchial stents for airway bypass., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In a prospective study, seven patients underwent MDCT according to a low-dose protocol (40 mAs, 120 kVp) before and after stent placement. The positions of the stents in the segmental bronchi were analyzed and compared with the bronchoscopic findings, which were reference standard. Patency versus lack of patency of stents was classified with five levels of confidence, and a definitive diagnosis was assigned to each stent. Prediction of stent dislodgment, follow-up findings, and complications occurring during the observation period were recorded. Consensus reading was performed by two radiologists. Statistical analysis was conducted by receiver operating characteristic analysis or four-field table., RESULTS: Seven patients underwent implantation of 37 stents (mean, 5 +/- 2 [SD] stents per patient; range, 2-8 stents). The area under the curve for differentiating patent from occluded stents was 0.995 with resulting sensitivity and specificity of 86.5% and 98.1%. The correct diagnosis of patency was established with MDCT for all but one stent (sensitivity, 94.7%; specificity, 100%). Sensitivity and specificity for prediction of dislodgment were 80% and 91%. Five stents were not identified during inspection bronchoscopy but were found in a regular position at MDCT. Three instances of minor bleeding and one of pneumothorax resolved spontaneously. The mean effective dose of the scan was 1.3 +/- 0.6 mSv., CONCLUSION: Low-dose MDCT is feasible for radiologic monitoring after airway bypass procedure.",Excluded

1719,"[Possibilities of prognostication of individual radiation sensitivity] Proceeding from the concept of individual radiosensitivity as a sign of total reactivity 3 directions in a study of its possible prediction were considered: establishing correlation between separate indices characterizing the initial state and total radiosensitivity; correlation between body reactions to non-radiation exposures and subsequent irradiation; comparison of total radiosensitivity to irradiation at a small dose and subsequent irradiation at LD50. The following indices were used for the evaluation of the basal status of the body: oxygen consumption level, body mass increase rate, the level of water and basal metabolism, peripheral blood indices, body temperature, basal indices of the functional adrenocortical activity, the state of the cardiovascular system. The following non-radiation stress-exposures were used: physical exercise, constant magnetic field, starvation, hypoxia, and adrenaline administration. A V-type dependency was established for most investigated indices of the basal status and reaction of the body to non-radiation exposures. The utmost radioresistance was shown by animals in whom the basal indices or their reaction to non-radiation exposure approximated the average group level. The third direction: comparison of radiosensitivity and radiation damage--was analyzed by comparing the reaction of cerebral biocurrents to radiation exposure at a small dose with subsequent damage of the body following irradiation at a lethal dose. The accuracy of predicting the outcome of radiation injury by some of the indices varied from 65 to 80%. In some indices of the basal status and reactivity evaluation it reached 85-90%.",Excluded

1435,"Use of handheld X-ray fluorescence as a non-invasive method to distinguish between Asian and African elephant tusks We describe the use of handheld X-ray fluorescence, for elephant tusk species identification. Asian (n = 72) and African (n = 85) elephant tusks were scanned and we utilized the species differences in elemental composition to develop a functional model differentiating between species with high precision. Spatially, the majority of measured elements (n = 26) exhibited a homogeneous distribution in cross-section, but a more heterologous pattern in the longitudinal direction. Twenty-one of twenty four elements differed between Asian and African samples. Data were subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis followed by a stepwise discriminant analysis, which identified elements for the functional equation. The best equation consisted of ratios of Si, S, Cl, Ti, Mn, Ag, Sb and W, with Zr as the denominator. Next, Bayesian binary regression model analysis was conducted to predict the probability that a tusk would be of African origin. A cut-off value was established to improve discrimination. This Bayesian hybrid classification model was then validated by scanning an additional 30 Asian and 41 African tusks, which showed high accuracy (94%) and precision (95%) rates. We conclude that handheld XRF is an accurate, non-invasive method to discriminate origin of elephant tusks provides rapid results applicable to use in the field.",Excluded

The analysis of cosmonauts' response times showed that the mental rotation task is not greatly impaired in weightlessness. On the contrary, there are indications of a facilitation as: (1) the average rotation time per degree was shorter inflight than on the ground; (2) this difference seemed to be particularly marked for stimuli calling for roll axis rotations. However several factors may be responsible for this difference which was not obvious in one subject.

2382,"Incidence of pain flare following palliative radiation therapy for symptomatic bone metastases: Multicenter prospective observational study Purpose/Objective(s): Palliative radiation therapy (RT) is a wellestablished treatment option for symptomatic bone metastases, with few treatment-related side effects. However, pain flare, a temporary worsening of bone pain in the irradiated metastatic site, has been recognized following RT. The aim of this study is to determine the incidence of pain flare following RT for painful bone metastases. Materials/Methods: Patients with bone metastases treated with RT were eligible. Worst pain scores and analgesic consumption were collected before, daily during, and for 10 days after treatment. Pain flare was defined as a 2-point increase in the worst pain score (0-10) compared to baseline with no decrease in analgesic intake, or a 25% increase in analgesic intake with no decrease in worst pain score. The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) was administered to measure the ""sensory"" dimension of pain (intensity, or severity) and its ""reactive"" dimension (interference with daily function) before the RT treatment and at the 4-weeks follow-up evaluation. Descriptive statistics were reported. Response rate and 95% confidence intervals were calculated at 4 weeks after RT. A comparison of patients with pain flare vs those without was performed. The relationships between the occurrence of pain flare and collected demographic variables were investigated. Result(s): From June 2010 to December 2013, 160 patients were enrolled in this study. From this cohort, 94 patients with complete data were evaluable for pain flare. There were 61 (65%) men and 33 (35%) women. Median age was 66 years. The majority of patients had primary breast (12%), lung (31%), or prostate (22%) carcinoma and were treated with 8 Gy in a single fraction (28%) or 20 Gy in five fractions (65%). The overall pain flare incidence across all centers was 42/94 (44.7%). The majority of pain flares occurred on Days 1-5 (88%) as opposed to Days 6-10 (12%). The median duration of the pain flare was 2 days. There was no significant difference between patients who experienced a pain flare vs those who did not in terms of sex, age, primary cancer site, radiation dose, previous systemic therapy, location or area of RT, or on any of the BPI items (p > 0.05). BPI scores showed a significant improvement at 4 weeks on all functional interference items (p < 0.05). The main differences were seen in the ""worst pain"" and ""sleep"" domains, both decreased from 7/10 at baseline to 4/10 at the 4-week follow-up. Conclusion(s): Pain flare is a common event, occurring in nearly half of the patients that receive palliative RT for symptomatic bone metastases. Furthermore, RT for symptomatic bone metastases is a very effective palliative treatment, in terms of both pain control and functional interference.",Excluded
1572,"Treatment of posterolateral tibial plateau fractures with a rotational support plate and special pressurizer: technical note and retrospective case series BACKGROUND: In tibial plateau fractures, the posterolateral segment of the tibia plateau is frequently affected and challenging to treat. Although there are many surgical approaches and fixation methods for the treatment of these fractures, all of these methods have limitations. We designed a new rotational support plate (RSP) and a special pressurizer that can fix the fracture directly via the anterolateral approach. This method is advantageous because it leads to little trauma, involves a simple operation, and has a reliable fixation effect. This study details the technique of treating these fractures with the RSP and special pressurizer and provides the outcomes. METHOD(S): From May 2016 to January 2019, the data of 12 patients with posterolateral tibial plateau fractures treated with the RSP and special pressurizer in our hospital were retrospectively analyzed. Postoperative rehabilitation was advised, knee X-rays were taken at follow-ups, and fracture healing, complications, and knee range of motion were assessed. The Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) knee score and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) were used to evaluate knee function at the last follow-up. RESULT(S): The average follow-up time of all patients was 16.5 months (range, 12-25 months). The average bony union time was 3.2 months (range, 3-4.5 months). At the last follow-up, the average knee range of motion was 138degree (range, 107-145degree). The average HSS score was 91 (range, 64-98). The average KOOS Symptoms score was 90 (range, 75-96). The average KOOS Pain score was 91 (range, 72-97). The average KOOS ADL score was 91 (range, 74-97). The average KOOS sport/recreation score was 83 (range, 70-90). The average KOOS QOL score was 88 (range, 69-93). Skin necrosis, incision infections, and fixation failure did not occur during the follow-up period.

Radiation plan was 2 dimensional using telecobalt in 2 patients & 3 dimensional using megavoltage X-rays in 16 patients. Treatment volume encompassed the gross tumour with a safety margin of 1-2 cm. Neck was addressed in patients with involved nodes. Common field arrangement included 2 anterior oblique or anterolateral or superior & inferior vetex beams. Chemotherapy was used in the following setting: neoadjuvant in 10 patients (common regimens CAPcyclophosphamide, adriamycin & cisplatin; EP-etoposide & cisplatin; VACvincristine, actinomycinD, cyclophosphamide), concurrent in 3 patients with weekly cisplatin & adjuvant in 5 patients with EP regimen. 7 patients had died at last follow-up with causes being local recurrence in 2, nodal recurrence in 2, distant dissemination in 3 (metastases in bone, brain & chest wall respectively), disease persistence in1 & unknown in 1. After a median follow-up of 14.43 months, 2 year overall survival & progressionfree survival were respectively 62%+/-13% & 49.7+/-14%. Conclusion(s): Management of esthesioneuroblastoma poses clinical challenge due to rarity, complex topography of disease, morbidity of extensive surgery and absence of well defined treatment protocols. Our institutional results are modest and clinical management has been quite heterogenous. In future treatment guidelines need to be framed - surgery alone for Kadish A tumour, surgery with post-operative radiation in Kadish B tumour & multimodality management- surgery (craniofacial resection) followed by chemoradiation in Kadish C tumour. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy merits trial in Kadish C tumours which are upfront unresectable.",Excluded
1839,"Use of unstable chromosome aberrations for biological dosimetry after the first postirradiation mitosis The loss of unstable chromosome aberrations after the first postirradiation mitosis makes their use difficult in radiation dosimetry. We describe here a method which, in a cell population observed at this stage, allows retrospective estimation of the frequencies of the unstable aberrations induced at the time of irradiation, and their use as a dosimeter. The laws controlling the behavior of unstable aberrations during mitosis were defined from a large-scale experiment on irradiated human lymphocytes. For cells undergoing the first, second, or third mitosis after irradiation, relationships were determined between the frequency, at irradiation time, of acentric fragments not arising from formation of dicentrics or rings, and the ratio of dicentrics and centric rings appearing without acentric fragments to the total number of dicentrics plus rings. On the basis of this ratio, the method described here provides an assessment of the postirradiation mitotic activity in a cell population. This assessment permitted estimation of the cell distribution and frequency of dicentrics plus centric rings, and of the frequency of acentric fragments at the time of irradiation. The use of this method for retrospective dosimetry after whole-body irradiation under various conditions of exposure is illustrated.",Excluded
2101,"Assessment of inflammatory back pain and axial spondyloarthritis in Brazil Background/Purpose: The concept of inflammatory back pain (IBP) was proposed in association with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), one prototype of Spondyloarthritis (SpA), more than 60 years ago. Spondyloarthritis (SpA) comprises several rheumatic diseases. Although several criteria sets have been developed, the diagnosis of SpA remains challenging. This study aims to evaluate the frequency of inflammatory back pain (IBP) among Brazilian subjects with chronic back pain (CBP), and to describe the results of rheumatologic evaluation based on the axial SpA classification criteria from the Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society (ASAS). Method(s): This was an observational study with retrospective (phase 1) and one-month prospective (phase 2) data collection. Medical records of subjects 18-60 years old, with onset of back pain at age <40 years, and with CBP (pain almost daily >=3 months), were included in phase 1. Subjects with at least one ASAS screening parameter for IBP were contacted by phone, and confirmed IBP cases were invited to phase 2. At phase 2 visit 1, HLA-B27 and C-reactive protein (CRP) were requested. At phase 2 visit 2, the fulfilment of the ASAS classification criteria for axial SpA was verified. Frequency of IBP among subjects with CBP starting before the age of 40 years was estimated. For subjects included in phase 2, the proportions of positive HLA-B27, AS and non-radiographic axial SpA (nrAxSpA) were calculated. Result(s): A total of 363 records of subjects with CBP were reviewed from five sites. Based on medical records and phone contact, 130 subjects had IBP confirmed (35.8%, 95%CI: 30.9-40.7%). From IBP population, only 52 subjects accepted to participate in phase 2. Mean age was 38.8+/-11.43 years, 64% were female, 85% professionally active, and 14% had family history of IBP related conditions. Time since CBP onset was 12.3+/-10.09 years and no subject had a prior diagnosis of SpA. Among the 50 patients that completed visit 2, 14% had positive HLA-B27, 82% had lesions of the sacroiliac joint assessed by MRI, 16% had abnormal clinically significant CRP results, and 10% had grade 3-4 lesions assessed by X-ray. The proportions of AS and nrAxSpA cases were 46% and 26%, respectively by ASAS classification criteria. Conclusion(s): More than one third of the CBP subjects with onset <40 years had IBP by ASAS criteria. Of notice, subjects with a positive HLA-B27 test did not have prior diagnosis of axial SpA. The results in this Brazilian population suggest that patients with IBP may be under diagnosed, delaying their treatment, and that women may seek more for medical care than men. An eventual selection bias cannot be excluded.",Excluded
1844,"Rate of Progression of Aortic Stenosis and its Impact on Outcomes in Patients With Radiation-Associated Cardiac Disease: A Matched Cohort Study Objectives: The aim of this study was to study differences in progression of aortic stenosis (AS) in patients with mediastinal radiotherapy (XRT)-associated moderate AS versus a matched cohort during the same time frame, and to ascertain need for aortic valve replacement (AVR) and longer-term survival. Background(s): Rate of progression of XRT-associated moderate AS and its impact on outcomes is not well-described. Method(s): We included 81 patients (age 61 +/- 13 years; 57% female) with at least XRT-associated moderate AS (aortic valve area [AVA] 1.05 +/- 0.3 cm2; mean gradient 24 +/- 10 mm Hg) who had >=2 transthoracic echocardiograms (TTEs) 1 year apart and matched them in a 1:2 fashion on the basis of age, sex, and AVA with those without prior XRT. Serial aortic valve gradients and AVA were recorded. AVR and longer-term all-cause mortality during follow-up were recorded. Result(s): A total of 100% of patients had 1, a total of 71% had 2, and 39% had 3 follow-up TTEs. Before AVR, mean AVG and AVA were not significantly different between XRT and comparison groups. At 3.6 +/- 2.0 years from baseline TTE, 146 (60%) underwent AVR (16% transcatheter), with significantly more patients in the XRT group undergoing AVR (80% vs. 50%; p < 0.01), at a much shorter time (2.9 +/- 1.6 years vs. 4.1 +/- 2.4 years; p < 0.01). At 6.6 +/- 4.0 years from the initial TTE, 49 (20%) patients died, with a significantly higher mortality in the XRT group (40% vs. 11%; p < 0.01), with prior XRT associated with increased longer-term mortality, whereas AVR was associated with improved longer-term survival. Conclusion(s): In patients with moderate AS, those with prior XRT have a similar rate of progression of AS versus a comparison group. A higher proportion of patients in the XRT group were referred for AVR at a shorter time from baseline TTE. Despite that, the XRT patients had significantly higher longer-term mortality, and prior exposure to XRT was associated with significantly increased longer-term mortality.Copyright © 2018 American College of Cardiology Foundation",Excluded
1962,"Comparison of phototherapy two times and four times a week with low doses of narrow-band ultraviolet B in Asian patients with psoriasis Background/Aims: The optimum narrow-band (TL-01) ultraviolet (UV) B weekly treatment frequency for psoriasis has yet to be defined, especially in Asian patients with TL-01. Our purpose was to compare 2x weekly and 4x weekly therapy with narrow-band UVB at low doses for psoriasis vulgaris. Method(s): Sixty-nine patients with moderately severe psoriasis were recruited and allocated to the 2x weekly or 4x weekly treatment group. The patients were treated with a new protocol using low doses of narrow-band UVB with varied exposure increments. Outcomes were evaluated by means of Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) scores, time (weeks), cumulative UVB dose and number of treatments to clearance. Result(s): No significant difference was found between the two regimens in the PASI score at the end of treatment, in the proportion of patients whose skin cleared during treatment and in the time to clearance (8 weeks). Those who completed treatment achieved clearance after a median of 16 exposures with 2x weekly treatment compared with 32 exposures with 4x weekly treatment (P=0.0304), and 12.5 minimal erythema dose multiples (MEDs) compared with 39.7 MEDs (P=0.0470). Acute side effects of the treatment were similar for the two groups (P=0.8462). Conclusion(s): For skin phototype III-V populations, a greater long-term risk is expected, connected with the higher cumulative UVB dose and number of exposures required in the 4x weekly group. Therefore, 4x weekly phototherapy will no longer be used for psoriasis.",Excluded
2380,"Prolonged Steroid Dependence in Adult Patients With Glioma BACKGROUND/AIM: Prolonged use of glucocorticoids (GC) in glioma treatment can lead to adrenal insufficiency (AI) and subsequent steroid dependence due to suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. This is challenging to diagnose due to its nonspecific clinical symptoms erroneously ascribed to treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the risk factors predisposing patients with gliomas to develop AI., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Charts in the neuro-oncology clinic from July 2018 to March 2019 were reviewed. Inclusion criteria included >18 y/o with WHO Grade II-IV gliomas, and secondary AI. Demographic profile, tumor characteristics, and treatment profile were compared., RESULTS: The majority of patients were started on high dose dexamethasone at >8 mg daily, and were on dexamethasone for 4-8 months. The minimum dose needed to prevent symptoms was 0.5 mg to 2 mg daily. The majority received standard radiation doses ranging from 54-60 Gy. Most patients had radiation exposure to the HPA axis within the prescription isodose levels., CONCLUSION: Prolonged steroid dependency can result from chronic GC use in patients with glioma. Dose and duration of GC are risk factors for its development. Radiation exposure to the HPA axis may also be a contributing factor.

2132,"[Digital chest x-rays with a selenium detector: a prospective comparison with a conventional film-screen combination] PURPOSE: To compare a new digital chest radiography system that uses amorphous selenium as the x-ray detector, with conventional radiography for the detection of pathological alterations of the chest., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two observers analysed pairs of posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs of 95 patients. One pair of radiographs was obtained with the digital selenium chest radiography system, and the other with conventional film-screen technique. 9 criteria were rated using a 4 point scale. Technical parameters were standardised. Radiation dose was measured in both techniques and compared., RESULTS: A total of 855 criteria were rated. 740 findings were diagnosed in accordance on both techniques (740/855 = 87%). 115 criteria (115/855 = 13%) showed deviations. The mean radiation dose for the selenium detector was 0.02 cGy and for the conventional system 0.11 cGy., CONCLUSION: The exposure of radiation is lower using a selenium x-ray detector compared to conventional film-screen technique in chest radiography. The digital selenium system performs well in a clinical setting, providing visualisation of pathological findings as good as a standard screen-film system.",Excluded
1800,"Diagnosing Fish Bone and Chicken Bone Impactions in the Emergency Department Setting: Measuring the System Utility of the Plain Film Screen OBJECTIVES: In the emergency department, fish and chicken bone impactions are typically evaluated with screening x-rays. We sought to determine whether this modality ultimately improves system outcomes, including length of stay (LOS), cost, and radiation dosage., METHODS: We reviewed patients >= 18 years old presenting to an urban academic emergency department over a 4-year period who received a screening soft-tissue x-ray to determine the presence of a retained fish or chicken bone. We calculated the diagnostic accuracy of x-ray and computed tomography (CT) evaluations, respectively, in addition to system outcomes., RESULTS: Twenty-seven of the 78 patients included for analysis were ultimately positive for bone impaction. Initial x-ray interpretations demonstrated a sensitivity of 24.0% (95% CI, 9.4%-45.1%) and a specificity of 90.0% (95% CI, 78.2%-96.7%). However, initial CT interpretation (ie, a preliminary read from on-call residents) demonstrated a sensitivity of 75% (95% CI, 19.4%-99.4%) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI, 59.0%-100%). LOS, cost, and radiation dosage were not significantly different between patients who ultimately had true bone impactions and those who did not (P > .05)., CONCLUSIONS: X-rays are poor screening tools in determining fish or chicken bone impactions with poor diagnostic and system utility. Further studies should be performed to evaluate the role of a low-radiation CT screen. Copyright © The Author(s) 2015.",Excluded
1754,"MRI of small hepatocellular carcinoma: comparison with US, CT, DSA, and Lipiodol-CT Thirteen cirrhotic patients with 27 nodules of hepatocellular carcinoma less than 3 cm (small HCC) were examined with ultrasonography (US), MR, pre- and postcontrast CT, digital subtraction angiography (DSA), and CT after injection of Lipiodol (Lipiodol-CT). The accuracy of MR was compared with other diagnostic modalities and MR morphologic and the signal intensity features of HCC were investigated. The detection rate by MR was 63%, by US 67%, by CT 50%, by DSA 74%, and by Lipiodol-CT 93%. The Mc Nemar test showed no difference between the detection rates of MR and CT, MR and DSA, MR and US, and Lipiodol-CT and DSA; however, the differences between the detection rates of MR and Lipiodol-CT and CT and Lipiodol-CT were statistically significant (p less than or equal to 0.05). The difference in sensitivity between the detection rates of Lipiodol-CT and US was just above the level considered significant (P less than or equal to 0.065). On T1- and T2-weighted spin echo images 83% of small HCC were hyperintense relative to the surrounding liver parenchyma. Pseudocapsule was observed in 58% of lesions on T1-weighted images in particular. We believe that US is still the best diagnostic technique for the screening of HCC. We prefer MR to CT as a second level examination to support US in noninvasive diagnosis of small HCC, since MR gives the same or slightly better results than CT without the need of ionizing radiation and large amounts of iodized contrast medium. In our opinion, more invasive examinations, such as DSA and Lipiodol-CT, cannot be avoided in cases where an exact knowledge of the number of lesions is essential for the choice of therapy.",Excluded
1735,"Perioperative Comparison of Robotic-Assisted Versus Fluoroscopically Guided Minimally Invasive Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion Objective: Robotic surgical systems have been developed to improve spine surgery accuracy. Studies have found significant reductions in screw revision rates and radiation exposure with robotic assistance compared with open surgery. The aim of the present study was to compare the perioperative outcomes between robot-assisted (RA) and fluoroscopically guided (FG) minimally invasive (MI) transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) performed by a single surgeon. Method(s): The present retrospective cohort study analyzed all patients with lumbar degenerative disease who had undergone MI-TLIF by a single surgeon from July 2017 to March 2020. One group had undergone FG MI-TLIF and one group had undergone RA MI-TLIF. Result(s): Of the 101 patients included in the present study, 52 had undergone RA MI-TLIF and 49, FG MI-TLIF. We found no statistically significant differences in the operative time (RA, 241 +/- 69.3 minutes; FG, 246.2 +/- 56.3 minutes; P = 0.681). The mean radiation time for the RA group was 32.8 +/- 28.8 seconds, and the mean fluoroscopy dose was 31.5 +/- 30 mGy. The RA radiation exposure data were compared with similar data for the FG MI-TLIF group in a previous study (59.5 +/- 60.4 mGy), with our patients' radiation exposure significantly lower (P = 0.035). The postoperative complications and rates of surgical revision were comparable. Conclusion(s): Our results have demonstrated that RA MI-TLIF provides perioperative outcomes comparable to those with FG MI-TLIF. A reduced radiation dose to the patient was observed with RA compared with FG MI-TLIF. No differences were noted between the RA and FG cohorts in operative times, complication rates, revision rates, or length of stay.Copyright © 2021",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the amount of tagged stool and fluid significantly affects the radiation exposure in low-dose screening CT colonography performed with an automatic tube-current modulation technique., METHODS: The study included 311 patients. The tagging agent was barium (n = 271) or iodine (n = 40). Correlation was measured between mean volume CT dose index (CTDI (vol)) and the estimated x-ray attenuation of the tagged stool and fluid (ATT). Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to determine the effect of ATT on CTDI (vol ) and the effect of ATT on image noise while adjusting for other variables including abdominal circumference., RESULTS: CTDI (vol) varied from 0.88 to 2.54 mGy. There was no significant correlation between CTDI (vol) and ATT (p = 0.61). ATT did not significantly affect CTDI (vol) (p = 0.93), while abdominal circumference was the only factor significantly affecting CTDI (vol) (p < 0.001). Image noise ranged from 59.5 to 64.1 HU. The p value for the regression model explaining the noise was 0.38., CONCLUSION: The amount of stool and fluid tagging does not significantly affect radiation exposure.",Excluded
2024,"New recommendation and coverage of low-dose computed tomography for lung cancer screening: uptake has increased but is still low BACKGROUND: In 2013, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) issued recommendations for low-dose computed tomography for lung cancer screening (LDCT-LCS), but there continues to be a dearth of information on the adoption of LDCT-LCS in healthcare systems. Using a multilevel perspective, our study aims to assess referrals for LDCT-LCS and identify facilitators and barriers to adoption following recent policy changes. METHOD(S): A retrospective analysis of electronic medical record data from patients aged 55-80 years with no history of lung cancer who visited a primary care provider in a large healthcare system in California during 2010-2016 (1,572,538 patient years). Trends in documentation of smoking history, number of eligible patients, and lung cancer screening orders were assessed. Using Hierarchical Generalized Linear Models, we also evaluated provider-level and patient-level factors associated with lung cancer screening orders among 970 primary care providers and 12,801 eligible patients according to USPSTF guidelines between January 1st, 2014 and December 31st, 2016. RESULT(S): Documentation of smoking history to determine eligibility (59.2% in 2010 to 77.8% in 2016) and LDCT-LCS orders (0% in 2010 to 7.3% in 2016) have increased since USPSTF guidelines. Patient factors associated with increased likelihood of lung cancer screening orders include: younger patient age (78-80 vs. 55-64 years old: OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.3-0.7), Asian race (vs. Non-Hispanic White: OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.4), reported current smoking (vs. former smoker: OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.4-2.0), no severe comorbidity (severe vs. no major comorbidity: OR=0.2, 95% CI=0.1-0.3; moderate vs. no major comorbidity: OR=0.5; 95% CI=0.4-0.7), and making a visit to own primary care provider (vs. other primary care providers: OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.7-3.4). Appropriate referral for lung cancer screening varies considerably across primary care providers. Provider factors include being a female physician (vs. male: OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.3) and receiving medical training in the US (foreign vs. US medical school graduates: OR=0.4, 95% CI=0.3-0.7). CONCLUSION(S): Future interventions to improve lung cancer screening may be more effective if they focus on accurate documentation of smoking history and target former smokers who do not regularly see their own primary care providers.",Excluded
1989,"Validation of NRG oncology/RTOG-0129 risk groups for HPV-positive and HPV-negative oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer: Implications for risk-based therapeutic intensity trials Background: Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)-0129 recursive partitioning analysis was the basis for risk-based therapeutic intensification trials for oropharyngeal cancer (OPC). To the authors' knowledge, the question of whether RTOG-0129 overall survival (OS) estimates for low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk groups are similar in other data sets or applicable to progression-free survival (PFS) is unknown. Therefore, the authors evaluated whether survival differences between RTOG-0129 risk groups persist at 5 years, are reproducible in an independent clinical trial, and are applicable to PFS, and whether toxicities differ across risk groups. Method(s): Prospective randomized clinical trials were analyzed retrospectively. RTOG-0129 evaluated standard versus accelerated fractionation radiotherapy concurrent with cisplatin. RTOG-0522 compared the combination of cisplatin and accelerated fractionation with or without cetuximab. Patients with OPC with available p16 status and tobacco history were eligible. Result(s): There was a total of 260 patients and 287 patients, respectively, from RTOG-0129 and RTOG-0522, with median follow-ups for surviving patients of 7.9 years (range, 1.7-9.9 years) and 4.7 years (range, 0.1-7.0 years), respectively. Previous OS differences in RTOG-0129 persisted at 5 years. In RTOG-0522, the 5-year OS rates for the low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk groups were 88.1%, 69.9%, and 45.1%, respectively (P for trend, <.001). The 5-year PFS rates for the same 3 groups were 72.9%, 56.1%, and 42.2%, respectively. In RTOG-0522 among a subgroup of patients considered to be at very good risk (p16-positive disease, smoking history of <=10 pack-years, and classified with T1-T2 disease with ipsilateral lymph nodes measuring <=6 cm or T3 disease without contralateral or >6 cm lymph nodes), the 5-year OS and PFS rates were 93.8% and 82.2%, respectively. Overall rates of acute and late toxicities were similar by risk group. Conclusion(s): RTOG-0129 risk groups persisted at 5 years and were reproducible in RTOG-0522. However, there was variability in the estimates. These data underscore the importance of long-term follow-up and appropriate patient selection in therapeutic deintensification trials.Copyright © 2019 American Cancer Society",Excluded

To prevent cardiovascular deconditioning a centrifuge may be utilized to induce gravity-like stresses within the body. The current investigation allows insight into the mechanisms of POI by simulating stand tests on Earth, the moon, and Mars while predicting centrifuge spin rates that sufficiently mimic each constant gravity reference. It was found that the modeled nonfinishing male & female astronaut would become presyncopal in about 4&7min, 32&56min, 104&182min while losing 160&280mL, 512&896mL, 692&1211mL of blood volume (BV) at the onset of presyncope in each case for Earth, Mars, and the moon, respectively.

2232,"Combined effects of glutathione S-transferase polymorphisms and thyroid cancer risk Since exposure to ionizing radiation, a risk factor for thyroid cancer, may produce genotoxins potentially eliminated by glutathione-S-transferases, we conducted a case control study to evaluate the role of the GSTM1- and GSTT1-null genotypes and GSTP1 polymorphisms in thyroid cancer. The frequency of GSTP1 Ile/Ile, GSTM1-, and GSTT1-null genotypes was increased in cancer patients when compared with control population. Considering the genotypes over-represented in thyroid cancer patients as potential risk genotypes, we carried out an odds ratio (OR) analysis considering the presence of none, one, two, or three risk genotypes. The results obtained showed that the presence of three potentially risk alleles (GSTM1 null, GSTT1 null, and GSTP1 Ile/Ile) lead to a significant OR increase for all the cases, irrespective of the type of tumor (OR=2.91), for papillary (OR=3.64) but not for follicular tumors. The presence of GSTP1 Ile/Ile leads to a significant later age of tumor onset when compared with GSTP1 Ile/Val and Val/Val (P<0.05), suggesting a possible association between GSTP1 Ile/Ile and the age of disease manifestation. These results suggest that combined GST polymorphisms lead to a moderate increased risk for thyroid cancer, especially for the papillary type, and GSTP1 polymorphisms might modulate the age of onset of the disease.",Excluded
1448,"Appendiceal Interposition for Ureteral Stricture Disease: Technique and Surgical Outcomes OBJECTIVE: To report our initial experience with ureteral appendiceal interposition (UAI) in a series of adult patients undergoing ureteral reconstruction for ureteral stricture. METHOD(S): We retrospectively collected data of patients who underwent UAI for ureteral stricture disease from December 2015 to March of 2020. Success of surgery was defined as one that required no subsequent procedural intervention for recurrent ureteral stricture disease, or loss of kidney function. RESULT(S): Eleven patients underwent UAI for ureteral stricture. Etiologies for stricture disease included radiation exposure, nephrolithiasis, and iatrogenic injury. Median follow-up was 363 days. Three patients had Clavien-Dindo class III complications during their hospitalization. No patient required repeat intervention due to recurrent ureteral stricture disease. On imaging, 9 patients had no obstruction on Lasix renal scan postoperatively, or improvement in hydronephrosis on CT scan. Two patients with poor renal function preop continued to show poor function after surgery.

This study used an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to simulate the prevalence of nosocomial infections in the Department of Critical Care Medicine of Guizhou Province. We also provided a policy basis for the prevention and control of hospital infection in the Department of Critical Care Medicine of Guizhou Province. Method(s): The data of ventilator-associated pneumonia, vascular catheter-related bloodstream infections, and urinary tract intubation-related urinary tract infections in nine tertiary A comprehensive treatment hospitals in Guizhou province from January 2014 to December 2019 were collected. The ARIMA time series model was used to evaluate the model fitting and prediction effects. Result(s): After comparison, in the Department of Critical Care Medicine of Guizhou Province, the unsurpassed model of ventilator-associated pneumonia was the ARIMA (0,1,1) model, with a residual Ljuing-Box Q test result of Q=10.832 (P=0.865), suggesting it is a white noise sequence and its simulation and prediction effects are beneficial. The best model of vascular catheter-related bloodstream infection was the ARIMA (0,0,1) model, with a residual Ljuing-Box Q test result of Q=14.914 (P=0.602). These results suggest that it is a white noise sequence, and its simulation and prediction effects are sufficient. The optimal model of urinary tract intubation-related urinary tract infection is ARIMA (1,0,0), and the residual Ljuing-Box Q test result is Q=15.042 (P=0.592), suggesting it is a white noise sequence with an accurate simulation and prediction effect.

Radon exposure and health effects are perceived based on the knowledge of the source and the ability to accept it as a health hazard. The purpose of this study was to assess the level of awareness and knowledge of radon and to identify the preferred sources of information for different target groups. The analysis was made by gender, ager education and socio-professional status. A questionnaire was developed. There was a total of 880 completed a ""face-to-face"" surveys in this study to randomly selected persons. It is estimated that 70% of all participants know what radon is, but a relatively small percentage of people who have azheard about radona know that radon causes lung cancer; The percentage of respondents who have more knowledge of the source and potential effects increases with the increase of educational level and is related to the profession. Just over half of those who know that radon is harmful tend to test their home. Several awareness-raising methods for different occupational groups have been identified. This study pro-vides useful information on effective risk communication with the public, which is a major component of the public health system.Copyright © 2020 Medical Information Center.

The fistula rate for patients who underwent immediate PMMC flap was 28.6%, intermediate to primary closure and PMMF flap. Several factors were evaluated for relationship to fistula, but no significant associations were identified. However, patients with fistula tended to have longer inpatient stays and may have been more likely to have a history of cardiovascular or hypoxic disease., Conclusion: Pharyngocutaneous fistula is a well-established complication of total laryngectomy and is especially a concern in patients with a previous history of radiation. Our retrospective review demonstrates that PMMF onlay flap appears to be more effective in reducing the rate of fistula compared to primary closure in these patients. Myocutaneous augmentation flaps, in contrast, have a fairly high fistula rate and may be better replaced with alternative closures such as free flaps.Copyright © 2013 The American Laryngological.",Excluded
1472,"Apoptosis, ageing and cancer susceptibility We have previously shown that peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from individuals carrying a germline TP53 mutation show a dramatically reduced apoptotic response to radiation. As part of a study of this phenomenon, we also investigated apoptotic response in a series of breast cancer patients lacking TP53 mutations and in a control group of individuals without cancer. There was a significant reduction in mean apoptotic response with increasing age in all groups. These findings are consistent with a number of studies in rodents, which have demonstrated a reduction in DNA damage-induced apoptosis with increasing age. In addition, after adjusting for age, breast cancer patients showed significantly reduced apoptotic responses compared with normal controls (P=0.002). The odds ratio for breast cancer in women with an apoptotic response of <35%, compared with women with a response of >49%, was 6.42 (95% CI 1.68-24.6). The data further support the hypothesis that a reduction in apoptotic response to DNA damage with increasing age may play a significant role in the age-related increase in cancer.",Excluded
1513,"Salivary gland-sparing other than parotid-sparing in definitive head-and-neck intensity-modulated radiotherapy does not seem to jeopardize local control Background: The objective was to analyze locoregional (LR) failure patterns in patients with head-and-neck cancer (HNC) treated using intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with whole salivary gland-sparing: parotid (PG), submandibular (SMG), and accessory salivary glands represented by the oral cavity (OC). Method(s): Seventy consecutive patients with Stage I-II (23%) or III/IV (77%) HNC treated by definitive IMRT were included. For all LR failure patients, the FDG-PET and CT scans documenting recurrence were rigidly registered to the initial treatment planning CT. Failure volumes (Vf) were delineated based on clinical, radiological, and histological data. The percentage of Vf covered by 95% of the prescription isodose (Vf-V95) was analyzed. Failures were classified as "" in-field"" if Vf-V95 >= 95%, "" marginal"" if 20% < Vf-V95 < 95%, and "" out-of-field"" if Vf-V95 <=20%. Correlation between Vf-V95 and mean doses (Dmean) in the PG, SMG, and OC was assessed using Spearman's rank-order correlation test. The salivary gland dose impact on the LR recurrence risk was assessed by Cox analysis. Result(s): The median follow-up was 20 months (6-35). Contralateral and ipsilateral PGs were spared in 98% and 54% of patients, respectively, and contralateral and ipsilateral SMG in 26% and 7%, respectively. The OC was spared to a dose <=40 Gy in 26 patients (37%). The 2-year LR control rate was 76.5%. One recurrence was "" marginal"" , and 12 were "" in-field"" No recurrence was observed in vicinity of spared structures. Vf-V95 was not significantly correlated with Dmean in PG, SMG, and OC. The LR recurrence risk was not increased by lower Dmean in the salivary glands, but by T (p = 0.04) and N stages (p = 0.03). Conclusion(s): Over 92% of LR failures occurred "" in-field"" within the high dose region when using IMRT with a whole salivary gland-sparing strategy. Sparing SMG and OC in addition to PG thus appears a safe strategy. © 2013 Chajon et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded

Method(s): From August 2002 to April 2005, 400 patients with stage III or stage IVa nasopharyngeal carcinoma were recruited for a randomised clinical trial of induction chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Pretreatment serum lipid concentrations were examined in 342 patients. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to investigate the association of serum lipid levels with different treatment outcomes. Result(s): The 5-year failure-free survival rate for the low- high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and high-HDL-C groups was 52.1% and 65.5%, respectively (p=0.017), and the 5-year overall survival rate was 64.7% and 72.5%, respectively (p=0.094). The pretreatment serum level of HDL-C was a favourable prognostic factor of overall survival and failure-free survival in a Cox regression model with HR 0.65 (95% CI 0.43-0.97; p=0.036) and 0.60 (95% CI 0.41-0.88; p =0.008). No significant correlation was observed between the prognosis of patients with NPC and serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).

2295,"Supermicrosurgical lymphaticovenous anastomosis for a patient with breast lymphedema secondary to breast cancer treatment Breast lymphedema (BLE) has been reported as a complication following breast cancer treatment. As for extremity lymphedema treatment, supermicrosurgical lymphaticovenous anastomosis (LVA) is considered an option for the treatment of progressive BLE refractory to conservative treatments, but no case has been reported so far. We report the first case of BLE successfully treated with supermicrosurgical LVA. A 55-year-old female presented with left BLE after breast conserving surgery and axillary lymph node dissection and adjuvant radiotherapy. After the cancer treatments, the patient suffered from pronounced swelling, sensation of tension, and pain of the left breast with frequent episodes of breast cellulitis. Conservative treatments had been performed for 7 years, but were not effective, and the patient was referred for further surgical treatment. Supermicrosurgical LVA was performed at the left breast. LVA surgery resulted in three anastomoses, in which three lymphatic vessels were anastomosed to three nearby veins in an intima-to-intima coaptation manner. After LVA, the left breast decreased in size, and the sensation of tension disappeared. One year postoperatively, the patient had no distress nor cellulitis episode, and was satisfied with the results of normal breast conditions. Although further clinical studies are required to confirm efficacy, supermicrosurgical LVA has the potential to be an option for the treatment of progressive BLE refractory to conservative treatments.Copyright © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded

All patients received either preoperative or postoperative radiation therapy., SETTING: Academic tertiary care referral center., INTERVENTIONS: Fourteen patients had mandibular continuity restored by using the titanium hollow screw reconstruction plate system, and 1 patient received a stainless steel mandibular reconstruction plate. Associated soft-tissue defects were repaired by using radial forearm (n = 11), rectus abdominis (n = 2), scapular and parascapular (n = 1), or lateral arm (n = 1) free flaps., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Early and delayed complications., RESULTS: All 15 microvascular free tissue transfers were successful. Early complications were minor and occurred in 5 (33%) of 15 patients. One patient in whom the titanium hollow screw reconstruction plate system had been used experienced a fracture at 15 months after reconstruction. Three patients experienced delayed external plate exposure between 7 and 15 months after primary oromandibular reconstruction. Patients who experienced delayed external plate exposure required secondary reconstruction with a vascularized bone-containing free flap. The overall rate of delayed reconstructive failure was 40% in patients who were followed up for a minimum of 1 year., CONCLUSIONS: For patients who are undergoing free flap reconstruction of lateral mandibulectomy defects, the technique that used soft-tissue free flaps combined with mandibular reconstruction plates has been abandoned in favor of using vascularized bone-containing free flaps or a combination of free flaps to achieve optimal long-term results.",Excluded
1766,"Analysis of EPR and FISH studies of radiation doses in persons who lived in the upper reaches of the Techa River Waterborne radioactive releases into the Techa River from the Mayak Production Association in Russia during 1949-1956 resulted in significant doses to about 30,000 persons who lived in downstream settlements. The residents were exposed to internal and external radiation. Two methods for reconstruction of the external dose are considered in this paper, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements of teeth, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) measurements of chromosome translocations in circulating lymphocytes. The main issue in the application of the EPR and FISH methods for reconstruction of the external dose for the Techa Riverside residents was strontium radioisotopes incorporated in teeth and bones that act as a source of confounding local exposures. In order to estimate and subtract doses from incorporated (89,90)Sr, the EPR and FISH assays were supported by measurements of (90)Sr-body burdens and estimates of (90)Sr concentrations in dental tissues by the luminescence method. The resulting dose estimates derived from EPR to FISH measurements for residents of the upper Techa River were found to be consistent: The mean values vary from 510 to 550 mGy for the villages located close to the site of radioactive release to 130-160 mGy for the more distant villages. The upper bound of individual estimates for both methods is equal to 2.2-2.3 Gy. The EPR- and FISH-based dose estimates were compared with the doses calculated for the donors using the most recent Techa River Dosimetry System (TRDS). The TRDS external dose assessments are based on the data on contamination of the Techa River floodplain, simulation of air kerma above the contaminated soil, age-dependent lifestyles and individual residence histories. For correct comparison, TRDS-based doses were calculated from two sources: external exposure from the contaminated environment and internal exposure from (137)Cs incorporated in donors' soft tissues. It is shown here that the TRDS-based absorbed doses in tooth enamel and muscle are in agreement with EPR- and FISH-based estimates within uncertainty bounds. Basically, this agreement between the estimates has confirmed the validity of external doses calculated with the TRDS.",Excluded
2026,"[Clinical significance of low-dose CT performed for three consecutive years in diagnosis of lung nodules in coal mine workers with 20 working years] Objective: To investigate the clinical significance of low-dose CT (LDCT) in coal mine workers with relatively long working years. Methods: A total of 907 coal mine workers with >=20 working years were enrolled, among whom there were 863 male and 44 female workers with a mean age of 49.5 years. Digital radiography (DR) was performed for these workers in 2013, and LDCT was performed for three consecutive years from 2014 to 2016. Results: A total of 32 workers were found to have lung nodules by DR in 2013, while in 2014, 269 workers were found to have non-calcified lung nodules by LDCT, and there was a significant difference in the number of workers with lung nodules (chi(2)=233.73, P<0.005) . There was also a significant difference in the detection rate of nodules between the workers with different working years of dust exposure (chi(2)=6.648, P=0.00) . The male workers had a significantly higher detection rate of nodules than the female workers (chi(2)=5.690, P=0.017) . There was no significant difference in the number of nodules between workers with different types of work (chi(2)=16.985, P=0.05) . There were 443 lung nodules in total, among which 71.56% were solid nodules and 55.75% had a size of <=4mm; malignant nodules were confirmed by surgery in 6 (0.66%) of the 907 workers after baseline LDCT. LDCT reexamination in 2015 and 2016 found new nodules in 8 workers and enlarged nodules in 3 workers, and there was no significant change in the number of nodules with a size of <=4 mm. Conclusions: It is necessary to perform high-risk population screening for coal mine workers by LDCT. The follow-up strategies for nodules with a size of <=4mm are the same as those for negative results; annual reexamination is recommended for nodules with a size of >4-8 mm, and clinical treatment should be considered for nodules with a size of >8 mm.",Excluded
1391,"Preliminary Evidence That Cortical Amyloid Burden Predicts Poor Response to Antidepressant Medication Treatment in Cognitively Intact Individuals With Late-Life Depression Objective: Amyloid accumulation, the pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, may predispose some older adults to depression and cognitive decline. Deposition of amyloid also occurs prior to the development of cognitive decline. It is unclear whether amyloid influences antidepressant outcomes in cognitively intact depressed elders. Design(s): A pharmacoimaging trial utilizing florbetapir (18F) PET scanning followed by 2 sequential 8-week antidepressant medication trials. Participant(s): Twenty-seven depressed elders who were cognitively intact on screening. Measurements and Interventions: After screening, diagnostic testing, assessment of depression severity and neuropsychological assessment, participants completed florbetapir (18F) PET scanning. They were then randomized to receive escitalopram or placebo for 8 weeks in a double-blinded two-to-one allocation rate. Individuals who did not respond to initial treatment transitioned to a second open-label trial of bupropion for another 8 weeks. Result(s): Compared with 22 amyloid-negative participants, 5 amyloid-positive participants exhibited significantly less change in depression severity and a lower likelihood of remission. In the initial blinded trial, 4 of 5 amyloid-positive participants were nonremitters (80%), while only 18% (4 of 22) of amyloid-negative participants did not remit (p = 0.017; Fisher's Exact test). In separate models adjusting for key covariates, both positive amyloid status (t = 3.07, 21 df, p = 0.003) and higher cortical amyloid binding by standard uptake value ratio (t = 2.62, 21 df, p = 0.010) were associated with less improvement in depression severity. Similar findings were observed when examining change in depression status across both antidepressant trials. Conclusion(s): In this preliminary study, amyloid status predicted poor antidepressant response to sequential antidepressant treatment. Alternative treatment approaches may be needed for amyloid-positive depressed elders.Copyright © 2020",Excluded
2152,"Idiopathic pneumonia syndrome in mice after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation: Association between idiopathic pneumonia syndrome and acute graft-versus-host disease Objective: To explore the association between idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) and acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Method(s): Established acute GVHD model of C57BL/6 -> BALB/c mice. Chest computed tomography (CT) scans were dynamically performed in recipient mice after transplant. Lung histopathology and cytokine levels (including TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma) were examined in three experimental groups: mice receiving simple irradiation, syngeneic transplants, and allogeneic transplants. Result(s): All allogeneic transplant mice developed aGVHD. On CT, most aGVHD mice had bilateral diffuse lung infiltrates, while syngeneic transplant mice had normal lungs. On histopathology, aGVHD mice had acute pneumonitis. On immunohistochemistry, the infiltrates were mainly CD4+ T cells during aGVHD onset, but CD8+ T cells predominated during aGVHD progression. Lung TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma levels were higher in the three experimental groups than in normal controls on days + 3 and + 7 post-transplant. On day + 7, TNF-alpha levels were higher in allogeneic than in syngeneic transplant mice; IFN-gamma levels were not different. On days + 12 and + 16, TNF-alpha levels were higher but IFN-gamma levels were lower in allogeneic mice than in syngeneic transplant mice. Conclusion(s): The underlying cause of IPS is aGVHD. T cells and TNF-alpha may play a role in the pathogenesis of aGVHD-induced IPS. IPS progression may be associated with decreasing lung IFN-gamma levels. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded

1765,"[Dental care in patients undergoing radiotherapy of the head and neck] Radiotherapy involving the oral cavity and salivary glands induces a wide range of alterations in oral tissues and salivary gland functions which may result in oral side effects. Some of these are inevitable and transient such as radiation mucositis, some however may be permanent such as xerostomia. Others however are preventable, and are caused by poor radiation techniques, application of excessive radiation doses or lack of necessary preventive measures. Frequent complications in these patients are development of caries, dental hypersensitivity, rapidly progressive periodontal disease and loss of taste. Occasionally, trismus and osteoradionecrosis may develop. Careful treatment planning before start of radiotherapy with adequate dosimetry and careful shielding of the healthy tissues as well as close monitoring of the oral cavity with strict application of preventive measures (dental care protocol) can significantly reduce the incidence of these complications. The private practitioner should keep in mind the life-long precautions that are necessary when treating these patients.",Excluded
1634,"Regional radiation dose susceptibility within the parotid gland: Effects on salivary loss and recovery Purpose: Xerostomia is one of the most likely late toxic effects of radiotherapy treatment in patients with head-and-neck cancers. Modern treatment techniques can incorporate knowledge of complication risk into treatment plans. To this end, the authors attempt to quantify the regional radiotherapy dose-dependence of salivary output loss and recovery in a prospective study. Method(s): Salivary output was collected from patients undergoing radiotherapy treatment for headand- neck cancers at the BC Cancer Agency between February 2008 and May 2013. Regional dose-dependence (i.e., dose susceptibility) of loss and recovery is quantified using nonparametric (Spearmans rank correlation coefficients, local linear regression) and parametric (least-sum of squares, least-median of squares) techniques. Result(s): Salivary flow recovery was seen in 79 of 102 patients considered (p < 0.0001, Wilcoxon sign rank test). Output loss was strongly correlated with left- and right parotid combined dose phi = min (DL, 45 Gy)+min (DR, 45 Gy), and can be accurately predicted. Median early loss (three months) was 72% of baseline, while median overall loss (1 yr) was 56% of baseline. Fitting an exponential model to whole parotid yields dose sensitivities A3m = 0.0604 Gy?1 and A1y = 0.0379 Gy?1. Recovery was not significantly associated with dose. Hints of lateral organ subsegment doseresponse dimorphism were observed. Conclusion(s): Sub-segmentation appears to predict neither loss nor recovery with any greater precision than whole parotid mean dose, though it is not any worse. Sparing the parotid to a combined dose phi of <50 Gy is recommended for a patient to keep =40% of baseline function and thus avoid severe xerostomia at 12 months post-treatment. It seems unlikely that a populations mean recovery will exceed 20%30% of baseline output at 1 yr after radiotherapy treatment using current (whole-organ based) clinical guidelines.Copyright © 2015 Am.

1560,"Radiation-induced oscillopsia in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients PURPOSE: To apply a battery of audiovestibular function tests and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate the causes of oscillopsia in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients after irradiation (RT)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Of 300 NPC patients, 12 (4%) developed oscillopsia after RT. The mean accumulated radiation dose to the nasopharynx was 112 +/- 30 Gy. Each patient underwent a battery of audiovestibular function tests, including audiometry and the dynamic illegible E, caloric, and rotational tests., RESULTS: Excluding 3 patients with neck fibrosis who could not perform the head turning movement, the remaining 9 patients displayed 100% abnormal dynamic illegible E test results and 100% abnormal refixation saccades. All 12 patients presented with bilateral hearing loss, caloric reductions, and reduced gains of the vestibular ocular reflex (VOR) on the rotational test, indicating bilateral VOR loss. After excluding tumor relapse and radiation necrosis of the brain by MRI, the oscillopsia in these 12 irradiated NPC patients was attributed to bilateral VOR loss., CONCLUSION: Radiation-induced oscillopsia in our NPC patients was attributed to bilateral VOR loss, possibly as a result of higher radiation doses. Hence, the therapeutic benefits of a second course of RT are associated with the potential risk of oscillopsia after RT.",Excluded
1773,"Occurrence of Phosphenes in Patients Undergoing Proton Beam Therapy for Ocular Tumor Purpose: Phosphenes are frequently reported by patients irradiated in the head and neck area. The aim of the present study was to characterize and investigate potential mechanisms of proton beam therapy (PBT)-induced phosphenes in a large population of patients undergoing PBT for ocular tumors. Design(s): Prospective cohort study. Method(s): Consecutive patients who underwent PBT in a single center were included. Immediately after the first session, all patients completed a questionnaire collecting information about the presence of phosphenes as well as their color, shape, and duration. Patient, tumor and treatment characteristics (dose volume histograms) were also collected. Result(s): Among the 474 patients included, 62.8% reported phosphenes during the first session of PBT. Reported colors were mainly blue-violet (70.5%) and white (14.1%). The prevalence of phosphenes was higher in younger patients (P =.003); other patient or ocular characteristics were not associated with the occurrence of phosphenes. Irradiation of the macula (P <.001) and/or optic disc (P <.001) were significantly associated with the presence of phosphenes, whereas blue-violet color was only associated with young age and irradiation of macular area (P =.04). Pupillary constriction was reported for 57.1% of patients with phosphenes vs 18.5% of patients without (P <.001). Blue-violet phosphenes (P <.001) and irradiation of macula (P =.001) were statistically associated with pupillary constriction. Conclusion(s): The present study reported a high rate of phosphenes in patients irradiated by PBT for ocular tumor. Their blue-violet color and their association with a pupillary constriction probably indicates the stimulation of S-cones and retinal ganglion cells that reflects the activation of the afferent visual pathway.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

Dose escalation was performed toward the maximal PD using secondary endpoint constraints for the lung, spinal cord, and heart, with de-escalation according to defined esophageal tolerance. Dose calculation was performed using the Eclipse pencil beam algorithm, and all plans were recalculated using a collapsed cone algorithm. The normal tissue complication probabilities were calculated for the lung (Grade 2 pneumonitis) and esophagus (acute toxicity, grade 2 or greater, and late toxicity)., RESULTS: IMRT resulted in statistically significant decreases in the mean lung (p <.0001) and maximal spinal cord (p = .002 and 0005) doses, allowing an average increase in the PD of 8.6-14.2 Gy (p <=.0001). This advantage was lost after de-escalation within the defined esophageal dose limits. The lung normal tissue complication probabilities were significantly lower for IMRT (p <.0001), even after dose escalation. For esophageal toxicity, IMRT significantly decreased the acute NTCP values at the low dose levels (p = .0009 and p <.0001). After maximal dose escalation, late esophageal tolerance became critical (p <.0001), especially when using IMRT, owing to the parallel increases in the esophageal dose and PD., CONCLUSION: In LA-NSCLC, IMRT offers the potential to significantly escalate the PD, dependent on the lung and spinal cord tolerance. However, parallel increases in the esophageal dose abolished the advantage, even when using collapsed cone algorithms. This is important to consider in the context of concomitant chemoradiotherapy schedules using IMRT. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

We have compared three schedules of non-platinum-based CT plus either radiotherapy or chemoradiation. From May 2001 to June 2006, 158 patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC were enrolled in a randomized phase II trial with overall response rate (ORR) as the primary endpoint. The initial design included three arms: sequential CT followed by thoracic radiation (TRT); concurrent CT/TRT followed by consolidation CT; and induction CT followed by concurrent CT/TRT. However, based on the preliminary results of the RTOG 9410 trial, the sequential arm was closed when 19 patients had been enrolled. All patients received two cycles of docetaxel 40mg/m2 days 1 and 8 plus gemcitabine 1200mg/m2 days 1 and 8, as either induction or consolidation therapy. Concurrent CT/TRT consisted of docetaxel 20mg/m2 and carboplatin AUC 2 weekly plus 60Gy TRT. No differences were found in ORR between the two arms (56% and 57%). Hematological toxicity was mild but significantly superior with consolidation CT; the esophagitis rate was similar in both arms (16% and 15%).

In the present study, we assess the stratum corneum (SC) hydration in sun-exposed males and females., METHODS: A total of 168 subjects (84 males and 84 females) aged 19-75 years were enrolled. A multifunctional skin physiology monitor was used to measure SC hydration., RESULTS: In comparison with non-sun exposure, sun exposure does not cause a significant change in SC hydration in either young males or young females, whereas in aged females, a significant reduction of SC hydration is seen on the forehead and the dorsal hand of sun-exposed subjects. SC hydration on the canthus of both aged males and aged females is significantly lower than that of young subjects. Additionally, SC hydration on the dorsal hand of aged females is also significantly lower as compared with young females. Sun-induced reduction of SC hydration is more evident on the dorsal hand of aged females than that of males (P<0.001). Moreover, the SC rehydration capacity is significantly lower in sun-exposed aged females than in age-matched males., CONCLUSION: These results demonstrated that sun-induced changes of the SC hydration property vary with age and gender.

1256,"Contrast-enhanced ultrasound for the evaluation of the cryolesion after laparoscopic renal cryoablation: An initial report Purpose: Stringent radiological follow-up is essential after renal tumor ablation. Drawbacks of postablation follow-up by contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) are the associated ionizing radiation and nephrotoxic contrast agent. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has shown potential to demonstrate microvasculature without using either ionizing radiation or toxic contrast agent. We assessed the concordance of enhancement patterns of CEUS and CECT/MRI in cryolesion assessment after laparoscopic renal cryoablation (LCA). Method(s): From 01/2006 to 01/2009, a CEUS was performed before and after LCA (3 and 12 months) in addition to regular CECT/MRI. Using an enhancement score (0=no enhancement, 1=rim enhancement, 2=diffuse enhancement, 3=localized enhancement, 4=no enhancement defect), the cryolesion was assessed by both modalities, and concordance of enhancement score was assessed. Result(s): In total, 45 tumors were included (29 biopsy proven renal cell carcinoma (RCC), mean size 2.66 cm). One cryoablation failed, resulting in a nonenhancing cryolesion apart from the persisting renal tumor. There were no postablation recurrences during the study period. Pre-LCA: Both modalities were available in 26 cases. In 20 out of 26, there was concordance of enhancement score (77%, all cases score 3 or 4). Three months: Both modalities were available in 32 cases. Enhancement score corresponded in 23 out of 32 cases (72%). Seven cases showed enhancement on CECT/MRI (""1"" in six cases, ""4"" in one case) with enhancement score ""0""on CEUS. Two cases showed enhancement on CEUS without enhancement on CECT/MRI (specificity 92%, negative predictive value [NPV] 77%). Except one case, all enhancement resolved on subsequent imaging. Twelve months: Both modalities were available in 21 tumors. Enhancement score corresponded in 19 out of 21 cases (91%). Two cases showed enhancement on CEUS without enhancement on CECT/MRI (specificity 90%, NPV 100%). Conclusion(s): This pilot study shows that CEUS is a safe imaging technique with high concordance of enhancement score between CEUS and CECT/MRI. While cross-sectional imaging seems sensible to demonstrate successful ablation at first follow-up, CEUS might be used to diminish the burden of contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging in the long-term follow-up. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Excluded
2154,"Utility of positron emission tomography/computed tomography in extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma Background: Natural killer (NK/) T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, is an aggressive form of extranodal lymphoma that is common in Asia, but rare in Europe and North America. Although NK/T-cell lymphoma involves upper aerodigestive sites such as the nasal cavity and nasopharynx, it frequently involves other extranodal sites, including the gastrointestinal tract, bone marrow, adrenal gland, and skin. Because of the frequency of extranodal site involvement, pretreatment evaluation of disease extension is important for staging and treatment. Recently, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) was evaluated for its usefulness in the prognosis and treatment response of aggressive B-cell lymphoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma, and relevant results were obtained. Many studies have evaluated the value of PET/CT for various types of B-cell lymphomas, but other similar studies involving T-cell and NK-cell lymphomas are rare. In the present study, we compared the utility of PET/CT and conventional modalities, particularly CT, in extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma. Patients and Method: From January 2006 to April 2010, 19 untreated patients with extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (11 males and 8 females; median age 61 years; range 13-90 years) were included in the study. PET/CT and conventional procedures (e.g., CTs and biopsies) were compared and evaluated for their abilities to detect tumor lesions and their influence in staging and treatment strategies. PET/CT was performed as an initial staging procedure. In addition to PET/CT, all patients underwent initial staging workups, including whole-body CT with contrast media, biopsies from the bone marrow and other sites, and panendoscopies of the upper aerodigestive tract. Patients were evaluated for clinical stage by both evaluation modalities (PET/CT and conventional modalities) according to the Ann Arbor Staging System, and treatment strategies were first planned based on staging results. Following PET/CT, the clinical stage was reevaluated in each patient, and treatment strategies were decided based on the re-staging results. Result(s): Seven patients (37%) had bone marrow involvement, eight (42%) were in Ann Arbor stage I-II, and 11 (58%) had a systemic dissemination. Most patients with systemic dissemination (9/11, 82%) had cutaneous lesions. The median number of disease sites was 4 (range, 1-15). The median number of positive lesions was 3 (range, 1-15) by PET/CT compared to 2 (range, 0-14) by CT (p = 0.12). Using PET/CT, 108 lesions (93%) were detected, and at least one FDG-avid lesion was observed at initial staging workups in all patients. In contrast, 70 lesions (60%) were detected by CT, and three patients (16%) did not show any positive lesion. Two lesions (2%) at the nasal cavity that were detected by biopsy were undetectable by either PET/CT or CT. The nodal and extranodal regions were separately evaluated by PET/CT and conventional modalities. In total, 28 nodal lesions were detected: all (100%) were positive by PET/CT and 26 (93%) by CT. Conversely, 89 extranodal lesions were detected, and 83 (93%) and 44 (49%) were positive by PET/CT and CT (p = 0.003), respectively. For the detection of upper aerodigestive lesions, PET/CT and CT demonstrated similar results: 23 lesions (92%) vs. 17 (68%), respectively. Notably, PET/CT was superior to CT in detecting cutaneous lesions [31 lesions (100%) vs. 19 lesions (61%), respectively; p = 0.026]. Bone marrow involvement was confirmed pathologically in only seven patients; four cases (57%) were positive by PET/CT and none by CT. Using conventional modalities, 11 patients (58%) were in the localized stage and eight (42%) were in the advanced stage. Using PET/CT, eight (42%) were in stage I-II and 11 (58%) were in stage III-IV. Most patients received chemotherapy plus local irradiation in stage I-II, and intensive chemotherapy with or without hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in stage III-IV. One patient did not receive treatment because of unwillingness for treatment and older age. PET/CT findin s altered the stage and treatment strategy in four (21%) and two cases (11%). Conclusion(s): In extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, PET/CT demonstrated a high detection rate for nodal and extranodal lesions, except in the bone marrow. PET/CT may have an impact on treatment strategy and is essential for risk-adapted treatment.",Excluded
1287,"Thyroid radiation doses during radioimmunotherapy of CEA-expressing tumours with 131I-labelled monoclonal antibodies A number of radioimmunotherapy (RAIT) trials with iodinated antibodies have shown a high variability in the radiation doses to the thyroid. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate which factors influence these thyroid doses during RAIT with 131iodinated monoclonal anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) antibodies. Data from 36 patients with CEA-expressing tumours were analysed. The patients underwent RAIT with the 131I-labelled IgG1 anti-CEA antibody, MN-14 (Ka = 10(9) l mol-1) or its F(ab')2 fragment (activity range 45.8-220.0 mCi). The thyroid was blocked with 120 mg iodine (lugol's orSSKI solution) and 400 mg perchlorate per day, starting 1 day prior to the first study. Blood clearance and molecular composition of labelled plasma compounds were determined by blood sampling and size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. The cumulated activities of tissues were determined from daily imaging and blood clearance data. Doses were derived from the MIRD scheme. Thyroid radiation doses showed a high variability, between 1.2 and 37.7 cGy mCi-1 (mean +/- S.D.: 11.1 +/- 8.3 cGy mCi-1), corresponding to absolute doses between 2.5 and 43.6 Gy. However, the maximal iodine uptake in the thyroid was 2.4 +/- 1.9 microCi mCi-1 (range 0.2-10.0 microCi mCi-1), which was less than 1% of the injected activity, indicating that more than 99% of the thyroid was blocked in all cases. No correlation was found between these thyroid doses and conditions leading to an enhanced exposure to free radioiodine, such as unbound I- in the mAb preparation, rapid metabolic breakdown of the labelled antibody due to human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA), or immune complex formation with circulating antigen. However, a relationship between the thyroid doses and the patients' compliance in taking their Lugol's and perchlorate blocking medications, as well as to a relatively high variability in the biological half-life of the iodine in the thyroid (range from 31.1 h to virtual infinity), is indicated. No rising TSH titres or other signs of (latent) hypothyroidism were seen in these patients during a 2 year follow-up period. Longer follow-up was not possible because of the terminal condition of most of the patients. These data show that thyroid doses in an appropriately blocked individual given a standard, non-myeloablative dose of RAIT, are generally lower than those assumed to be required to cause late hypothyroidism. Even if higher activities are used, potential hypothyroidism may be overcome easily by hormone replacement. Thyroid doses are independent of parameters leading to an enhanced exposure of the thyroid to free radioiodine, suggesting that patient compliance in taking their blocking medication may be the most crucial factor for reducing thyroid doses in RAIT with 131I-labelled antibodies.",Excluded
1350,"Apoptosis of Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes in the Members of the Techa River Cohort Chronically Exposed to Radiation The purpose of the present research was to estimate the intensity of the apoptotic death of lymphocytes during the period of carcinogenic effect realization in the residents of the Techa riverside villages. The investigation included analyses of the frequency of lymphocytes at the early and late stages of apoptosis and necrosis of peripheral blood lymphocytes using the method of FITC Annexin V, lymphocyte counts at the stage of DNA fragmentation using the TUNEL method, and the number of CD95(+)-lymphocytes. In the capacity of additional tests, loading tests involving in vitro irradiation at the dose of 1 Gy of a suspension of lymphocytes and incubations for 5 and 24 hours were used. Activation of the initial apoptotic and necrotic death of peripheral blood lymphocytes was revealed in the persons chronically exposed to low-intensity radiation within the range from 0.01 to 4.23 Gy. Exposed patients demonstrated a decrease in the number of CD95(+)-cells as compared to unexposed patients. The results of the cell death studies in the persons residing in the Techa riverside villages testify indirectly to the genomic instability of the peripheral blood lymphocytes.",Excluded

1932,"Cumulative ionizing radiation to image the small bowel: Are we really exceeding the safety limits? Introduction: Radiation exposure from diagnostic imaging of the small bowel is common in Crohn's disease (CD) patients. Increased risk of malignancy has been associated with radiation exposure. For solid cancers this follows a linear-no-threshold model. Current data (BEIR VII) demonstrates that exposure to 100mGY to population of mixed ages, the life time attributable risk (LAR) of solid organ malignancy is 8 per 1000 of exposed persons for males and 13.1 per 1000 for females. This varies according to age of exposure exposure to 100mGY at age 10 confers a risk of 1.33% for males (2.53% for females); at age 30 this is 0.6% for males (1% for females) and at age 50 it is 0.51% for males (0.68% for females). 100mGY exposure confers a LAR (in a linear-quadratic model) for leukaemia of 1 per 1000 for males and 0.72 per 1000 for females. This varies from 1.2 per 1000 exposed males at age 10 (0.86 for females) to 0.84 per 1000 males exposed at age 30 (0.49 for females). The risk remains the same for males aged 50 and decreases to 0.30 per 1000 females exposed aged 50. Aim and Method: Aim: To determine the cumulative ionizing radiation exposure in mGY secondary to non-acute small bowel (SB) imaging in CD patients. Method(s): Patients were identified from our database. Their SB investigations were extracted. Radiation exposure for the procedures was obtained from the Physics division of the radiology department. Result(s): 80 CD patients (males 42 patient) were identified. The time since the diagnosis of CD varied from 41 years to 5 months (mean 8.6 years). 56 patients (30 males) were exposed to ionizing radiation to image the SB. Table 1 denotes the total number of exposures per age group and gender. 15 male and 5 female patients had SB stricturing disease. 2 female patients had fistulising SB disease. Table 2 demonstrates cumulative ionizing radiation secondary to non-acute small bowel imaging. Conclusion(s): 70% of the CD patients were exposed to diagnostic ionizing radiation as to image the small bowel. This radiation exposure reached more than 50mGY in 15% of patients and more than 100mGY in 8.75% our Study group. These results demonstrate the high ionizing radiation with the possible consequences that CD patients are exposed to throughout their lifetime. Thus we suggest that efforts should be done to image the small bowel by non-ionizing radiation such as MRI. In places where this is not available the request for ionizing radiation should only be done by specialists in close liason with the radiologists. (Table presented).",Excluded
2397,"Tolerability of combined modality therapy for rectal cancer in elderly patients aged 75 years and older Purpose: To determine the rate of treatment deviations during combined modality therapy for rectal cancer in elderly patients aged 75 years and older. Methods and Materials: We reviewed the records of consecutively treated patients with rectal cancer aged 75 years and older treated with combined modality therapy at Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham & Women's Hospital from 2002 to 2007. The primary endpoint was the rate of treatment deviation, defined as a treatment break, dose reduction, early discontinuation of therapy, or hospitalization during combined modality therapy. Patient comorbidity was rated using the validated Adult Comorbidity Evaluation 27 Test (ACE-27) comorbidity index. Fisher's exact test and the Mantel-Haenszel trend test were used to identify predictors of treatment tolerability. Result(s): Thirty-six eligible patients had a median age of 79.0 years (range, 75-87 years); 53% (19/36) had no or mild comorbidity and 47% (17/36) had moderate or severe comorbidity. In all, 58% of patients (21/36) were treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and 33% (12/36) with postoperative CRT. Although 92% patients (33/36) completed the planned radiotherapy (RT) dose, 25% (9/36) required an RT-treatment break, 11% (4/36) were hospitalized, and 33% (12/36) had a dose reduction, break, or discontinuation of concurrent chemotherapy. In all, 39% of patients (14/36) completed >=4 months of adjuvant chemotherapy, and 17% (6/36) completed therapy without a treatment deviation. More patients with no to mild comorbidity completed treatment than did patients with moderate to severe comorbidity (21% vs. 12%, p = 0.66). The rate of deviation did not differ between patients who had preoperative or postoperative CRT (19% vs. 17%, p = 1.0). Conclusion(s): The majority of elderly patients with rectal cancer in this series required early termination of treatment, treatment interruptions, or dose reductions. These data suggest that further intensification of combined modality therapy for rectal cancer should be performed with caution in elderly patients, who require aggressive supportive care to complete treatment. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
2373,"Normalized Dual-Energy Iodine Ratio Best Differentiates Renal Cell Carcinoma Subtypes among Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers from Perfusion CT and Dual-Energy CT OBJECTIVE. The objective of our study was to assess and compare the diagnostic accuracy of perfusion CT (PCT) and dual-energy CT (DECT) in differentiating clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) from non-ccRCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS. This retrospective study included 51 patients with 52 renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) (36 ccRCCs and 16 non-ccRCCs) who underwent both PCT and DECT before surgery or biopsy between January 2014 and December 2018. Three independent readers measured blood flow, blood volume (BV), and permeability using PCT and iodine concentration (IC) and iodine ratio using DECT. Interreader agreement was calculated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to assess PCT and DECT models. Size-specific dose estimates of the two methods were compared. RESULTS. BV (ICC, 0.93) and iodine ratio (ICC, 0.85) were the most reproducible parameters. Both PCT and DECT were significant models (p < 0.05, all readers) for differentiating ccRCC from non-ccRCC. There was no significant difference in diagnostic accuracy between PCT and DECT (p > 0.05). BV and iodine ratio were independent predictors of non-ccRCC (p < 0.05). However, the mean size-specific dose estimate was 16 times lower with DECT than with PCT (p < 0.001). The AUC of iodine ratio was 0.95, and sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy with an iodine ratio cutoff of 63.72% was 0.90, 0.86, and 0.87, respectively. CONCLUSION. PCT and DECT had comparable and high diagnostic accuracy in differentiating RCC subtypes; however, because of the significantly lower radiation dose of DECT, iodine ratio may be used as the best independent predictor.Copyright © American Roentgen Ray Society",Excluded

Because of similar actions of estrogens and radiation in the cell cycle, and possibly antagonistic effects reported in the clinical literature, we looked for an antagonism between these two therapeutic modalities. Radiation therapy consistently showed a greater tumor inhibitory effect than estrogen therapy alone at the dose tested. Combinations of radiation therapy with hormonal manipulation did not appear to show a greater inhibition of tumor growth than radiation therapy alone. There also did not appear to be an antagonistic effect between these two modalities in this system.",Excluded
1374,"CT follow-up in patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs): combined radiation and contrast dose reduction Background Frequent computed tomography (CT) follow-ups involve significant radiation related risks for patients with low-grade neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Contrast agent (CA) application is essential for diagnostic evidence and has additional risks especially in patients with limited renal function. Purpose To investigate if a combination of dose and contrast agent (CA) reduction affects image quality and diagnostic evidence in neuroendocrine tumor (NET) patients. Material and Methods A total of 51 NET patients were enrolled in the study and 153 CT scans were analyzed. Patients underwent a baseline CT scan (A = 120 kVp, filtered back projection [FBP]) and two follow-up CTs (B = 120 kVp, adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction [ASIR] 40%; C1 = 100 kVp, ASIR 40%; C2 = 100 kVp, ASIR 60%; the latter two protocols were applied with a 30% reduction in CA volume). We evaluated image quality and applied dose. Results In C1/2, the combination of low kV (100 kVp) with ASIR 40%/60% reduced the mean applied dose significantly by 28% compared to B and by 57% compared to A. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) of tumor to liver/muscle were significantly increased by using C1/2 compared to B and A. With respect to subjective image quality, a slight loss of diagnostic confidence in C1 could be counterbalanced by the higher ASIR blending in C2. Conclusion Combined dose reduction techniques can be used to reduce radiation dose and CA volume without sacrificing image quality and diagnostic confidence in staging CT of NET patients.",Excluded

1709,"Surgical management of osteoradionecrosis of the jaws OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to evaluate our 10-year clinical experience in surgical management of patients with osteoradionecrosis (ORN) unresolved with conservative nonoperative treatment., PATIENTS AND METHODS: The medical records of 120 patients who had been surgically treated for ORN during a 10-year period (January 2003 to January 2013) were retrospectively reviewed., RESULTS: The most predilection ORN site was mandible (82.5%), followed by the maxilla (11.7%). ORN developed within initial 12 months in 39.2% and within the first 3 years in 68.3%. The median radiation dose was 68.1 Gy (range, 35-148 Gy), but 51 patients (42.5%) experienced ORN even though radiation doses were controlled under 60 Gy. Surgical trauma, as we believed, was the most important factor leading to this result. Among all the patients, 12 (10.0%) patients were found ineligible for operative treatment due to comorbid systematic diseases whereas none healed or improved. In terms of surgical management of the rest of the 108 patients, 90 (75.0%) patients underwent radical resection (4 patients unhealed), and 18 (15.0%) patients underwent mild surgical procedures such as sequestrectomy or debridement (1 patient unhealed). Of the 90 radical resection patients, 58 patients underwent radical resections and immediate microvascular flap reconstruction (19 bone flaps and 39 soft flaps), and 32 patients only experience radical resection (5 patients received second-stage reconstruction). According to follow-up information, 55 patients were free of disease., CONCLUSION: Though priority should be given to surgical treatment for the patient whose ORN does not respond to conservative nonoperative treatment, we may as well take into account more individualized regimens based on ORN severity. A hard lesson learned from our article is that the oral maxillofacial surgeon should minimize the trauma for jaws as possible as he can, especially to patients who need to receive postoperative radiotherapy.",Excluded
2334,"Utility whole body PET/CT scan in malignant melanoma. Can the location of the primary tumor guide image planning? Aim/Introduction: To determine the value of systematically performing whole-body (head-to-toe) PET/CT images (WBPET) in the evaluation of patients with malignant melanoma and propose a criteria of when standard imaging can be performed. Material(s) and Method(s): Retrospective study of all WB-PET scans performed in patients with malignant melanoma in our hospital, either for staging, restaging, recurrence or post-treatment follow-up, between January 2011 and January 2020. We looked for any FDG avid foci in the lower extremities. The findings were considered as true positives if histopathological findings were confirmed, if the lesion was treated as melanoma because of other complementary findings (physical exploration, ultrasound, etc) or if during follow-up it was determined as malignant in nature. We also analyzed if the true positive findings had any change in patients management. Result(s): We analyzed 367 WB-PET studies belonging to 169 patients, 93 male (55%) and 76 female (45%), with a mean age of 56.4 years (range 19-90 years). Of the 367 studies performed 170 (46,3%) where for staging (all at least stage IIIB), and 197 (53,7%) for suspected recurrence or post treatment follow-up. From all the WB-PET scans we observed that 19 (5 %) had positive findings in the lower extremities, 11 (3%) of which were true-positive findings (all with histopathological confirmation), 8 (2%) scans were false positive (5 inflammatory foci demonstrated by clinical follow-up and 3 benign lesions (dermatophibroma, nevus and encondroma). From the 11 true-positive findings, 8 (2%) had the primary lesion in an infra-umbilical location; 1 (0.2%) was an extracutaneous melanoma (paranasal) but the finding could be included on a standard study, and the other 2(0,4%), had disseminated disease so the findings did not change clinical management. Also, none of these findings generated a change in management. Conclusion(s): In our cohort, we found that WB-PET in patients with melanoma had no additional value to standard (head-tomid-thigh) PET/CT images. We propose to perform WB-PET only in patients with the primary melanoma lesion located below the umbilical line. PET/CT acquisition of the lower extremities results in increased scan time and unnecessary radiation dose without generated therapeutic impact.",Excluded
1761,"Molecular and cellular profiling of acute responses to total body radiation exposure in ovariectomized female cynomolgus macaques Purpose: The threat of radiation exposure requires a mechanistic understanding of radiation-induced immune injury and recovery. The study objective was to evaluate responses to ionizing radiation in ovariectomized (surgically post-menopausal) female cynomolgus macaques. Material(s) and Method(s): Animals received a single total-body irradiation (TBI) exposure at doses of 0, 2 or 5 Gy with scheduled necropsies at 5 days, 8 weeks and 24 weeks post-exposure. Blood and lymphoid tissues were evaluated for morphologic, cellular, and molecular responses. Result(s): Irradiated animals developed symptoms of acute hematopoietic syndrome, and reductions in thymus weight, thymopoiesis, and bone marrow cellularity. Acute, transient increases in plasma monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1) were observed in 5 Gy animals along with dose-dependent alterations in messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) signatures in thymus, spleen, and lymph node. Expression of T cell markers was lower in thymus and spleen, while expression of macrophage marker CD68 (cluster of differentiation 68) was relatively elevated in lymphoid tissues from irradiated animals. Conclusion(s): Ovariectomized female macaques exposed to moderate doses of radiation experienced increased morbidity, including acute, dose-dependent alterations in systemic and tissue-specific biomarkers, and increased macrophage/T cell ratios. The effects on mortality exceeded expectations based on previous studies in males, warranting further investigation.Copyright © 2015 Informa UK, Ltd.",Excluded

Fifty-seven patients were scanned using both ATVS and ATCM and images were reconstructed using either filtered back-projection (FBP) (group A1) or sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction (SAFIRE) (group A2). Forty-eight patients were imaged using only ATCM, with a fixed tube potential of 120 kVp and FBP reconstruction (group B). Quantitative parameters (image noise in Hounsfield unit and contrast-to-noise ratio of the aorta, the liver, and the hepatic tumors) and qualitative visual parameters (image noise, overall image quality, and lesion conspicuity as graded on a 5-point scale) were compared among the groups., RESULTS: Group A2 scanned with the automatically chosen 80 kVp and 100 kVp tube voltages ranked the best in lesion conspicuity and subjective and objective image quality (p values ranging from < 0.001 to 0.004) among the three groups, except for overall image quality between group A2 and group B (p = 0.022). Group A1 showed higher image noise (p = 0.005) but similar lesion conspicuity and overall image quality as compared with group B. The radiation dose in group A was 19% lower than that in group B (p = 0.022)., CONCLUSION: CT scanning with combined use of ATVS and ATCM and image reconstruction with SAFIRE algorithm provides higher lesion conspicuity and better image quality for evaluating small hepatic HCCs with radiation dose reduction.",Excluded

Data on disease control and toxicity were collected as well as patient and treatment characteristics. Acute (<6 mo) and late (>=6 mo) severe toxicity (grade >=3) were graded. Four patients were excluded due to the presence of metastatic disease or stage TX. Late toxicity data were available for 120 patients., RESULTS: Median cumulative IMRT dose was 51.25 Gy (median, 28 fractions). All but 2 patients received chemotherapy. With median follow-up of 26.8 months, local control at 3 years was 87%, worse for patients with T3-T4 than T1-T2 disease on univariate analysis (79% vs. 90%; P=0.04). Regional control, distant control, and overall survival were 97%, 91%, and 87%, respectively, at 3 years. Nodal status was associated with regional control, distant control, and overall survival (P<0.01 for each). Most common severe acute toxicity was hematologic (41%), skin (20%), and gastrointestinal tract (11%). Two grade 5 toxicities occurred (hematologic and gastrointestinal tract). Severe late toxicity affected skin (1%) and gastrointestinal tract (3%)., CONCLUSIONS: IMRT with chemotherapy resulted in excellent local control. Although T stage predicted worse local control, most T3-T4 disease was controlled with IMRT. Nodal status predicted regional and distant control and overall survival.

Overall, there was no significant difference in patient characteristics between those receiving sucralfate and those receiving placebo. Moderate or worse diarrhea was observed in 53% of patients receiving sucralfate versus 41% of those receiving placebo. Compared with patients receiving placebo, more sucralfate-treated patients reported fecal incontinence (16% v 34%, respectively; P = .04) and need for protective clothing (8% v 23%, respectively; P = .04). The incidence and severity of nausea were worse among those taking sucralfate (P = .03). Analysis of patient-reported symptoms 10 to 12 months after RT showed a nonsignificant trend toward more problems in patients taking sucralfate than in those taking placebo (average, 2.3 v 1.9 problems, respectively; P = .34). Conclusion(s): Sucralfate did not decrease pelvic RT-related bowel toxicity by any of the end points measured and seems to have aggravated some gastrointestinal symptoms.

1540,"Idiopathic pulmonary artery aneurysm: A case report of a rare disease INTRODUCTION: Pulmonary artery aneurysm (PAA) is defined as dilation of the proximal pulmonary artery or one of its branches. It is difficult to diagnose and often is an autopsy finding. It is classified as central, which arises from the main pulmonary artery, or peripheral, which arises from segmental or sub-segmental arteries. Pulmonary hypertension is an important risk factor for development and rupture of PAA. We present a case of idiopathic PAA which has remained stable for past 10 years. CASE PRESENTATION: A 32 year old male with a history of PAA presented to the ER with complaints of atypical chest pain. Physical exam findings and laboratory studies were unremarkable. Contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest revealed aneurysmal dilation of the right pulmonary artery with a clot in it. This was compared to multiple previous CT scans and did not show any changes. Review of past records revealed that 10 years ago, the patient was admitted for similar complaints, found to have a right hilar mass on X-ray and chest CT suspicious for neoplasm. Thoracotomy was done for biopsy and patient was found to have a 4x3 cm right PAA. Echocardiography showed normal pulmonary artery pressure. On this visit VQ scan was done which was negative for pulmonary embolism. Patient was discharged after 2 days with outpatient follow-up. DISCUSSION: PAA is a rare condition with an incidence of 1 in 14,000 autopsies. Unlike aortic aneurysm it has equal prevalence in both genders and occurs in younger patients. The likely pathology seems to be increased hemodynamic stresses combined with underlying vessel wall weakness. It is commonly associated with congenital heart defects (shunts, PDA or VSD), pulmonary artery hypertension and connective tissue disorders such as Marfan's syndrome and infections like syphilis and TB. It typically presents with hemoptysis, chest pain, cough and/or dyspnea but is also not infrequently discovered as an incidental finding. The advent of contrast-enhanced CT, MRI and echocardiograms have assumed a primary role in diagnosis. Complications may include pulmonary hypertension, thrombus formation, bronchial compression or aneurysmal rupture. Management is surgical coupled with treatment of the underlying disorders. CONCLUSION(S): Controversy still exists regarding indications for surgical management, with some pursuing conservative approach while others in favor of surgical intervention even in asymptomatic patients. One third of the patients die from rupture of the aneurysm emphasizing the need for follow up and prompt intervention if it enlarges or become symptomatic. Therefore, close follow-up is required.",Excluded
1438,"Investigating the role of FDG-PET/CT for preoperative lymph-node staging of bladder cancer: Our preliminary experience Introduction: In patients with nonmetastatic invasive bladder cancer (T2 or higher, M0) or recurrent high-risk non-muscle invasive disease (T1G3 with or without Tis, M0), locoregional lymph node metastasis is an important prognostic factor. The standard imaging modalities for staging (computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) have an accuracy range of 70-90% for lymph-node staging. Fluorine-18 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) has been approved for imaging in many malignancies but not for bladder cancer. This study investigated the value of FDGPET/ CT for preoperative lymph-node staging of patients with MIBC. We present our preliminary results. Patients and Methods: Between September 2012 and February 2013, 10 patients (8 male, 2 female) with bladder cancer underwent FDG-PET/CT and a thoraco-abdominal CT scan. Four patients were found to be recurrent T1G3 at TUR-B, five T2G3 and one T2G2. Independently from the results for lymphnode status at FDG-PET/CT or at abdominal CT scan, all patients underwent radical cystectomy and lymphadenectomy. Results of FDG-PET/CT and CT for N-staging were compared to histopathology findings. Complete data are available for 8 patients. Result(s): Among the 8 patients, 3 patients had metastatically involved locoregional lymph nodes, diagnosed on histopathology. In all these patients, the lymph-nodes demonstrated increased FDG uptake on PET/CT; the same nodes were not considered as metastatic at abdominal CT scan. Five patients had lymph-nodes with a normal FDG uptake on PET/CT: these nodes were found nonmetastatic at histopathology. Only 1 patient had nodes suspected for metastases at CT scan but not at FDGPET/CT: these lymphnodes were found nonmetastatic at histopathology. The accordance between histopathology and FDG-PET/CT findings was 100%. Discussion and Conclusion(s): Our preliminary data show that FDG-PET/CT may provide better accuracy in N-staging of bladder cancer; our study is still ongoing because a larger sample (at least 50-75 patients) is needed. According to our results and to data in the Literature, larger prospective studies are needed to elucidate the effective role of FDG-PET/CT in N-staging of bladder cancer.",Excluded
2369,"Immuno-PET Evaluation of In Vivo Therapeutic Resistance in Renal Cell Carcinoma Patient-Derived Xenografts Purpose/Objective(s): Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) resists conventional therapy, but is responsive to hypofractionated radiation (HRT) and immunotherapy. Furthermore, HRT might synergize with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Despite the synergy, the majority of patients progress alluding to therapeutic resistance. Adaptive resistance of increased programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in response to PD-1/L1 directed therapy as well as HRT has been reported. However, this mechanism has not been verified in real-time in vivo. Confirming this hypothesis will require multiple invasive biopsies of metastatic sites before and during therapy. Furthermore, due to inter- and intra-lesional heterogeneity of metastasis, variable degrees of temporal and spatial adaptive resistance not to be captured by biopsy can be expected. As a first step towards non-invasive real-time imaging of patients, here, we demonstrate the feasibility of immuno positron emission tomography (iPET) with 89Zr labeled anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) atezolizumab (ATZ) for demonstrating the dynamic changes in PD-L1 expression in vivo in response to HRT in RCC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models. Materials/Methods: ATZ was radiolabeled with 89Zr at specific activity of 2.2 mCi/mg after conjugation with deferoxamine (DFO) at a molar ratio of 1 ATZ:1.9 DFO. We ensured the mAb's immunoreactivity in the conjugate by Lindmo assay and tested its stability in rat serum. NOD/SCID mice with subcutaneous implantation of RCC PDX (baseline PD-L1 expression: 30-55%) were given tumor-targeted HRT (25 Gy, 1 fraction, n = 8) with control mice receiving sham irradiation. 3 hours later, mice received an IV injection of ~100 muCi of 89Zr-DFO-ATZ. PET/CT imaging was performed from day 2 to 6 post-injection (p.i.). Then, tumors were excised for immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis to verify PD-L1 expression. iPET imaging data analysis and IHC were blinded. Unpaired t test, one-tailed, assuming unequal variances was used for statistical analyses. Result(s): 89Zr-DFO-ATZ was radiolabeled with high (>95%) radiochemical purity and immunoreactivity (86.2 +/- 4%, n = 6) and was stable (>80%) for 6 days in serum at 37C. iPET showed a significantly higher mean tumor uptake of the antibody in irradiated mice (range: 4.0 - 6.4% ID/g) than in control mice (range: 3.8 - 4.8% ID/g) from days 2 to 6 p.i. (p < 0.05). IHC analyses showed that irradiated mice expressed higher PD-L1 (55 - 80%, n = 7; 30%, n = 1) than that in control mice (40 - 55%, n = 2; 75%, n = 1). PD-L1 expression by IHC in PDX tumors directly correlates with iPET signal on day 4 p.i (r = 76%, r-square = 0.57, p < 0.018). Conclusion(s): 89Zr-DFO-ATZ iPET demonstrates increased PD-L1 expression in vivo in response to HRT in RCC PDX. 89Zr-DFO-ATZ iPET is an effective tool for the non-invasive and real-time monitoring of therapy resistance that could find applications in patient selection, toxicity prediction and ICI therapy monitoring.

1742,"Diagnostic accuracy of 320-row multidetector computed tomography coronary angiography in the non-invasive evaluation of significant coronary artery disease Aims Multidetector computed tomography coronary angiography (CTA) has emerged as a feasible imaging modality for non-invasive assessment of coronary artery disease (CAD). Recently, 320-row CTA systems were introduced, with 16 cm anatomical coverage, allowing image acquisition of the entire heart within a single heart beat. The aim of the present study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of 320-row CTA in patients with known or suspected CAD. Methods and resultsA total of 64 patients (34 male, mean age 61 +/- 16 years) underwent CTA and invasive coronary angiography. All CTA scans were evaluated for the presence of obstructive coronary stenosis by a blinded expert, and results were compared with quantitative coronary angiography. Four patients were excluded from initial analysis due to non-diagnostic image quality. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values to detect >=50 luminal narrowing on a patient basis were 100, 88, 92, and 100, respectively. Moreover, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values to detect >=70 luminal narrowing on a patient basis were 94, 95, 88, and 98, respectively. With inclusion of non-diagnostic imaging studies, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values to detect >=50 luminal narrowing on a patient basis were 100, 81, 88, and 100, respectively.

2270,"[Lung nodule detection with ultra-low-dose CT in routine follow-up of cancer patients] PURPOSE: To evaluate the value of an ultra-low-dose CT protocol (ULD-CT) in the dectection of lungnodules in follow-up of cancer patients., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between April and August 2003, 72 consecutive patients with a history of malignancy were prospectively examined on a single-slice helical CT scanner (Aquilion, Toshiba) with ULD-CT (120 kV, 5 mAs, D-eff 0.12 mSv) and regular-dose CT (R-CT) (120 kV, 150 mAs, D-eff 4.8 mSv). The ULD-CT examinations were independently evaluated by two radiologists. Afterwards, consensus reading of the ULD-CT and R-CT examinations was done. Individual nodules were classified benign (benign calcifications) and non-benign. The studies were classified in 4 subgroups: 1) non-benign nodule evident; 2) non-benign nodule probable; 3) non-benign nodule possible, but not likely; 4) no-non benign nodule., RESULTS: ULD-CT detected 180 nodules in 47 patients, while R-CT showed 168 nodules in 39 patients. The sensitivity of ULD-CT was 87 % in detecting nodules regardless of size and 94 % in detecting nodules > or = 5 mm. Regarding the prediction of a case with non-benign nodules (subgroups 1 to 3), the sensitivity of ULD-CT was 94 % and the specificity 75 %., CONCLUSION: ULD-CT is a good diagnostic tool in detecting lung nodules > or = 5 mm. Radiation dose can be markedly reduced. A negative ULD-CT study excludes non-benign nodules in R-CT with a high probability. In case of a positive ULD-CT, R-CT can be immediately followed.",Excluded

Method(s): A cohort of 39 patients underwent VMAT employing a schedule consisting of 50.4Gy/28 fractions to the gross tumour volume (GTV) and 42Gy/28 fractions to the elective nodal volumes for patients with cT2N0 disease. Patients with cT3-T4/N0-N3 tumours were prescribed 54Gy/30 fractions to the GTV and 50.4Gy/30 fractions to the gross nodal volumes if sized #3cm or 54Gy/30 fractions if . 3cm. Elective nodal regions were given 45Gy/30 fractions. CT was administered concurrently following Nigro's regimen. The primary end point was acute toxicity. Secondary end points were colostomy-free survival (CFS), disease-free survival (DFS), cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS). Dosimetric data are also provided. Result(s): Median follow-up was 21 months. Maximum acute toxicities were: dermatologic-G3: 18%; gastrointestinal-G3: 5%; genitourinary-G3: 2%; anaemia-G2: 7%; leukopenia-G3: 28%; G4: 8%; neutropenia-G3: 13%; G4: 18%; thrombocytopenia-G3: 11%; and G4: 2%. The actuarial 2-year CFS was 77.9% [95% confidence interval (CI): 54-90.4%]. Actuarial 2-year OS and CSS were 85.2% (95% CI: 60.1-95.1%), while DFS was 75.1% (95% CI: 52.4.7-88.1%).

1722,"Vitamin D improves sunburns by increasing autophagy in M2 macrophages Cutaneous inflammation from UV radiation exposure causes epidermal damage, cellular infiltration, and secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators that exacerbate tissue destruction. Recovery is mediated chiefly by anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages that suppress inflammation and augment epidermal regeneration. Vitamin D enables anti-inflammation to promote tissue repair in response to injury. Since vitamin D enhances cellular macroautophagy/autophagy, we investigated the role of autophagy in vitamin D protection of UV-mediated sunburn and inflammation. Using a UV-mediated acute skin injury mouse model, we demonstrate that a single dose of vitamin D resolves injury with sustained inhibition of inflammatory cytokines associated with enhanced autophagy in myeloid anti-inflammatory M2 macs. Increased MAP1LC3B/LC3 expression corroborated with complete autolysosome formation detected by electron microscopy and correlated with degradation of SQSTM1/p62 in the skin following vitamin D treatment. Specifically, pharmacological inhibition of autophagy increased UV-induced apoptosis, suppressed M2 macs recruitment, and prevented vitamin D downregulation of Tnf and Mmp9 in the skin. Furthermore, selective deletion of autophagy in myeloid cells of atg7 cKO mice abrogated vitamin D-mediated protection and recapitulated UV-induced inflammation. Mechanistically, vitamin D signaling activated M2-autophagy regulators Klf4, Pparg, and Arg1. Lastly, analysis of UV-exposed human skin biopsies detected a similar increase in macrophage autophagy following vitamin D intervention, identifying an essential role for autophagy in vitamin D-mediated protection of skin from UV damage.

1478,"Advances in malignant peritoneal mesothelioma BACKGROUND: Malignant mesothelioma is a rare, insidious, and aggressive tumor arising from the mesothelial surface of pleural and peritoneal cavities, the pericardium, or the tunica vaginalis, with an increasing incidence worldwide, high misdiagnosis rate, and overall negative prognosis. A total of 20% of all cases is peritoneum in origin., METHODS: The present study is a review of literatures focusing on the advances in epidemiology, clinical presentations, radiological features, diagnosis, misdiagnosis, management, and prognostic factors of malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (MPM) occurred in the past decades., RESULTS: Asbestos, SV40, and radiation exposures have been demonstrated to be correlated with the pathogenesis of MPM. The main presentations are abdominal distension and pain. Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron-emission tomography (PET) play an important role in the preoperative imaging and staging. Definitive diagnosis is made on the basis of immunohistochemistry. Prognostic factors have been identified and verified. Negative indicators include advanced age, male gender, poor performance status, non-epithelial histology, and absence of surgery. The management of MPM has evolved from single chemotherapy to multimodality treatment of cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy. Promising results have been achieved after a combined treatment of CRS and HIPEC, with an elevated median survival time of 29.5-92 months and a 5-year survival rate of 39-63%., CONCLUSIONS: CRS and HIPEC represent the standard treatment strategy for selected patients with MPM, and patients with unresectable tumors can benefit from the combined treatment of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy.",Excluded

Image data were statistically reviewed focusing on original image quality demonstrated by image-quality scores and signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios; and perfusion parameters including perfusion (PF, in ml/min/ml), peak enhanced density (PED, in HU), time to peak (TTP, in seconds) and blood volume (BV, in ml/100 g) for the tumour. To test the interobserver agreement of perfusion measurements, perfusion analyses were repeatedly performed., RESULTS: Original image-quality scores were 4.71+/-0.49 whereas S/N ratios were 5.21+/-2.05, and the scores were correlated with the S/N ratios (r=0.465, p<0.0001). Mean values for PF, PED, TTP and BV of the tumour were 33.27+/-24.15 ml/min/ml, 24.06+/-9.87 HU, 29.42+/-8.61 s, and 12.45+/-12.22 ml/100 g, respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficient between the replicated measurements of each perfusion parameter was greater than 0.99, and mean difference of the replicated measurements of each parameter was close to zero., CONCLUSION: Whole tumour first-pass perfusion with 64-section MDCT at low-dose radiation could be reproducible to assess microcirculation in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma without compromising subjective original image quality of the tumour.

1855,"Uninterrupted moderately accelerated radiotherapy in the treatment of unresectable/advanced head and neck cancer: one institution's experience and a comparative review Conventional radiotherapy alone in treatment of unresectable or locally advanced head and neck cancer has poor results. To improve outcome without significant increase in acute and late morbidity, we began a moderately accelerated hyperfractionation radiation therapy protocol without breaks for treatment of unresectable/advanced head and neck malignancies. From August 1984 to June 1995, 48 patients with unresectable or advanced carcinoma of the head and neck were treated using a protocol of accelerated hyperfractionation radiation therapy at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center, Los Angeles. Patients were treated twice a day using 150 cGy per fraction, 4 days per week, to a final dose of 60 Gy. Two patients were excluded from this analysis because they did not complete treatment. With a median follow-up of 33 months, 31 (67%) patients have had disease recurrence, 30 (65%) of whom had a locoregional component to their failures. At the last follow-up, 12 patients (26%) were alive with no evidence of disease, 30 patients had died of disease, and 4 had died of intercurrent disease without recurrence. Nine (19%) patients required treatment interruptions averaging 8 days in duration. This accelerated regimen resulted in outcomes similar to those with conventional radiotherapy, most likely because of a conservative total dose. Further refinement of fractionation schedules with potential incorporation of chemotherapy must be investigated.",Excluded
2268,"Celecoxib and radioresistant glioblastoma-derived CD133+ cells: Improvement in radiotherapeutic effects. Laboratory investigation Object. Glioblastoma, the most common primary brain tumor, has a poor prognosis, even with aggressive resection and chemoradiotherapy. Recent studies indicate that CD133+ cells play a key role in radioresistance and recurrence of glioblastoma. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which converts arachidonic acid to prostaglandins, is overexpressed in a variety of tumors, including CD133+ glioblastomas. The COX-2-derived prostaglandins promote neovascularization during tumor development, and conventional radiotherapy increases the proportion of CD133+ cells rather than eradicating them. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, in enhancing the therapeutic effects of radiation on CD133+ glioblastomas. Methods. Cells positive for CD133 were isolated from glioblastoma specimens and characterized by flow cytometry, then treated with celecoxib and/or ionizing radiation (IR). Clonogenic assay, cell irradiation, cell cycle analysis, Western blot, and xenotransplantation were used to assess the effects of celecoxib alone, IR alone, and IR with celecoxib on CD133+ and CD133- glioblastoma cells. Three separate xenotransplantation experiments were carried out using 310 severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice: 1) an initial tumorigenicity evaluation in which 3 different quantities of untreated CD133- cells or untreated or pretreated CD133+ cells (5 treatment conditions) from 7 different tumors were injected into the striatum of 2 mice (210 mice total); 2) a tumor growth study (50 mice); and 3) a survival study (50 mice). For these last 2 studies the same 5 categories of cells were used as in the tumorigenicity (untreated CD133 - cells, untreated or pretreated CD133+ cells, with pretreatment consisting of celecoxib alone, IR alone, or IR and celecoxib), but only 1 cell source (Case 2) and quantity (5 x 104 cells) were used. Results. High levels of COX-2 protein were detected in the CD133 + but not the CD133- glioblastoma cells. The authors further demonstrated that 30 mM celecoxib was able to effectively enhance the IR effect in inhibiting colony formation and increasing IR-mediated apoptosis in celecoxib-treated CD133+ glioblastoma cells. Furthermore, reduction in radioresistance was correlated with the induction of G2/M arrest, which was partially mediated through the increase in the level of phosphorylated-cdc2. In vivo xenotransplant analysis further confirmed that CD133+-associated tumorigenicity was significantly suppressed by celecoxib treatment. Importantly, pretreatment of CD133+ glioblastoma cells with a combination of celecoxib and IR before injection into the striatum of SCID mice resulted in a statistically significant reduction in tumor growth and a statistically significant increase in the mean survival rate of the mice. Conclusions. Celecoxib combined with radiation plays a critical role in the suppression of growth of CD133+ glioblastoma stemlike cells. Celecoxib is therefore a radiosensitizing drug for clinical application in glioblastoma.",Excluded

Materials and methods Data from 37 patients with cervical lymph node involvement were used. All patients originally received chemotherapy followed by 3DCRT-INRT (30.6 Gy). A VMAT-INRT, PT-INRT (both 30.6 Gy), and a MF plan (36 Gy) were simulated. Doses to head and neck OARs were compared with cumulative DVHs and repeated measures ANOVA. Results The estimated median mean doses were 15.3, 19.3, 15.4, and 37.3 Gy (thyroid), 10.9, 12.0, 7.9, and 34.5 Gy (neck muscles), 2.3, 11.1, 1.8, and 37.1 Gy (larynx), 1.7, 5.1, 1.3, and 23.8 Gy (pharynx), 0.5, 0.8, 0.01, and 32.3 Gy (ipsilateral parotid), and 2.4, 3.8, 0.7, and 34.7 Gy (ipsilateral submandibular) with 3DCRT, VMAT, PT, and MF (all p < 0.0001), respectively. Conclusion The use of INRT significantly lowered the estimated radiation dose to the head and neck OARs. VMAT appeared suboptimal compared to 3DCRT and PT, and for some patients, PT offered an additional gain. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1945,"Left ventricular noncompaction diagnosed by cardiac computed tomography Introduction: Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is characterized by a 2-layered myocardium composed of a noncompacted (NC) and a compacted (C) layer. The endsystolic NC:C ratio measured by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) has been established as a major diagnostic criterion; however, it is not easy to apply in all patients. Cardiac computed tomography (CCT) might provide an added value, but limited diagnostic criteria are available. Method(s): TTE and prospective ECG-triggered CCT were performed in 17 patients with previously diagnosed LVNC and in 19 healthy controls (Fig 1) and segmental analysis was performed. In TTE, each segment was analysed in parasternal short axis view and maximal thickness of NC and C was measured in the segment with most prominent recesses/trabeculations during enddiastole and endsystole. In CCT maximal thickness of NC and C was measured in each segment during enddiastole (75% of R-R interval). Segmental CCT NC:C ratio was calculated and compared between LVNC and control. Spearman's correlation coefficient was calculated between TTE and CCT segmental ratios. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to validate cut-off values for distinguishing LVNC from control on a per-segment and a per-patient basis. Result(s): The median [IQR] radiation dose for CCT was 1.3 [1.2-1.5]mSv. The CCT segmental median [IQR] thickness of the C layer was significantly lower in patients with LVNC compared to controls: inferolateral-midventricular (7.8 [6.8-9.8] vs 8.8 [7.8-9.5]mm), lateral- (6.2 [5.9-8.0] vs 8.3 [7.5-9.3] mm), inferior- (6.3 [5.7-6.7] vs 7.8 [6.9-8.4]mm), and septal-apical (6.9 [6.0-7.5] vs 7.9 [7.2-8.8] mm). The median CCT NC:C ratio differed between control and LVNC in the inferior-midventricular and in all apical segments (p< 0.05; Fig 2A). The infero-apical segment was that with most prominent recesses/trabeculations in both TTE (72%) and CCT (44%) (Fig 2B). NC:C ratio correlated significantly between CCT and TTE (both at enddiastole (=0.8) and endsystole (=0.9)). A CCT NC:C ratio of >1.7 distinguished LVNC with a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 96, 99, 95, and 100% on segmental analysis (Fig 2C). Using this cut-off value, all LVNC patients could be identified (Fig 2D). Conclusion(s): LVNC can be diagnosed with ECG-triggered low-dose CCT using a NC:C ratio of 1.7 in enddiastole with an excellent accuracy. There is an excellent correlation between TTE and CCT NC:C ratio. (Figure Presented) .",Excluded
1852,"Femoral artery dopplerfluxometry of adult healthy dogs (canis lupus familiaris) Background: In Veterinary Medicine, there are several methods for early and accurate assessment of blood flow dynamics. The Dopplerfluxometry can access the peak systolic velocity, mean velocity and end diastolic velocity, including Resistive Index and Pulsatility Index. Normal values of Dopplerfluxometry in healthy dogs allow the identification of vascular abnormalities and authors' knowledge there are no reference regarding the values of Dopplerfluxometry of the femoral artery in healthy dogs. The aim of the study was to assess the femoral Dopplerfluxometry of adult healthy dogs by Resistive Index, Pulsatility Index, systolic and diastolic velocities, and femoral artery diameter. Materials, Methods & Results: Eighteen healthy intact beagle dogs, male and female, aging from 2 to 4 years old (mean +/- SD: mean 3 +/- 0.8 years), weighing from 10.1-17.9 kg [22.3-39.5 lb] [mean +/- SD: 14.3 +/- 2.7 kg (31.5 +/- 5.96 lb)] were used. The dogs underwent to physical examination, complete blood cell count, serum biochemistry examination urinalysis, and radiographs examination, muscular and cardiac evaluation. Females had to be in anestrous. All dogs were submitted to right femoral artery Dopplerfluxometry. The dogs were positioned in dorsal recumbency by one person without any chemical restraint. A high definition ultrasound device equipped with a 3 - 13 MHz multi-frequency linear transducer was used. The right femoral artery was identified with the transducer positioned transversely on the right triangle femoral area. Peak systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity was measured. The Resistivity Index and Pulsatility Index were calculated automatically by the ultrasound machine software. Three measurements were obtained with the Doppler spectrum. The values of peak systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity, Resistivity Index, Pulsatility Index and femoral artery diameter were expressed as Mean +/- Standard Deviation (SD). Discussion(s): No studies regarding to femoral artery Dopplerfluxometry in healthy dogs were found in the literature. These results can be used as normal reference values of Dopplerfluxometric parameters for adult dogs. The literature cited only Dopplerfluxometric values of renal arteries, abdominal aorta and of the internal thoracic artery. The normal values of arterial Dopplerfluxometry is necessary to identify the spectral quantitative characteristics of the blood flow for diagnosis and prognosis of vascular diseases. Authors referred to changes in blood perfusion by Dopplerfluxometry examination, but no changes in B-mode ultrasonography. The femoral Resistivity Index values can be used to correlate the postoperative evolution in dogs submitted to femoral bone, hip and knee surgeries, since Dopplerfluxometry allows blood flow assessment in the femoral region muscles. Changes in the heart rate, blood pressure, stress, exercise, and diseases as hypotension, renal lesion, hepatic diseases, diabetes, hyperadrenocorticism can change the Dopplerfluxometric parameters. All dogs which used in this study were clinically healthy, and were used beagle dogs due to lowest variations within breed. Sedation was avoid due to possible changes in Dopplerfluxometric parameters since the use of sedation or tranquilization in animals is strongly discussed due to possible hemodynamic changes that may occur during the examination. In conclusion, the mean values of the right femoral artery Dopplerfluxometry in male and female adult healthy dogs is Resistivity Index (0.887); Pulsatility Index (1.599); peak systolic velocity (124.41 cm/s), end-diastolic velocity (14.12 cm/s), femoral artery diameter (3.9 mm).Copyright © 2018 Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul.

1307,"Combined stent insertion and single high-dose brachytherapy in patients with advanced esophageal cancer - results of a prospective safety study Previous randomized studies comparing the two commonly used palliative treatments for incurable esophageal cancer, i.e. stent insertion and intraluminal brachytherapy, have revealed the pros and cons of each therapy. While stent treatment offers a more prompt effect, brachytherapy results in more long-lasting relief of dysphagia and a better health-related quality of life (HRQL) in those living longer. This prospective pilot study aimed to explore the feasibility and safety of combining these two regimes and incorporating a single high dose of internal radiation. Patients with newly diagnosed, incurable cancer of the esophagus and dysphagia were eligible for inclusion, and stent insertion followed by a single dose (12Gy) of brachytherapy was performed as a two-stage procedure. Clinical parameters including HRQL and adverse events were registered at inclusion, and 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months later. Twelve patients (nine males) with a median age of 73 years (range 54-85) were included. Stent insertion followed by a single dose of brachytherapy was successfully performed in all but one patient who was treated with stent only. Relief of dysphagia was achieved in the majority of cases (10/11, P < 0.05), but HRQL did not improve except for dysphagia-related items. Only minor adverse events, including chest pain, reflux, and restenosis, were reported. The median survival time after inclusion was 6.6 months. Our conclusion is that the combination of stent insertion and single high-dose brachytherapy seems to be a feasible and safe palliative regime in patients with advanced esophageal cancer. Randomized trials comparing the efficacy of this strategy to stent insertion or brachytherapy alone are warranted. © 2011, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the International Society for Diseases of the Esophagus.",Excluded
1375,"Increased oxidative stress in barn swallows from the Chernobyl region The Chernobyl nuclear accident produced the largest unintended release of radionuclides in history, with dramatic consequences for humans and other organisms. Exposure to ionizing radiation is known to reduce circulating and stored levels of specific antioxidants in birds and humans, thus potentially increasing oxidative stress. However, overall effects of radioactive exposure on oxidative status have never been investigated in any free ranging vertebrate. We measured plasma antioxidant capacity and concentration of reactive oxygen metabolites in adult barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) from colonies with variable background radiation levels in the Chernobyl region in Ukraine and Belarus. We predicted that antioxidants would decrease while reactive oxygen metabolites would increase with exposure to increasing levels of radiation at the breeding sites. Consistent with this expectation, radiation level positively predicted plasma concentration of reactive oxygen metabolites, whereas no significant covariation was found with non-enzymatic plasma antioxidant capacity. An index of oxidative stress was also larger in barn swallows exposed to high contamination levels. Thus, radioactive contamination appeared to be responsible for the increased generation of reactive oxygen metabolites and the imbalance between reactive oxygen metabolites and non-enzymatic plasma antioxidant capacity. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

1430,"Severe combined immunodeficiency and microcephaly in siblings with hypomorphic mutations in DNA ligase IV DNA double-strand breaks (dsb) during V(D)J recombination of T and B lymphocyte receptor genes are resolved by the non-homologous DNA end joining pathway (NHEJ) including at least six factors: Ku70, Ku80, DNA-PK(cs), Artemis, Xrcc4, and DNA ligase IV (Lig4). Artemis and Lig4 are the only known V(D)J/NHEJ factors found deficient in human genetic disorders. Null mutations of the Artemis gene result in a complete absence of T and B lymphocytes and increased cellular sensitivity to ionizing radiations, causing radiosensitive-SCID. Mutations of Lig4 are exclusively hypomorphic and have only been described in six patients, four exhibiting mild immunodeficiency associated with microcephaly and developmental delay, while two patient had leukemia. Here we report a SCID associated with microcephaly caused by compound heterozygous hypomorphic mutations in Lig4. Residual activity of Lig4 in these patients is underscored by a normal pattern of TCR-alpha and -beta junctions in the T cells of the patients and a moderate impairment of V(D)J recombination as tested in vitro. These observations contrast with the severity of the clinical immunodeficiency, suggesting that Lig4 may have additional critical roles in lymphocyte survival beyond V(D)J recombination.",Excluded
1268,"Dual-source versus 64-section CT coronary angiography at lower heart rates: comparison of accuracy and radiation dose PURPOSE: To compare the diagnostic performance and radiation doses of dual-source and 64-section computed tomographic (CT) coronary angiography for the diagnosis of significant coronary stenoses in patients with heart rates of 65 beats/min or less., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study had local ethics committee approval; all patients gave written informed consent. Two hundred patients with heart rates of 65 beats/min or less were enrolled; 100 underwent dual-source and 100 underwent 64-section CT coronary angiography. Two blinded observers independently assessed image quality of all coronary segments by using a four-point scale and searched for significant (>50%) stenoses in each segment. Catheter angiography was used as the reference standard. Image noise was measured in the ascending aorta. Radiation doses were calculated., RESULTS: No significant differences were found regarding sex, age, body weight, cardiovascular risk profile, prevalence of stenosis, mean and variability of heart rate, Agatston score, and image noise (all P > .1) between patients in both CT coronary angiography groups. No significant difference was found in the rate of nonassessable coronary segments between dual-source (1.0%, 14 of 1405) and 64-section CT coronary angiography (1.8%, 25 of 1387; P = .08). Motion artifacts occurred significantly more often in 64-section (21 of 25) versus dual-source (five of 14, P = .004) CT coronary angiography. Segment-based accuracy and specificity were significantly higher for dual-source versus 64-section CT coronary angiography. There was no significant difference in accuracy parameters at the per-vessel and per-patient analyses. No significant difference (P = .13) was found between the effective doses of dual-source (mean +/- standard deviation, 10.9 mSv +/- 1.1) and 64-section CT (10.4 mSv +/- 1.7) coronary angiography., CONCLUSION: In patients with heart rates of 65 beats/min or less, the higher temporal resolution of dual-source CT coronary angiography results in improved accuracy and specificity for the diagnosis of significant stenoses on a per-segment level at a similar radiation dose, but provides a comparable diagnostic accuracy on a patient-based level as does 64-section coronary angiography.",Excluded
1764,"Evaluation and definitive management of medically inoperable early stage non-small-cell lung cancer. Part 2: newer treatment modalities Lung cancer is estimated to be the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in both men and women in 2006, and the leading causes of cancer mortality. Non-small-cell lung cancer represents the majority of such cases. Most of these patients have locally advanced disease at presentation and are not eligible for curative resection. For the minority of patients who are technically resectable at presentation, lobectomy or pneumonectomy and pathologic mediastinal nodal staging offer the best overall survival. The high rate of comorbid medical illness and poor baseline pulmonary function in this population, however, make many such early-stage patients medically inoperable. For these patients, conventional single-modality radiotherapy has been the primary definitive treatment option, as discussed in part 1 of this article, which appeared in last month's issue. Numerous retrospective reports demonstrate long-term disease-free and overall survival data that are modestly superior to that expected after observation, but both local and distant failure continue to be significant risks. Investigation of radiotherapy dose escalation is ongoing, in an effort to improve local control while maintaining minimal toxicity. Additionally, emerging evidence suggests that new modalities, such as stereotactic radiosurgery and radiofrequency ablation, may also be potentially curative treatment alternatives. These modalities are addressed in part 2.",Excluded
1671,"Three-dimensional structures of avian beta-microseminoproteins: insight from the chicken egg-specific beta-microseminoprotein 3 paralog Beta-microseminoproteins (MSMBs) are small disulfide-rich proteins that are conserved among vertebrates. These proteins exhibit diverse biological activities and were mainly reported to play a role in male fertility, immunity, and embryogenesis. In this work, we focused on the chicken MSMB3 protein that was previously depicted as an egg antibacterial protein. We report that MSMB3 protein is exclusively expressed in the reproductive tissues of laying hens (in contrast to chicken MSMB1 and MSMB2 paralogs), to be incorporated in the egg white during the process of egg formation. We also showed that chicken MSMB3 possesses highly conserved orthologs in bird species, including Neognathae and Palaeognathae. Chicken MSMB3 was purified from egg white using heparin affinity chromatography and was analyzed by top-down and bottom-up proteomics. Several proteoforms could be characterized, and a homodimer was further evidenced by NMR spectroscopy. The X-ray structure of chicken MSMB3 was solved for the first time, revealing that this protein adopts a novel dimeric arrangement. The highly cationic MSMB3 protein exhibits a distinct electrostatic distribution compared with chicken MSMB1 and MSMB2 structural models, and with published mammalian MSMB structures. The specific incorporation of MSMB3 paralog in the egg, and its phylogenetic conservation in birds together with its peculiar homodimer arrangement and physicochemical properties, suggests that the MSMB3 protein has evolved to play a critical role during the embryonic development of avian species. These new data are likely to stimulate research to elucidate the structure/function relationships of MSMB paralogs and orthologs in the animal kingdom.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

Premalignant skin lesions are seen very much earlier in white skinned populations exposed to excessive sunlight, and over time these same individuals develop larger numbers of all of the three major skin cancers than individuals who do not experience excessive UV exposure. These three skin cancers are squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), basal cell carcinoma (BCC), and malignant melanoma. In the case of SCC the major aetiological pattern is chronic long-term exposure, but for BCCs the pattern appears to be slightly different with short-term burning episodes being more important. In the case of melanomas, there is evidence that for the 4 main types of melanomas, the pattern of excess UV exposure which is most injurious varies. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

1528,"Comparison of the clinical outcomes of percutaneous vertebroplasty vs. kyphoplasty for the treatment of osteoporotic Kummell's disease:a prospective cohort study BACKGROUND: Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) and percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) are widely used in the treatment of Kummell's disease. The purpose of this article is to investigate the clinical efficacy of PVP and PKP for Kummell's disease., METHODS: The clinical data that 56 cases of Kummell's disease treated with either PVP (28 cases) or PKP (28 cases) from December 2015 to December 2017 were prospectively analyzed. Gender, age, course of disease, injury segment, bone mineral density (BMD), visual analogue scale (VAS), Oswestry disability index (ODI), imaging measurement indexes before surgery between the two groups showed no significant difference (all P > 0.05). The bone cement leakage rate, bone cement injection amount, operation time, VAS, ODI, the rate of vertebral compression, correction rate of kyphosis and refracture rate of adjacent vertebra in 2 years were compared between the two groups to calculate clinical efficacy., RESULTS: The two groups were followed up for 24-48 months. There was no significant difference in the follow-up time, amount of bone cement injected, incidence of bone cement leakage and refracture rate of adjacent vertebrae between the two groups (all P > 0.05). The operation time, intraoperative blood loss and fluoroscopy times of the PVP group were significantly lower than those of the PKP group (all P = 0.000). VAS score and ODI of the two groups were significantly lower at 1 day, 1 year and 2 years after surgery than before surgery (all P < 0.05), but there was not statistically significant difference between the two groups at each time point after surgery (all P > 0.05). The rate of vertebral compression and kyphosis correction in the two groups were significantly corrected (P < 0.05, respectively) and decreased significantly with time (all P < 0.05), But there was not significant difference between the two groups at any time point (all P > 0.05)., CONCLUSION: Both PVP and PKP can achieve similar effects in the treatment of Kummell's disease. Because the cost, operation time, blood loss, radiation exposure and surgical procedure of PVP are less than those of PKP, PVP has more clinical priority value.",Excluded

1871,"Pathologic response prediction and neoadjuvant rectal score evaluation in patients with rectal cancer Aim: In this study, we aimed to evaluate the factors of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) affecting the pathologic response in locally advanced rectal cancer. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 80 rectal cancer patients undergoing nCRT were included in the study to investigate clinical and pathological factors associated with tumor regression grade. Neoadjuvant rectal scoring (NAR) was calculated to predict overall survival. Result(s): Thirteen patients (16%) were detected to have pathologic complete response (pCR) and 24 patients (30%) as pathologic poor response (pPR). Tumor size in pCR group was smaller than the in other groups (p=0.003). Distal tumor localization and clinical complete response (cCR) were associated with pCR (p=0.007, p<0.005 respectively). Higher rates of pPR were observed in patients with residual tumours (cPR) (p=0.007). The factors correlated to low NAR were distal tumor localization, pathologically negative lymph nodes, cCR, and pCR (p=0.003, p=0.017, p<0.005, p<0.005 respectively). Statistically significant correlations were identified between high NAR and PET-CT stage III disease (p=0.03), pathologic lymph node metastasis (p<0.005) and cPR (p=0.007). Discussion(s): Clinical and pathologic factors are correlated with tumour regression grade and 5-year overall survival expectancy. Studies with larger sample sizes are needed to better elucidate these groups of patients and develop more effective treatments.Copyright © 2019, Derman Medical Publishing.

2345,"Derivation and validation of the Asian ureteral stent length guide Background and objectives Choice of stent length remains subjective despite the maturity of the procedure and incorrect stent length adversely affects quality of life. We aim to determine the ureteral length of the Malaysian population using CT measurement and to derive an ideal stent length guide based on body height. Materials and methods Phase-1 enrolled 118 patients. Bilateral ureteral lengths were measured by CT scan from the level of the renal vein to VUJ. They were grouped according to body height and median length for each were obtained. Phase-2 was a prospective randomisedtrial involving 60 patients undergoing ureteral stenting. 6F Double-J stents were used and choice of length in Group A was based on the devised guide; and using intraoperative ureteral length measurement with 5F catheter in Group B. Fluoroscopy time was recorded. Intravesical position of stent was determined by postoperative X-ray. USSQ score, were analysed two-weeks postoperatively. Results The median right and left ureteral length for male patients were 20.9 cm (18-27) and 21.3 cm (17-27); for female patients they were 20.7 cm (16-24) and 22.0 (17-25) respectively. Phase one concluded that double-J stents of 22 cm in length were suitable for all but men >=170 cm and women >=160 cm where a 24 cm stent is more appropriate. In Phase-2, median age was 49 (17-71) and median height of male and female patients were 165 cm (152-175) and 149 cm (140- 172) respectively. Fluoroscopy time is significantly shorter in Group A (3.03 vs 6.43 s, P = 0.001) and incidence of the distal loop crossing the midline was lower (0 vs 11, P < 0.001). Total USSQ score was better in Group A (60 vs 83, P = 0.001) particularly in urinary symptoms (P = 0.004) and pain (P < 0.001) subdomains. Stent migration was not encountered in both groups. Conclusion The devised ideal ureteral stent length guide for Malaysian adults is reliable, reduces procedural fluoroscopy time and curtails the incidence of post-procedural stent-related symptoms.",Excluded
1655,"Prospective evaluation of early treatment outcome in patients with meningiomas treated with particle therapy based on target volume definition with MRI and 68Ga-DOTATOC-PET Purpose. To evaluate early treatment results and toxicity in patients with meningiomas treated with particle therapy. Material and methods. Seventy patients with meningiomas were treated with protons (n = 38) or carbon ion radiotherapy (n = 26). Median age was 49 years. Median age at treatment was 55 years, 24 were male (34%), and 46 were female (66%). Histology was benign meningioma in 26 patients (37%), atypical in 23 patients (33%) and anaplastic in four patients (6%). In 17 patients (24%) with skull base meningiomas diagnosis was based on the typical appearance of a meningioma. For benign meningiomas, total doses of 52.2-57.6 GyE were applied with protons. For high-grade lesions, the boost volume was 18 GyE carbon ions, with a median dose of 50 GyE applied as highly conformal radiation therapy. Nineteen patients were treated as re-irradiation. Treatment planning with MRI and 68-Ga-DOTATOC-PET was evaluated. Results. Very low rates of side effects developed, including headaches, nausea and dizziness. No severe treatment-related toxicity was observed. Local control for benign meningiomas was 100%. Five of 27 patients (19%) developed tumor recurrence during follow-up. Of these, four patients had been treated as re-irradiation for recurrent high-risk meningiomas. Actuarial local control after re-irradiation of high-risk meningiomas was therefore 67% at six and 12 months. In patients treated with primary radiotherapy, only one of 13 patients (8%) developed tumor recurrence 17 months after radiation therapy (photon and carbon ion boost). Conclusion. Continuous prospective follow-up and development of novel study concepts are required to fully exploit the long-term clinical data after particle therapy for meningiomas. To date, it may be concluded that when proton therapy is available, meningioma patients can be offered a treatment at least comparable to high-end photon therapy.Copyright © 2013 Informa Healthcare.",Excluded

Method(s): Single-center registry of coronary CTA in consecutive ED patients with suspicion of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The primary outcome was efficiency of coronary CTA defined as the length of hospitalization. Secondary endpoints of safety were defined as the rate of downstream testing, normalcy rates of invasive coronary angiography (ICA), absence of missed ACS, and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) during follow-up, and index radiation exposure. Result(s): One thousand twenty two consecutive patients were referred for clinical coronary CTA with suspicion of ACS. Overall, median time to discharge home was 10.5 (5.7-24.1) hours. Patient disposition was 42.7 % direct discharge from the ED, 43.2 % discharge from emergency unit, and 14.1 % hospital admission. ACS rate during index hospitalization was 9.1 %. One hundred ninety two patients underwent additional diagnostic imaging and 77 underwent ICA. The positive predictive value of CTA compared to ICA was 78.9 % (95 %-CI 68.1-87.5 %). Median CT radiation exposure was 4.0 (2.5-5.8) mSv. No ACS was missed; MACE at follow-up after negative CTA was 0.2 %. Conclusion(s): Coronary CTA in an experienced tertiary care setting allows for efficient and safe management of patients with suspicion for ACS. Key points: * ED Coronary CTA using advanced systems is associated with low radiation exposure. * Negative coronary CTA is associated with low rates of MACE. * CTA in ED patients enables short median time to discharge home. * CTA strategy is characterized by few downstream tests including unnecessary ICA.Copyright © 2016, European Society of Radiology.",Excluded
1521,"Fragility fracture and osteoarthritis: Interaction between bone mineral and bone mass index Increased bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mass index (BMI) are associate with increased risk of osteoarthritis (OA) and reduced risk of fragility fracture. However, little is known about the relationship between fragility fracture and osteoarthritis. In this study, we sought to examine the interactions between BMD and BMI in the determination of the OA-fracture relationship. The study was part of the on-going Dubbo Osteoporosis Epidemiology Study, which involved 2,412 women and 1,452 men aged between 46 to 99 years. The individuals had been followed up for a median of 7 years (range: 0.1 to 21 years). Baseline BMD was measured at femoral neck (FNBMD) and lumbar spine (LSBMD) by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (GE-Lunar, Madison, WI). Osteoarthritis was ascertained by self-report. The incidence of fragility fracture was ascertained by X-ray report during the follow-up period. In addition, data concerning demographic characteristics, clinical history, and lifestyle factors were obtained by a structured questionnaire. A total of 1,077 participants (691 women and 386 men) had reported a diagnosis of OA. Overall, the risk of OA was associated significantly with increased LSBMD in men (odds ratio [OR] 1.34, 95%CI, 1.19-1.52) and women (1.20; 1.09-1.32). Elevation in FNBMD was significantly associated with increased risk of OA in men (OR 1.16; 1.02-1.32), but not in women. When stratified by BMI, significant association remained between OA risk and high LSBMD amongst women with BMI < 25kg/m2 (OR 1.26; 1.07-1.47) and BMI >30kg/m2 (1.26; 1.05-1.51); and in men with BMI < 25kg/m2 (OR 1.75; 1.37-2.27) or BMI 25-30kg/m2 (1.21; 1.02-1.43). OA was associated with an increased risk of fracture. After adjusting for LSBMD women with OA had significant increased fracture risk (1.41; 1.16-1.72); however, the association was not significant in men (OR 0.96; 0.69-1.32). Moreover, the association between OA and fracture risk was particularly pronounced in women with BMI 25-30kg/m2 (OR 1.45; 1.05-1.99, adjusted for LSBMD).These data suggest that high BMD is associated with a greater risk of OA in both men and women, particularly those with low BMI. The results also suggest that BMD could be a useful measure for identifying individuals at high risk of OA, particularly among those at lower BMI spectrum. Despite having higher bone density, women with self-reported OA, especially those overweight, have an increased risk of fragility fracture, suggesting that the OA-fracture association is mediated via non-BMD factors.",Excluded

We report on outcome after fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT) in correlation with patient-reported outcomes (PROs). We analyzed 69 patients treated between 2000 and 2019. FSRT was delivered with a median total dose of 54 Gy (single fraction: 1.8 Gy). PRO questionnaires were sent to 28 patients. Median overall survival was 17.2 years; mean local control was 15.6 years (median not reached). Median follow-up was 5.8 years. Twenty (71%) patients participated in the PRO assessment. Physicians reported symptoms grade >=3 in 6 cases (9%). Of all, 35 (51%) patients suffered from hypopituitarism at baseline, and during follow-up, new or progressive hypopituitarism was observed in 11 cases (16%). Patients reported 10 cases of severe side effects. Most of these symptoms were already graded as CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) grade 2 by a physician in a previous follow-up exam. PROs are an essential measure and only correlate to a certain extent with the physician-reported outcomes. For high-precision radiotherapy of pituitary adenomas, they confirm excellent overall outcomes and low toxicity. In the future, the integration of PROs paired with high-end treatment will further improve outcomes.Copyright © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Excluded
2133,"Curvature in the cancer mortality dose response in Japanese atomic bomb survivors: absence of evidence of threshold PURPOSES: To investigate the evidence for a threshold in the cancer dose-response curve., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Japanese atomic bomb survivor cancer mortality data, based on follow-up to 1990, was used, taking account of random errors in DS86 dose estimates., RESULTS: For all solid cancers analysed together, there is a significant positive dose response (two-sided p<0.05) if all survivors who received <0.5 Sv are considered, but the significance vanishes if doses of <0.2 Sv are considered; the same is also true for leukaemia. For solid cancer mortality there is no indication of curvilinearity in the dose response: no statistically significant improvement in fit to a linear relative risk model is provided by addition of quadratic or threshold dose terms. If a relative risk model with a threshold (the dose response is assumed linear above the threshold) is fitted to solid cancer mortality data, the best estimate of the threshold is < 0.00 Sv (95% CI <0.00-0.13). If a linear-quadratic-threshold model is used the best estimate of the threshold is < 0.00 Sv (95% CI < 0.00-0.15). For leukaemia mortality there is highly statistically significant upward curvature in the dose response. In particular, if a relative risk model with a threshold (the dose response is assumed linear above the threshold) is fitted to the leukaemia data, the best estimate of the threshold is 0.16 Sv (95% CI 0.05-0.40) (two-sided p=0.001 for test of departure of threshold from 0). However, there is no evidence for a threshold effect (two-sided p = 0.16) when a quadratic term is included in the dose response: the best estimate of threshold in this case is 0.09Sv (95% CI <0.00-0.29). Moreover, addition of a quadratic term improves the fit of a linear-threshold model at borderline levels of statistical significance (two-sided p = 0.07). Therefore, the most parsimonious description of the leukaemia dose response is provided by a linear-quadratic function of dose., CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence of threshold-type departures from the linear-quadratic dose response either for solid tumours or for leukaemia in the Japanese atomic bomb survivor mortality data.",Included

Design(s): Prospective, multicenter, interventional, noncontrolled clinical trial. Participant(s): Fifty-three eyes of 53 participants with neovascular AMD requiring frequent anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) retreatment. Method(s): Participants underwent pars plana vitrectomy with a single 24-Gy dose of EMB delivered using an intraocular, handheld cannula containing a strontium 90/yttrium 90 source positioned over the active lesion. Participants were retreated with ranibizumab administered monthly as needed, using predefined retreatment criteria. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was undertaken monthly, with images assessed by an independent reading center. Main Outcome Measure(s): Coprimary outcomes at 12 months were proportion of participants with stable vision (losing <15 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study [ETDRS] letters) and mean number of anti-VEGF retreatments. Result(s): Before enrollment, participants had received an average of 12.5 anti-VEGF injections. After a single treatment with EMB, 81% maintained stable vision, with a mean of 3.49 anti-VEGF retreatments in 12 months. Mean +/- standard deviation change in visual acuity was -4.0+/-15.1 ETDRS letters. Mean +/- standard deviation OCT central retinal thickness increased by 50+/-179 mum.

1635,"Sargramostim accelerates leukocyte recovery and improves mortality rate at day 60 in a non-human primate model of hematopoietic acute radiation syndrome when administered 48 h after total body irradiation Background: Hematopoietic acute radiation syndrome (H-ARS) occurs in individuals that are exposed to high levels of radiation over a short period of time. The destruction of bone marrow leads to pancytopenia, which increases the incidence of infections and accounts for the majority of morbidity and mortality. Sargramostim (yeast-derived rhGM-CSF) is a leukocyte growth factor that promotes differentiation, maturation and activation of granulocytes, monocytes and macrophages. Method(s): We evaluated the efficacy of repeat administrations of sargramostim (7 mug/kg/day) in a blinded, GLP study in total body irradiated non-human primates (NHPs) when administered 48 h postirradiation with minimal supportive care (e.g., no blood products or individualized antibiotics). The primary objective was to assess the efficacy of sargramostim versus vehicle on mortality rate at Day 60 in irradiated male and female NHPs at LD50-60/60 (n=36/group). Secondary objectives included the efficacy of sargramostim on overall survival and its effect on hematology parameters. The study included an exploratory arm of male and female NHPs that were irradiated at a LD70-80/60 (n= 18/group) and received the same treatments. Result(s): Sargramostim decreased the mortality rate at Day 60 by 36% in the LD50-60/60group (p=0.0018) and by 44% in the LD70-80/60group (p=0.0076). Additionally, neutrophil, platelet, lymphocyte, and white blood cell levels in survivors demonstrated accelerated recovery in the sargramostim-treated NHPs in the LD50-60/60and LD70-80/60groups. Conclusion(s): Treatment with sargramostim (7 mug/kg/day) beginning at 48 h, in the absence of blood products and individualized antibiotics, suggests that the use of sargramostim is a viable therapeutic strategy for H-ARS in a mass casualty event.",Excluded
1700,"Three phenotype profiles are revealed by cluster analysis in early inflammatory back pain suggestive of spondyloarthritis (SPA). Results from the devenir des spondyloarthropathies indifferenciEes rEcentes (DESIR) cohort Background Spondylarthritis (SPA) spectrum refers to a variety of skeletal and extra-articular inflammatory manifestations that may combine differently among patients. Objectives To examine whether SPA disease manifestations at baseline would combine according to an ordered or random pattern in patients with early inflammatory low back pain (IBP) and suggestive of SPA. Methods Baseline clinical and demographic characteristics, as well as imaging (i.e. pelvic X-rays, pelvic MRI and peripheral entheses ultrasound) and biological data (including HLA-B27) of patients included in the French multicenter DESIR cohort of early (<3 yrs duration) IBP suggestive of SPA were analysed by multiple correspondence analysis in order to graphically assess the association between the studied manifestations. Several methods of cluster analysis using those variables were then performed to identify subgroups of patients with similar characteristics. Results Seven hundred and eight patients were included into the Cohort. Among the 700 analysed patients cluster analysis allowed us to classify 688 patients in 3 major groups (table 1). Cluster A contained a majority of men, with predominant isolated axial manifestations, and higher frequency of uveitis and positivity of HLA-B27. Cluster B predominantly consisted of women, with higher frequency of peripheral signs (including vascularisation at entheses by power Doppler ultrasound (PDUS)), psoriasis and younger onset of disease symptoms. Cluster C was composed by patients with predominant axial symptoms, equal distribution of sex, highest presence of pelvic X-rays and MRI positivity, and higher prevalence of HLA-B27 positivity. (Table presented) Conclusions Cluster analysis of SPA manifestations among patients with early IBP allowed us to clearly identify at baseline 3 different groups of clinical phenotypes. Ongoing follow up will allow to determine whether these clusters may correspond to different severity patterns.",Excluded
1789,"The effect of hyperbaric oxygen therapy on treatment of wound complications after oral, pharyngeal and laryngeal salvage surgery Introduction: Radiation therapy alone, or combined with chemotherapy, are both used for cancer in the head and neck. This can lead to damage of tissue cells and vasculature. Surgery in such compromised tissues has increased complication rates, because wound healing with angiogenesis and fibroplasias requires normal cell growth conditions. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy raises oxygen levels in hypoxic tissue, stimulates angiogenesis and fibroplasia. In this report, we review the clinical value of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for major wounds that had shown no signs of healing as well as fistulas after salvage surgery in patients treated with (chemo)radiation of the head and neck regions. Method(s): In this retrospective study, 16 patients with soft-tissue wounds without signs of healing after salvage surgery, after radiation, and most after chemotherapy were treated in the head and neck regions with hyperbaric oxygen therapy. The patients were treated by HBO2, 2.5 bars 90 minutes daily, usually 20 treatments. Result(s): The healing processes seemed to be initiated and accelerated by HBO2. Fourteen of the 16 patients healed completely. There were no life-threatening complications. Conclusion(s): Radiotherapy and combined chemoradiation therapy leads to damage of tissue cells and vasculature. Salvage surgery in such tissues has an increased complications rate, because wound healing requires angiogenesis and fibroplasias, all of which are jeopardized. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy raises oxygen levels in hypoxic tissue, stimulates angiogenesis and fibroplasias and is an effective and powerful treatment for postoperative wounds in oral, pharyngeal and laryngeal carcinomas surgery.

2109,"The metabolic effects of abdominal irradiation in man with and without dietary therapy with an elemental diet The metabolic effects of abdominal radiotherapy were assessed in patients with pelvic neoplasms, and the effects of supplementation of the diet with an 'elemental' diet assessed. Therapeutic irradiation led to significant mean weight losses of 1.4 kg in control patients and 1.0 kg in patients receiving 'elemental' diet supplements. Irradiation was associated with small falls in plasma potassium and calcium concentrations in both groups. In the 'elemental' group there was a small increase in circulating alanine and insulin concentrations and a fall in glycerol and ketone body concentrations, but all variables remained within or close to normal basal reference ranges. Plasma albumin fell slightly but significantly in the 'elemental' diet group from 44 +/- 1 to 42 +/- 1 g/litre during treatment. Is is concluded that modern radiotherapy is no more than a modest catabolic stimulus. Long-term dietary supplementation with 'elemental' diets in ill subjects did not produce adverse effects.",Excluded
1946,"Fifteen-year survival of the CediorTM total knee prosthesis Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is an effective treatment for advanced osteoarthritis of the knee. No large and long-term follow-up study has been done about Cedior prosthesis. The study hypothesis was that 15-year survival for the CediorTM prosthesis is at least as good as rates reported for other models. A continuous retrospective single-center study included patients managed by CediorTM TKA with at least 15-year follow-up. The main endpoint was prosthesis survival; secondary objectives were to identify factors for implant revision and to assess functional scores at 15 years. In the present series, 15-year all-cause survival for the Cedior knee prosthesis was 93.03%; comparable to rates in the literature, posterior-stabilized implants showed higher revision rates. No other factors for revision emerged. These findings are comparable with those of the literature.Copyright © 2019, Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
1939,"Mixed effect modelling of dose and Linear Energy Transfer correlations with brain image changes after intensity modulated proton therapy for skull base head and neck cancer PURPOSE: Intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) could yield high Linear Energy Transfer (LET) in critical structures and increased biological effect. For head and neck cancers at the skull base this could potentially result in radiation associated brain image change (RAIC). The purpose of the current study was to investigate voxel-wise dose and LET correlations with RAIC after IMPT. MATERIAL AND METHODS: For 15 patients with RAIC after IMPT, contrast enhancement observed on T1 weighted MRIs were contoured and co-registered to the planning CT. Monte Carlo calculated dose- and dose averaged LET (LETd) distributions were extracted at voxel level and associations with RAIC were modelled using uni- and multivariate mixed effect logistic regression. Model performance was evaluated using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) and Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC). RESULT(S): An overall statistically significant RAIC association with dose and LETd was found in both the uni- and multivariate analysis. Patient heterogeneity were considerable with SD of the random effects of 1.81 (1.30 - 2.72) for dose and 2.68 (1.93 - 4.93) for LETd, respectively. AUROC was 0.93 and 0.95 for the univariate dose-response model and multivariate model, respectively. Analysis of the LETd effect demonstrated increased risk of RAIC with increasing LETd for the majority of patients. Estimated probability of RAIC with LETd=1 keV/microm was 4% (95% CI: 0%, 0.44%) and 29% (95% CI: 0.01, 0.92%) for 60 Gy and 70 Gy, respectively. The TD15 were estimated to be 63.6 Gy and 50.1 Gy with LETd equal to 2 keV/microm and 5 keV/microm, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): Our results suggest that the LETd effect could be of clinical significance for some patients; LETd assessment in clinical treatment plans should therefore be taken into consideration.Copyright © 2021.

1483,"The amount of impaction and loss of reduction in osteoporotic proximal humeral fractures after surgical fixation Summary: After surgical fixation, osteoporotic proximal humeral fractures often show high impaction and loss of reduction. This study aims at assessing the amount of impaction and loss of reduction at a short and medium follow-up. We found an alarming percentage of cases showing these complications in the first postoperative months. Introduction: This study seeks to quantify the amount of humeral head impaction and loss of reduction in a consecutive series of osteoporotic proximal humerus fractures treated with a locking plate. Method(s): A series of displaced proximal humerus fractures were prospectively treated with minimally invasive reduction and ostheosynthesis using a locking plate. Diagnosis and classification of fractures were based on X-ray examination and CT scan. Proximal humerus cortical bone thickness (CBTAVG) was studied to assess osteoporosis. Amount of loss of reduction and head fragment impaction were noted at 3 and 18 months of follow-up. Constant score was calculated at 6 and 18 months of follow-up. Result(s): Thirty-one osteoporotic fractures were studied. Most of the fractures (21, 67.7 %) had a CBTAVG of less than 4 mm. At 3 months of follow-up, 7 cases (22.5 %) had significant loss of reduction and the mean amount of impaction was 2.8 mm. At 18 months of follow-up, only 1 additional fracture showed loss of reduction and mean impaction was 3 mm (p < 0.05). At 6 months follow-up, the mean Constant score was 58 %; while at 18 months, it was 70 % (p = 0.02). Amount of impaction was significantly correlated to age of patients (p = 0.031), female sex (p = 0.011), CBTAVG (p = 0.019), and metaphyseal comminution (p = 0.013). Conclusion(s): Osteoporotic proximal humerus fractures may present an important impaction and loss of reduction in the first 3 months after surgery even if treated with a rigid device and multiple head screws. Surgeons treating these osteoporotic fractures should be aware of these complications even when using a rigid device.Copyright © 2015, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.",Excluded

PS has a 6% incidence rate worldwide. In this study, we aim to retrospectively evaluate the effectiveness of computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous infiltration in a series of consecutive PS patients who have symptoms that are refractory to conservative therapies. An institutional database search identified 20 such consecutive patients who underwent infiltration with a mixture of long-acting corticosteroid and local anesthetic. Preoperational evaluation included physical examination and magnetic resonance imaging. The correct position of the 22-gauge spinal needle was verified with CT scan after contrast medium injection. Pain measured before the procedure and at 1 wk and 1, 6, and 12 mo after the procedure was compared by means of a numeric visual scale (NVS) questionnaire. The mean pain score before CT-guided percutaneous infiltration was 8.95 +/- 1.432 NVS units. This score was reduced to a mean value of 0.85 +/- 0.933 units at 1 wk, 0.90 +/- 0.852 at 1 mo, 1.10 +/- 1.165 at 6 mo, and 1.20 +/- 1.399 at 12 mo follow-up (p < 0.001). Two patients of 20 (10%) underwent a second infiltration that was performed at 7 and 10 d after the first, respectively. No complications were observed. CT-guided infiltration seems to be a feasible, efficacious, and safe approach for pain reduction and mobility improvement in patients with symptomatic PS.Copyright © 2020 by Begell House, Inc. www.begellhouse.com.",Excluded
1359,"Differentiation between brain tumor recurrence and radiation injury using perfusion, diffusion-weighted imaging and MR spectroscopy BACKGROUND: Differentiation between tumor recurrence/vital tumor tissue and radionecrosis based on conventional diagnostic imaging is impossible because of the likeness of the images. In such circumstances advanced MRI techniques (PWI, DWI, 1HMRS) seem to be helpful. The aim of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic effectiveness of PWI, DWI and 1HMRS in the differentiation of the tumor recurrence from radiation related injury., MATERIAL AND METHODS: The retrospective analysis comprised 11 contrast-enhancing lesions observed in 8 patients treated for gliomas with radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy. 5 out of 11 contrast-enhancing lesions were tumor recurrences whereas 6 out of 11 radiation-related injuries. The MR examinations comprised of conventional MR imaging (T1-SE, T1-MPRAGE with CE, T2-TSE, T2 FLAIR) and PWI, DWI, 1HMRS. Mean and maximum rCBV values of each contrast-enhancing lesion were calculated. These values were normalized to normal appearing white matter. Mean normalized ADC ratio to normal appearing white matter and mean ADC obtained from contrast-enhancing lesions were analysed. In 1HMRS only those voxels which were placed in solid part of the contrast-enhancing lesion were analysed and Cho/Cr, Cho/NAA ratios presented., RESULTS: Mean normalized rCBVmax (2.44 +/- 0.73 for tumor recurrence vs. 0.78 +/- 0.46 for radiation injury; p < 0.001) and mean normalized rCBVmean (1.46 +/- 0.49 for tumor recurrence vs. 0.49 +/- 0.38 for radiation injury; p < 0.005) were significantly higher in the recurrent gliomas group than in the radiation injury one. It was observed that normalized rCBVmax higher than 1.7 and normalized rCBVmean higher than 1.25 is highly indicative for recurrent glioma whereas normalized rCBVmax lower than 1.0 and normalized rCBVmean lower than 0.5 is highly indicative for radiation injury. Results obtained in DWI and 1HMRS were not statistically significant different between two analysed groups. Mean ADCce: 1.06 +/- 0.18 x 10-3 mm2/s for tumor recurrence vs. 1.13 +/- 0.13 x 10-3 mm2/s for radiation injury; p = 0.51. Mean normalized ADC: 1.55 +/- 0.39 x 10-3 mm2/s for tumor recurrence vs. 1.55 +/- 0.18 x 10-3 mm2/s for radiation injury; p = 0.98. Median Cho/Cr ratio: (2.16min/max [1.67-3.15] for tumor recurrence vs. 1.34min/max [1.13-2.37] for radiation injury; p = 0.15), median Cho/NAA ratio (1.9min/max [0.86-2.36] for tumor recurrence vs. 2.11min/max [0.97 vs. 2.87] for radiation injury; p = 0.51)., CONCLUSIONS: Among the analyzed advanced neuroimaging methods PWI seems to be most reliable in differentiation between tumor regrowth/recurrence and radiation necrosis. In these results mean rCBV is a better differing factor than max rCBV. Proton MR spectroscopy (1HMRS) and DWI do not differentiate analyzed groups with statistical significance, despite tendency to lower ADC values in recurrence group than in radiation injury one.",Excluded

CTPA was performed with vendor-predefined second-generation (group A, 100-kV single-energy computed tomography (SECT); group B, 80/Sn140-kV dual-energy computed tomography (DECT)) or third-generation DSCT (group C, 100-kV SECT; group D, 90/Sn150-kV DECT) devices. Radiation metrics were assessed using a normalized scan range of 27.5 cm. For objective image quality evaluation, dose-independent figure-of-merit (FOM) contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were calculated. Subjective image analysis included ratings for overall image quality, reader confidence, and image artifacts using five-point Likert scales., RESULTS: Calculations of the effective dose (ED) of radiation for a normalized scan range of 27.5 cm showed nonsignificant differences between SECT and DECT acquisitions for each scanner generation (p >= 0.253). The mean effective radiation dose was lower for third-generation groups C (1.5 mSv +/- 0.8 mSv) and D (1.4 mSv +/- 0.7 mSv) compared to second-generation groups A (2.5 mSv +/- 0.9 mSv) and B (2.3 mSv +/- 0.6 mSv) (both p <= 0.013). FOM-CNR measurements were highest for group D. Qualitative image parameters of overall image quality, reader confidence, and image artifacts showed nonsignificant differences among the four groups (p >= 0.162)., CONCLUSIONS: Third-generation DSCT systems show lower radiation dose parameters for CTPA compared to second-generation DSCT. DECT can be performed with both scanner generations without radiation dose penalty or detrimental effects on image quality compared to SECT., KEY POINTS: * Radiation exposure showed nonsignificant differences between SECT and DECT for both DSCT scanner devices. * Dual-energy CTPA provides equivalent image quality compared to standard image acquisition. * Subjective image quality assessment was similar among the four study groups.",Excluded
2335,"Thoracic spine fracture in the course of severe nocturnal hypoglycemia in young patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus - The role of low bone mineral density Thus far, only a few spine fracture cases related to severe nocturnal hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes patients have been reported. Due to the relatively young age of these subjects, osteoporosis was not taken into consideration and bone mineral density was not assessed. We report three type 1 diabetes cases in young patients with durations of 2, 4, and 19 years. These patients had severe hypoglycemic attacks during night sleep with subsequent compression thoracic vertebrae fractures. Laboratory parameters for diabetes control, calcium, phosphate metabolismand celiac-specific antibodies were assessed. Moreover, kidney, thyroid, and parathyroid gland functions were also measured. Bone mineral density was assessed by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Lumbar spine x-ray absorptiometry revealed very low bone mineral density in all three patients. In all subjects, metabolic control was good, no chronic diabetes complications were found and other laboratory parameters were within a normal range. For the first time, itwas demonstrated that lowbone mineral density in young type 1 diabetes patients may contribute to an increased compression fracture risk of the dorsal spine during severe nocturnal hypoglycemia courses. The possibility of osteoporosis in young patients with short diabetes durations suggests it might be advisable to perform bone mineral density testing during diabetes diagnoses. Spinal pain occurrences in young patients after severe nocturnal hypoglycemia should be investigated using procedures for the diagnosis of vertebral compression fracture, even if there is no evident trauma. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The bone-seeking, alpha-particle-emitting radiopharmaceutical Alpharadin, 223RaCl2 (half-life=11.4 days), is under clinical development as a novel treatment for skeletal metastases from breast and prostate cancer. This article summarizes the current status of preclinical and clinical research on 223RaCl2. Potential advantages of 223Ra to that of external beam irradiation and registered beta-emitting bone seekers are discussed. Published data of 223Ra dosimetry in mice and a therapeutic study in a skeletal metastases model in nude rats have indicated significant therapeutic potential of bone-seeking alpha-emitters. This article provides short-term and long-term results from the first clinical single dosage trial. We also present data from a repeated dosage study of five consecutive injections of 50 kBq/kg body weight, once every 3rd week, or two injections of 125 kBq/kg body weight, 6 weeks apart. Furthermore, interim results are described for a randomized phase 2 trial involving 64 patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer and painful skeletal metastases who received four monthly injections of 223Ra or saline as an adjuvant to external beam radiotherapy. Lastly, we present preliminary dose estimates for 223Ra in humans.

The therapeutic challenges of locally advanced stage are well recognized, especially increased risk of local recurrence. However, with introduction of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), significant tumour regression is achieved, thereby permitting breast conservation, hence a non-randomized single arm study was conducted. Material(s) and Method(s): From 2007 to 2014 one hundred & ten patients were recruited. 59 out of 110 underwent NACT. All underwent lumpectomy and axillary dissection & intraoperatively template guided rigid/flexible needle with 2 or 3 plane. After 2D/3D based CT - planning, HDR dose of 15-16 Gy/2 - 2.5 Gy/# BD given for 3-5 days. Whole breast irradiation (46-50 Gy) was delivered after a 2-3 weeks' gap. CTV & DHI parameters were studied. Acute skin toxicity assessed at end of treatment. Cosmetic assessment done at 3 months according to Harvard scale. Unpaired t and Chi-square tests were used for analysis of parameters. Result(s): The ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence rate was (5) 4.5% with median follow up 5.4 years. Mean D90 (91.5%) and V90 (90.7%). Mean V100 was 84.20%. DHI range 0.7-0.8. The ipsilateral breast except the CTV (Breast-CTV) received a mean dose of 33.2%. Mean dose received by heart was 7.2%. Mean dose received by contralateral breast was (V5%) 1.6% & (V10%) 0.08%. Mean dose received by ipsilateral lung was (V5%) 46% & 18% (V10%). Mean dose to skin is significantly 24.9% brachytherapy. Excellent/good overall cosmesis is observed in 69 patients and fair/poor cosmesis observed in 32 patients. Poor cosmesis was observed in 9 patients. Conclusion(s): Breast conservation treatment options show comparable local control with acceptable dosimetric parameters & cosmetic outcomes even in LABC.

The purpose of this study is to compare the usefulness of MRI and CT for evaluating the fetal skeletal shape., METHODS: This study was approved by our Institutional Review Board. Fetal specimens (n = 14) were scanned on a 3T MRI scanner using our newly-developed sequence. It is based on T2*-weighted imaging (TR, 12 ms; TE for opposed-phase imaging, 6.1 ms, for in-phase imaging, 7.3 ms; flip angle, 40degree). The specimens were also scanned on a 320 detector-row CT scanner. Four radiologists visually graded and compared the visibility of the bone shape of eight regions on MRI- and CT-scans using a 5-point grading system., RESULTS: The diagnostic ability of MRI with respect to the 5th metacarpals, femur, fibula, and pelvis was superior to CT (all, P < 0.050); there was no significant difference in the evaluation results of observers with respect to the cervical and lumbar spine, and the 5th metatarsal (0.058 <= P <= 1.000). However, the diagnostic ability of MRI was significantly inferior to CT for the assessment of the bone shape of the thoracic spine (observers A and C: P = 0.002, observers B and D: P = 0.001)., CONCLUSION: The MRI method we developed represents a potential alternative to CT imaging for the evaluation of the fetal bone structure.",Excluded
2480,"Reducing intraoperative duration and ionising radiation exposure during the insertion of distal locking screws of intramedullary nails: a small-scale study comparing the current fluoroscopic method against radiation-free, electromagnetic navigation BACKGROUND: Intramedullary nailing is the standard surgical treatment for mid-diaphyseal fractures of long bones; however, it is also a high radiation dose procedure. Distal locking is regularly cited as a demanding element of the procedure, and there remains a reliance on X-ray fluoroscopy to locate the distal holes. A recently developed electromagnetic navigation (EMN) system allows radiation-free distal locking, with a virtual on-screen image., OBJECTIVE: To compare operative duration, fluoroscopy time and radiation dose when using EMN over fluoroscopy, for the distal locking of intramedullary nails., METHOD: Consecutive patients with mid-diaphyseal fractures of the tibia and femur, treatable with intramedullary nails, were prospectively enrolled during a 9-month period. The sample consisted of 29 individuals, 19 under fluoroscopic guidance and 10 utilising EMN. Participants were allocated depending on the type of intramedullary nail used and surgeon's preference. These were further divided into tibial and femoral subcategories, relative to the fracture site., RESULTS: EMN reduced fluoroscopy time by 49 (p = 0.038) and 28 s during tibial and femoral nailings, respectively. Radiation dose was reduced by 18 cGy/cm2 (p = 0.046) during tibial and 181 cGy/cm2 during femoral nailings when utilising EMN. Operative duration was 11 min slower during tibial nailings using EMN, but 38 min faster in respect of femoral nailings., CONCLUSIONS: This study has evidenced statistically significant reductions in both fluoroscopy time and radiation dose when using EMN for the distal locking of intramedullary nails. It is expected that overall operative duration would also decrease in line with similar studies, with increased usage and a larger sample.",Excluded
1748,"The association of residential altitude on the molecular profile and survival of melanoma: Results of an interreg study Cutaneous melanoma (CM) incidence is rising worldwide and is the primary cause of death from skin disease in the Western world. Personal risk factors linked to environmental ultraviolet radiation (UVR) are well-known etiological factors contributing to its development. Nevertheless, UVR can contribute to the development of CM in different patterns and to varying degrees. The present study aimed at investigating whether altitude of residence can contribute to the development of specific types of CM and/or influence its progression. To this aim, 306 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues from primary CM diagnosed in different geographical areas were submitted to B-RAF proto-oncogene serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) and N-RAS proto-oncogene GTPase (NRAS) mutational status detection and mRNA and miRNA profiling by qPCR. Genes were chosen for their functions in specific processes, such as immune response (CD2, PDL1, or CD274) and pigmentation (MITF, TYRP1, and TRPM1). Furthermore, four microRNAs, namely miR-150-5p, miR-155-5p, miR-204-5p, and miR-211-5p, were included in the profiling. Our results highlight differences in the gene expression profile of primary CM with respect to the geographical area and the altitude of residence. Melanoma-specific survival was influenced by the gene expression of mRNA and miRNAs and varied with the altitude of patients' residence. In detail, TYRP1 and miR-204-5p were highly expressed in patients living at higher altitudes, unlike miR-150-5p, miR-155-5p, and miR-211-5p. Since miRNAs are highly regulated by reactive oxygen species, it is possible that different regulatory mechanisms characterize CMs at different altitudes due to the different environment and UVR intensity.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

PEM synergizes with ionizing radiation and CIS in preclinical models. PEM+CIS doublets showed efficacy and favourable toxicity profiles in Phase I/II studies of NS-NSCLC. This singlearm multicenter Phase II study investigated efficacy and safety of PEM+CIS induction followed by full-dose PEM+CIS plus concurrent RT in pts with LA NS-NSCLC. Material(s) and Method(s): Pts with unresectable Stage IIIA/IIIB NS-NSCLC, ECOG performance status (PS) 0-1 and forced expiratory volume (FEV) >50% of predicted normal FEV received two 21-day cycles of PEM 500 mg/m2 + CIS 75 mg/m2 on Day 1. Pts who had not progressed, had no residual neurological toxicity >Grade(G) 2, PS 0-1 and lung V20 <35% then received 2 cycles of the same full-dose PEM+CIS regimen plus concurrent thoracic RT of 2 Gy/fraction, 5d/wk for 7wks (66 Gy total). All pts received vitamin supplementation/dexamethasone prophylaxis as per PEM-label. Primary endpoint was the 1 yr progression-free survival (PFS) rate. A minimum of 53 events was required to provide 90% power to demonstrate an improvement of the 1 yr PFS rate from 45% (historical data) to 60% at a 2-sided alpha level of 5%, resulting in a sample size of 88 pts assuming 10% dropouts. Secondary data presented include tumor response and toxicity. Result(s): 90 pts were enrolled in 4 countries: median age 61 yrs, male/ female 57%/43%, ECOG PS 0/1 66%/34%, mean (SD) FEV 2.3 (0.62)L, adenocarcinoma 90%, Stage IIIA/IIIB 36%/62% (2 pts had Stage IV and discontinued before starting RT). 75 pts (83.3%) completed induction CT and started concurrent CT+RT. 63 of the 75 pts (84.0%) received all 4 CT cycles and full RT of 66 Gy. Median PEM+CIS dose intensities were >97% during concurrent CT+RT, median RT dose was 66 Gy (range 18-66 Gy). The 1 yr PFS rate was 51.3% (95% CI 42.0-60.5). After a median follow-up of 24 months, median PFS was 10.6 months (95% CI 8.6-17.3). Response data are shown as table. One pt died from study-drug related toxicity (enteritis) during Cycle 4. Four pts discontinued due to non-fatal drug- or radiation related adverse events, 1 on induction CT (renal failure), 3 on concurrent CT+RT (hypoacusis, 2x radiation esophagitis). During induction CT, 18.9% of pts reported G3/4 CTCAEs, only neutropenia (2.2%) and syncope (2.2%) were reported by >1 pt. During concurrent CT+RT, 41.3% of 75 pts reported G3/4 CTCAEs, mainly esophagitis (12.0%), neutropenia (10.7%) and leukopenia (9.3%). One pt experienced G3 mucositis and 1 pt showed G3 acute pneumonitis. Conclusion(s): In this study of PEM+CIS induction followed by full-dose PEM+CIS with concurrent thoracic RT, the 1 yr PFS rate (51.3%) was in the same range as previously observed with other CIS-based induction CT followed by CT+RT (40-50%). Of note, 7 pts had CR. Main G3/4 toxicities during concurrent CT+RT included esophagitis, neutropenia and leukopenia. (Table presented).",Excluded
2431,"[Vitamin D levels in patients with hip fracture in Madrid] BACKGROUND: Vitamin D appears to be implicated in the loss of bone mass and its most severe complication is the hip fracture. A change is produced in the metabolism of vitamin D in elderly people although its study has received little attention in many countries., METHODS: With the aim of evaluating vitamin D and its metabolites in the elderly people with hip fracture in our geographic environment (Madrid, Spain), 58 patients with hip fracture over the age of 70, and 39 subjects without a fracture or the similar age were studied. Both groups were evaluated during the season of minimum solar irradiation. The plasma concentrations of intact PTH and the serum concentrations of calcidiol and calcitriol were studied in all the patients., RESULTS: The patients with hip fracture presented significantly lower concentrations of calcidiol (11.7 +/- 6.4 vs. 18.4 +/- 12.7 nmol/l) and calcitriol (60.1 +/- 24.7 vs. 76.1 +/- 25.0 pmol/l) than in elderly persons without fracture, with similar PTH values being observed in both groups (4.8 +/- 1.9 vs. 5.1 +/- 2.3 pmol/l)., CONCLUSIONS: Although Madrid, Spain is considered to be a geographical area of high solar irradiation, the elderly population studied presented a vitamin D deficiency which was found to be greater in those with hip fracture.",Excluded

1510,"Pulmonary resection after high-dose and low-dose chest irradiation BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of pulmonary resection after low and high dose neoadjuvant radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy., PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study using an electronic prospective database from January 1998 to August 2004. All patients had N2, stage IIIa, nonsmall cell lung cancer, and received neoadjuvant carboplatinum-based chemotherapy with similar doses. In addition, some patients received high-dose chest radiation (HD) equal to or greater than 60 Gy and were compared with those who received low-dose radiation (LD) less than 60 Gy. All bronchial stumps were buttressed with an intercostal muscle., RESULTS: There were 104 patients, 50 in the LD group and 54 patients in the HD group. Median dose of radiation was 45 Gy (range 35-50.4) in the LD group and 60 Gy (range 60-66.7) in the HD group. Complete pathologic response rate was 10% compared to 28% favoring the HD group (p = 0.04). Median length of stay for both groups was 4 days and the ICU was avoided in 74%. Major morbidity and mortality rates were similar: 8% compared to 9% and 2% compared to 3.7% for the low and high dose groups, respectively. Pneumonectomy was a significant risk factor for morbidity (OR = 17.0)., CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary resection after preoperative chest radiation is safe even after 60 Gy or higher. Sixty or higher may afford an increase in complete pathologic response and it does not seem to increase morbidity or mortality. However, if pneumonectomy is known to be required we prefer to avoid neoadjuvant radiotherapy and use chemotherapy alone.",Excluded
1877,"Prevalence and expectations of ""alternative and complementary medicine"" use during radiotherapy in 2016: A prospective study Purpose: Alternative and complementary medicine is defined as any substance or technique of non-allopathic medicine used to improve health and quality of life. The purpose of this prospective observational study was to evaluate the use of alternative and complementary medicine during radiotherapy. Material(s) and Method(s): A questionnaire was given the last week of treatment to all patients treated for breast cancer, prostate cancer or head and neck cancer in our centre in 2016. Result(s): In 2016, 132 patients were included. Fifty-seven patients (43%) used alternative and complementary medicine during radiotherapy, more women (61%) than men (35%) (P = 0.005). The use of alternative and complementary medicine varied according to locations: 44% of head and neck cancers, 57% of breast cancers and 24% of prostate cancers, but sex was the confounding factor. If alternative and complementary medicine was used before radiotherapy, 82% of patients used it during treatment, compared to 30% if they were naive (P < 10-7). Healing touch (68%), homeopathy (26%) and magnetisers (21%) were the most used alternative and complementary medicines. Sixty-one percent of patients used alternative and complementary medicine to reduce skin and mucosal side effects of treatments, 28% to improve well-being, and 9% to treat cancer. Seventy-two percent of all patients would advise their loved one to use an alternative and complementary medicine and 87% would like information about them in the hospital. Conclusion(s): Alternative and complementary medicines are used more by women, and by patients who used them before radiotherapy. The desired effects are mainly to reduce the side effects of the treatments. More than 80% of patients, whether or not they use alternative and complementary medicine, demand medical information.Copyright © 2018",Excluded
2428,"Safety of deferred CT imaging of intoxicated patients presenting with possible traumatic brain injury BACKGROUND: Patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with altered mental status and alcohol intoxication can clinically resemble patients with an intracranial hemorrhage. Although intracranial hemorrhage is quickly excluded with a head computed tomographic (CT) scan, it is common practice to defer imaging and allow the patient to metabolize to spare ED resources and minimize radiation exposure to the patient. Although this reduces unnecessary scans, it may delay treatment in patients with occult intracranial hemorrhage, which some fear may increase morbidity and mortality. We sought to evaluate the safety of deferred CT imaging in these patients by evaluating whether time to scan significantly affects the rate of neurosurgical intervention., METHODS: In this retrospective medical record review, all clinically alcohol-intoxicated patients presenting to 2 university EDs were included. Time to order CT imaging, findings on imaging, and outcomes of these patients were determined. Patients were assessed in 3 groups: CT ordered within 1 hour of triage, CT ordered 1-3 hours from triage, and CT ordered 3 or more hours from triage., RESULTS: During the study period, 5943 patients were included in the study. Of these, 0 patients scanned in less than 3 hours had intracranial findings on imaging requiring neurosurgery, whereas 1 patient with a deferred CT scan required a neurosurgical intervention; however, it was not emergently performed., CONCLUSION: Routine CT scanning of alcohol-intoxicated patients with altered mental status is of low clinical value. Deferring CT imaging while monitoring improving clinical status appears to be a safe practice. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

2076,"The lack of cytotoxic effect and radioadaptive response in splenocytes of mice exposed to low level internal beta-particle irradiation through tritiated drinking water in vivo Health effects of tritium, a beta-emitter and a by-product of the nuclear industry, is a subject of significant controversy. This mouse in vivo study was undertaken to monitor biological effects of low level tritium exposure. Mice were exposed to tritiated drinking water (HTO) at 10 KBq/L, 1 MBq/L and 20 MBq/L concentrations for one month. The treatment did not result in a significant increase of apoptosis in splenocytes. To examine if this low level tritium exposure alters radiosensitivity, the extracted splenocytes were challenged in vitro with 2 Gy gamma-radiation, and apoptotic responses at 1 and 24 h were measured. No alterations in the radiosensitivity were detected in cells from mice exposed to tritium compared to sham-treated mice. In contrast, low dose gamma-irradiation at 20 or 100 mGy, resulted in a significant increase in resistance to apoptotic cell death after 2 Gy irradiation; an indication of the radioadaptive response. Overall, our data suggest that low concentrations of tritium given to mice as HTO in drinking water do not exert cytotoxic effect in splenocytes, nor do they change cellular sensitivity to additional high dose gamma-radiation. The latter may be considered as the lack of a radioadaptive response, typically observed after low dose gamma-irradiation. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Included
1885,"A hypothetical protocol for the provisional use of perfusion imaging with exercise stress testing Background: Previous literature suggests that the results of myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) add little to the prognosis of patients who exercise >10 metabolic equivalents (METS) during stress testing. With this in mind, we attempted to determine if a provisional injection protocol could be developed in which a patient would not receive an injection of radioisotope if adequate exercise was achieved without symptoms and a negative ECG response. This protocol would save a substantial amount of time, radiation exposure, and cost. Method(s): All patients who underwent a stress SPECT MPI over a 6.5-year period from 2004 to 2010 were included. Patients who would have been considered for a standby injection protocol were: exercise stress, age < 65, no known coronary artery disease (CAD), and an interpretable ECG. Patients were retrospectively divided into two groups based on whether they would have received radioisotope or not. Criteria for not injecting included a maximal predicted heart rate >= 85%, >=10 METS of exercise, no symptoms of chest pain or shortness of breath, and no ECG changes (ST depression or arrhythmia). The two groups were then compared based on MPI results and all-cause mortality derived from the Social Security Death Index. Result(s): A total of 24,689 patients underwent SPECT MPI during this period, and 5,352 would have been eligible for a provisional injection protocol. There were 3,791 (70.8%), who would have been injected and 1,561 (29.2%), who would not have been. Perfusion results were abnormal in 5.9% of non-injected group compared to 14.4% in those who would have been injected. After a mean follow-up of 60.6 +/- 21.4 months, 1.1% had died in the non-injected cohort compared to 2.2% in the injected group. Conclusion(s): A provisional injection protocol defined as age < 65, normal rest ECG, no history of CAD, and high level exercise with a negative ECG response and no symptoms has a very low 5-year all-cause mortality and low yield of MPI. If adopted it would decrease radiation exposure and save time and health care costs without jeopardizing prognosis. © 2013 American Society of Nuclear Cardiology.",Excluded

Design and settings A population-based retrospective cohort study from Western Norway. Participants 363 patients aged 18 years or older diagnosed with glioblastoma between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2014. Primary and secondary outcome measures Overall survival and survival rates determined by Kaplan-Meier method, groups compared by log-rank test. Associations between clinical characteristics and treatment approach assessed by logistic regression. Associations between treatment approach and outcome analysed by Cox regression. Results Median overall survival was 10.2 months (95% CI 9.1 to 11.3). Resection was performed in 221 patients (60.9%), and was inversely associated with age over 70 years, higher comorbidity burden, deep-seated tumour localisation and multifocality. Median survival was 13.7 months (95% CI 12.1 to 15.4) in patients undergoing tumour resection, 8.3 months (95% CI 6.6 to 9.9) in patients undergoing biopsy and 4.5 months (95% CI 4.0 to 5.1) in patients where no surgical intervention was performed. Chemoradiotherapy according to the Stupp protocol was given to 157 patients (43%). Age over 70 years, higher comorbidity burden and cognitive impairment were associated with less intensive chemoradiotherapy. Median survival was 16.3 months (95% CI 14.1 to 18.5), 7.9 months (95% CI 6.7 to 9.0) and 2.0 months (95% CI 0.9 to 3.2) in patients treated according to the Stupp protocol, with less intensive chemoradiotherapy and with best supportive care, respectively. Surgical resection (HR 0.61 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.79)) and chemoradiotherapy according to the Stupp protocol (HR 0.09 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.15)) were strongly associated with favourable overall survival, when adjusted for clinical variables. Conclusions In a real-world setting, less than half of the patients received full-course chemoradiotherapy, with a median survival comparable to results from clinical trials. Survival was considerably worse in patients receiving less intensive treatment. Our results point out a substantial risk of undertreating glioblastoma, especially in elderly patients.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

1370,"Relationships between nasopharyngeal carcinoma and radioactive elements in soils in China Earlier comparisons of epidemiological and geochemical maps of China disclosed associations between high mortality rates from nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and low contents of magnesium in the soil. More recent work has shown that high rates of NPC are also associated with high levels of uranium and thorium in the soil. These latest findings are consistent with the earlier ones, since uranium and thorium occur predominantly in acid rocks poor in magnesium. Uranium and thorium are radioactive, and their progeny include radioactive elements such as radium and radon. Whether or not naturally occurring radioactive elements could be risk factors in NPC should, therefore, be further investigated. Direct carcinogenic properties of radon are well known, but in connection with NPC possibilities for reactivation of virus by natural ionizing radiation should also be considered.

1400,"Effect of X-irradiation on epidermal immune function: decreased density and alloantigen-presenting capacity of Ia+ Langerhans cells and impaired production of epidermal cell-derived thymocyte activating factor (ETAF) The mechanisms involved in the modulation of cutaneous immune responses by UV radiation have been extensively investigated; by contrast, few studies have addressed the effects of x-irradiation on epidermal immune function. We therefore investigated the effect of x-irradiation of mice on: (a) the density of epidermal Ia+ Langerhans cells (LC) in immunofluorescence studies, (b) epidermal cell (EC) allostimulatory capacity in the allogeneic EC-lymphocyte reaction (ELR), and (c) production of epidermal cell-derived thymocyte activating factor (ETAF). C3H/He and BALB/c mice were irradiated with 900, 1,800, 2,700, or 3,600 rad from a 137Cs source, and sacrificed 10 h or 3 days later. X-irradiation of mice 10 h previously only slightly decreased the density of epidermal Ia+ LC and did not affect the capacity of their EC to stimulate allogeneic responder lymphocytes in the ELR. X-irradiation of mice 3 days previously, however, resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the density of Ia+ LC. This decrease was accompanied by a substantial reduction in EC allostimulatory capacity in the ELR at all doses of x-irradiation. ETAF production by cultured EC from mice x-irradiated 3 days previously was also found to be diminished at all doses of x-irradiation. Trypan blue exclusion studies demonstrated that the observed decreases in EC allostimulatory capacity and ETAF production were not the result of a generalized lethal effect of x-irradiation on EC. The reduction in EC allostimulatory capacity following in vivo x-irradiation could not be reversed by addition of exogenous ETAF or interleukin-1 in the ELR. Taken together, these results indicate that x-irradiation decreases the density of Ia+ LC, impairs LC alloantigen-presenting function, and reduces ETAF production. Thus cutaneous x-irradiation may affect inflammatory and neoplastic processes not only by its antimitotic activity, but also by a direct effect on EC which subserve immunologic functions.",Included

Half-normal saline (HNS)-irrigation is a promising strategy to improve the success rate of VA ablation., OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the efficacy of HNS-irrigated ablation after a failed standard plain normal saline solution (PNSS)-irrigated ablation on idiopathic outflow tract ventricular arrhythmia (OT-VA)., METHOD: This is a prospective observational study of consecutive patients undergoing RFA of idiopathic OT-VA comparing the efficacy of additional HNS-irrigated ablation for failed standard PNSS-irrigated ablation. Acute failure was defined as persistence of spontaneous VA or persistent inducibility of the clinical VA., RESULTS: Out of 160 OT-VA cases (51 +/- 15-year-old, 62 males), 31 underwent HNS irrigation after a failed standard PNSS-irrigated ablation. The HNS group had a significantly longer procedure time (60.06 +/- 43.83 vs 37.51 +/- 33.40 minutes; P = .013) and higher radiation exposure (31.45 +/- 20.24 vs 17.22 +/- 15.25 minutes; P = .001) than the PNSS group but provided an additional acute success in 21 of 31 (67.7%) patients. Over a follow-up duration of 7.8 +/- 4.6 months, 24 recurrences were identified, including 8 (25.8%) in the HNS and 16 (12.4%) in the PNSS group, with lower freedom from recurrence in the HNS group (log rank P = .009). No major complication was observed., CONCLUSION: HNS-irrigated ablation after failed standard PNSS-irrigated ablation is safe and additionally improves acute ablation success by 67.7% for idiopathic OT-VA but with a higher rate of recurrence on follow-up. Whether the application of HNS as initial irrigant could result in better outcome requires further investigation. Copyright © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
1452,"Diagnostic medical radiation in inflammatory bowel disease: Primum non-nocere? Background and Aims Patients with Inflammatory Bowel disease (IBD) are frequently exposed to diagnostic medical radiation for the diagnosis and evaluation of their disease. Despite increasing awareness of the potentially serious downstream effects, few studies have quantified radiation exposure in IBD patients. Methods We conducted a retrospective review of 225 consecutive patients attending IBD clinics at our hospital. Clinical data including demographics, disease characteristics and therapy were obtained from case note and electronic patient record review. All incidences of diagnostic medical radiation from initial diagnosis until 30 June 2010 inclusive were recorded from case note and computerised radiology database system review. The radiation dose for each procedure was obtained from published tables from the Royal College of Radiologists, UK. Effective dose for each procedure was calculated by multiplying this value by the number of procedures during the study period. The sum of doses received was the cumulative effective dose. Results One hundred and two of the 225 IBD patients reviewed were female, 123 were male. The median age was 48 (Range 17-88) and mean disease duration 9.8 years. One hundred and four patients had Crohn's disease, 113 patients had ulcerative colitis and 8 patients had an indeterminate colitis. The mean and median cumulative effective radiation doses were 11.35 mSv and 5.12 mSv respectively. A cumulative radiation dose greater than 10 mSv was seen in 40.9% (92) patients and greater than 25 mSv in 12.9% (29) patients. In 9 patients the cumulative effective dose was greater than 50 mSv. Crohn's disease was associated with a higher cumulative effective dose with exposure exceeding 10 mSv in 60.6%, 25 mSv in 22.1% and 50 mSv in 8.7% patients respectively. CT imaging accounted for 43% and barium studies for 32% of the total cumulative effective dose exposure. Thirty-nine patients had small bowel magnetic resonance (MR) studies as an alternative to ionising radiation in the last 3 years. Conclusions Patients with IBD, particularly those with Crohn's disease are exposed to significant amounts of diagnostic medical radiation in their lifetime. The increased risk of cancer from cumulative radiation coupled with the inherent risk of colorectal malignancy in long standing IBD and the potential for immunomodulator drugs such as azathioprine to increase the risk of cancers (e.g. lymphoma) is of great clinical and public health concern. Clinicians must remain vigilant to these risks when evaluating these patients and radiation exposure should be minimised and when possible alternatives such as intestinal ultrasound and MR imaging should be preferred.",Included
1744,"Can low-dose unenhanced chest CT be used for follow-up of lung nodules? OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to establish the difference in lung nodule volume between standard-dose contrast-enhanced and low-dose unenhanced CT., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with known pulmonary metastases underwent three CT examinations on 1 day: two unenhanced low-dose (120 kVp and 30 mAs) and a standard-dose (120-140 kVp and 75-200 mAs) contrast-enhanced chest CT examinations. For nodules<1000 mm3, nodule volume was quantified using dedicated software from the CT manufacturer. Wilcoxon's signed rank tests were used for analysis of nodules<=200 mm3 and >200 mm3 (approximately diameter of 8 mm)., RESULTS: One hundred one nodules (n=69<=200 mm3) were analyzed in 15 of these subjects. Measured volume of nodules<=200 mm3 was systematically lower on both low-dose unenhanced CT examinations when compared with standard-dose contrast-enhanced CT (differences, 13.7% and 15.5%, respectively; p<0.0001), but nodule volume was not different between low-dose CT (median difference, 1.0%; p=0.10). Nodule volume was not systematically different between the protocols for nodules>200 mm3 (p>0.30)., CONCLUSION: For lung nodules<=200 mm3 (approximately 8 mm) the measured volume on low-dose unenhanced CT is significantly lower when compared with standard-dose contrast-enhanced CT. This effect is likely due to contrast administration rather than other imaging parameters, which should be taken into account in the follow-up of lung nodules because growth can remain undetected or doubling time underestimated.",Excluded

All patients were disease-free at the time of screening. The median time from completion of radiation therapy was 56 months (range, 6-135 months). One-hundred fifty-five patients (47%) were treated by definitive radiation therapy, and 175 (53%) were treated postoperatively. Radiation doses ranged from 50 to 74 Gy (median, 66 Gy). Intensity-modulated radiation therapy was used in 62% of cases, and 133 patients (40%) received concurrent chemotherapy., RESULTS: Forty patients (12%) reported neuropathic symptoms, with the most common being ipsilateral pain (50%), numbness/tingling (40%), motor weakness, and/or muscle atrophy (25%). When patients with <5 years of follow-up were excluded, the rate of positive symptoms increased to 22%. On univariate analysis, the following factors were significantly associated with brachial plexus symptoms: prior neck dissection (p = 0.01), concurrent chemotherapy (p = 0.01), and radiation maximum dose (p < 0.001). Cox regression analysis confirmed that both neck dissection (p < 0.001) and radiation maximum dose (p < 0.001) were independently predictive of symptoms., CONCLUSION: The incidence of brachial plexus-associated neuropathies after radiation therapy for head-and-neck cancer may be underreported. In view of the dose-response relationship identified, limiting radiation dose to the brachial plexus should be considered when possible. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): Between February 2007 and December2011, 68 patients, 24 female, 44 male, median age of 69 years (range 32-87 years) with 91 pathologically proven pulmonary metastases not amenable to surgery, (colorectal 36, lung 20, kidney 12, breast 8, parothyd 9, bladder 2, pancreas 2, endometrium 1 and melanoma 1) with a median gross tumor volume of 31 cc (range 3.55-240.06 cc) were referred to our Radiotherapy Department for Cyberknife stereotactic radiotherapy treatment. 1-3gold fiducials (24 patients) were used as markers implanted, except for pts who were eligible for fiducialless Xsight Lung option. Treatment consisted of 48-54 Gy in 3 to 4 fractions for patients with centrally located lesions, and 23-30 Gy single fraction for peripheral lesions. Patients were followed with CT and PET scan to detect disease Local recurrence was defined as an increase in size of tumor following treatment as most tumors shrunk following radiation. Median follow-up was 20 months (range, 4-71months). Result(s): The Kaplan-Meier local control rate (LC) at 1, 2 and 3 years was 95.1%, 90.7%, and 86.9%; overall survival (OS) at 1, 2 and 3 years of 84.6%, 71.2% and 71.2%; disease free Survival (DFS) at 1, 2 and 3 years 63.5%, 48.7% and 40.2% respectively. The overall toxicity was very mild, with the majority of patients without any clinical side effect that did not interfere with their activities of daily living with the exception of fatigue which was experienced by many of them. In one patients with concomitant infection we observed a grade 3 acute pneumonitis, one patients developed significant thoracic pain related to high radiation dose received by the peripheral nerve. Conclusion(s): Cyberknife stereotactic radiotherapy, in patients with pulmonary metastases has been shown to be a promising treatment with high local control and low toxicity profile. Additionally follow up is needed to investigate the optimal radiation dose and overall treatment efficacy. Unfortunately, most patients die from progression of their disease systemically despite local control of their pulmonary disease.",Excluded
1686,"An examination of radon awareness, risk communication, and radon risk reduction in a Hispanic community Purpose: Radiation risk communication is a critical component of radiation protection and the public's understanding of radiation risks and benefits. Risk communication becomes even more complicated when considering cultural and language differences. In the US, many diverse communities face risk communication challenges. We obtained radon testing data to evaluate patterns of radon testing in Allentown, the third largest city in Pennsylvania. Radon exposure is the second leading cause of lung cancer after smoking and is associated with over 21,000 lung cancer deaths in the US annually. It is estimated that 1 in every 15 homes in the US has elevated radon levels above the recommended action level set by the US Environmental Protection Agency. Allentown has some of the highest reported levels of indoor radon in the country, yet only a small portion of the population has tested their homes. This is true particularly among self-identified Hispanics, who make up nearly half of the city's population. This study seeks to (1) characterize the difference in testing rates between self-identified Hispanics and non-Hispanics in Allentown, (2) quantify the level of radon awareness and knowledge, (3) identify potential obstacles to radon testing among the Allentown population that self-identifies as Hispanic, and (4) determine whether more effective risk communication is needed. Method(s): Radon test results in Allentown were analyzed to better understand the nature of radon testing. To evaluate radon awareness and knowledge, a cross-sectional study was conducted using a face-to-face survey. This data was informative in assessing testing and mitigation practices, ethnicity, income level, age, education level, homeowner status, zip code and primary language. Result(s): Ethnicity was an independent predictor of radon awareness and knowledge. Statistically significant differences were found between the number of self-identified Hispanics (39%) and non-Hispanics (84%) who indicated that they had ever heard of radon; 13% of Hispanics and 49% of non-Hispanics knew that they lived in an area with typically high radon levels. There was a statistically significant association between self-reported ethnicity and radon testing with non-Hispanics (43%) more likely to test their homes for radon than Hispanics (32%). Conclusion(s): Individual and community understanding of the risks of exposure to radiation sources such as radon is dependent upon communication that informs and spurs appropriate action. This study demonstrates the need for culturally appropriate radon risk communication strategies targeted to a Hispanic population. Successful communication will raise awareness and knowledge that can lead to better public health protection.© 2020, Copyright © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group LLC.",Excluded
1408,"RADIATION DOSE TO PATIENTS IN CORONARY INTERVENTIONAL PROCEDURES: A SURVEY The objective of this study was to evaluate dose-area product (DAP) and peak skin dose (PSD) for coronary angiography (CA) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The DAP and PSD of 300 randomly selected patients who were referred to CA and/or PCI, over a period of 3 months were recorded and analyzed. The mean DAP of 32 Gy cm2 and mean PSD of 412 mGy for CA were lower than 118 Gy cm2 and 857 mGy, respectively, for PCI. The DAP range of 2-84 Gy cm2 for CA and 12-378 mGy for PCI were also established. The maximum value of PSD for PCI procedures reached above the 2 Gy threshold for erythema. However, these values are similar to those available in literature. Periodic surveys may be required to monitor and/or reduce radiation doses in coronary interventional procedures.

2004,"Characteristics of urgent palliative cancer care consultations encountered by radiation oncologists Background: Palliative radiation therapy(PRT)is often employed in patients with advanced cancers requiring urgent consultation given the rapidity of presentation.We report on characteristics of urgent palliative oncologic issues encountered by radiation oncologists(RO). Method(s): We prospectively evaluated patterns of presentation in162 consecutive consultations for urgent PRT at 3 centers from 5/19/14 to 9/26/14.Survey of palliative care issues was completed by physicians/nurse practitioners including assessment of reasons for urgent radiation oncology consultation,disease presentation characteristics and site of RT delivery.Response rate was 86% with 140 of 162 responses received. Result(s): Median age of patients was 63 years(29-89)with 39% > 65, 41 % from 50-65 and 20% < 50 years;56% were males and 44% females. Most were married(62%)and 30% non-Caucasians.48% had ECOG PS 0-1,whereas it was 2, 3 and 4 in 24%,9% and 3%.Primary cancer diagnoses were lung (28%),breast(13%),prostate(10%),melanoma(10%),sarcoma(7%) and other diagnoses in 32%.Pain was predominant reason for consult(57%)followed by brain metastases(29%),spinal cord/cauda compression (13%),dyspnea (10%),bleeding (8%),bone fracture(4%)and dysphagia(2%).Clinicians managed pain (69%),neurologic symptoms(51%),fatigue (49%),intestinal(21%),respiratory (19%) symptoms,bleeding (14%),insomnia (13%),nausea/vomiting(12%)and dysphagia(6%).Patients presented at all stages 79% at the time of their diagnosis of metastatic cancer,63% with an established (> 1 month) metastatic cancer diagnosis and continuing to further cancer therapies and 17% proceeding to hospice care without further anti-cancer therapy after PRT. Conclusion(s): Radiation oncologists care for patients across time course of metastatic cancer diagnosis managing variety of urgent oncologic issues,most commonly metastases causing pain followed by brain metastases and cord compression.They also manage cancer-related symptoms,mostly pain,neurological symptoms and fatigue.These findings point to need for palliative care to be well integrated into radiation oncology practice including education and systems of care.",Excluded
2274,"Oral complications of head and neck radiotherapy: prevalence and management AIM: The aim of the study was to evaluate the short-term and long-term toxicity caused by radiation treatment in the head and neck with the technique of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT)., METHODS: We selected 20 patients, 18 men and 2 women aged between 21 and 71 years, undergoing radiation therapy (IMRT) in head and neck. Patients were visited during radiotherapy and followed for six months after the end of the therapy. We assessed the presence of: mucositis, xerostomia, dysgeusia, dysphagia, pain, trismus and, in the case of late-onset complications, radiation cavities., RESULTS: Acute toxicity: in 20 patients, 18 reported mucositis, 19 xerostomia, 17, dysgeusia, 15 dysphagia, 18 had pain and 3 patients had trismus. Tardive toxicity: in 14 patients, 5 reported mucositis, 11 xerostomia, 6 dysgeusia, 2 dysphagia, 3 had pain, 4 trismus and in 4 patients were found radiation cavities., CONCLUSION: Acute complications with higher prevalence were xerostomia (19 of 20 patients), dysgeusia of 2nd grade (11 patients of 20), mucositis of 1st grade and pain of 1st grade (10 patients of 20). Among the late complications it was noted a maintenance of the high prevalence of xerostomia (11 patients of 14) and an increase in prevalence of trismus (4 patients of 14) against a reduction of all other complications.

1260,"Endoscopic guided PCNL in the prone split-leg position versus supine PCNL: a comparative analysis stratified by Guy's stone score INTRODUCTION: The optimal patient positioning for percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) based on the complexity of stone burden is not yet defined. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the intraoperative parameters, effectiveness and complications of patients undergoing PCNL between the endoscopic-guided prone split-leg PCNL (ePSL) and the supine PCNL by stratifying patients according to Guy's stone score (GSS)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted of patients undergoing PCNL at two high-volume tertiary referral centers. At one center, patients underwent PCNL using the ePSL technique, while at the second center, patients underwent PCNL in supine. Patient demographics and stone characteristics, operative details, complications and effectiveness were compared between groups. The impact of obesity was also investigated., RESULTS: Of 830 subjects, a total of 449 (54%) underwent PCNL in ePSL and 381 (46%) in supine. The ePSL group had a greater mean age and body mass index. No statistical differences were found in gender, serum chemistry and Charlson comorbidity index. After stratifying patients by GSS, the differences in baseline stone burden between PSL and supine lost significance and both groups could be compared. Complications were not statistically different between both groups. Univariate analysis demonstrated that multiple tracts and lower pole access were more prevalent in supine. In addition, for GSS1-3, ePSL was correlated with reduced operative time, radiation exposure, length of hospital stay and need for secondary procedure. Multivariate analysis correlated ePSL with lower radiation exposure and need for secondary procedures (p = 0.01). In comparison to the whole trial population, the same tendencies were appreciated for obese cohort., CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report focusing on the performance differences between ePSL and supine PCNL stratified by GSS. Both techniques are safe, with a low rate of complications. For GSS1-3, ePSL reduces radiation exposure and requires less need for both multiple access and secondary procedure.",Excluded
2418,"Cardiac computed tomography previous to atrial fibrillation ablation - effects of technological improvements and protocol optimization BACKGROUND: Cardiac computed tomography (CT) can provide a precise tridimentional anatomic map and exclude intra-cardiac thrombus. We aimed to access the impact of CT protocol optimization and technological evolution on the contrast and radiation dose as well as on image quality previous to atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation., METHODS: From a prospective registry of consecutive patients who underwent cardiac CT in a single center, we selected 270 patients in whom the CT was done for evaluation prior to AF ablation and they were distributed in 3 groups: Group1: the first 150 patients included; Group2: the last 60 patients performed with the same CT scanner; Group3: the first 60 exams performed with the new CT scanner. Quality of the protocol was access based on radiation dose, contrast volume used, the use of a second (delayed) acquisition, and on quantitative image quality analisis (signal to noise and contrast to noise ratios; density homogeneity racio between LA and LAA)., RESULTS: We found a significant radiation dose as well as contrast dose reduction between the first and last subgroups (G1: 5,6mSv and 100ml; G2: 1,3mSv and 90ml; G3: 0,6mSv and 65ml). Even though group 3 had less radiation and contrast used it still had better quantitative image quality (signal/noise of 13,5; contrast/noise 14,8; density homogeneity racio of 0,92)., CONCLUSION: Protocol optimization and technology both contributed to significant lower radiation dose and contrast volume used on cardiac CTs prior to AF ablation, without compromising image quality.

2321,"Different pedicle osteosynthesis for thoracolumbar vertebral fractures in elderly patients Introduction: Pedicle screws' stability, especially in osteoporotic fractures, is a really problem for spinal surgeons. Nowadays, little is known about the influence of different screw types and amount of cement applied. This single-center retrospective observational study has the aim of evaluating the middle- to long-term mechanical performances of different types of screws in elderly patients with thoracolumbar fractures. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 91 patients (37 males and 54 females), treated between 2011 and 2016, affected by somatic osteoporotic fractures aged over 65 years were treated. We divided patients into three different populations: solid screws, cannulated screws and cannulated screws augmented with poly methyl methacrylate cement (PMMA). Patients were radiologically evaluated with X-rays in pre- and post-surgery and at the follow-up (FU). Clinical evaluations were made with VAS and Oswestry Disability Index. Result(s): A total of 636 screws were implanted (222 pedicle screws, 190 cannulated and 224 cannulated screws with PMMA augmentation). At FU, we found significative differences between populations in terms of mechanical performances. We founded five cases of loosening; these were reported in solid screws group and in cannulated screws one. No mechanical failures were reported in cannulated screws with augmentation of PMMA. No rods breakage cases were reported. Conclusion(s): All stabilization methods showed good clinical results, but cannulated screws augmented with PMMA seem to provide better implant stability with the lowest rate of loosening.

1429,"Does the effectiveness of recanalisation of chronic occlusion depend on the location of the obstruction? Aims: Reports concerning the efficacy of recanalisation of chronic coronary total occlusion (CTO) depending on occlusion site are inconsistent. Some of them indicate a lower effectiveness of recanalisation of the circumflex artery (Cx). Methods and Results: Between January 2011 and February 2015, 252 CTO procedures in 242 patients were performed. Characteristics of the occlusions, the procedures performed and the effectiveness of revascularisation among various coronary arteries were compared. In the study group, most of the patients were men - 201 (83.1%) - and 41 (16.9%) were women. The average age was 62.4+/-9.3 years. The incidence of the risk factors was: hypertension - 86.8% (n=211), hypercholesterolaemia - 99.1% (n=241), diabetes - 29.2% (n=71), smoking - 20.6% (n=50) and history of smoking - 58.0% (n=141). The artery most often opened was the right coronary artery (RCA) - 49.0% (n=125), followed by the left anterior descending (LAD) 32.9% (n=84) and the circumflex branch 18.1% (n=46). There were no differences in the duration of the occlusions among subsequent arteries. There was a difference in length of occlusion (mm): RCA - 30.5+/-13.5, LAD - 25.5+/-9.9, Cx - 20.2+/-8.3 (p<0.05 for all changes). J-CTO score for each coronary artery was as follows: 0 - 10.9% LAD (n=9) 23.9% Cx (n=11), 11.0% RCA (n=14); 1 - 31.7% LAD (n=26), 45.6% Cx (n=21), 22.8% RCA (n=29); 2 - LAD 37.8% (n=31), 19.6% Cx (n=9), 38.5% RCA (n=49); >=3 - LAD 19.5% (n=16), 10.9% Cx (n=5), 27.5% RCA (n=34). Mean J-CTO score for LAD was 2.19+/-0.95, for Cx 2.13+/-1.14, and for RCA 2.29+/-1.07 (p=NS between arteries). The longest procedure time of the revascularisation was PCI of the RCA (77.1+/-34.9 min, p<0.05 relative to the remaining vessels). Procedure time between the LAD (65.9+/-28.8 min) and the Cx (56.6+/-26 8 min) did not differ significantly. Fluoroscopy time was also the longest during PCI of the RCA (31.0+/-19.2 min, p<0.005 relative to other arteries), and did not differ between Cx (20.0+/-12.2 min) and LAD (25.3+/-16.8 min). There was no difference in the radiation dose (Gy): 2.5+/-1.7 vs. 2.2+/-1.3 vs. 2.5+/-1.3 (RCA, Cx and LAD, respectively) among vessels. The volume of contrast was similar during PCI of the RCA and LAD (365.8+/-161.6 vs. 371.3+/-149.4 mL, p=NS) and was significantly higher in comparison to PCI of the Cx (279.6+/-150.9 mL). The reverse technique (retrograde) was used most frequently during PCI of the RCA (30.4%, n=38), then LAD (19.1%, n=16) and significantly less during PCI of the Cx (4.4%, n=2). The number of implanted stents was significantly higher in PCI of the RCA (1.9+/-0.8) and did not differ between the LAD (1.3+/-0.6) and Cx (1.1+/-0.4). There was no difference in the incidence of complications depending on the artery opened: there was 1 stroke and 1 myocardial infarction during PCI of the RCA and 2 smaller perforations during PCI of the LAD and Cx. One tamponade was observed during PCI of the RCA. Efficacy of recanalisation was similar for all of the arteries: 82.4% for the RCA (n=103), 84.5% for the LAD (n=71), and 91.3% for the Cx (n=46). Conclusion(s): The most common artery we revascularised was the right coronary artery. It was characterised by the longest length of occlusion and required the longest procedure time and fluoroscopy time. Furthermore, it required the highest amount of contrast medium and number of implanted stents. Nevertheless, the efficacy was similar for all vessels.",Excluded
1701,"Hyperparathyroidism after thyroid surgery and autotransplantation of histologically normal parathyroid glands BACKGROUND: Parathyroid autotransplantation is a well-established method to prevent hypoparathyroidism during parathyroid and thyroid operations. The reported success rate of parathyroid autotransplantation ranges from 75% to 100%. Recurrent hyperparathyroidism may develop after parathyroid autotransplantation, especially after the transplantation of hyperplastic or adenomatous parathyroid tissue. Hyperparathyroidism recurs most frequently after subtotal parathyroidectomy or total parathyroidectomy and autotransplantation, in patients with renal failure and secondary hyperparathyroidism, and in patients with familial primary hyperparathyroidism or MEN I or MEN II syndrome. We report three patients who experienced primary hyperparathyroidism after autotransplantation of normal parathyroid tissue during thyroid operations (two patients) or after a long period of hypoparathyroidism., STUDY DESIGN: We reviewed our records from 1983 to May 1998 and identified three patients in whom hyperparathyroidism developed after thyroid operations., RESULTS: One patient had a thyroidectomy with left modified radical neck dissection for papillary thyroid cancer, followed by radioiodine ablative therapy. Two patients had thyroid operations for benign thyroid disease. One of these patients had a history of radiation exposure for acne, and in the other one secondary hyperparathyroidism arose 6 years after a thyroidectomy for hyperthyroidism., CONCLUSIONS: Our study documents that hyperparathyroidism may develop after autotransplantation of histologically normal parathyroid tissue and after a period of hypoparathyroidism after thyroid operations. For this reason, it is important to mark the site of the parathyroid transplantation.",Excluded
2287,"Congenital coronary anomalies detected by coronary computed tomography compared to invasive coronary angiography BACKGROUND: As coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) has emerged as a non-invasive alternative for evaluation of coronary anatomy with a lower referral threshold than invasive coronary angiography (ICA), the prevalence of coronary anomalies in CCTA may more closely reflect the true prevalence in the general population. Morphological features of coronary anomalies can be evaluated more precisely by CCTA than by ICA, which might lead to a higher identification of congenital coronary anomalies in CCTA compared to ICA.To evaluate the incidence, clinical and morphological features of the anatomy of patients with coronary anomalies detected either by coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) with prospective ECG-triggering or invasive coronary angiography (ICA)., METHODS: Consecutive patients underwent 64-slice CCTA (n = 1'759) with prospective ECG-triggering or ICA (n = 9'782) and coronary anatomy was evaluated for identification of coronary anomalies to predefined criteria (origin, course and termination) according to international recommendations., RESULTS: The prevalence of coronary anomalies was 7.9% (n = 138) in CCTA and 2.1% in ICA (n = 203; p < 0.01). The most commonly coronary anomaly detected by CCTA was myocardial bridging 42.8% (n = 59) vs. 21.2% (n = 43); p < 0.01, while with ICA an absent left main trunk was the most observed anomaly 36.0% (n = 73; p < 0.01). In 9.4% (n = 13) of identified coronary anomalies in CCTA 9.4% were potentially serious coronary anaomalies, defined as a course of the coronary artery between aorta and pulmonary artery were identified., CONCLUSION: The prevalence of coronary anomalies is substantially higher with CCTA than ICA even after exclusion of patients with myocardial bridging which is more frequently found with CCTA. This suggests that the true prevalence of coronary anomalies in the general population may have been underestimated based on ICA.",Excluded

The aim of this study was to report the usefulness of external radiotherapy (RT) for penoscrotal EMPD in an inoperable elderly patient. This report presents the treatment of an 89-year-old man with widespread penoscrotal EMPD. A multidisciplinary treatment team decided on radical RT. The patient received a radiation dose of 61.8 Gy in 30 fractions through electron and photon beams. His treatment tolerance was good, and no severe toxicity had been observed up the last follow-up. At 6.5 years after the RT, the patient showed no evidence of recurrence. Definitive RT resulted in excellent disease control and minimal toxicity; thus, it could be a promising nonsurgical therapeutic option for penoscrotal EMPD, even in extremely elderly individuals.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.",Excluded
1322,"Influence of topography on the endemicity of Kala-azar: a study based on remote sensing and geographical information system Kala-azar, a fatal infectious disease in many Indian states, particularly in Bihar, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, and Jharkhand, is caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani and transmitted by the sandfly vector Phlebotomus argentipes. The vector is distributed all over the country but the disease is confined to particular zones since before the last century. In this study, parameters such as altitude, temperature, humidity, rainfall and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were investigated for correlation with the distribution of the disease in the northeastern corner of the Indian sub-continent. Data analysis on Kala-azar prevalence during the period 2005-2007 in the four states showed that the highest prevalence was below 150 m of altitude with very few cases located above the 300 m level. Low NDVI value ranges (0.03-0.015) correlated with a high occurrence of the disease. The maximum temperatures in the affected sites varied between an upper level of 25-29 degrees C and a minimum of 16-20 degrees C. The rainfall in these areas fluctuated between 1154 and 1834 mm.

2137,"Different patterns of allelic imbalance in sporadic tumors and tumors associated with long-term exposure to gamma-radiation The study aimed to reveal cancer related mutations in DNA repair and cell cycle genes associated with chronic occupational exposure to gamma-radiation in personnel of the Siberian Group of Chemical Enterprises (SGCE). Mutations were analyzed by comparing genotypes of malignant tumors and matched normal tissues of 255 cancer patients including 98 exposed to external gamma-radiation (mean dose 128.1+/-150.5mSv). Also a genetic association analysis was carried out in a sample of 149 cancer patients and 908 healthy controls occupationally exposed to gamma-radiation (153.2+/-204.6mSv and 150.5+/-211.2mSv, respectively). Eight SNPs of genes of DNA excision repair were genotyped (rs13181, rs1052133, rs1042522, rs2305427, rs4244285, rs1045642, rs1805419 and rs1801133). The mutation profiles in heterozygous loci for selected SNP were different between sporadic tumors and tumors in patients exposed to radiation. In sporadic tumors, heterozygous genotype Arg/Pro of the rs1042522 SNP mutated into Arg/0 in 15 cases (9.6%) and 0/Pro in 14 cases (8.9%). The genotype Lys/Gln of the rs13181 SNP mutated into Lys/0 and 0/Gln in 9 and 4 cases, respectively. In tumors of patients exposed to low-level radiation, the rs1042522 Arg/0 mutated genotype was found in 12 cases (12.1%), while in 2 cases (2%) 0/Pro mutation was observed. Finally, the rs13181 0/Gln mutated genotype was observed in 15 cases (16,5%) . Thus, our study showed the difference in patterns of allelic imbalance in tumors appeared under low-level radiation exposure and spontaneous tumors for selected SNPs. This suggests different mechanisms of inactivation of heterozygous genotypes in sporadic and radiation-induced tumors. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Included
1559,"Protective Effects of Magnesium Sulfate on Radiation Induced Brain Injury in Rats OBJECTIVES: The effect of magnesium sulfate on brain tissue of SD rats irradiated by 6MeV electron was investigated., METHODS: SD rats were divided into three groups: control group, irradiation (IR group) and irradiation treated with magnesium sulfate (IR+M group). After being anesthetized, the whole brains of IR group and IR+M group were exposed to 6 MeV electron radiation. IR+M group was i.p. injected with 10% magnesium sulfate (400 mg/kg) one day before radiation and three days and five days after radiation. And on the 1st, 3rd, 7th and 14th day after radiation, SD rats were euthanatized to take brain tissue for the detection of calcium, redox status and cell apoptosis, as well as the expression of NF-kappaB and ICAM-1., RESULTS: The results indicated that magnesium treatment may alleviate the elevation of calcium and enhance redox status through increasing the activities of superoxide dimutase (SOD) and myeloperodase (MPO), and decreasing the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA). Tunnel and immunohistochemistry assay suggested that treatment with magnesium decreased the apoptosis rate of brain cells and the expressions of caspase-3, respectively. Decline of the expression of NF-kappaB and ICAM-1 protein was observed after the treatment of magnesium., CONCLUSION: All the results demonstrated that magnesium may elicit protective effect against radiationinduced brain injury by reducing calcium overload, improving redox and inhibiting cell apoptosis. Moreover, magnesium significantly down-regulated the protein or mRNA levels of NF-kappaB and ICAM- 1. The findings may provide references for the application of magnesium in clinic for brain injury induced by radiation.

1649,"Simplified screening for immune complexes by laser nephelometry of ultracentrifuged serum Serum samples were drawn from 14 healthy volunteers after an overnight fast and again after a meal. Each sample was divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 20 min, and a portion from the middle of the tube was removed by puncturing the tube's side. All samples were then added to cuvettes containing 0.14 M NaCl alone or 1, 2, 3, or 4% polyethylene glycol in 0.15 M KCl. The light scattering of each tube was measured. The centrifuged samples scattered 58% less light than the uncentrifuged controls. The range of values obtained with the centrifuged samples was also smaller as reflected in the standard deviation of the means obtained at each polyethylene glycol concentration. The coefficient of variation for replicate samples ranged from 0 to 16.6% (mean 5.8%), even when samples were processed differently. Storage at -70 degrees C significantly increased light scattering compared to baseline values. Serum samples were drawn from 44 patients with diseases that have been associated with immune complexes. Nephelometry selectively identified some groups of patients as abnormal. We conclude that preparative ultracentrifugation removes much of the background light scattering of serum samples, including that due to lipid, under conditions that do not sediment out immune complexes. Because it measures a physical property of immune complexes, this assay may provide information that is not available from biological receptor-based assays.",Excluded
2156,"T cell expansion study using the lesional skin provides evidence for the role of drug-specific Tc1 and Th17 cells in severe drug eruptions Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS) are life threatening adverse drug reactions. It is considered that antigen-specific T cells are involved in the pathogenesis. However, the role of drug-specific T cells in the skin lesions is not fully investigated. We expanded skin-infiltrating T cells from 4-mm biopsied lesional skin samples of TEN, SJS, DIHS, and erythema multiforme (EM) using anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies and IL-2. We obtained >107 cells/specimen by this method. For the drug reactivity, T cells labeled with CFSE were cultured with X-ray-irradiated PBMCs from the same patients and causative drugs, and the proliferation was assessed by flow cytometry. The cytokine profiles of responding T cells were also examined by intracellular staining for interferon (IFN)-gamma;, IL-4, and IL-17, or by cytokine quantification of the supernatants. Both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells proliferated to the causative drugs in all cases. Notably, 80% of expanded CD8+ T cells with the causative drugs expressed high levels of IFN-gamma. The expanded CD4+ T cells bore IFN-gamma, IL-4 or IL-17A at various frequencies. The culture supernatants contained IL-17A at various concentrations. The ability of T cells to produce IL-17A did not correlate with their ability to produce the other cytokines. In DIHS, however, the IL-17A production levels appeared to fluctuate in parallel with the clinical courses. Our results demonstrate that drug-specific T cells are definitely present in the skin infiltrate of severe drug eruptions. It is suggested that drug-reactive, IFN-gamma-producing CD8+ T cells infiltrate at a high frequency and Th17 cells also participate in the formation of lesional skin depending on cases.",Excluded
1944,"Hand osteoid osteoma: Evaluation of diagnosis and treatment Background: OO (osteoid osteoma) is a common, osteoblastic, benign bone tumor but rarely seen in the hand region. There is still some debate about the diagnosis and treatment of hand OOs. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the epidemiology, radiologic features, surgical treatment options and functional outcomes. Method(s): Between January 2003 and December 2014, surgically treated and pathologically verified 9 hand OO cases were investigated retrospectively. The preoperative and postoperative clinical outcome scores were calculated using the M2-DASH (Manchester-Modified Disabilities of Arm Shoulder and Hand) Score. Result(s): Lesion locations were as follows: middle phalanx in 2/9 (22%) patients (2nd and 4th digit), proximal phalanx in 6/9 (67%) patients (one 4th, two 2nd and three 5th digits) and metacarpal (2nd) in 1/9 (11%) patient. Incidence of nidus formation was 6/9 (67%) on X-ray, 7/9 (78%) on CT imaging and 2/9 (22%) on MR imaging. The mean time to diagnosis was 13.22 +/- 5.44 months. Preoperative mean M2-DASH score was 41 +/- 6 and postoperative was 7.4 +/- 8.6. Conclusion(s): Osteoid osteoma is usually seen below 25 years, and rarely found over 40 years of age. There is male dominance with a male to female ratio of 3:1. Delay of diagnosis may be encountered because of many differential diagnoses. When OO is suspected, CT imaging should be taken before the MR imaging. Because of superiority in soft tissue imaging, MR imaging should be an alternative tool in complex cases.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).",Excluded
1841,"Effects of a proton pump inhibitor on the physiological accumulation of fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) in FDG-positron emission tomography PURPOSES: The physiological accumulation of fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) is common in medical examinations of the digestive tract conducted using FDG-positron emission tomography (PET). The aim of this study was to determine the effects of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) on the physiological FDG accumulation in the digestive tract., METHODS: A total of 130 patients examined from July 2007 to October 2008 were included in the final analysis. A PPI was administered orally prior to FDG-PET in 65 patients. The remaining 65 patients underwent FDG-PET without administration of the PPI. The assessments used visual and quantitative evaluations., RESULTS: Visual evaluation showed that physiological FDG accumulation in the stomach was significantly reduced (p = 0.037) in the PPI group compared with the control group. The quantitative evaluation also revealed a significant reduction in the maximum standardized uptake values (SUV(max)) in the stomach in the PPI group compared with the control group (p < 0.0001). Physiological FDG accumulation in the colon showed a decreasing trend on visual evaluation in the PPI group compared with the control group, and the quantitative evaluation found a significant reduction in the physiological FDG accumulation in the colon in the PPI group (p = 0.045)., CONCLUSIONS: The oral administration of a PPI was effective for reducing the physiological accumulation of the FDG in the alimentary tract. However, based on the error associated with SUV(max) measurement, a quantitative evaluation should therefore be combined with the visual evaluation.",Excluded
2210,"Complete pathological responses in locally advanced rectal cancer after preoperative IMRT and integrated-boost chemoradiation Background and purpose: To analyze the efficacy and safety of a new preoperative intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and integrated-boost chemoradiation scheme. Patients and Methods: In all, 74 patients were treated with IMRT and concurrent standard dose capecitabine. The dose of the planning target volume (PTV) encompassing the tumor, mesorectum, and pelvic lymph nodes was 46 Gy in 23 fractions; the boost PTV, at a dose of 57.5 Gy in 23 fractions, included the macroscopic primary tumor and pathological lymph nodes. The patients underwent surgery 6-8 weeks after chemoradiation. Result(s): The complete treatment data of 72 patients were analyzed. Tumor downstaging was achieved in 55 patients (76.38%) and node downstaging in 34 (47.2%). In 22 patients (30.6%), there was complete pathological response (ypCR). The circumferential resection margin was free of tumor in 70 patients (97.2%). The 3-year estimated overall survival and disease-free survival rates were 95.4 and 85.9% respectively, and no local relapse was found; however, ten patients (13.8%) developed distant metastases. High pathologic tumor (pT) downstaging was shown as a favorable prognostic factor for disease-free survival. No grade 4 acute radiotherapy-related toxicity was found. Conclusion(s): The IMRT and integrated-boost chemoradiation scheme offered higher rates of ypCR and pT downstaging, without a significant increase in toxicity. The circumferential margins were free of tumors in the majority of patients. Primary tumor regression was associated with better disease-free survival. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
1389,"Nuclear cardiology practices and radiation exposure in Africa: results from the IAEA Nuclear Cardiology Protocols Study (INCAPS) OBJECTIVE: While nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) offers many benefits to patients with known or suspected cardiovascular disease, concerns exist regarding radiation-associated health effects. Little is known regarding MPI practice in Africa. We sought to characterise radiation doses and the use of MPI best practices that could minimise radiation in African nuclear cardiology laboratories, and compare these to practice worldwide., METHODS: Demographics and clinical characteristics were collected for a consecutive sample of 348 patients from 12 laboratories in six African countries over a one-week period from March to April 2013. Radiation effective dose (ED) was estimated for each patient. A quality index (QI) enumerating adherence to eight best practices, identified a priori by an IAEA expert panel, was calculated for each laboratory. We compared these metrics with those from 7 563 patients from 296 laboratories outside Africa., RESULTS: Median (interquartile range) patient ED in Africa was similar to that of the rest of the world [9.1 (5.1-15.6) vs 10.3 mSv (6.8-12.6), p = 0.14], although a larger proportion of African patients received a low ED, <= 9 mSv targeted in societal recommendations (49.7 vs 38.2%, p < 0.001). Bestpractice adherence was higher among African laboratories (QI score: 6.3 +/- 1.2 vs 5.4 +/- 1.3, p = 0.013). However, median ED varied significantly among African laboratories (range: 2.0-16.3 mSv; p < 0.0001) and QI range was 4-8., CONCLUSION: Patient radiation dose from MPI in Africa was similar to that in the rest of the world, and adherence to best practices was relatively high in African laboratories. Nevertheless there remain opportunities to further reduce radiation exposure to African patients from MPI.",Excluded
1760,"Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and short infusional 5-FU in advanced head and neck malignancies Background: Combination of radical surgery and radiotherapy is the standard management of head and neck malignancies. But due to considerable morbidity of surgery and associated cosmetic and functional deficiencies, often aggravated by adjuvant radiotherapy, many patients prefer only radiotherapy with its' decreased chance of survival. Proper surgical facilities are also not accessible to most of our patients. Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and loco-regional management by surgery and / or radiotherapy have emerged as a viable alternative. Aim(s): The purpose of this study is to find out the survival outcome as well as toxicity profile of Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and short infusional (3 hours) 5-FU followed by radiotherapy in advanced head and neck malignancies. Material(s) and Method(s): From June 2002 to December 2003, seventy four patients with advanced head and neck malignancies were planned to be treated with Cisplatin (50 mg / sq. meter) on Days 1 and 2 and 5 - FU (600 mg / sq. meter) on Days 1, 2 and 3 by 3 hour infusion on Day care basis. On completion of four cycles of chemotherapy at 21 days interval, all patients were destined to receive 6000 cGy of radiotherapy to the loco - regional site. Result(s): At one year follow up on completion of therapy, 57% patients were alive and 31% patients were disease free. These 31% patients enjoyed a good quality of life in terms of cosmetic and functional deficits. Toxicities were moderate and easily manageable. Conclusion(s): The study indicated that neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with Cisplatin and short infusional 5 - FU may be delivered on day care basis and results are comparable with Cisplatin and 96 hours continuous infusional 5 - FU. Thus avoiding the continuous infusional 5 - FU, 7 to 10 days in-patient hospitalization during each cycle may be avoided which is a constrain in developing countries like us.",Excluded
1810,"Proton pump inhibitor use and risk of community-acquired Clostridium difficile-associated disease defined by prescription for oral vancomycin therapy BACKGROUND: The association between the use of proton pump inhibitors and the risk of Clostridium difficile-associated disease (CDAD) is controversial. In this study we re-examined a previously reported association between the use of proton pump inhibitors and the development of community-acquired CDAD, this time using an alternative case definition of the disease., METHODS: We performed a case-control study of community-acquired CDAD using a United Kingdom clinical research database. Patients receiving oral vancomycin therapy were identified as having CDAD, the only indication for this drug. Each case subject was matched with up to 10 control subjects. Neither the cases nor the controls had been admitted to hospital in the year before the date of the vancomycin prescription (index date). Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to adjust for key covariates., RESULTS: We identified 317 cases of community-acquired CDAD treated with oral vancomycin therapy and 3167 matched control subjects. Exposure to a proton pump inhibitor in the 90 days before the index date was associated with an increased risk of CDAD (odds ratio [OR] 3.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.3-5.2). Antibiotic exposure in the 90 days before the index date was also a significant risk factor for community-acquired CDAD (OR 8.2, 95% CI 6.1- 11.0), even though 45% of the case subjects had not received a prescription for an antibiotic during that period. Certain comorbidities, in particular renal failure, inflammatory bowel disease and malignant disease, as well as prior methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection, were also associated with an increased risk., INTERPRETATION: Proton pump inhibitor use was associated with an increased risk of community-acquired CDAD, when cases were defined by receipt of prescription for oral vancomycin therapy. Prior antibiotic exposure was also a significant risk factor, but a significant proportion of the patients with community-acquired CDAD had no such exposure.",Excluded
2126,"PET quantification of brain O-GlcNAcase with [18F]LSN3316612 in healthy human volunteers Background: Previous studies found that [18F]LSN3316612 was a promising positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand for imaging O-GlcNAcase in nonhuman primates and human volunteers. This study sought to further evaluate the suitability of [18F]LSN3316612 for human clinical research. Method(s): Kinetic evaluation of [18F]LSN3316612 was conducted in a combined set of baseline brain scans from 17 healthy human volunteers and test-retest imaging was conducted in 10 of these volunteers; another 6 volunteers had whole-body scans to measure radiation exposure to body organs. Total distribution volume (VT) estimates were compared for the one- and two-tissue compartment models with the arterial input function. Test-retest variability and reliability were evaluated via mean difference and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The time stability of VT was assessed down to a 30-min scan time. An alternative quantification method for [18F]LSN3316612 binding without blood was also investigated to assess the possibility of eliminating arterial sampling. Result(s): Brain uptake was generally high and could be quantified as VT with excellent identifiability using the two-tissue compartment model. [18F]LSN3316612 exhibited good absolute test-retest variability (12.5%), but the arithmetic test-retest variability was far from 0 (11.3%), reflecting a near-uniform increase of VT on the retest scan in nine of 10 volunteers. VT values were stable after 110 min in all brain regions, suggesting that no radiometabolites accumulated in the brain. Measurements obtained using only brain activity (i.e., area under the curve (AUC) from 150-180 min) correlated strongly with regional VT values during test-retest conditions (R2 = 0.84), exhibiting similar reliability to VT (ICC = 0.68 vs. 0.64). Estimated radiation exposure for [18F]LSN3316612 PET was 20.5 +/- 2.1 muSv/MBq, comparable to other 18F-labeled radioligands for brain imaging. Conclusion(s): [18F]LSN3316612 is an excellent PET radioligand for imaging O-GlcNAcase in the human brain. Alternative quantification without blood is possible, at least for within-subject repeat studies. However, the unexplained increase of VT under retest conditions requires further investigation.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded
1296,"Comparison of three dosimetric techniques to take in account lung tumor motion: Gating-like technique results lead to advice the use of gating device even in the cases of pre-operative irradiation Purpose: Comparison of three dosimetric techniques of lung tumor delineation to integrate tumor motion during breathing. Patients and Methods: Nineteen patients with T1-3N0M0 malignant lung tumor were treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy (14 cases) or pre-surgery chemoradiation. Doses were, respectively, 66 and 46 Gy. CT-scan for delineation was performed during three phases of breathing: free breathing and deep breath-hold inspiration and expiration. GTV (gross tumor volume) was delineated on the three sequences. The classic technique included GTV from the free-breathing sequence plus a CTV (clinical target volume) margin of 5 to 8 mm plus a PTV (planning target volume) margin of 7 to 10 mm (including ITV [internal target volume] margin and set-up margin). The gating-like technique included GTV from the deep breath-hold inspiration sequence plus a CTV margin of 5 to 8 mm plus a PTV margin of 2 mm. The three-volume technique, included GTV as a result of the fusion of GTVs from the three sequences plus a CTV margin of 5 to 8 mm plus a PTV margin of 2 mm. Dosimetry was calculated for the three PTVs, if possible, with the same fields number and position. Dose constraints and rules were imposed to accept dosimetries: firstly spinal cord maximal dose less than 45 Gy, followed by V95 % for PTV greater than or equal to 95 %, and V20 GYGy for lung less than or equal to 30 %, V30 GYGy for lung less than or equal to 20 %. Result(s): GTVs were not statistically different between the three methods of delineation. PTVs were significantly lower with the gating-like technique. V95% of the PTV were not different between the three techniques. With the classic-, the gating-like- and the 3-volume techniques, dosimetry was considered as acceptable, respectively in 15, 18 and 15 cases. Comparisons of constraint values showed that the gating-like method gave the best results. In the case of pre-operative management, the gating-like method allowed the best results even for the V95% values. However, in the absence of gating device or without the possibility to use it, the 3-volume method allowed to take into account more precisely the organ motion than the classical technique. Conclusion(s): The 3-volume method can be done. It is a good method to take into account the organ motions. However, the gating-like method gives the best results leading to propose its use even for pre-operative patients with upper tumors. © 2009.",Excluded
1604,"Stereotactic radiosurgery of cranial nonvestibular schwannomas: Results of single-and multisession radiosurgery BACKGROUND: Surgical resection of nonvestibular cranial schwannomas carries a considerable risk of postoperative complications. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) offers a non-invasive treatment alternative. The efficacy and safety of multi-session SRS of nonvestibular cranial schwannomas has not been well studied. OBJECTIVE(S): To analyze the results of single-and multi-session SRS of nonvestibular cranial schwannomas. METHOD(S): From 2001 to 2007, 42 lesions in 40 patients were treated with SRS at Stanford University Medical Center, targeting schwannomas of cranial nerves IV (n = 1), V (n = 18), VII (n = 6), X (n = 5), XII (n = 2), jugular foramen (n = 8), and cavernous sinus (n = 2). SRS was delivered to a median marginal dose of 18 Gy (range, 15-33 Gy) in 1 to 3 sessions, targeting a median tumor volume of 3.2 cm3 (range, 0.1-23.7 cm3). The median doses for treatments in 1 (n = 18), 2 (n = 9), and 3 (n = 15) sessions were 17.5, 20, and 18 Gy, respectively. RESULT(S): With a median follow-up of 29 months (range, 6-84 months), tumor control was achieved in 41 of the 42 lesions. Eighteen of 42 lesions (43%) decreased in size; 23 tumors (55%) remained stable. There were 2 cases of new or worsening cranial nerve deficits in patients treated in single session; no patient treated with multi-session SRS experienced any cranial nerve toxicity (P = 0.18).

Forty patients with refractory DLBCL were treated with high-dose etoposide for stem cell mobilization. All patients were in progressive disease (PD) prior to mobilization and underwent high-dose chemotherapy followed by APBSCT. Successful PBSC mobilization was achieved in all patients. Twenty-three patients (57.5%) showed a clinical response to high-dose etoposide. After APBSCT, 17 patients (42.5%) achieved CR.

1736,"Abdominal aortic calcification on a plain X-ray and the relation with significant coronary artery disease in asymptomatic chronic dialysis patients Background: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is common in asymptomatic chronic dialysis patients and plays an important role in their poor survival. Early identification of these high-risk patients could improve treatment and reduce mortality. Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) has previously been associated with CAD in autopsy studies. Since the AAC can be quantified easily using a lateral lumbar X-ray we hypothesized that the extent of AAC as assessed on a lateral lumbar X-ray might be predictive of the presence of significant CAD in dialysis patients. Method(s): All patients currently enrolled in the ICD2 trial without a history of CABG or a PCI with stent implantation were included in this study. All patients underwent CT-angiography (CTA) and a lateral X-ray of the abdomen. AAC on X-ray was quantified using a previously validated scoring system whereupon the association between AAC and the presence of significant CAD was assessed. Result(s): A total of 90 patients were included in this study (71% male, 67 +/- 7 years old). Forty-six patients were found to have significant CAD. AAC-score was significantly higher in patients with CAD (10.1 +/- 4.9 vs 6.3 +/- 4.6 (p < 0.05). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that AAC score is an independent predictor for the presence of CAD with a 1,2 fold higher risk per point increase (p < 0.01). The AAC score has a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 57% for the presence of significant CAD. Conclusion(s): This study shows that abdominal aortic calcification as assessed on a lateral lumbar X-ray is predictive for the presence of significant coronary artery disease in asymptomatic dialysis patients. This simple, non-invasive and cheap screening method could contribute to early identification of patients eligible for further screening of CAD.Copyright © 2017 The Author(s).",Excluded
1682,"Clinical features of photodamaged human skin are associated with a reduction in collagen VII Chronically sun-exposed or photodamaged human skin is characterized by a number of clinical features, including wrinkles. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that underlie these features. We investigated the hypothesis that the mechanism of wrinkle formation may involve loss of anchoring fibrils, composed mainly of collagen VII, which are important in maintaining dermal-epidermal junction integrity. Ten volunteers with moderate to severe photodamage of dorsal forearm skin were recruited to the study. Using immunohistochemistry, transmission electron microscopy and in situ hybridization, we compared collagen VII protein and mRNA content of photodamaged forearm skin with that of sun-protected hip and upper inner arm skin from the same subjects. Numbers of anchoring fibrils per linear microns of basement membrane (mean +/- SEM) were significantly lower in photodamaged skin (1.79 +/- 0.10) as compared with sun-protected hip (2.28 +/- 0.11) and upper inner arm skin (2.21 +/- 0.10) (P < 0.01), and similarly keratinocyte expression of collagen VII mRNA, quantitated as number of positively stained keratinocytes per high power field, was significantly reduced in photodamaged skin (6.3 +/- 2.5) as compared with sun-protected hip (20.0 +/- 5.6) and upper inner arm skin (17.7 +/- 4.9) (P < 0.001). Semiquantitative assessment of immunohistochemical staining for collagen VII showed a non-significant reduction in photodamaged skin as compared with sun-protected skin.

1741,"Short-term Automated Quantification of Radiologic Changes in the Characterization of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Versus Nonspecific Interstitial Pneumonia and Prediction of Long-term Survival Purpose: Fibrotic interstitial lung diseases presenting with nonspecific and overlapping radiologic findings may be difficult to diagnose without surgical biopsy. We hypothesized that baseline quantifiable radiologic features and their short-term interval change may be predictive of underlying histologic diagnosis as well as long-term survival in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) presenting without honeycombing versus nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP). Material(s) and Method(s): Forty biopsy-confirmed IPF and 20 biopsy-confirmed NSIP patients with available high-resolution chest computed tomography 4 to 24 months apart were studied. CALIPER software was used for the automated characterization and quantification of radiologic findings. Result(s): IPF subjects were older (66 vs. 48; P<0.0001) with lower diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide and higher volumes of baseline reticulation (193 vs. 83 mL; P<0.0001). Over the interval period, compared with NSIP, IPF patients experienced greater functional decline (forced vital capacity, -6.3% vs. -1.7%; P=0.02) and radiologic progression, as noted by greater increase in reticulation volume (24 vs. 1.74 mL; P=0.048), and decrease in normal (-220 vs. -37.7 mL; P=0.045) and total lung volumes (-198 vs. 58.1 mL; P=0.03). Older age, male gender, higher reticulation volumes at baseline, and greater interval decrease in normal lung volumes were predictive of IPF. Both baseline and short-term changes in quantitative radiologic findings were predictive of mortality. Conclusion(s): Baseline quantitative radiologic findings and assessment of short-term disease progression may help characterize underlying IPF versus NSIP in those with difficult to differentiate clinicoradiologic presentations. Our study supports the possible utility of assessing serial quantifiable high-resolution chest computed tomographic findings for disease differentiation in these 2 entities.Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

1290,"Monitoring of residual hematopoiesis after total body irradiation in humans as a model for accidental x-ray exposure: dose-effect and failure of ex vivo expansion of residual stem cells in view of autografting PURPOSE: To evaluate the residual hematopoiesis at different levels of total body irradiation (TBI) dose in bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB), and to study the dose-effect relationship on hematopoietic immature and mature progenitors. We also investigated the possibility of expanding ex vivo the residual progenitors exposed to different dose levels of TBI., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eight patients treated for AML (n = 3) and myeloma (n = 5) were included. BM and PB samples were harvested before TBI and after doses of: 5 Gy. Mononuclear cells (MNCs) were assayed for burst-forming unit erythroid (BFU-E), granulocyte-forming unit macrophage (CFU-GM), and long-term culture initiating cells (LTC-ICs). Ex vivo expansion: MNCs (after irradiation and controls) were suspended in long-term cultures and expanded with a combination of five cytokines., RESULTS: CD34+ cells were detectable at 10 Gy. We observed a significant decrease of CFU-GM and BFU-E, respectively, to 13.5% and 8.5% of baseline values for doses <or=2 Gy and to 8.2% and 4.6% for doses ranging between 2.1 and 5 Gy. No dose effect was observed for residual MNCs. LTC-ICs were not detectable after 0.8 Gy. The expansion was not successful after 1.2 Gy., CONCLUSION: This study confirms the significant decrease of human mature and immature progenitors in BM and PB immediately after low-dose TBI. In addition, the lack of expansion suggests that autografting using BM or PB residual stem cells collected and expanded in vitro in case of accidental whole body exposure may be impractical.",Excluded

1468,"[Hereditary colorectal cancer: observations of a family study] Described in Switzerland in the early '60, the major features of hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer syndrome (HNPCCS) were established 20 years ago by H.

Both syndromes are transmitted by an autosomic dominant pattern. None of the known biomarkers are specific and/or sensitive enough to rely on their predictive values of patient's risks. A typical Swiss family was investigated on the basis of the cancer-prone family history. 21% of the family members observed over 5 generations presented one or more (30% of the cases) colo-rectal neoplasms at the age of 50. 55% of the tumors were right sided. Histologically, half of the tumors were mucinous. 30% of metachronous cancer appeared within 10 years. Polyps (1-3) and flat adenomas were associated to the lesion in 57%. Extra-colonic tumors appeared in 18% of family members and in half of the colon cancer patients. The sites of these tumors were the urinary tract, ovary, small bowel, breast and stomach. Two fibroblast strains of affected individuals were established. No increased tetraploidy was noted. Preliminary results suggest that this two strains are rather sensitive to ionising radiation. Often neglected, family history of colon cancer remains the major diagnostic and decision-making tool of a such syndrome. It will necessitate special treatment of affected subjects and early screening of the relatives.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Excluded

The objective of this study was to determine the outcomes associated with linear accelerator-based stereotactic radiotherapy or radiosurgery (SRT/SRS) of brainstem metastases. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed 38 tumors in 36 patients treated with SRT/SRS between February 2003 and December 2011. Treatment was delivered with the CyberknifeTM or TrilogyTM radiosurgical systems. The median age of patients was 62 (range: 28-89). Primary pathologies included 14 lung, 7 breast, 4 colon and 11 others. Sixteen patients (44%) had received whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) prior to SRT/SRS; ten had received prior SRT/SRS at a different site (28%). The median tumor volume was 0.94 cm3 (range: 0.01-4.2) with a median prescription dose of 17 Gy (range: 12-24) delivered in 1-5 fractions. Result(s): Median follow-up for the cohort was 3.2 months (range: 0.4-20.6). Nineteen patients (52%) had an MRI follow-up available for review. Of these, one patient experienced local failure corresponding to an actuarial 6-month local control of 93%. Fifteen of the patients with available follow-up imaging (79%) experienced intracranial failure outside of the treatment volume. The median time to distant intracranial failure was 2.1 months. Six of the 15 patients with distant intracranial failure (40%) had received previous WBRT. The actuarial overall survival rates at 6- and 12-months were 27% and 8%, respectively. Predictors of survival included Graded Prognostic Assessment (GPA) score, greater number of treatment fractions, and higher prescription dose. Three patients experienced acute treatment-related toxicity consisting of nausea (n = 1) and headaches (n = 2) that resolved with a short-course of dexamethasone. Conclusion(s): SRT/SRS for brainstem metastases is safe and achieves a high rate of local control. We found higher GPA as well as greater number of treatment fractions and higher prescription dose to be correlated with improved overall survival. Despite this approach, prognosis remains poor and distant intracranial control remains an issue, even in patients previously treated with WBRT. © 2012 Leeman et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
2396,"Cortical Bone Trajectory Screws in Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion: Minimally Invasive Surgery for Maximal Muscle Sparing - A Prospective Comparative Study with the Traditional Open Technique Introduction. A prospective comparative study between classical posterior interbody fusion with peduncular screws and the new technique with divergent cortical screws was conducted. Material and Methods. Only patients with monosegmental degenerative disease were recruited into this study. We analyzed a cohort of 40 patients treated from January 2015 to March 2016 divided into 2 groups (20 patients went to traditional open surgery and 20 patients under mini-invasive strategy). Primary endpoints of this study are fusion rate and muscular damage; secondary endpoints analyzed were three different clinical scores (ODI, VAS, and EQ) and the morbidity rate of both techniques. Results. There was no significant difference in fusion rate between the two techniques. In addition, a significant difference in muscular damage was found according to the MRI evaluation. Clinical outcomes, based on pain intensity, Oswestry Disability Index status, and Euroquality-5D score, were found to be also statistically different, even one year after surgery. This study also demonstrated a correlation between patients' muscular damage and their clinical outcome. Conclusions. Cortical bone trajectory screws would provide similar outcomes compared to pedicle screws in posterior lumbar interbody fusion at one year after surgery, and this technique represents a reasonable alternative to pedicle screws.Copyright © 2018 Nicola Marengo et al.",Excluded
2045,"Feasibility and reproducibility of hybrid 18F-FDG PET/MRI in the progression of early subclinical atherosclerosis (PESA) study Background: Although hybrid technology using 18F-fluordeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (18F-FDG PET/MRI) can provide in vivo molecular and anatomical information, data are limited regarding multi-territorial evaluation of atherosclerosis. Purpose(s): To assess the feasibility and reproducibility of 18F-FDG PET/MRI to characterize plaque burden, composition and inflammation in subclinical atherosclerosis. Method(s): A total of 938 asymptomatic participants with extensive atherosclerosis (age 48.0+/-4.3 years, 84% men) from the PESA (Progression of Early Subclinical Atherosclerosis) study underwent 18F-FDG PET/MRI of the carotid arteries, aorta, and ilio-femoral arteries 30 min after 18F-FDG injection (FDG dose 293+/-10.5 MBq, radiation dose 5.6+/-0.2 mSv). Arterial FDG uptake was evaluated on co-registered PET/MRI images using target-to-background ratios (TBR). Atherosclerotic burden was evaluated on T1-weighted MR images (indexed wall volume) and plaque characterization on T1- and T2- weighted MR images (lipidic, fibrous, mixed). Reproducibilities of FDG uptake and atherosclerotic burden/ composition were quantified in 15 PESA participants using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), kappa and Bland & Altman analysis. Result(s): A total of 842 (89.7%) 18F-FDG PET/MRI studies were available for final analysis (5.9% of which were incomplete, mainly lacking carotid imaging). FDG circulation time was 106.0+/-14.9 min for the ilio-femoral PET and 133.0+/-19.5 min for the carotid-aortic PET. Plaque composition analysis showed a Kappa value of 0.57. ICC of multi-territorial TBR was excellent (0.98; 95% CI of 0.97-0.98). ICC of multi-territorial indexed wall volume was good (0.89; 95% CI of 0.84-0.93). Bland & Altman plots showed good agreement for all explored territories, with mostly narrow confidence intervals (Figure). Conclusion(s): Hybrid 18F-FDG PET/MRI of multi-territory subclinical atherosclerosis in a single setting is feasible and highly reproducible, as demonstrated in the largest cohort ever reported for vascular PET/MRI, allowing multiparametric characterization of plaque burden, composition and inflammation.

1931,"Efficacy of gamma knife radiosurgery for small-volume recurrent malignant gliomas after initial radical resection Objective: To review the authors' experience with Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKR) for small recurrent high-grade gliomas (HGGs) following prior radical resection, external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT), and chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ). Method(s): The authors retrospectively analyzed 26 consecutive adults (9 women and 17 men; median age 60.4 years; Karnofsky Performance Status [KPS] >=70) who underwent GKR for recurrent HGGs from 2004-2009. Median lesion volume was 1.22 cc, and median treatment dose was 15 Gy. Pathology included glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; n = 16), anaplastic astrocytoma (AA; n = 5), and anaplastic mixed oligoastrocytoma (AMOA; n = 5). Two patients lost to follow-up were excluded from radiographic outcome analyses. Result(s): Median overall survival (OS) for the entire cohort from the time of GKR was 13.5 months. Values for 12-month actuarial survival from time of GKR for GBM, AMOA, and AA were 37%, 20% and 80%. Local failure occurred in 9 patients (37.5%) at a median time of 5.8 months, and 18 patients (75%) experienced distant progression at a median of 4.8 months. Complications included radiation necrosis in two patients and transient worsening of hemiparesis in one patient. Multivariate hazard ratio (HR) analysis showed KPS 90 or greater, smaller tumor volumes, and increased time to recurrence after resection to be associated with longer OS following GKR. Conclusion(s): GKR provided good local tumor control in this group of clinically stable and predominantly high-functioning patients with small recurrent HGGs after radical resection. Meaningful survival times after GKR were seen. GKR can be considered for selected patients with recurrent HGGs. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

1913,"Dynamic CT for parathyroid adenoma detection: How does radiation dose compare with nuclear medicine? OBJECTIVE. Dynamic CT is increasingly used for preoperative localization of parathyroid adenomas, but concerns remain about the radiation effective dose of CT compared with that of99mTc-sestamibi scintigraphy. The purpose of this study was to compare the radiation dose delivered by three-phase dynamic CT with that delivered by99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT performed in accordance with our current protocols and to assess the possible reduction in effective dose achieved by decreasing the scan length (i.e., z-axis) of two phases of the dynamic CT protocol. MATERIALS AND METHODS. The effective dose of a99mTc-sestamibi nuclear medicine parathyroid study performed with and without coregistration CT was calculated and compared with the effective dose of our current three-phase dynamic CT protocol as well as a proposed protocol involving CT with reduced scan length. RESULTS. The median effective dose for a99mTc-sestamibi nuclear medicine study was 5.6 mSv. This increased to 12.4 mSv with the addition of coregistration CT, which is higher than the median effective dose of 9.3 mSv associated with the dynamic CT protocol. Reducing the scan length of two phases in the dynamic CT protocol could reduce the median effective dose to 6.1 mSv, which would be similar to that of the dose from the99mTc-sestamibi study alone. CONCLUSION. Dynamic CT used for the detection of parathyroid adenoma can deliver a lower radiation dose than99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT. It may be possible to reduce the dose further by decreasing the scan length of two of the phases, although whether this has an impact on accuracy of the localization needs further investigation.Copyright © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded
2433,"Adjuvant external beam radiation for medullary thyroid carcinoma Background: Adjuvant radiation is rarely used to treat medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). We hypothesized that external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) would improve overall survival (OS) in MTC patients. Method(s): The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database identified patients who underwent total thyroidectomy and lymph nodes excision for MTC between 1988 and 2004. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for univariate comparisons of OS. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models controlled for gender, age, lymph node status, tumor size, extent of disease, and EBRT. Result(s): After 12 years, EBRT did not significantly improve OS (log rank, P < 0.14). In node-positive patients, univariate analysis demonstrated an OS benefit with EBRT (log rank, P < 0.05). In a multivariate model of node-positive patients, only increasing age (P < 0.001) and tumor size (P < 0.001) significantly influenced OS. Conclusion(s): The OS benefit attributed to EBRT in node-positive patients by univariate analysis could not be duplicated when controlling for known prognostic factors. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Excluded
2042,"Unstable chromosomal aberrations and micronuclei analyses in the biomonitoring of workers occupationally exposed to ionising radiation The quantification of unstable chromosomal aberrations and micronuclei in peripheral blood lymphocytes is a method commonly used in biodosimetry by cytogenetic analysis, especially when physical dosimetry cannot be performed. In this context, the aim of this research was to compare these methods in the biomonitoring of health professionals occupationally exposed to ionising radiation. In parallel, the C-banding technique was applied to confirm the presence of unstable chromosomal aberrations (dicentrics and rings). For this, samples of peripheral blood from health professionals of three hospitals (Recife - Brazil) were collected and lymphocyte cultures were carried out based on classical cytogenetic techniques. The number of cells scored per subject was the same (1000) for each assay. Among the individuals, those who do not usually wear a lead apron had higher frequencies of unstable chromosomal aberrations and micronuclei than the ones who carefully observe the radioprotection rules.

1863,"Ultra-low-dose CT-guided lung biopsy in clinic: radiation dose, accuracy, image quality, and complication rate Background: Computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous lung biopsy is usually performed by helical scanning. However, there are no studies on radiation dose, diagnostic accuracy, image quality, and complications based on axial scan mode. Purpose(s): To determine radiation dose, accuracy, image quality, and complication rate following an ultra-low-dose (ULD) protocol for CT-guided lung biopsy in clinic. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 105 patients were enrolled to receive CT-guided lung biopsy. The use of an ULD protocol (axial scan) for CT-guided biopsy was initiated. Patients were randomly assigned to axial mode (Group A) and conventional helical mode (Group B) CT groups. 64-slice CT was performed for CT-guided pulmonary biopsy with an 18-G coaxial cutting biopsy needle. The radiation dose, accuracy, image quality, and complication rate were measured. Result(s): Ninety-seven patients were selected for the final phase of the study. There was no significant difference between the two groups for pulmonary nodule characteristics (P > 0.05). The mean effective dose in group A (0.077 +/- 0.010 mSv) was significantly reduced relative to group B (0.653 +/- 0.177 mSv, P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in accuracy, image quality, and complication rate (P > 0.050) between the two modes. Conclusion(s): An ULD protocol for CT-guided lung nodule biopsy yields a reduction in the radiation dose without significant change in the accuracy, image quality, and complication rate relative to the conventional helical mode scan.Copyright © The Foundation Acta Radiologica 2020.",Excluded
2049,"Geometrical changes of parotid, submandibular, and thyroid glands during intensity modulated radiation therapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma Purpose/Objective(s): Both the tumor and organs at risk (OARs) occurred considerable changes during the intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) course for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). This study aims to analyze quantitatively the geometrical variations of the parotid, submandibular gland (SMG) and thyroid as three independent OARs throughout IMRT course. Materials/Methods: Twenty NPC patients received the definitive chemo-IMRT in 33 fractions within 6.5 week-long course. Each patient had a planning CT (pCT) and six weekly repeat CT (rCT) without enhanced contrast. Each rCT was rigidly registered to its pCT. The parotid, SMG and thyroid were manually delineated in the axial pCT and rCT imaging by a single radiation oncologist. When compared a contour in pCT with rCT, it was calculated the volume of each contour (V-pCT, V-rCT), the common volume (V-com) and the shortest perpendicular distance (SPD) between two contours. Each surface voxel of a contour in rCT has a SPD and the standard deviation (SD) of all the SPDs was calculated. Both the SPD and Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) calculated as 2*V-com / (V-pCT + V-rCT) were used as the surrogate of the shape variations. The displacement of center of mass as the positional shift was calculated and the mean displacement, system and random error were statistically calculated. The difference of geometrical changes among six week, the left- and right- sided OAR was compared using one-way analysis of variance or Mann-Whitney U test. Result(s): The mean radiation dose of the parotid, SMG, thyroid gland were 32.12 >= 11.2 Gy, 25.46 >= 8.62 Gy, 18.89 >= 10.24 Gy, (mean >= standard deviation) respectively. And their mean and maximal volume reduction were 28.6% >= 14.6%, 26.6% >= 17.1%, 12.3% >= 11.3% and 40.6% >= 12.4%, 38.9%>=14.9%, 16.3%>=14.3%, respectively. For the parotid and SMG, the volume loss per treatment day decreased from 1.7%, 1.6% in the first week to 0.5%, 0.6% in the last week, and that of thyroid was of 0.4% - 0.5% after the 2nd week. The center of mass displacement of parotid gland shifted medially 2.0 mm - 2.6 mm, SMG and thyroid did medially 0.1 mm - 0.5 mm. In addition, the displacement in anterior-posterior and cranial-caudal direction were < 0.6 mm. The 3-demensional vector displacements of the parotid and SMG were 2.2mme 2.9mmand that of thyroid were 4.0mm- 4.3 mm. The DSCs of parotid, SMGand thyroid showed the decreased time-trend. For the parotid, SMG, thyroid, the SD of SPDs increased from 1.5 mm e 1.8 mm in the first week to 2.1mme2.5 mm. The variations among the different weeks were statistically different (P < 0.05) and there was no difference between the left- and right-sided OARs (P> 0.05).

The control animals were sham radiated but were otherwise treated identically as those of the experimental groups. Blood samples were taken by cardiac puncture before radiation and 30 min after each exposure of 150 rads. The red cells were re-suspended in their own plasma and HMP pathway activity was measured in the suspension. The pathway activity showed a consistent but minor reduction in the experimental group, which became statistically significant after the total dose of 750 rads (P less than 0.020). In a separate study the changes induced by ionizing radiation in the erythrocyte enzyme NADH-methemoglobin reductase were measured using the same experimental protocol. The enzyme activity in the red cells of the experimental group varied between 34.90 +/- 2.17 to 161.95 +/- 5.34 I.U./ml erythrocyte pack.

1824,"Re-irradiation plus bevacizumab treatment in patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab (BEV) is increasingly utilized in the treatment of recurrent high-grade gliomas. However, the utility of BEV in the setting of re-irradiation has not been fully evaluated. We examined the timing of BEV treatment in relation to re-irradiation for recurrent high-grade gliomas. METHOD(S): We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas, treated between2007 and 2012, with a second course of radiation therapy. We compared overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) as calculated from the time recurrent highgrade glioma was diagnosed. RESULT(S): A total of 50 patients were identified with a median follow-up of 10 months (range 2.2 to 70). 12 patients received no BEV, 18 received concurrent BEV with re-irradiation, 16 BEV after re-irradiation, and 4 before re-irradiation. Median PFS was 14.4, 3.6, 5.8, and 3.5 months and median OS 25.2, 6.3, 9.9, and 5.7 months, respectively. There were no significant differences in age, sex, or number of surgical resections between groups. However, patients not receiving BEV were more likely to have received either concurrent or adjuvant temozolomide with re-irradiation (p = 0.002, Fisher's Exact Test) or to have been first diagnosed with low-grade tumors. No patients that received BEV prior to re-irradiation experienced overt radiation necrosis, whereas other groups experienced a 30-33% incidence of necrosis. CONCLUSION(S): In this small retrospective study, patients receiving no BEV had superior survival. However, selection bias, temozolomide use and histologymayaccount for this finding. Amongpatients receiving BEV, BEV administered following re-irradiation yielded the best PFS and OS. However, BEV with re-irradiation did not appear to improve PFS or OS compared with historical data with single agent BEV or re-irradiation alone.BEVdid not appear to lower incidence of radiation necrosis, except when given prior re-irradiation.",Excluded

2163,"Impacts of ionising radiation on sperm quality, DNA integrity and post-fertilisation development in marine and freshwater crustaceans Crustaceans have been designated as internationally important model organisms in the development of environmental radioprotection measures. Despite the known sensitivity of sperm to ionizing radiation, the impacts of chronic radiation exposure on male fertility in crustaceans have not been studied. For the first time, the present study aimed to assess the impacts of chronic radiation exposure on male fertility, sperm DNA damage and concomitant impacts on breeding in two amphipod crustaceans. Echinogammarus marinus and Gammarus pulex (male fertility only) were exposed to phosphorus-32 at dose rates of 0, 0.1, 1 and 10mGy/d and sperm parameters, DNA damage and knock-on impacts on breeding were assessed. Sperm quality parameters and DNA damage were assessed using a fluorescent staining method and single cell gel electrophoresis respectively. Concomitant effects of male exposure to radiation on fecundity were determined by pairing phosphorus-32 exposed males to unexposed sexually mature females. In E. marinus, a statistically significant reduction of 9 and 11% in the quality of sperm was recorded at dose rates of 1 and 10mGy/d respectively, with no significant effects recorded on sperm counts. Conversely in the freshwater G. pulex, no significant impact of radiation on sperm quantity or quality was recorded. For E. marinus, a statistically significant increase in DNA damage was recorded at doses of 10mGy/d. Reduced fecundity and an increase in the frequency of abnormal embryos was recorded in female E. marinus breeding with males exposed to radiation. These findings suggest sperm quality may be a sensitive indicator of radiation exposure in invertebrates with potential impacts on the unexposed embryo, though unclear dose-response and differences between two closely related species necessitate further study before robust conclusions can be drawn.

2200,"Aldehyde dehydrogenase, a therapeutic target in chordoma: Analysis in 3d cellular models Chordomas are rare, slow-growing tumors of the axial skeleton. These tumors are locally aggressive and refractory to conventional therapies. Radical surgery and radiation remain the first-line treatments. Despite these aggressive treatments, chordomas often recur and second-line treatment options are limited. The mechanisms underlying chordoma radioresistance remain unknown, although several radioresistant cancer cells have been shown to respond favorably to aldehyde de-hydrogenase (ALDH) inhibition. The study of chordoma has been delayed by small patient cohorts and few available models due to the scarcity of these tumors. We thus created cellular 3D models of chordoma by using low-adherence culture systems. Then, we evaluated their radiosensitivity using colony-forming and spheroid size assays. Finally, we determined whether pharmacologically inhibiting ALDH increased their radiosensitivity. We found that 3D cellular models of chordoma (derived from primary, relapse, and metastatic tumors) reproduce the histological and gene expression features of the disease. The metastatic, relapse, and primary spheroids displayed high, me-dium, and low radioresistance, respectively. Moreover, inhibiting ALDH decreased the radiore-sistance in all three models.Copyright © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): Subjects were 373 asymptomatic individuals who performed both low-dose chest CT and abdominal fat CT for medical check-up. Maximum bi-dimensional axial diameters of paracardial fats at right (RPF) and left (LPF) cardiophrenic angle portions, and epicardial fats around right (REF) and left (LEF) coronary arteries, and coronary sinus (SEF) were measured. Correlation between pericardial fat diameters and metabolic parameters were statistically analyzed. Result(s): RPF, LPF, REF, LEF, and SEF diameters were moderately correlated with abdominal visceral fat (AVF) area (R = 0.74, 0.70, 0.48, 0.41, and 0.53, respectively, p < 0.01) in Pearson's correlation analysis. In multiple linear regression analysis, coefficient of RPF for AVF showed highest value.

However, the effects of radiation therapy on telomere DNA of non-cancer tissue have not been thoroughly investigated. This study analyzed the telomere length of inpatients with cancer treated with radiation therapy to see whether the telomere lengths change in response to therapeutic radiation. Material(s) and Method(s): Twenty-five patients were enrolled in the study. The patients had lung cancer, prostate cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatoma, or rectal cancer. They received radiation therapy with a dose range of 15-74 Gy. The telomere lengths and telomere length distribution in peripheral leukocytes were analyzed by using a Southern blot-based method. Result(s): The telomere length and the telomere length distribution of the peripheral leukocytes did not change after radiation therapy. However, there was a significant proportional decrease in the short telomere fraction (< 4.4 kb) per day and per Gy. Conclusion(s): This observation suggested that the telomere length distribution of peripheral leukocytes could be affected by radiation therapy, and that the effect of radiation tends to appear in cells with short telomeres. Radiation therapy-associated somatic telomere length change within a short range of time, about three months or shorter, can be detected by analyzing the mean telomere length and telomere length distribution. © 2013 Informa UK, Ltd.",Excluded
1638,"Needle placement for piriformis injection using 3-D imaging Piriformis syndrome is a pain syndrome originating in the buttock and is attributed to 6% - 8% of patients referred for the treatment of back and leg pain. The treatment for piriformis syndrome using fluoroscopy, computed tomography (CT), electromyography (EMG), and ultrasound (US) has become standard practice. The treatment of Piriformis Syndrome has evolved to include fluoroscopy and EMG with CT guidance. We present a case study of 5 successful piriformis injections using 3-D computer-assisted electromagnet needle tracking coupled with ultrasound. A 6-degree of freedom electromagnetic position tracker was attached to the ultrasound probe that allowed the system to detect the position and orientation of the probe in the magnetic field. The tracked ultrasound probe was used to find the posterior superior iliac spine. Subsequently, 3 points were captured to register the ultrasound image with the CT or magnetic resonance image scan. Moreover, after the registration was obtained, the navigation system visualized the tracked needle relative to the CT scan in real-time using 2 orthogonal multi-planar reconstructions centered at the tracked needle tip. Conversely, a recent study revealed that fluoroscopically guided injections had 30% accuracy compared to ultrasound guided injections, which tripled the accuracy percentage. This novel technique exhibited an accurate needle guidance injection precision of 98% while advancing to the piriformis muscle and avoiding the sciatic nerve. The mean (+/- SD) procedure time was 19.08 (+/- 4.9) minutes. This technique allows for electromagnetic instrument tip tracking with real-time 3-D guidance to the selected target. As with any new technique, a learning curve is expected; however, this technique could offer an alternative, minimizing radiation exposure.",Excluded

1684,"Upper versus lower gastrointestinal bleeding. A direct comparison of clinical presentation, outcomes and the risk factors Objectives. Gastrointestinal bleeding is a frequent cause of hospital admission and is a factor in hospital morbidity and mortality. Understanding the cause and specific differences between the onset, signs and symptoms and evolution of upper and lower GI bleeding is essential for proper treatment. Our purpose was to compare prevalence, the onset, clinical outcomes and resource utilization between subjects with lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). Materials and methods. We did a retrospective study, during the period from January 1st 2018 to 15 March 2019, on batch of 418 patients admitted in Gastroenterology and Hepatology Clinic of Timisoara with gastrointestinal bleeding. Using clinical observations, assessing the serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level, hemoglobin concentration, platelet, white blood cell counts, proteins level, electrolytes, creatinine, urea and with the help of the endoscopy Results. Our study group includes 418 patients admitted in clinic with gastrointestinal bleeding. There is a higher prevalence of a upper gastrointestinal bleeding 80,14%(335) compared to lower gastrointestinal bleedings prevalence 19,86% (83). Etiology, for upper gastrointestinal bleeding includes: peptic ulcer 47,9%, esophageal and gastric varices 22,80%, Mallory- Weiss syndrome 4,65%, gastric cancer 2,32%, vascular ectasia 2,79%, Dieulafoy lesion 2,79%, esophageal ulcer 0,46%, jejunal bleeding 0,46%. For lower gastrointestinal bleeding etiology includes: diverticulum or diverticulosis 30,86%, hemorrhoids 18,51%, colonic polyps 14,81%, colonic cancer 7,41%, inflammatory bowel disease 4,93%,ischemic colitis 1,23%,irradiation colitis 3,70%. A 7,34% percentage of the GI bleeding didn't have an obvious cause.The mean age for UGIB was 58(+/-20) years and for LGIB 68(+/-5) years.Subjects with UGIB compared to LGIB had greater admission hemodynamic instability including tachycardia, lower blood pressure or shock. Severe anemia was present at 30% of patients with LGIB and at 52,13% of patients with UGIB. Creatinine, urea ratio was grown in UGIB. Generally a low level of protein is more common in LGIB group. For the other biological parameters evaluated there is no significant difference between UGIB group and LGIB group. Hematochezia and bloody diarrhea are most common in LGIB but they also appeared in 1,26% of UGIB. Melena appeared in 3, 57 % of LGIB (small bowel or cecal bleeding). Mortality was 11,94% in UGIB group and 6,02% in LGIC group. Resource utilization was similar in UGIB and LGIB including mean costs, length of stay and number of endoscopic procedures. Conclusions. This presentation could be useful for a rapid diagnostic and therapeutic orientation and and appreciation of the prognosis of bleeding.

2323,"Increased incidence of haematological cancer among physicians in a University Hospital OBJECTIVES: The oral report of eight cases of cancer over a period of 3 years among physicians working in a French University Hospital led us to conduct a retrospective cohort study to compare the incidence of cancer in these physicians with that of the general population living in the same area., METHOD: The cohort consisted of 940 physicians (72% male, 28% female) who had worked for at least 1 year in this hospital between 1945 and 1994 (a total of 10,693 person-years). The incidence of cancer among physicians was compared with that of the general population using a local cancer registry which has recorded all cancer cases occurring in the Department between 1979 and 1994. Standardised incidence ratio (SIR) was calculated for all causes of cancer and site by site., RESULTS: Although the global incidence of cancer did not differ from that of the general population (SIR=0.97; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59-1.5), a significantly increased incidence of haematological malignancy was found among physicians (SIR=5.45; 95% CI 2-11.9)., CONCLUSIONS: These findings pointed out the risk of lymphatic and haematopoietic cancer among physicians who started working after 1945 when the first rules pertaining to protection from ionising radiation came into effect. However, limitations of this study such as limited statistical power and lack of individual exposure data should be considered in the interpretation of these findings. Possible aetiological factors responsible for these risks are discussed. Education about general safety protection programmes against carcinogenic risk factors including physical, biological and chemical agents still remains a priority among physicians.",Excluded
2155,"Potential values of metabolic tumor volume and heterogeneity measured with 18F-FDG PET/CT pretreatment to evaluate local control for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated with nonsurgical therapy Objectives: The aim of the study was to evaluate the predictive value of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET/computed tomography (CT) pretreatment on local control (LC) and survival after radical radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and to discuss its potential value for establishing optimal radiation treatment plans. Method(s): Fifty-eight patients with pathologically proven esophageal SCC who underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT pretreatment in our center were retrospectively reviewed. We examined the correlation between the PET parameters of primary tumors and LC and overall survival. The coefficient of variation was used to estimate the 18F-FDG uptake in heterogeneity. Result(s): The mean duration of follow-up for surviving patients was 38 months, and 36 patients died because of tumor recurrence or other diseases. The rates of 3-year overall survival and LC were 40.4 and 50.4%, respectively. Multivariate analysis of LC revealed that metabolic tumor volume (MTV) greater than 16.08ml was the only predictor of outcome, with a lower 3-year LC (P = 0.017, hazard ratio: 1.608, 95% confidence interval: 1.090-2.371). The coefficient of variations of their primary lesion were higher compared with those of patients who had smaller MTVs. Conclusion(s): In this study, MTV assessed by PET/CT might be an adverse factor for predicting LC in esophageal SCC. For those with higher MTVs, higher intratumor heterogeneity suggests that irradiation may need to be boosted in stable high-uptake regions to improve LC. These results need to be prospectively validated in larger cohorts.Copyright © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1523,"A double-blind randomised controlled trial of a natural oil-based emulsion (Moogoo Udder Cream R) containing allantoin versus aqueous cream for managing radiation-induced skin reactions in patients with cancer BACKGROUND: Radiation-induced skin reaction (RISR) is one of the most common and distressing side effects of radiotherapy in patients with cancer. It is featured with swelling, redness, itching, pain, breaks in skin, discomfort, and a burning sensation. There is a lack of convincing evidence supporting any single practice in the prevention or management of RISR., METHODS/DESIGNS: This double-blinded randomised controlled trial aims to investigate the effects of a natural oil-based emulsion containing allantoin (as known as Moogoo Udder Cream R) versus aqueous cream in reducing RISR, improving pain, itching and quality of life in this patient group. One group will receive Moogoo Udder Cream R. Another group will receive aqueous cream. Outcome measures will be collected using patient self-administered questionnaire, interviewer administered questionnaire and clinician assessment at commencement of radiotherapy, weekly during radiotherapy, and four weeks after the completion of radiotherapy., DISCUSSION: Despite advances of radiologic advances and supportive care, RISR are still not well managed. There is a lack of efficacious interventions in managing RISR. While anecdotal evidence suggests that Moogoo Udder Cream R may be effective in managing RISR, research is needed to substantiate this claim. This paper presents the design of a double blind randomised controlled trial that will evaluate the effects of Moogoo Udder Cream R versus aqueous cream for managing in RISR in patients with cancer., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ACTRN 12612000568819.",Excluded
1606,"Radiosurgical techniques and clinical outcomes of gamma knife radiosurgery for brainstem arteriovenous malformations OBJECTIVE: Brainstem arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is rare and radiosurgical management is complicated by the sensitivity of the adjacent neurological structures. Complete obliteration of the nidus is not always possible. We describe over 20 years of radiosurgical procedures for brainstem AVMs, focusing on clinical outcomes and radiosurgical techniques., METHODS: Between 1992 and 2011, the authors performed gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) in 464 cerebral AVMs. Twenty-nine of the 464 patients (6.3%) reviewed had brainstem AVMs. This series included sixteen males and thirteen females with a mean age of 30.7 years (range : 5-71 years). The symptoms that led to diagnoses were as follows : an altered mentality (5 patients, 17.3%), motor weakness (10 patients, 34.5%), cranial nerve symptoms (3 patients, 10.3%), headache (6 patients, 20.7%), dizziness (3 patients, 10.3%), and seizures (2 patients, 6.9%). Two patients had undergone a previous nidus resection, and three patients had undergone a previous embolization. Twenty-four patients underwent only GKRS. With respect to the nidus type and blood flow, the ratio of compact type to diffuse type and high flow to low flow were 17 : 12 and 16 : 13, respectively. In this series, 24 patients (82.8%) had a prior hemorrhage. The mean target volume was 1.7 cm(3) (range 0.1-11.3 cm(3)). The mean maximal and marginal radiation doses were 38.5 Gy (range 28.6-43.6 Gy) and 23.4 Gy (range 18-27 Gy), and the mean isodose profile was 61.3% (range 50-70%)., RESULTS: Twenty-four patients had brainstem AVMs and were followed for more than 3 years. Obliteration of the AVMs was eventually documented in 17 patients (70.8%) over a mean follow-up period of 77.5 months (range 36-216 months). With respect to nidus type and blood flow, the obliteration rate of compact types (75%) was higher than that of diffuse types (66.7%), and the obliteration rate of low flow AVMs (76.9%) was higher than that of high flow AVMs (63.6%) (p<0.05). Two patients (6.9%) with three hemorrhagic events suffered a hemorrhage during the follow-up period. The annual bleeding rate of AVM after GKRS was 1.95% per year. No adverse radiation effects or delayed cystic formations were found., CONCLUSION: GKRS has an important clinical role in treatment of brainstem AVMs, which carry excessive surgical risks. Angiographic features and radiosurgical techniques using a lower maximal dose with higher isodose profiles are important for lesion obliteration and the avoidance of complications.",Excluded

1718,"Impact of VMAT-IMRT compared to 3D conformal radiotherapy on anal sphincter dose distribution in neoadjuvant chemoradiation of rectal cancer Background: Neoadjuvant radio- or chemoradiation (nIRT) therapy is the standard treatment for loco-regional advanced rectal cancer patients of the lower or middle third. Currently, intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is not the recommended radiation technique even though IMRT has advantages compared to 3D-radiation regarding dose sparing to organs at risk like small bowel and urinary bladder. So far, the benefit of IMRT concerning the anal sphincter complex is not examined. With this study we intended to evaluate the dose distribution on the anal sphincters of rectal cancer patients treated with IMRT in comparison with 3D-techniques. Method(s): We selected 16 patients for the IMRT-group and 16 patients for the 3D-group with rectal cancer of the middle third who were treated in our institute. All patients received 45 Gy in a chemoradiation protocol. Patients in both groups were matched regarding stage, primary tumor distance to the anal verge and size of the tumor. We delineated the internal and external anal sphincters, the addition of both sphincters and the levator ani muscle in all patients. Subsequently, we evaluated and compared dose parameters of the different sphincters in both groups and analysed the configuration of the isodoses in the area of the caudal radiation field, respectively. Result(s): Most of the relevant dose parameters of the caudal sphincters (Dmean, Dmedian, V10-V40) were significantly reduced in the IMRT-group compared to the 3D-group. Accordingly, the isodoses at the caudal edge of the target volume in the IMRT group demonstrated a steep dose fall. The levator ani muscle always was included into the planned target volumes and received the full dose in both groups. Conclusion(s): The modern VMAT-IMRT can significantly reduce the dose to the anal sphincters for rectal cancer patients of the middle third who were treated with conventional chemoradiation therapy.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).",Excluded

DARCA (AlluraXperSwing TM, Philips, the Netherlands) involves a pre-set rotation of the C-arm around the patient and allows for the visualization of each coronary artery in different views, using a single automatic pump contrast injection., METHODS: From November 2012 to February 2013, 201 patients were randomly assigned to either CCA (n = 100) or DARCA (n = 101). Exclusion criteria included acute coronary syndrome (ACS), prior PCI or CABG. CCAs were performed in 4 acquisition runs for the left coronary artery and 2 to 3 acquisition runs for the right coronary artery, whereas DARCAs were performed in a single run for each coronary artery., RESULTS: Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics were similar for both groups. The overall prevalence of CAD was 77.6%. The DARCA group had a significant reduction in the amount of contrast, 60 ml (IQR: 52.5-71.5 ml) versus 76 ml (IQR: 68-87 ml), P < 0.0001; and radiation dose by Air Kerma, 269.5 mGy (IQR: 176-450.5) versus 542.1 mGy (IQR: 370.7-720.8), P < 0.0001. There were fewer patients requiring additional projections in the DARCA group: 54.0% versus 75.0%; P = 0.002., CONCLUSIONS: In a population with a high prevalence of CAD, DARCA was safe and resulted in a significant decrease in contrast volume and radiation dose.

1740,"Sunscreen protection against cis-urocanic acid production in human skin Commercial sunscreens may offer some protection from immunosuppression induced by ultraviolet (UV) radiation, but agreement concerning the degree of protection is lacking. Cis-urocanic acid, formed by the photoisomerization of transurocanic acid is considered an important mediator of the cutaneous immunomodulation resulting from exposure to UV radiation. We investigated the effect of sunscreens on the isomerization of urocanic acid in 17 human subjects. Two sunscreens containing chemical filters, sun protection factor (SPF) 4 and SPF 10, and a SPF 10 sunscreen with a physical filter were applied at a thickness of 2 mg/cm2. The effect of a thin layer (0.5 mg/cm2) of the chemical SPF 10 sunscreen was also evaluated, as the amount of sunscreen applied in practice may be considerably less than recommended. All areas were irradiated with a single UV dose of 3.6 SED (standard erythema doses). In irradiated unprotected skin the median net production of cis-urocanic acid was 52% (relative amount). In the sites treated with the chemical sunscreens, the production of cis-urocanic acid was 7.4% (SPF 4) and 3.5% (SPF 10), and isomerization was thus reduced more efficiently at a higher SPF (p<0.01). The physical sunscreen reduced the formation of cis-UCA to 15%, and was significantly less effective than both the chemical SPF 10 sunscreen (p<0.01) and the SPF 4 sunscreen (p<0.01). The production of cis-urocanic acid in the area treated with the thin layer of the chemical SPF 10 sunscreen was 22%. The protection against the production of cis-urocanic acid was therefore reduced significantly (p<0.01) when the sunscreen was applied in an amount lower than recommended.",Excluded

1917,"Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy for patients with craniocervical or thoracic irradiation Background: Radiotherapy with high local doses to the craniocervical or mediastinal region is commonly employed for a variety of oncological diagnoses. However, even with modern radiation techniques, treatment associated morbidity is a limiting factor, the most important being severe mucositis, dysphagia, nausea and consequently significant weight loss. Many patients require invasive procedures such as parenteral nutrition or the placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) to ensure sufficient calorie intake during and after the course of treatment. Patients and Methods: We have considered 71 patients who, from Jan 2014 until Oct 2015 and in association with their course of radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy of the head, neck, or thoracic region, received a PEG via standard endoscopic or reverse (so called PEXACT) procedure. Diagnoses and accordingly therapy regimens varied: Patients receiving chemoradiotherapy (n=34), Cetuximab-based immune-radiotherapy (n=11) or definitive radiotherapy (n=7) for HNSCC were most common, followed by spinal bone metastases (n=6) and thoracic esophageal carcinoma (n=4) among others. HNSCC patients received a mean cumulative dose of 55,6 Gy (stdev=4,4Gy) to the cervical lymph nodes with involved regions being boosted up to a mean cumulative dose of 69,2 Gy (stdev=4,9Gy). Concomitant Chemotherapy was applied in the form of either a median of 4 weekly courses of Cisplatin or two courses of Carboplatin/5-FU in week 1 and 5 of radiotherapy. A median of 6 weekly courses of Cetuximab was applied. We retrospectively analyzed the development of patient body weight, BMI and general performance during radiotherapy. Result(s): Mean initial BMI was 23,5 (stdev=4,7). PEG placement was performed after a mean period of 18 days into radiotherapy. Mean cumulative dose applied up to that point was 32,6 Gy accounting for 50,7% of the overall dose. Median weight loss before PEG placement was 1 kg (range 0-9kg). 70% of patients (n=48) consequently were able to stabilize their body weight within a range of +/-2 kg, 23% (n=16) continued to lose weight (mean of 4kg), 7% (n=5) gained weight. PEG-related CTCAE grade 3 or higher complications, none fatal, were observed in 3 cases in the form of PEG dislocation and severe infection with subsequent surgical intervention. Mild local infection was observed in 6 cases and treated antibiotically without further complications. Conclusion(s): PEG is a valid and important supportive procedure to ensure sufficient calorie intake during the course of craniocervical or thoracic irradiation and can help avoid weight loss and consequently poor patient performance. The requirement of a PEG is generally associated with high doses applied to the mucosa of the upper GI-tract. It is crucial to determine valid prognostic factors for PEG-requirement in addition to the best timing of PEG placement during radiotherapy. Further clinical analyses are underway, for which this data will serve as basis.",Excluded

Frequently, patients with osteoarthritis (OA) are misdiagnosed as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in primary care centers, leading to wrong treatment and consequent clinical and pharmacoeconomic impact Objectives The objective of this study was to describe demographic and clinical characteristics of a cohort of patients derived to a specialized RA center with presumptive RA diagnosis and finally diagnosed as osteoarthritis Methods A descriptive, cross sectional study. Patients were referred and assisted to a specialized RA center in a 24 month period with presumptive diagnosis of this disease. A complete medical record was fulfilled by a rheumatologist; it was measured rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated antibodies, and other laboratories depending on each case. Also were made x-rays of hands, and in some cases of persistent doubt about the diagnosis was requested comparative MRI of hands. Frequencies and Percentages were calculated for the demographic and clinical characteristics of the cohort of patients Results From a total of 3665 Patients derived to specialized in RA center with presumptive RA diagnosis, after medical and laboratory evaluation 1451 (39.6%) had a wrong RA diagnosis; of them 1116 patients (76.9%) had finally osteoarthritis diagnosis.

The primary tumors included malignant melanoma (n = 10), non-small cell lung carcinoma (n = 6), renal cell carcinoma (n = 3), colorectal carcinoma (n = 1), oropharyngeal carcinoma (n = 1), and adenocarcinoma of unknown origin (n = 3). All tumors were less than or equal to 3.0 cm in greatest diameter. Twenty patients received a planned combination of 30-40 Gy whole brain fractionated irradiation and a radiosurgical ""boost"" of 16-20 Gy to the tumor margins; one patient refused conventional fractionated irradiation. Three patients with recurrent, persistent, or new non-small cell lung carcinomas had radiosurgical treatment 12-20 months after receiving 30-42.5 Gy whole-brain external beam irradiation. Stereotactic computed tomographic imaging was used for target coordinate determination and imaging-integrated dose planning. All tumors were enclosed by the 50-90% isodose shell using one (n = 22), two (n = 1), or three (n = 1) irradiation isocenters. During this 23-month period (median follow-up of 7 months) no patient died from progression of a radiosurgically-treated brain metastasis. Ten patients died of systemic disease (n = 8) or remote central nervous system metastasis (n = 2) between 1 week and 10 months after radiosurgery. One patient had tumor progression and underwent craniotomy and tumor excision 5 months after radiosurgery. To date, median survival after radiosurgery has been 10 months; 1-year survival was 33.3%. Stereotactic radiosurgery eliminated the surgical and anesthetic risks associated with craniotomy and resection of solitary brain metastases.

1909,"Cancer risk estimation of genotoxic chemicals based on target dose and a multiplicative model A mechanistic model and associated procedures are proposed for cancer risk assessment of genotoxic chemicals. As previously shown for ionizing radiation, a linear multiplicative model was found to be compatible with published experimental data for ethylene oxide, acrylamide, and butadiene. The validity of this model was anticipated in view of the multiplicative interaction of mutation with inherited and acquired growth-promoting conditions. Concurrent analysis led to rejection of an additive model (i.e. the model commonly applied for cancer risk assessment). A reanalysis of data for radiogenic cancer in mouse, dog and man shows that the relative risk coefficient is approximately the same (0.4 to 0.5 percent per rad) for tumours induced in the three species. Doses in vivo, defined as the time- integrated concentrations of ultimate mutagens, expressed in millimol x kg- 1 x h (mMh) are, like radiation doses given in Gy or rad, proportional to frequencies of potentially mutagenic events. The radiation dose equivalents of chemical doses are, calculated by multiplying chemical doses (in mMh) with the relative genotoxic potencies (in rad x mMh-1) determined in vitro. In this way the relative cancer incidence increments in rats and mice exposed to ethylene oxide were shown to be about 0.4 percent per rad-equivalent, in agreement with the data for radiogenic cancer. Our analyses suggest that values of the relative risk coefficients for genotoxic chemicals are independent of species and that relative cancer risks determined in animal tests apply also to humans. If reliable animal test data are not available, cancer risks may be estimated by the relative potency.

2303,"Liver cancers in Mayak workers Liver cancer mortality risks were evaluated in 11,000 workers who started working at the 'Mayak' Production Association in 1948-1958 and who were exposed to both internally deposited plutonium and external gamma radiation. Comparisons with Russian liver cancer incidence rates indicate excess risk, especially among those with detectable plutonium body burdens and among female workers in the plutonium plant. Comparisons within the Mayak worker cohort which evaluate the role of plutonium body burden with adjustment for cumulative external dose indicate excess risk among workers with burdens estimated to exceed 7.4 kBq (relative risk = 17; 95% CI = 8.0-36) and among workers in the plutonium plant who did not have routine plutonium monitoring data based on urine measurements (relative risk = 2.8; 95% CI = 1.3-6.2). In addition, analyses treating the estimated plutonium body burden as a continuous variable indicate increasing risk with increasing burden (P < 0.001). Relative risks tended to be higher for females than for males, probably because of the lower baseline risk and the higher levels of plutonium measured in females. Because of limitations in current plutonium dosimetry, no attempt was made to quantify liver cancer risks from plutonium in terms of organ dose, and risk from external dose could not be reliably evaluated.

2332,"Clinical factors increasing radiation doses to patients undergoing long-lasting procedures: Abdominal stent-graft implantation Background: An important negative factor of EVAR is the radiation acquired during long-lasting procedures. The aim of the study was to document the radiation doses of EVAR and to discuss potential reasons for prolongation of radiological procedures. Material/Methods: Dose-area product (DAP) (Gy cm2) and air kerma (AK) (Gy) obtained during EVAR from 92 patients were analyzed retrospectively in regards to body mass index (BMI), angulations of aneurysm neck, length of aneurysm neck and occurrence of tortuosity of iliac arteries. Result(s): Total AK for fuoroscopy differed signifcantly between normal BMI (373 mGy) and BMI 25-29.9 (1125 mGy) or BMI >30 (1085 mGy). Iliac artery tortuosities >45degree and short aneurysm necks caused higher doses of total AK (1097 mGy and 1228 mGy, respectively) than iliac artery tortuosities <45degree and long aneurysm necks (605 mGy and 720 mGy, respectively). Conclusion(s): The main factors contributing to a high radiation dose being acquired by patients during EVAR are: BMI >25, tortuosity of iliac arteries >45degree and short aneurysm necks. © Med Sci Monit, 2011.",Excluded
1593,"PATIENT DOSES IN COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY EXAMINATIONS IN TWO REGIONS OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION Computed tomography (CT) is often a justified diagnostic tool, but is also associated with high exposure of the patients. Due to the rapid increase in the number of CT units and thus the availability of CT examinations in Russia, there is a growing need for optimisation within this field. In order to develop proper optimisation procedures for CT, the two regions St. Petersburg and Belgorod of Russia were chosen, representing an urban and a rural region, respectively. In 2014, a survey was conducted of the parameters applied in CT examinations in these regions, and the results show that the highest effective doses were observed for investigations of abdomen, reaching up to 137 mSv, and pelvic CT examinations, reaching up to 58 mSv, both with contrast agents. The dose distributions were approximately log-normal, and for the majority of the examinations, the 75th percentiles of the CT dose distributions in the Belgorod region were higher than observed in St. Petersburg. The aim of the current project is primarily to define and implement diagnostic reference levels as a part of the process of optimisation of CT examinations in Russia. Copyright © The Author 2016.

The 27 patients with radiotherapy had a conventional dosage, 220 cGy per fraction, or less. The median interval between the completion of radiotherapy and the evaluation of neuropsychological function was 1.7 years. Groups were matched for age and educational level. The results showed that our NPC group with radiotherapy had neuropsychological impairments in the areas of auditory attention/concentration, immediate and delayed verbal recall and immediate visual recall, and recent memory, higher-order visuospatial abilities, and bimanual dexterity. Thus neuropsychological dysfunction may occur in patients with NPC within the first 2 years after radiotherapy.",Included
1951,"Comparing the efficiency of Er,Cr:YSGG laser and diode laser on human beta-defensin-1 and IL-1beta levels during the treatment of generalized aggressive periodontitis and chronic periodontitis Background: The aim of this study is to determine the suitability of the Er,Cr:YSGG and 940 +/- 15-nm diode laser for the treatment of generalized aggressive periodontitis and chronic periodontitis by measuring the levels of human beta-defensin-1 and IL-1beta. Patients and Methods: A total of 26 patients were included in this study. The study was designed as a ""split-mouth"" experiment. We performed scaling and root planing in the right maxillary quadrant, scaling and root planning + Er,Cr:YSGG laser in the left maxillary quadrant, scaling and root planning + 940 +/- 15-nm diode laser in the left mandibular quadrant, and only scaling and root planing in the right mandibular quadrant. The presence of human beta-defensin-1 and IL-1beta was analyzed with an ELISA. Result(s): When the baseline and post-treatment human beta-defensin-1 levels and IL-1beta levels of the study groups were evaluated, a decrease in human beta-defensin-1 and IL-1beta were observed in the quadrant where the Er,Cr:YSGG laser was applied in both the generalized aggressive periodontitis group and the chronic periodontitis group. Conclusion(s): The use of the Er,Cr:YSGG laser at non-surgical periodontal treatment decreased both IL-1beta and human beta-defensin-1 levels.

1697,"The effect of body mass index on fluoroscopic time and radiation dose during lumbar transforaminal epidural steroid injections OBJECTIVE: Transforaminal epidural steroid injections (TFESIs) are a commonly used, effective treatment for radicular pain. Accurate delivery of the injected medication helps to ensure maximum therapeutic efficacy and to decrease possible adverse events, and fluoroscopy is the preferred and most common image-guidance modality used to ensure accurate needle placement during lumbar TFESIs. However, fluoroscopic-guided lumbar TFESIs put patients at risk because of radiation exposure. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and fluoroscopy time and radiation dose during lumbar TFESIs., DESIGN: A retrospective study design was used., SETTING: The study was conducted at an academic orthopedic center. All procedures were performed by physicians board-certified in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&R) and with subspecialty certification in sports medicine, or by a trainee under close supervision from an attending physician., PARTICIPANTS: Participants were patients who underwent fluoroscopic-guided lumbar TFESIs between February 2013 and March 2015 with a documented height/weight, fluoroscopy time, and radiation dose., INTERVENTIONS: All patients received unilateral or bilateral lumbar TFESIs with fluoroscopic guidance. Fluoroscopy time and dose were recorded., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measures were fluoroscopy time and radiation dose. A Bonferroni correction was implemented for multiple comparisons, defining statistical significance at p<.01., RESULTS: A total of 2,443 injections were performed on 1,548 patients. There were 419 normal, 572 overweight, and 557 obese patients, respectively. There were 1,426 first-time injections and 1,017 repeat injections. Sixty-nine percent (1,681) were unilateral injections, and 26.4% (645) were single level injections. A trainee was involved in 1,361 (55.7%) of the injections performed. The mean fluoroscopy time for all injections was 30.0+/-17.5 seconds, and the mean radiation dose was 2,164+/-1,484 mGy-cm(2). The mean fluoroscopy time was 27.7+/-15.2 seconds for normal weight patients, 30.0+/-21.0 seconds for overweight patients, and 32.2+/-15.1 seconds for obese patients, showing a significant difference between groups (p<.001). The mean radiation doses for each group were 1,376+/-450, 1,911+/-653, and 3,029+/-640 mGy-cm(2), respectively, with a significant increase in radiation dose with increasing BMI (p<.001)., CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study demonstrate that fluoroscopy radiation dose and fluoroscopy time during lumbar TFESIs are increased in patients with an elevated BMI, and in patients of greater age, but the presence of a trainee had no effect on fluoroscopy time.

2278,"Prospective evaluation of a dedicated spine radiosurgery program using the Elekta Synergy S system Cone beam CT (CBCT) image guidance has recently been adopted for the delivery of spine radiosurgery. In 2007, the authors' institution began a dedicated spine radiosurgery program using the Elekta Synergy S system, which incorporates CBCT technology. In this study, the authors prospectively evaluated the Synergy S platform as a dedicated spine radiosurgery delivery system, including an evaluation of the accuracy of patient positioning using this technology, as part of a quality assurance program. One hundred sixty-six spine and paraspinal lesions were treated using the Elekta Synergy S 6-MV LINAC with a beam modulator and CBCT image guidance combined with a HexaPOD couch that allows correction of patient positioning in 3 translational and 3 rotational directions. Stratifying the lesion by location, there were 28 cervical, 69 thoracic, 48 lumbar, and 21 sacral lesions. The most common histological types for the metastatic lesions (136 cases total) were breast, lung, sarcomas, and renal cells. The most common benign tumors (30 cases total) included 10 schwannomas, 5 neurofibromas, and 5 meningiomas. Twenty-eight lesions (17%) were intradural. To measure intratreatment patient movement, 3 quality assurance CBCTs were performed and recorded at separate times: immediately before treatment started; at the first third of the procedure; and at the second third of the procedure. The positioning data and fused images of the planning CT and CBCT were analyzed to determine intrafraction patient movements. From each of 3 quality assurance CBCT images, 3 translational and 3 rotational coordinates were obtained. The prescribed dose to the gross tumor volume, delivered in a single fraction, ranged from 12 to 20 Gy (mean 16 Gy) in this cohort. This dose was delivered by between 7 and 14 coplanar intensity-modulated radiation therapy beams (mean 9 beams). The gross tumor volumes ranged from 1.2 to 491.7 cm(3) (mean 39.2 cm(3)). Mean treatment time including setup was 64 minutes. At the first third of the treatment, the magnitude of the 3D translational vector (X, Y, Z) was 1.1 +/- 0.7 mm. Similarly, the 3D translational vector at the second third of the treatment was 1.0 +/- 0.6 mm. The means +/- SDs of the rotational angles were 0.2degree +/- 0.4degree, 0.4degree +/- 0.5degree, and 0.3degree +/- 0.5degree along yaw, roll, and pitch, respectively, at the first third of the treatment, and 0.2degree +/- 0.3degree, 0.4degree +/- 0.5degree, and 0.4degree +/- 0.5degree, respectively, at the second third of the treatment. Single-fraction spine radiosurgery performed using the Synergy S platform and incorporating CBCT image guidance was determined to be feasible, accurate, and safe.

We report results of a phase I/II trial of PRT in patients with chordoma/chondrosarcoma. Method(s): Twenty adult patients with pathologically confirmed, nonmetastatic chordoma or chondrosarcoma were enrolled in a single-institution prospective trial of PRT from 2010 to 2014. Seventeen patients received adjuvant PRT and three received definitive PRT. Median dose was 73.8 Gy(RBE; range 68.4-79.2 Gy) using PRT-only (n = 6) or combination PRT/intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) (n = 14). Quality-of-life (QOL) and fatigue were assessed weekly and every 3 months posttreatment with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Brain (FACTBr) and Brief Fatigue Inventory. Primary endpoint was feasibility (90% completing treatment with < 10 day treatment delay and <= 20% unexpected acute grade >= 3 toxicity). Result(s): Tumors included chordomas of the skull base (n = 10), sacrum (n = 5), and cervical spine (n = 3), and skull base chondrosarcomas (n = 2). Median age was 57. The 80% had positive margins/gross disease. Median follow-up was 37 months. Feasibility endpoints were met. The 3-year local control and progression-free survival was 86% and 81%. There were no deaths. Two patients had acute grade 3 toxicity (both fatigue). One had late grade 3 toxicity (epistaxis and osteoradionecrosis). There were no significant differences in patient reported fatigue or QOL from baseline to the end-of-treatment.

2297,"Pulmonary nodules detected at lung cancer screening: Interobserver variability of semiautomated volume measurements Purpose: To retrospectively determine interobserver variability of semiautomated volume measurements of pulmonary nodules and the potential reasons for variability. Material(s) and Method(s): The Dutch-Belgian lung cancer screening trial (NELSON) is a lung cancer screening study that includes men between the ages of 50 and 75 years who are current or former heavy smokers. The NELSON project was approved by the Dutch Ministry of Health and the ethics committee of each participating hospital. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. For this study, the authors evaluated 1200 consecutive low-dose computed tomographic (CT) scans of the chest obtained during the NELSON project and identified subjects who had at least one 50-500-mm3 nodule. One local and one central observer independently evaluated the scans and measured the volume of any detected nodule by using semiautomated software. Noncalcified solid nodules with volumes of 15-500 mm3 were included in this study if they were fully surrounded by air (intraparenchymal) and were detected by both observers. The mean volume and the difference between both measurements were calculated for all nodules. Intermeasurement agreement was assessed with the Spearman correlation coefficient. Potential reasons for discrepancies were assessed. Result(s): There were 232 men (mean age, 60 years; age range, 52-73 years) with 430 eligible nodules (mean volume, 77.8 mm3; range, 15.3-499.5 mm3). Interobserver correlation was high (r = 0.99). No difference in volume was seen for 383 nodules (89.1%). Discrepant results were obtained for 47 nodules (10.9%); in 16 cases (3.7%), the discrepancy was larger than 10%. The most frequent cause of variability was incomplete segmentation due to an irregular shape or irregular margins. Conclusion(s): In a minority (approximately 11%) of small solid intraparenchymal nodules, semiautomated measurements are not completely reproducible and, thus, may cause errors in the assessment of nodule growth. For small or irregularly shaped nodules, an observer should check the segmentation shown by the program. © RSNA, 2006.",Excluded
1651,"Patterns of relapse following surgery and postoperative intensity modulated radiotherapy for oral and oropharyngeal cancer Background. To investigate the patterns of relapse following intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) given after radical surgery for oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer. Patients and methods. One hundred and two patients with oral or oropharyngeal cancer were treated with radical surgery followed by IMRT up to a mean total dose of 60 Gy between years 2001 and 2007. Thirty-nine of the patients (%) also received concomitant weekly cisplatin. Forty of the patients had oral and 62 had oropharyngeal cancer. Data on the tumour, patient and treatment factors were collected. Following therapy the patients were followed by clinical examination, endoscopy and MRI/CT at 2- to 3-months interval up to 2 years and thereafter at 6-month intervals. Results. The mean follow-up time of the patients was 55 months (range, 26-106 months). The rate for local tumour control for the whole cohort was 92.2%: 87.5% for oral cancer patients and 96.7% for oropharyngeal cancer patients. The 5-year disease specific survival was 90.2% and 5-year overall survival 84.3%. During the follow-up eight locoregional recurrences were observed, three at the primary tumour site and one at regional nodal site and four at both sites. The mean time to primary tumour recurrence was seven months (range, 2-10 months) and to nodal recurrence seven months (range, 2-12 months). Distant metastasis occurred in six (6%) patients. The factors associated with poor prognosis were the primary tumour size and tumour site with oral cancers having worse outcome. The treatment was well tolerated with no unexpected toxicities. The most frequent late toxicity was dysphagia necessitating permanent PEG in five patients. This was correlated with the advanced primary tumour size and resulting in wide tumour excision and reconstruction. Conclusions. Surgery combined with postoperative radiotherapy given as IMRT results in low level of tumour recurrence. © 2011 Informa Healthcare.",Excluded

1479,"Assessment of aortic annulus dimensions for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with high-pitch dual-source CT: Comparison of systolic high-pitch vs. multiphasic data acquisition Objectives: To evaluate a systolic ECG-gated high-pitch aortoiliac computed tomography (CT) angiography for planning transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Method(s): Patients referred for TAVI underwent a combined CT imaging with retrospective, multiphasic ECG-gating of the heart and systolic ECG-gated high-pitch aortoiliac CT angiography. Consecutive patients were retrospectively included in this study group. Heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) were assessed during the high-pitch ECG prediction phase. Aortic annulus area (AAA) was planimetrically quantified on both datasets. While only one moment of cardiac cycle was available for measurements in the high-pitch CT, the point of time in the multiphasic CT was chosen, where AAA yielded maximum size. Hypothetical prosthesis sizing was compared between multiphasic vs. high-pitch CT. Result(s): Among 61 patients (44.2 % men, mean age: 83.3 +/- 5.5 years) average heart rate and HRV were 71.0 +/- 13.4 bpm and 7.3 +/- 8.5 bpm. 20 patients (32.7 %) had atrial fibrillation at the time of image acquisition. There was a strong correlation of AAA as derived from multiphasic vs. the high-pitch CT (r = 0.98). The difference in AAA was 10.5 +/- 17.1mm2 (455.1 +/- 83.0 mm2 for multiphasic vs. 444.5 +/- 87.2 mm2 for high-pitch CT) and did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.08). Hypothetical prosthesis sizing showed an agreement in 55 of 61 patients (90.2 %). A sizing based on the high-pitch CT resulted in smaller prosthesis choice in 6 patients, all of them suffering from atrial fibrillation. Mean effective radiation dose was 10.9 +/- 6.1 mSv for cardiac CTA and 4.1 +/- 1.0 mSv for high-pitch CTA. Conclusion(s): For patients with sinus rhythm, systolic high-pitch aortoiliac CTA provides adequate prosthesis size selection as compared with multiphasic ECG-gated cardiac CTA and may result in significantly reduced radiation exposition.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
1672,"Intravascular radiation accelerates atherosclerotic lesion formation of hypercholesteremic rabbits OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the effect of intravascular radiation (IR) on the arterial wall of uninjured vessels in the hypercholesteremic rabbit model., METHODS: Aortas of 24 New Zealand white rabbits were treated with either intravascular 192-Ir gamma-radiation (15 Gy at 2 mm from the center of the source) or were exposed to the source catheter without radiation (sham controls). Following the radiation treatment, the animals were fed a 2% cholesterol diet until euthanasia at 2 (n=8) or 6 (n=16) weeks. Arteries were analyzed using light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM); transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) 1, a promoter of connective tissue deposition, was also monitored., RESULTS: At 2 weeks, SEM analysis showed well-aligned endothelial cells in nonradiated segments, whereas irradiated arteries consistently contained adherent and subendothelial macrophages with focal areas of endothelial disruption. Further radiated segments at 2 weeks showed a 7-fold increase in active TGF beta-1 over nonradiated segments. At 6 weeks, there was a significant increase in plaque and vessel wall area relative to control arteries, however, no differences were noted in the density of actin-positive smooth muscle cells (SMCs) or macrophages. Similarly, no differences were noted in cell proliferation between groups as evidenced by the marker bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). In contrast, nonirradiated segments frequently contained cellular areas with extracellular lipid., CONCLUSION: Exposure of previously uninjured vessels to IR and hypercholesterolemia is associated with increased plaque burden and leads to more advanced plaque types. Special care should be taken to minimize radiation exposure in normal vascular segments in hypercholesterolemic patients undergoing radiation therapy.",Included
1325,"Infrapopliteal Angioplasty of One or More than One Artery for Critical Limb Ischaemia: A Randomised Clinical Trial Objective: The aim was to analyse the effect of the treatment of more than one infrapopliteal artery with respect to wound healing and limb salvage. Method(s): Seventy-eight patients were enrolled prospectively for 80 procedures (80 limbs) that were randomly divided into two groups: 40 in the single vessel (SV) group and 40 in the multiple vessel group (MV). All patients had tissue loss. The choice of the first artery to treat was based on an analysis of two factors: the ease of the required endovascular technique and the presence of adequate distal outflow. The randomisation point was after the first successful distal artery angioplasty. The primary endpoints were the wound healing rate and limb salvage. Result(s): The mean age of the patients was 69.1 +/- 4.3 years, and 56% were male. Concomitant treatment of the femoral and popliteal arteries was performed in 38.8% of patients. All demographic characteristics and technical aspects were statistically comparable for both groups. Successful recanalisation was achieved in 95.8%, 86.2%, 86.9%, and 92.5% for the tibio-fibular trunk, anterior tibial, posterior tibial, and fibular artery, respectively. In the MV group, a higher contrast volume (29 mL more; p =.049), longer procedure time (p =.01), and higher radiation exposure (p =.04) were noted. There was no difference in renal function between the groups either before or 30 days after the procedure (p =.165). The limb salvage rates after 1 and 3 years, respectively, were 75.9% and 67% for the SV group and 91.1% and 91.1% for the MV group (log rank p =.052). The wound healing rates after 1 and 3 years, respectively, were 33.6% and 70.9% for the SV and 63.9% and 78.4% for MV group (log rank p =.006). Wound healing was faster in MV (2.11 cm2/month) than SV group (0.62 cm2/month; p =.004).

1927,"A regenerative role for bone marrow following experimental colitis: Contribution to neovasculogenesis and myofibroblasts Background & Aims: Bone marrow (BM) cells form differentiated adult lineages within nonhematopoietic tissues, with a heightened propensity with increasing regenerative pressure dictated by disease. We have previously shown that BM cells engraft into the gut and contribute substantially to the subepithelial intestinal myofibroblast population in the lamina propria. To investigate the reparative capacity of BM in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a well-established model of experimental colitis was used. Method(s): Lethally irradiated female mice were rescued by a BM transplant from male donors. Colitis was induced 6 weeks posttransplantation by injection of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS), and tissues were analyzed 1-14 days later. Donor-derived cells were detected by in situ hybridization using a Y chromosome-specific probe, and their phenotype was determined by immunohistochemistry. Result(s): TNBS-induced colitis was manifest as patchy lesions that increased in severity between days 1 and 8, and the mucosa gradually regenerated between days 8 and 14. The contribution of BM to intestinal myofibroblasts was significantly increased in regions of colitis compared with noninflamed regions. Furthermore, BM-derived endothelial cells, pericytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells were frequently interspersed throughout blood vessels, suggesting that these cells facilitate angiogenesis in tissue repair, substantiated by a significant increase in the incidence of BM-derived vascular smooth muscle cells in colitic compared with noninflamed regions. Blood vessels formed entirely from BM-derived cells were also seen, suggesting a role for BM in neovasculogenesis. Conclusion(s): Our data show that BM contributes to multiple intestinal cell lineages in colitis, with an important function in tissue regeneration and vasculogenesis after injury. © 2005 by the American Gastroenterological Association.",Excluded
1453,"Combining Optimized Image Processing With Dual Axis Rotational Angiography: Toward Low-Dose Invasive Coronary Angiography Background Dual axis rotational coronary angiography (DARCA) reduces radiation exposure during coronary angiography on older x-ray systems. The purpose of the current study is to quantify patient and staff radiation exposure using DARCA on a modality already equipped with dose-reducing technology. Additionally, we assessed applicability of 1 dose area product to effective dose conversion factor for both DARCA and conventional coronary angiography (CCA) procedures. Methods and Results Twenty patients were examined using DARCA and were compared with 20 age-, sex-, and body mass index-matched patients selected from a prior study using CCA on the same x-ray modality. All irradiation events are simulated using PCXMC (STUK, Finland) to determine organ and effective doses. Moreover, for DARCA each frame is simulated. Staff dose is measured using active personal dosimeters (DoseAware, Philips Healthcare, The Netherlands). With DARCA, median cumulative dose area product is reduced by 57% (ie, 7.41 versus 17.19 Gy.cm2). Effective dose conversion factors of CCA and DARCA are slightly different, yet this difference is not statistically significant. The occupational dose at physician's chest, leg, and collar level are reduced by 60%, 56%, and 16%, respectively, of which the first 2 reached statistical significance. Median effective dose is reduced from 4.75 mSv in CCA to 2.22 mSv in DARCA procedures, where the latter is further reduced to 1.79 mSv when excluding ventriculography. Conclusions During invasive coronary angiography, DARCA reduces radiation exposure even further toward low-dose values on a system already equipped with advanced image processing and noise reduction algorithms. For both DARCA and CCA procedures, using 1 effective dose conversion factor of 0.30 mSv.Gy-1.cm-2 is feasible.",Excluded
1610,"Cone-beam computed tomography-hepatic arteriography as a diagnostic tool for small hypervascular hepatocellular carcinomas: Method and clinical implications Objective: This study proposes a novel reference standard for hypervascular hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), established by cone-beam computed tomography-hepatic arteriography (CBCT-HA) and two-year imaging follow-up, and discusses its clinical implication on tumor staging and understanding the intrahepatic distant recurrence (IDR) in relation to dynamic computed tomography (CT). Material(s) and Method(s): In this retrospective study, 99 patients were enrolled, who underwent CBCT-HA during initial chemoembolization for HCC suspected on CT. All patients underwent chemoembolization and regular clinical and imaging follow-up for two years. If IDR appeared on follow-up imaging, initial CBCT-HA images were reviewed to determine if a hypervascular focus pre-existed at the site of recurrence. Pre-existing hypervascular foci on CBCT-HA were regarded as HCCs in initial presentation. Initial HCCs were classified into three groups according to their mode of detection (Group I, detected on CT and CBCT-HA; Group II, additionally detected on CBCT-HA; Group III, confirmed by interval growth). We assessed the influence of CBCT-HA and two-year follow-up on initial tumor stage and calculated the proportion of IDR that pre-existed in initial CBCT-HA. Result(s): A total of 405 nodules were confirmed as HCCs, and 297 nodules initially pre-existed. Of the initial 297 HCCs, 149 (50.2%) lesions were in Group I, 74 (24.9%) lesions were in Group II, and the remaining 74 (24.9%) lesions were in Group III. After applying CBCT-HA findings, 11 patients upstaged in T stage, and 4 patients had a change in Milan criteria. Our reference standard for HCC indicated that 120 of 148 (81.1%) one-year IDR and 148 of 256 (57.8%) two-year IDR existed on initial CBCT-HA. Conclusion(s): The proposed method enabled the confirmation of many sub-centimeter-sized, faintly vascularized HCC nodules that pre-existed initially but clinically manifested as IDR. Our reference standard for HCC helped in understanding the nature of IDR and the early development of HCC as well as the clinical impact of tumor staging and treatment decision.Copyright © 2020 The Korean Society of Radiology.",Excluded

Less experienced operators in the radial approach exposed patients to higher radiation doses (1,463 mGy vs 1,196 mGy; P = 0.02), which did not occur with the more experienced operators (1,311 mGy vs 1,449 mGy; P = 0.84). Conclusion(s): Patients undergoing invasive cardiologic procedures are exposed to higher radiation levels when the radial access is used.

1743,"Radiation-Induced Myocardial Fibrosis in Long-Term Esophageal Cancer Survivors Purpose: Radiation-induced cardiac toxicity is a potential lethal complication. The aim of this study was to assess whether there is a dose-dependent relationship between radiation dose and myocardial fibrosis in patients who received neoadjuvant chemoradiation (nCRT) for esophageal cancer (EC). Methods and Materials: Forty patients with EC treated with a transthoracic esophagectomy with (n = 20) or without (n = 20) nCRT (CROSS study regimen) were included. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (1.5 Tesla) for left ventricular (LV) function, late gadolinium enhancement, and T1 mapping were performed. Extracellular volume (ECV), as a surrogate for collagen burden, was measured for all LV segments separately. The dose-response relationship between ECV and mean radiation dose per LV myocardial segment was evaluated using a mixed-model analysis. Result(s): Seventeen nCRT and 16 control patients were suitable for analysis. The mean time after treatment was 67.6 +/- 8.1 (nCRT) and 122 +/- 35 (controls) months (P = .02). In nCRT patients, we found a significantly higher mean global ECV of 28.2% compared with 24.0% in the controls (P < .001). After nCRT, LV myocardial segments with elevated ECV had received significantly higher radiation doses. In addition, a linear dose-effect relation was found with a 0.136% point increase of ECV for each Gy (P < .001). There were no differences in LV function measures and late gadolinium enhancement between both groups. Conclusion(s): Myocardial ECV was significantly higher in long-term EC survivors after nCRT compared with surgery only. Moreover, this ECV increase was linear with the radiation dose per LV segment, indicating radiation-induced myocardial fibrosis.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s)",Included
2477,"[Comparison of radiation dose reduction of prospective ECG-gated one beat scan using 320 area detector CT coronary angiography and prospective ECG-gated helical scan with high helical pitch (FlashScan) using 64 multidetector-row CT coronary angiography] A high radiation dose associated with 64 multidetector-row computed tomography (64-MDCT) is a major concern for physicians and patients alike. A new 320 row area detector computed tomography (ADCT) can obtain a view of the entire heart with one rotation (0.35 s) without requiring the helical method. As such, ADCT is expected to reduce the radiation dose. We studied image quality and radiation dose of ADCT compared to that of 64-MDCT in patients with a low heart rate (HR<=60). Three hundred eighty-five consecutive patients underwent 64-MDCT and 379 patients, ADCT. Patients with an arrhythmia were excluded. Prospective ECG-gated helical scan with high HP (FlashScan) in 64 was used for MDCT and prospective ECG-gated conventional one beat scan, for 320-ADCT. Image quality was visually evaluated by an image quality score. Radiation dose was estimated by DLP (mGycm) for 64-MDCT and DLP.e (mGycm) for 320-ADCT. Radiation dose of 320-ADCT (208+/-48 mGycm) was significantly (P<0.0001) lower than that of 64-MDCT (484+/-112 mGycm), and image quality score of 320-ADCT (3.0+/-0.2) was significantly (P=0.0011) higher than that of 64-MDCT (2.9+/-0.4). Scan time of 320-ADCT (1.4+/-0.1 s) was also significantly (P<0.0001) shorter than that of 64-MDCT (6.8+/-0.6 s). 320-ADCT can achieve not only a reduction in radiation dose but also a superior image quality and shortening of scan time compared to 64-MDCT.",Excluded

A prospective cohort of 35,705 cataract-free US radiologic technologists aged 24-44 years was followed for nearly 20 years (1983-2004) by using two follow-up questionnaires. During the study period, 2,382 cataracts and 647 cataract extractions were reported. Cigarette smoking for >or=5 pack-years; body mass index of >or=25 kg/m(2); and history of diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or arthritis at baseline were significantly (p or=3 x-rays to the face/neck was associated with a hazard ratio of cataract of 1.25 (95% confidence interval: 1.06, 1.47). For workers in the highest category (mean, 60 mGy) versus lowest category (mean, 5 mGy) of occupational dose to the lens of the eye, the adjusted hazard ratio of cataract was 1.18 (95% confidence interval: 0.99, 1.40). Findings challenge the National Council on Radiation Protection and International Commission on Radiological Protection assumptions that the lowest cumulative ionizing radiation dose to the lens of the eye that can produce a progressive cataract is approximately 2 Gy, and they support the hypothesis that the lowest cataractogenic dose in humans is substantially less than previously thought.",Included

2422,"Assessment of Jugular Venous Blood Flow Stasis and Thrombosis during Spaceflight Importance: Exposure to a weightless environment during spaceflight results in a chronic headward blood and tissue fluid shift compared with the upright posture on Earth, with unknown consequences to cerebral venous outflow. Objective(s): To assess internal jugular vein (IJV) flow and morphology during spaceflight and to investigate if lower body negative pressure is associated with reversing the headward fluid shift experienced during spaceflight. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This prospective cohort study included 11 International Space Station crew members participating in long-duration spaceflight missions. Internal jugular vein measurements from before launch and approximately 40 days after landing were acquired in 3 positions: seated, supine, and 15degree head-down tilt. In-flight IJV measurements were acquired at approximately 50 days and 150 days into spaceflight during normal spaceflight conditions as well as during use of lower body negative pressure. Data were analyzed in June 2019. Exposures: Posture changes on Earth, spaceflight, and lower body negative pressure. Main Outcomes and Measures: Ultrasonographic assessments of IJV cross-sectional area, pressure, blood flow, and thrombus formation. Result(s): The 11 healthy crew members included in the study (mean [SD] age, 46.9 [6.3] years, 9 [82%] men) spent a mean (SD) of 210 (76) days in space. Mean IJV area increased from 9.8 (95% CI,-1.2 to 20.7) mm2 in the preflight seated position to 70.3 (95% CI, 59.3-81.2) mm2 during spaceflight (P <.001). Mean IJV pressure increased from the preflight seated position measurement of 5.1 (95% CI, 2.5-7.8) mm Hg to 21.1 (95% CI, 18.5-23.7) mm Hg during spaceflight (P <.001). Furthermore, stagnant or reverse flow in the IJV was observed in 6 crew members (55%) on approximate flight day 50. Notably, 1 crew member was found to have an occlusive IJV thrombus, and a potential partial IJV thrombus was identified in another crew member retrospectively. Lower body negative pressure was associated with improved blood flow in 10 of 17 sessions (59%) during spaceflight. Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study found stagnant and retrograde blood flow associated with spaceflight in the IJVs of astronauts and IJV thrombosis in at least 1 astronaut, a newly discovered risk associated with spaceflight. Lower body negative pressure may be a promising countermeasure to enhance venous blood flow in the upper body during spaceflight.Copyright © 2019 JAMA Network Open.",Excluded
1485,"Navigated minimally invasive unilateral laminotomy with crossover for intraoperative prediction of outcome in degenerative lumbar stenosis Background: Different surgical techniques have been described for treatment of degenerative lumbar stenosis (DLS). Only postoperative measures have been identified as predictors of efficacy of decompression. The objective of this study is to assess the role of navigated unilateral laminotomy with crossover to achieve and predict a satisfying decompression and outcome in DLS. Material(s) and Method(s): We enrolled patients with DLS who underwent navigation-assisted unilateral laminotomy with crossover. The extent of decompression was evaluated during surgery using neuronavigation. The outcome was assessed through the Oswestry disability index (ODI) and visual analog scale (VAS) for leg pain. Outcome correlation with the extent of the intraoperative bone decompression was analyzed. Finally, the outcome, surgical time, and in-hospital length-of-stay were compared with a control group treated through standard unilateral laminotomy. Result(s): Twenty-five patients were treated using the navigated technique (Group A), 25 using the standard unilateral laminotomy (Group B). In Group A, a cut-off value >=0.9 cm for bone decompression revealed to be an intraoperative predictor of good outcome, both regarding the ODI and VAS scores (P = 0.0005; P = 0.002). As compared with Group B, patients operated using the navigated technique showed similar operative times, in-hospital length-of-stay, ODI scores, but improved VAS scores for leg pain (P = 0.04). Conclusion(s): The intraoperative navigated evaluation of the bone decompression could predict the outcome allowing satisfactory results in unilateral laminotomy for DLS. The navigated technique also could lead to an improved decompression of lateral recesses resulting in better control of leg pain as compared to standard unilateral laminotomy.Copyright © 2018 Journal of Craniovertebral Junction and Spine Published by Wolters Kluwer -Medknow.",Excluded

1243,"A multicenter, prospective pilot study of gamma knife radiosurgery for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy: seizure response, adverse events, and verbal memory OBJECTIVE: The safety, efficacy, and morbidity of radiosurgery (RS) must be established before it can be offered as an alternative to open surgery for unilateral mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. We report the 3-year outcomes of a multicenter, prospective pilot study of RS., METHODS: RS was randomized to 20 or 24Gy targeting the amygdala, hippocampus, and parahippocampal gyrus. Seizure diaries evaluated the final seizure remission between months 24 and 36. Verbal memory was evaluated at baseline and 24m with the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R) and California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT). Patients were classified as having ""significant improvement,"" ""no change,"" and ""significant impairment"" based on relative change indices., RESULTS: Thirteen high-dose and 17 low-dose patients were treated. Both groups showed significant reductions in seizures by 1 year after treatment. At the 36-month follow-up evaluation, 67% of patients were free of seizures for the prior 12 months (high dose: 10/13, 76.9%; low dose: 10/17, 58.8%). Use of steroids, headaches, and visual field defects did not differ by dose or seizure remission. The prevalence of verbal memory impairment was 15% (4/26 patients); none declined on more than one measure. The prevalence of significant verbal memory improvements was 12% (3/26)., INTERPRETATION: RS for unilateral mesial temporal lobe epilepsy offers seizure remission rates comparable with those reported previously for open surgery. There were no major safety concerns with high-dose RS compared with low-dose RS. Additional research is required to determine whether RS may be a treatment option for some patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.",Excluded
1659,"Temozolomide and irradiation combined treatment-induced Nrf2 activation increases chemoradiation sensitivity in human glioblastoma cells Resistance to chemoradiotherapy is a major obstacle to successful treatment of glioblastoma. Recently, the role of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in enhancing chemoradiation sensitivity has been reported in several types of cancers. Here, we investigated whether temozolomide (TMZ) and irradiation (IR) combined treatment induced Nrf2 activation in human glioblastoma cells. And we further performed a preliminary study about the effect of Nrf2 on chemoradiation sensitivity. Immunohistochemical staining for Nrf2 in paired clinical specimens showed that TMZ and IR combined treatment increased the expression and nuclear localization of Nrf2 in human glioblastoma tissues. Moreover, we found nuclear Nrf2 expression in the glioblastoma tissues obtained from the patients undergoing TMZ and IR combined treatment was associated with the time to tumor recurrence. In vitro, we further verified these findings. First, we detected increased nuclear localization of Nrf2 following treatment with TMZ+IR in human glioblastoma cell lines. Second, we demonstrated TMZ+IR increased the levels of Nrf2 protein in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of U251 cells and induced Nrf2 target genes expression. Finally, downregulating Nrf2 expression increased TMZ+IR-induced cell death in the U251 cells. These findings suggest TMZ+IR combined treatment induces Nrf2 activation in human glioblastoma cells. The activation of Nrf2 may be associate with enhancing chemoradiation sensitivity in human glioblastoma cell. Blocking Nrf2 activation may be a promising method enhancing chemoradiation sensitivity of glioblastoma cells.",Excluded

2072,"The effects of post-radiation education pamphlet on self-efficacy in cancer patients Cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy often experience anxiety and a sense of loss of control immediately after completion of their active treatment. This study aims to evaluate, using a cross-sectional survey, the effects of a post-radiation education pamphlet on the self-efficacy of cancer patients in terms of seeking/understanding medical information, seeking support, and coping with radiation side effects. Forty-eight patients from various age groups with a variety of cancer diagnoses were recruited from the Radiation Medicine Program at Princess Margaret Hospital. Descriptive analysis of 35 survey responses suggests that the pamphlet improved patient self-efficacy in terms of seeking and understanding medical information, seeking support, and coping with radiation side effects. The benefits of the pamphlet were also found to be independent of patients' education level. Despite the small sample size, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of the education pamphlet in improving patient self-efficacy and gives support to the pamphlet's utility in improving the transition care of cancer patients finishing radiotherapy. In parallel, 40 Princess Margaret Hospital Radiation Medicine Program staff members were also asked, via online surveys, about their awareness of the pamphlet, and its usefulness in terms of content, format, and timing of the information provided. More than 90% of the staff indicated that the pamphlet was an effective tool. Only 57% of oncologists were aware of the pamphlet's existence. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1609,"Preoperative chemoradiotherapy for elderly patients with locally advanced rectal cancer-a real-world outcome study OBJECTIVE: Preoperative chemoradiotherapy has been established as a standard treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer. It is unclear whether preoperative chemoradiotherapy is truly beneficial in the elderly patients. Our aim was to assess the impact of age on the treatment tolerance and clinical outcomes., METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 160 consecutive patients with clinical stage T3-4, and/or lymph node positive tumors who received preoperative chemoradiotherapy from May 2003 to December 2010 at a single hospital. Treatment tolerance and outcomes were compared between patients >=70 years (N = 56) and <70 years (N = 104)., RESULTS: There was no disparity in the achievement of prescribed radiation dose and dose reduction of chemotherapy between two groups. Pathologic complete response rate (15.6% vs. 16.0%) and sphincter preservation rate (91.1% vs. 95.0%; P = 0.459) were not significantly different. The 3-year disease-free survival of older vs. younger patients was 77.8% vs. 92.3% and 5-year disease-free survival was 60.0% vs. 78.6%, respectively (P = 0.023). In multivariable analysis, age was significantly associated with disease-free survival (P = 0.033) but comorbidities were not (P = 0.092). However, both age (hazard ratio, 2.331; P = 0.028) and comorbidities (hazard ratio, 2.772; P = 0.031) were significantly associated with overall survival as well as clinical stage. Anemia was the only adverse effect more prominent in older patients., CONCLUSIONS: Older patients showed non-inferior compliance and equivalent pathologic complete response rates without an increased incidence of treatment complications with preoperative chemoradiotherapy. More comprehensive consideration than age alone is warranted in the decision of applying preoperative chemoradiotherapy to elderly patients with rectal cancer. Copyright © The Author 2016.

1278,"Elective lymph node irradiation with intensity-modulated radiotherapy: Is conventional dose fractionation necessary? Purpose: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is the standard of care for head-and-neck cancer (HNC). We treated patients with HNC by delivering either a moderate hypofractionation (MHF) schedule (66 Gy at 2.2 Gy per fraction to the gross tumor [primary and nodal]) with standard dose fractionation (54-60 Gy at 1.8-2.0 Gy per fraction) to the elective neck lymphatics or a conventional dose and fractionation (CDF) schedule (70 Gy at 2.0 Gy per fraction) to the gross tumor (primary and nodal) with reduced dose to the elective neck lymphatics. We analyzed these two cohorts for treatment outcomes. Methods and Materials: Between November 2001 and February 2009, 89 patients with primary carcinomas of the oral cavity, larynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and nasopharynx received definitive IMRT with or without concurrent chemotherapy. Twenty patients were treated using the MHF schedule, while 69 patients were treated with the CDF schedule. Patient characteristics and dosimetry plans were reviewed. Patterns of failure including local recurrence (LR), regional recurrence (RR), distant metastasis (DM), disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicities, including rate of feeding tube placement and percentage of weight loss, were reviewed and analyzed. Result(s): Median follow-up was 31.2 months. Thirty-five percent of patients in the MHF cohort and 77% of patients in the CDF cohort received chemotherapy. No RR was observed in either cohort. OS, DFS, LR, and DM rates for the entire group at 2 years were 89.3%, 81.4%, 7.1%, and 9.4%, respectively. Subgroup analysis showed no significant differences in OS (p = 0.595), DFS (p = 0.863), LR (p = 0.833), or DM (p = 0.917) between these two cohorts. Similarly, no significant differences were observed in rates of feeding tube placement and percentages of weight loss. Conclusion(s): Similar treatment outcomes were observed for MHF and CDF cohorts.

Results of a preliminary experience OBJECTIVE: To evaluate four-dimensional contrast-enhanced ultrasound (4D-CEUS) as an alternative imaging method to computed tomography angiography (CTA) during follow up of fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR) for juxta- and para-renal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA)., METHODS: Between October 2011 and March 2012, all consecutive patients who underwent FEVAR follow up were included in the study and evaluated with both 4D-CEUS and CTA. The interval between the two examinations was always <= 30 days. Endpoints were the comparison of postoperative AAA diameter, AAA volume, presence of endoleaks, revascularized visceral vessel (RVV) visualization, and patency. Comparative analysis was performed using Bland-Altman plots and McNemar's Chi-square test., RESULTS: Twenty-two patients (96% male, 4% female; mean age 74 +/- 7 years; American Society of Anesthesiologists grade III/IV 82%/18%) were enrolled. Seventy-eight RVV (fenestrations: 60; scallops: 17; branches: 1) were analyzed. The mean AAA diameter evaluated by 4D-CEUS and CTA was 45 +/- 10 mm (range 30-69 mm) and 48 +/- 9 mm (range 32-70 mm), respectively. The mean difference was 3 +/- 3 mm. The mean AAA volume evaluated by 4D-CEUS and CTA was 150 +/- 7 cc (range 88-300 cc) and 159 +/- 68 cc (range 80-310 cc), respectively. The mean difference was 7 +/- 4 cc; a Bland-Altman plot revealed agreement in AAA diameter and volume evaluation (p < .01) between 4D-CEUS and CTA. The observed agreement for the detection of endoleaks was 95%. McNemar's Chi-square test confirmed that 4D-CEUS and CTA were equivalent (p > .05) at detecting endoleaks. The first segment of six (8%) RVVs (four renal and two superior mesenteric arteries) was not directly visualized by 4D-CEUS owing to obesity, but the contrast enhancement into the distal part of vessel or into the relative parenchyma gave indirect information about their patency. McNemar's Chi-square test demonstrated the superiority of CTA (p = .031) in visualizing RVVs. The patency of 77/78 RVVs was confirmed with both techniques. McNemar's Chi-square test confirmed that 4D-CEUS and CTA were equivalent in their ability to detect visceral vessel patency., CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that 4D-CEUS is as accurate as CTA in the evaluation of postoperative AAA diameter and volume, endoleak detection, and RVV patency after FEVAR. Four-dimensional CEUS could provide hemodynamic information regarding RVVs, and reduce radiation exposure and renal impairment during follow up. Obesity limits the diagnostic accuracy of 4D-CEUS.

1399,"Serial ultraviolet B exposure and serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D response in young adult American blacks and whites: no racial differences We tested the hypothesis that repeated whole body suberythemal ultraviolet B (UVB) exposure would result in less increase of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentrations in black compared with white young adults with no significant change or racial differences in serum calciotropic hormones concentrations. Thirteen white and 7 black adults ranging from 22 to 35 years of age were submitted to sequential total body suberythemal doses of UVB (280-315 nm) biweekly for 6 weeks. Initial UVB dose was 5% below the minimal erythemal dose for the most sensitive skin, followed by 10% increase per exposure for 4 weeks. Blood samples were drawn weekly. Baseline 25OHD concentrations were significantly lower in blacks compared to whites, but the increases in serum 25OHD concentrations were similar in both groups; there were no significant differences by sex or age. Serum 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [24,25-(OH)2D] concentrations paralleled the serum 250HD response. Mean serum calcium (total and ionized), magnesium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, vitamin D binding protein, C-terminal parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25-(OH)2D], and osteocalcin concentrations did not differ between blacks and whites at any time. The ratio of the concentration of 1,25-(OH)2D to 25OHD in their serum was initially higher in blacks compared to whites (p less than 0.0001); the ratios decreased to levels similar to whites by the third UVB exposure. We conclude that, in blacks and whites, sequential suberythemal UVB exposure produces similar elevations of serum 25OHD concentrations and unchanged calciotropic hormones concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Excluded

Objective The purpose of this study was to evaluate the dose reduction and image quality of a novel X-ray technology using advanced image processing and dose reduction technology in an EP laboratory. Methods In this single-center, randomized, unblinded, parallel controlled trial, consecutive patients undergoing catheter ablation for complex arrhythmias were eligible. The Philips Allura FD20 system allows switching between the reference (Allura Xper) and the novel X-ray imaging technology (Allura Clarity). Primary end-point was overall procedural patient dose, expressed in dose area product (DAP) and air kerma (AK). Operator dose, procedural success, and necessity to switch to higher dose settings were secondary end-points. Results A total of 136 patients were randomly assigned to the novel imaging group (n = 68) or the reference group (n = 68). Baseline characteristics were similar, except patients in the novel imaging group were younger (58 vs 65 years, P <.01). Median DAP and AK were 43% and 40% lower in the novel imaging group, respectively (P <.0001). A 50% operator dose reduction was achieved in the novel imaging group (P <.001). Fluoroscopy time, number of exposure frames, and procedure duration were equivalent between the two groups, indicating that the image quality was similarly adequate in both groups. Procedural success was achieved in 91% of patients in both groups; one pericardial tamponade occurred in the novel imaging group.

1371,"Drug exposure and risk of microscopic colitis: a nationwide Danish case-control study with 5751 cases BACKGROUND: Previous small studies have indicated that commonly prescribed drugs may be associated with microscopic colitis (MC). With an increasing incidence of MC, it is important to explore the association between exposure to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, statins, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and MC in a larger setting., METHODS: Case-control study based on nationwide Danish registries. The study included all patients with MC diagnosis during the period 2005 to 2011. One hundred sex- and age-matched controls per case were randomly selected among the Danish population. Prescriptions were recorded in a Prescription Register in the year before the first recorded MC diagnosis. Effect measure is the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of collagenous colitis (CC) and lymphocytic colitis (LC) according to prescriptions of PPIs, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, statins, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Within the control group, we identified a subgroup with MC-free colonic biopsies., RESULTS: We identified 3474 patients with CC and 2277 with LC and found a positive association between redemption of prescriptions for PPIs and both CC (OR = 7.04; 95% confidence interval, 6.55-7.56) and LC (OR = 3.37; 95% confidence interval, 3.08-3.69). Among patients with MC-free colon biopsies in the control group, the association between PPIs and CC was strongly positive (OR = 3.47; 95% confidence interval, 3.08-3.89). Adding this parameter to the model attenuated all of the associations, but they remained positive for PPIs versus CC and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors versus LC., CONCLUSIONS: We found positive associations between exposure to all 4 medication classes and MC. Variations in endoscopic frequency by drug category indicate a potential impact of bias.",Excluded
2100,"Is there need for radioimmunotherapy? results of a phase I/II study in patients with indolent B-cell lymphomas using lutetium-177-DOTA-rituximab AIM: The aim of the study was to explore the clinical response to 177Lutetium-DOTA-rituximab (177Lu-D-R) and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in the treatment of patients with relapsed follicular, mantle cell or other indolent lymphomas such as marginal zone lymphoma as well as to put these results into context with other therapy options for these patients., METHODS: Treatment consisted of cold rituximab (250 mg/m2) on day 1 and day 8 and 177Lu-DOTA-Rituximab on day 8. Reassessment was done at week 10. Thirty-one patients (males=17, females=14, median number of pretreatments: 3) were treated in seven cohorts. Escalation of injected activity was carried out in steps of 5 mCi/m2. Dosimetry was performed in the first 20 patients., RESULTS: The MTD was found to be 45 mCi/m2. Thrombocytopenia and leukopenia were the dose-limiting toxicities. Significant anemia only occurred at dose level 7. We observed the nadir of platelets after a median of 36 days from treatment with 177Lu-D-R and a nadir of granulocytes after a median of 50 days from 177Lu-D-R treatment. Non-hematological toxicity was negligible. We observed clinical responses at all dose levels and for all lymphoma entities. Some of the responses were durable; the longest follow up in complete remission is currently over eight years., CONCLUSION: The MTD of 177Lu-DOTA-Rituximab was found to be 45 mCi/m2. Non hematologic toxicity was negligible. Responses were seen in all lymphoma entities and at all dose levels tested. Further testing seems to be most promising mainly in follicular and marginal zone lymphoma in particular as the results compare well to other therapy options for these patients with regard to effectiveness, toxicity and discomfort for the patients.",Excluded
2339,"Prescribed dose versus calculated dose of spinal cord in standard head and neck irradiation assessed by 3-D plan Background and Purpose: Spinal cord toxicity can be dreaded complication while treating head and neck cancer by conventional radiotherapy. Cord sparing approach is applied by two phase planning in conventional head neck radiotherapy. In spite of cord sparing approach spinal cord still receives considerable scatter dose. Our study aims to do the volumetric analysis of spinal cord dosimetry and to correlate with the clinical findings. Material(s) and Method(s): Treatment planning was done in two phases. First phase treatment fi elds include gross disease- both tumor and involved nodes. in the second phase, treatment field shrinkage was done to cover the gross disease sparing the spinal cord. These fields are termed as off-cord fields. 42 patients with histological proven squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck region were analysed with two groups. In Group A, 46 Gy was given in 23 fractions, and then tumor-boost with off-cord fi eld received 24 Gy in 12 fractions. In Group B 50 Gy was prescribed in 25 fractions initially, then off-cord fi eld given 20 Gy in 10 fractions to analyze theoutcome. Planning Computed tomography (CT) scan was done Philips Brilliance 16 slice CT scan machine, and contouring and dose calculation were done at ASHA treatment planning software. Result(s): Maximum dose and dose at 1 cm3, 2 cm3, and 5 cm3 were calculated. Maximum dose to cord was 52.6 Gy (range 48.1-49.7 Gy) in Group A and 54.3 Gy (range 51.48-52.33 Gy) in Group B initially. Off-cord fi elds received mean dose 8.07 Gy (85.85% of maximum) in Group A and 5.47 Gy (86.84% of maximum) in Group B. At the end of 6 months from the last date of radiotherapy, grade 1 spinal cord toxicity found in two patients in Group A and one patient in Group B respectively (P = 0.55). Both groups received additional dose, which are higher than the prescribed dose, but no patients show significant spinal cord toxicity after 6 month of follow-up. Conclusion(s): Spinal cord received scatter dose which much higher than the predicted dose in conventional radiotherapy of head neck cancer. Short term follow up failed to establish clinical correlation with volumetric dose of spinal cord. Two phase cord sparing head neck radiation planning if practiced should be used with caution. © 2014. The South Asian Journal of Cancer.",Excluded
2249,"Irradiation field design according to locoregional relapse sites after radiotherapy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: The lateral faciocervical field, lateral facial field, and cerrobent blocks were employed conventionally in radiotherapy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in Cancer Center of Sun Yat-sen University since 1990s. This study was to explore rationality of irradiated area of lateral faciocervical field and lateral facial field through analyzing the data of some patients presenting locoregional recurrence after conventional radiotherapy. METHOD(S): Clinical data of the patients, treated in 1999 and presented locoregional failure and had reports of CT examinations before and after radiotherapy and after recurrence, were reviewed. The regions of recurrent lesions were analyzed. Dosimetric analysis of recurrent regions was performed for the patients with available data of irradiating fields. If no less than 95% of the volume of local recurrent lesion was within 95% isodose curve, it was defined as in-field failure; 20% to less than 95% of the volume was within 95% isodose curve as marginal failure; less than 20% of the volume was within 95% isodose curve as out-field failure. RESULT(S): Clinical data of 40 patients could be analyzed, and dosimetric analysis of recurrent regions was performed for 15 patients. Local recurrences mainly occurred in the nasopharyngeal cavity and the skull base bone. Dosimetric analysis showed 9 cases of in-field failure, 4 cases of marginal failure, and 2 cases of out-field failure. For the 6 cases of marginal and out-field failure, the main reasons of recurrence were low dose area in target volume due to not strictly following the guidelines of defining field limit, or inappropriately estimating the involved regions of lesions. CONCLUSION(S): Irradiated area of lateral faciocervical field and lateral facial field employed conventionally in radiotherapy of NPC is rational.",Excluded
1298,"Low-energy He/Ne laser in the prevention of radiation-induced mucositis: A multicenter phase III randomized study in patients with head and neck cancer Use of the low-energy helium-neon laser (LEL) appears to be a simple atraumatic technique for the prevention and treatment of mucositis of various origins. Preliminary findings, and significant results obtained for chemotherapy-induced mucositis in a previous phase III study, prompted a randomized multicenter double-blind trial to evaluate LEL in the prevention of acute radiation-induced stomatitis. Irradiation by LEL corresponds to local application of a high-photon-density monochromatic light source. Activation of epithelial healing for LEL-treated surfaces, the most commonly recognized effect, has been confirmed by numerous in vitro studies. The mechanism of action at a molecular and enzymatic level is presently being studied. From September 1994 to March 1998, 30 patients were randomized. Technical specification: 60 mW (25 mW at Reims, 1 patient), He-Ne, wavelength 632.8 nm. The trial was open to patients with carcinoma of the oropharynx, hypopharynx and oral cavity, treated by radiotherapy alone (65 Gy at a rate of 2 Gy/fraction, 5 fractions per week) without prior surgery or concomitant chemotherapy. The malignant tumor had to be located outside the tested laser application areas (9 points): posterior third of the internal surfaces of the cheeks, soft palate and anterior tonsillar pillars. Patients were randomized to LEL or placebo light treatment, starting on the first day of radiotherapy and before each session. The treatment time (t) for each application point was given by the equation: t (s)=energy (J/cm2) x surface (cm2)/Power (W). Objective assessment of the degree of mucositis was recorded weekly by a physician blinded to the type of treatment, using the WHO scale for grading of mucositis and a segmented visual analogue scale for pain evaluation. Protocol feasibility and compliance were excellent. Grade 3 mucositis occurred with a frequency of 35.2% without LEL and of 7.6% with LEL (P<0.01). The frequency of 'severe pain' (grade 3) was 23.8% without LEL, falling to 1.9% with LEL (P < 0.05). Pain relief was significantly reduced throughout the treatment period (weeks 2-7). LEL therapy is capable of reducing the severity and duration of oral mucositis associated with radiation therapy. In addition, there is a tremendous potential for using LEL in combined treatment protocols utilizing concomitant chemotherapy and radiotherapy.",Excluded

The relatively rare localisation is the lot of elderly patients. It may follow cobalt therapy or corticotherapy and seems to be brought about by osteoporosis, hypertriglyceridemia and, perhaps, malignant lymphoidal proliferation. Histological confirmation of osteonecrosis was available in one case.

1693,"Faecal microbiota transplantation protects against radiation-induced toxicity Severe radiation exposure may cause acute radiation syndrome, a possibly fatal condition requiring effective therapy. Gut microbiota can be manipulated to fight against many diseases. We explored whether intestinal microbe transplantation could alleviate radiation-induced toxicity. High-throughput sequencing showed that gastrointestinal bacterial community composition differed between male and female mice and was associated with susceptibility to radiation toxicity. Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) increased the survival rate of irradiated animals, elevated peripheral white blood cell counts and improved gastrointestinal tract function and intestinal epithelial integrity in irradiated male and female mice. FMT preserved the intestinal bacterial composition and retained mRNA and long non-coding RNA expression profiles of host small intestines in a sex-specific fashion. Despite promoting angiogenesis, sex-matched FMT did not accelerate the proliferation of cancer cells in vivo. FMT might serve as a therapeutic to mitigate radiation-induced toxicity and improve the prognosis of tumour patients after radiotherapy.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

2207,"PET/CT in malignant melanoma: a two-tiered healthcare system? Updated healthcare situation regarding initial staging of malignant melanoma with PET/CT Background: Patients with stage IIC malignant melanoma are recommended to undergo cross-sectional imaging for initial staging. PET/CT is superior to other methods regarding its diagnostic accuracy of the tumor spread in stage III. So far there is no meaningful data on the nationwide availability, usage and cost recovery of this imaging technique. Patients and Methods: Questionnaires on the healthcare situation in 2018 were sent to all German dermatology clinics and PET/CT centers in March and April 2019. Result(s): 61.2 % of the dermatology clinics (71/115) and 48.2 % of the PET/CT centers (77/160) took part in the survey. A total of 22,645 patients with malignant melanoma were seen in these clinics in 2018. 16.8 % of the patients with stage IIC melanoma received a PET/CT for primary staging. The costs of this examination were covered for all statutory and privately insured patients in 40 % and 68 % of dermatology clinics (20/50 and 34/50), respectively. 68.0 % (34/50) of all dermatology clinics reported relevant changes of treatment according to PET/CT findings. Long examination periods by the health insurance companies and the time required to submit the application were the most common reasons for dermatology clinics to reject a request for PET/CT. Relevant incidental findings were reported in 90.2 % (47/51) of all PET/CT centers. Conclusion(s): There are clear differences in the nationwide availability and cost coverage of PET/CT in primary staging for stage IIC melanoma. For these reasons, a two-tiered healthcare system may be assumed.Copyright © 2021 Deutsche Dermatologische Gesellschaft (DDG). Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Excluded
2277,"Radiosurgery for the treatment of spinal melanoma metastases BACKGROUND: The role of stereotactic radiosurgery in treating metastatic melanoma involving the spine has previously been limited. Conventional external beam radiotherapy lacks the precision to allow delivery of large single-fraction doses of radiation and simultaneously to limit the dose delivered to radiosensitive structures such as the spinal cord. This study evaluated the clinical efficacy of radiosurgery for the treatment of melanoma spinal metastases in 28 patients., METHODS: Thirty-six melanoma spine metastases were treated with a single-session radiosurgery technique (1 cervical, 11 thoracic, 13 lumbar, and 11 sacral) with a follow-up period of 3-43 months (median 13 months). Tumor volume ranged from 4.1 to 153 cm3 (mean 47.6 cm3). Twenty-three of the 36 lesions had received prior external beam irradiation., RESULTS: Maximum tumor dose was maintained at 17.5-25 Gy (mean 21.7 Gy). Spinal cord volume receiving > 8 Gy ranged from 0.0 to 0.7 cm3 (mean 0.26 cm3); spinal canal volume at the cauda equina level receiving > 8 Gy ranged from 0.0 to 3.5 cm3 (mean 0.98 cm3). No radiation-induced toxicity occurred during the follow-up period. Axial and radicular pain improved in 27 of 28 patients (96%) who were treated primarily for pain. Long-term tumor control was seen in 3 of 4 cases treated primarily for radiographic tumor progression. Two patients went on to require open surgical intervention for tumor progression resulting in neurological deficit., CONCLUSIONS: Spinal radiosurgery offers a therapeutic modality for the safe delivery of large dose fractions of radiation therapy in a single fraction for the management of spinal metastases in patients with advanced melanoma that are often poorly controlled with alternative conventional external beam radiation therapy, and is successful even in patients with previously irradiated lesions.

2084,"Management and long-term outcomes of sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma: Twenty-year experience at a single institution Purpose/Objective(s): Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC) is a rare malignancy of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses generally associated with an aggressive clinical course and poor long-term survival. Optimal management is not well-defined, and varying combinations of surgery (S), radiation therapy (RT) and chemotherapy (CT) have been reported. There have been substantial advances in surgery as well as radiation therapy, which may offer improved outcomes. We review the management approaches, long-term outcomes, and patterns of failure of patients treated at our institution to help define the optimal management for this rare malignancy. Materials/Methods: Fifteen patients with SNUC were treated from 1992- 2012 at our institution, with pathology reviewed and confirmed. Demographic, treatment, and clinical data were collected from medical records. Patients underwent imaging evaluation with CT and/or MRI. Event outcomes were calculated from date of surgery to time of recurrence, death, or last follow-up. Survival statistics were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier and Cox Regression methods. Result(s): There were 10 male and 5 female patients with median age 49 years (range 22-82). Most patients had locally advanced T stage: T2 (n = 2), T3 (n = 5), and T4 (n = 8). At diagnosis, 1 patient was clinically node positive and none had distant metastases. Treatment was as follows: 4 S + postoperative RT +/- chemotherapy (CT); 3 preoperative chemoradiation (CRT) + S; 7 primary CRT; 1 RT alone. Nine had RT to primary site alone, and 6 had elective neck RT. Median dose was 69.5 Gy (range 50.4-70.2). Most received concurrent CT (n = 12). Median follow up was 39 months (range 3-206). At time of analysis, 8 patients are alive, 6 have died and 1 is lost to follow up. KM projected 5-year OS and RFS-rates were 70% and 53%, respectively. Five patients recurred: 1 local, 1 local/neck, 1 neck, 1 distant, 1 local/neck/distant. Median time to recurrence was 7 months. On univariate analysis, there was no statistically significant impact of stage, use of surgery, use of chemotherapy, radiation dose, gender, or age on survival. A trend for improved survival with concurrent CRT was seen (p = 0.097). Conclusion(s): SNUC is a highly aggressive malignancy associated with a high risk of disease recurrence, consistent with other series reported in the literature. There are some long term survivors who were treated with primary CRT or preoperative CRT followed by surgery. Early multimodality therapy is necessary for improved outcomes. The optimal timing and sequence of S, RT and CT should be further investigated.",Excluded
1584,"Radiotherapy for primary carcinoma of the trachea Between 1940 and 1985, 24 cases of primary carcinoma of the trachea were registered at the London Regional Cancer Centre. The most common presenting symptoms were hoarseness, haemoptysis and cough. Twenty patients had epidermoid carcinoma and four had adenoid cystic carcinoma. Because of different clinical behaviours, the two histologies were separately analyzed. Of the 20 patients with epidermoid carcinoma, 19 received radiotherapy as primary treatment and one patient did not receive radiotherapy because of advanced disease. Radiation doses ranged from 4000 to 6000 cGy and most patients had megavoltage irradiation. Treatment result was disappointing. Only one patient remained disease-free at 15-month follow-up and all other patients had persistent or recurrent tracheal tumour. Median survival for all 20 patients was 5 months (range 1 to 19 months). Of the four patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma, two had primary surgery and postoperative radiotherapy and two had primary radiotherapy. Two patients died of disease, at 5 months and 8 years from diagnosis. Two surviving patients had 15-month follow-up: one had persistent disease and the other was free from recurrence. In this study, radiotherapy within the range of doses given was found to be an ineffective primary treatment for tracheal carcinoma.",Excluded

Patients and Methods: Fifty-seven patients with T1NOMO (70%) and T2N0M0 (30%) were included between August 2003 and September 2005 at seven different centers in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark and observed up to 36 months. SBRT was delivered with 15 Gy times three at the 67% isodose of the planning target volume. Result(s): Progression-free survival at 3 years was 52%. Overall- and cancer-specific survival at 1, 2, and 3 years was 86%, 65%, 60%, and 93%, 88%, 88%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in survival between patients with T1 or T2 tumors. At a median follow-up of 35 months (range, 4 to 47 months), 27 patients (47%) were deceased, seven as a result of lung cancer and 20 as a result of concurrent disease. Kaplan-Meier estimated local control at 3 years was 92%. Local relapse was observed in four patients (7%). Regional relapse was observed in three patients (5%). Nine patients (16%) developed distant metastases. The estimated risk of all failure (local, regional, or distant metastases) was increased in patients with T2 (41%) compared with those with T1 (18%) tumors (P = .027). Conclusion(s): With a 3-year local tumor control rate higher than 90% with limited toxicity, SBRT emerges as state-of-the-art treatment for medically inoperable stage I NSCLC and may even challenge surgery in operable instances. © 2009 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",Excluded
2225,"Clinical efficacy of postoperative chemotherapy for esophageal squamous cell cancer after preoperative chemoradiotherapy combined with surgery OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical outcome of postoperative chemotherapy for resectable locally advanced esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) after preoperative chemoradiotherapy combined with surgery (trimodality therapy). METHOD(S): From January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2012, 192 consecutive locally advanced ESCC patients who had undergone trimodality therapy successfully were included. Grouping was based on the degree of myelosuppression occurred during preoperative chemoradiotherapy. Of the 192 patients, 120 patients underwent trimodality therapy only (group A), while 72 patients received postoperative chemotherapy additionally after trimodality therapy (group B). Preoperative chemoradiotherapy included two cycles of chemotherapy concurrently with radiotherapy. The chemotherapy regimen consisted of cisplatin 20 mg/(m2.d) and fluorouracil 400 mg/(m2.d) administered intravenously on days 1-5 of a 21-days cycle. Concurrent radiotherapy was delivered in a total of 40 Gy in 20 fractions. All patients underwent surgery successfully. For 72 patients in group B, additional 1 to 4 cycles of postoperative chemotherapy were administered and chemotherapy regimen was as before. RESULT(S): The 1, 3 and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 87.4%, 51.9% and 43.5% in group A, as compared with 93.0%, 58.5% and 48.8% in the group B (chi2=1.390, P=0.238). The 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 34.0% in group A and 38.8% in group B (chi2 =3.883, P=0.049). Outcome of Cox proportional-hazard regression model showed that complete pathological response(P=0.014, HR=1.420, 95%CI: 1.074~1.878) and negative lymph node (P=0.006, HR=1.979, 95%CI: 1.221~3.209)were associated with significantly improved OS. Likely, complete pathological response(P=0.056, HR=1.273, 95%CI: 0.994~1.631) and negative lymph node(P=0.004, HR=1.753, 95%CI: 1.121~2.742) were associated with improved PFS. Risk reduction in PFS was remarkable for males and those who did not achieve pathologic complete response (pCR). CONCLUSION(S): The addition of postoperative chemotherapy demonstrates no overall survival benefit for patients with locally advanced ESCC, but PFS is significantly improved, especially for males and those who did not achieve pCR.Copyright ©, 2015, The Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Cancer Prevention and Treatment.

All patients underwent pulmonary CT angiography and CTV of the abdomen, pelvis, and lower extremities using 64-MDCT with automatic tube current modulation: 50 patients underwent CT at 120 kVp, the standard kVp setting, and 50 patients were scanned at 100 kVp; we refer to these groups as the ""standard-kVp group"" and the ""low-kVp group,"" respectively. Vessel enhancement and image noise were assessed in the inferior vena cava (IVC), femoral vein, and popliteal vein. Two radiologists who were blinded to the kVp setting placed the regions of interest on vessels by consensus and assessed image quality using a 5-point visual scale. Effective dose was estimated using the dose-length product. The Wilcoxon rank test was used to evaluate differences between the two groups using statistics software (JMP, version 5.1). A p value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance., RESULTS: Mean vascular enhancement was significantly higher in the low-kVp group than in the standard-kVp group: IVC, 138.4 +/- 12.2 (SD) HU versus 164.5 +/- 17.4 HU, respectively; femoral vein, 130.2 +/- 18.0 HU versus 152.0 +/- 24.5 HU; and popliteal vein, 136.7 +/- 17.5 HU versus 158.3 +/- 26.0 HU. Although the images of the low-kVp group had significantly higher image noise, there were no significant differences in image quality in the IVC and popliteal vein. The mean effective dose for the low-kVp protocol was significantly lower than that for the standard-kVp protocol., CONCLUSION: Lowering the kVp setting for CTV examinations improved vascular enhancement while providing sufficient image quality.",Excluded

Mean time between both studies was 0.5 years. CT-attenuation values in Hounsfield units (HU) were measured at the thoracic and lumbar spine (T1, T6, T12, L1-L5), at the femoral neck, and then assigned to their corresponding DXA scores., RESULTS: Patients with DXA-defined osteoporosis or osteopenia showed significantly lower HU values of trabecular bone at all measured levels compared to healthy subjects (p < 0.001). HU values were highest at T1 and T6, lowest at L1-L3 and the femoral neck. There were no significant intraindividual differences between HU values in the sagittal, coronal or transversal plane. Significant differences between normal and abnormal BMD categories were verified for three CT scanners. More than half of all fractures were detected in patients with non-osteoporotic DXA T-scores., CONCLUSIONS: Abdominal and particularly thoracic CT scans obtained for other clinical indications can sensibly be applied toward determining low BMD, detecting osteoporosis and identifying persons at increased fracture risk. Osteoporotic morbidity and mortality might be minimized. Superiorly to DXA, fragility fractures can be found without additional imaging or radiation exposure which can initiate early adequate treatment., LIMITATIONS: Key limitations of the study were as following: a retrospective, single-center study; small patient cohort - larger cohorts are needed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic performance measurements; more complex CT evaluation of the hip for BMD assessment; DXA measurements were used as a reference standard, however, patients with unsuspected compression fractures but showing osteopenic or even normal BMD outline the limitations of DXA.",Excluded
1904,"LOW BMI PATIENT DOSE IN DIGITAL RADIOGRAPHY In this study, the radiation dose received by 364 low body mass index (BMI) adult patients undergoing chest, abdomen, lumbar spine, kidneys and urinary bladder (KUB) and pelvis X-ray examinations in an X-ray room with a digital radiography system was evaluated. The patients' kerma area product (KAP) values were recorded, and the entrance surface air kerma (ESAK) was calculated based on the X-ray tube output, exposure parameters and technical data. The 75th percentiles of the distribution of ESAK and KAP values were also estimated. The dose values were compared with the corresponding values for normal patients obtained from a previous survey in our hospital, as well as with the national and UK diagnostic reference levels (DRLs). The correlation of dose values with patient size metrics (mass, height, BMI) was also investigated. A statistically significant difference was found in KAP and the ESAK values between low BMI and normal patients (Mann-Whitney test, p < 0.05), for all examinations studied. The percentage difference for chest PA, chest LAT, abdomen PA, lumbar spine AP, lumbar spine LAT, pelvis AP and KUB AP examinations was 40, 36, 48, 68, 57, 46 and 67% for median KAP and 26, 43, 52, 48, 19, 44 and 51% for median ESAK, respectively. The corresponding 75th percentiles for low BMI patients were 0.065, 0.349, 0.683, 1.54, 3.92, 1.11, 0.67 mGy and 0.042, 0.218, 0.450, 0.280, 0.598, 0.597, 0.267 Gycm2 in terms of ESAK and KAP values, respectively. They were 74-90% lower compared to the national diagnostic reference levels (DRLs), 35-84% and 58-82% compared to the UK DRLs, for ESAK and KAP values, respectively. Regarding the gender of the patients, no statistically significant difference was found in the dose values between female and male patients (Mann-Whitney test, p > 0.05), for all examinations studied. A statistically significant correlation was found between ESAK and KAP values with BMI for KUB AP, pelvis AP, lumbar spine AP, lumbar spine LAT and chest PA, while for chest LAT examinations, only the ESAK were significantly correlated with BMI. They also significantly correlated with the mass for KUB AP, lumbar spine LAT, abdomen PA and chest PA examinations, while no significant correlation was found between the dose values and patients' height. It can be concluded that the low BMI patients received a significantly reduced radiation dose compared to normal patients. Additional studies need to be conducted for these patient groups, which could contribute to the further development of a radiation protection culture in diagnostic radiography.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

1929,"The complex case of MACS J0717.5+3745 and its extended filament: Intra-cluster light, galaxy luminosity function, and galaxy orientations Context. The properties of galaxies are known to be affected by their environment, but although galaxies in clusters and groups have been quite thoroughly investigated, little is known about galaxies belonging to filaments of the cosmic web, or about the properties of the filaments themselves. Aims. Here we investigate the properties of the rich cluster MACS J0717.5+3745 and its extended filament by analyzing the distribution and fractions of intra-cluster light (ICL) in its core and by trying to detect intra-filament light (IFL) in the filament. We analyze the galaxy luminosity function (GLF) of the cluster core and of the filament. We also study the orientations of galaxies in the filament to better constrain the filament properties. Methods. This work is based on Hubble Space Telescope (HST) archive data, both from the Hubble Frontier Fields in the F435W, F606W, F814W, and F105W bands, and from a mosaic of images in the F606W and F814W bands. The spatial distribution of the ICL was determined with our new wavelet-based software, DAWIS. The GLFs were extracted in the F606W and F814W bands, with a statistical subtraction of the background, and fit with Schechter functions. The galaxy orientations in the filaments were estimated with SExtractor after correction for the point spread function. Results. We detect a large amount of ICL in the cluster core, but no IFL in the cosmic filament. The fraction of ICL in the core peaks in the F606W filter before decreasing with wavelength. Though relatively noisy, the GLFs in the filament are notably different from those of field galaxies, with a flatter faint end slope and an excess of bright galaxies. We do not detect a significant alignment of the galaxies in the filament region analyzed. 2019 A. Ellien et al.",Excluded

The disease course can vary from a self-limiting illness to a chronic disease with flares and relapses. Nail changes are rare in sarcoidosis, but can include clubbing, discolouration, dystrophy, subungual hyperkeratosis, splinter haemorrhages and longitudinal ridges. Such changes are frequently an indication of systemic disease, We report a rare case of systemic sarcoidosis presenting as nail dystrophy with painful phalanges and underlying bony cysts. Observation: A 57 year old moroccan woman, with a 2-year history of periungual redpurplish discoloration associated with nail dystrophy of 4 of his toes, presented to the dermatology department. Examination of his toes showed evidence of red to purple discoloration in the nail folds with associated nail dystrophy and subungual hyperkeratosis. Examination of his entire skin showed a symetric ulcerated dactilitis of 2 fingers. Nail clippings were obtained for mycological examination, with negative results. A Hand and toes X-ray demonstrated bony cysts, trabecular pattern and osteolysis in distal phalanx. CT showed multiples lymphadenopaty above and under diaphragmatic. A punch biopsy taken from the nail bed, the lymphadenopathy and salivary gland showed sarcoid granulomas in the dermis and a chronic inflammatory infiltrate. With all this finding, the diagnosis of systemic sarcoidosis was making, and the patient receive a systemic treatment with corticosteroid: 0.5 mg/kg/day. After 1 week of treatment, the patient had a good response. Key message: Although nail changes are rare in sarcoidosis, they are often associated with systemic involvement (commonly pulmonary involvement, dactylitis and lymphadenopathy) and underlying bony changes. Thus, in patients presenting with nail involvement, a search for possible systemic involvement should take place, and this should include radiological imaging of hands and feet alongside chest imaging.",Excluded
1941,"Epidemiology of lung cancer in women: A hospital-based descriptive study Objective: Lung cancer required much greater attention as it is the most common cause of death. According to statistics in 2010, 85% of lung cancer in men and 57% in women are attributed to tobacco smoking. The aim of the study was to describe the clinical and pathologic characteristics of the female patients who visited the Department of Medical Oncology of Acibadem Maslak Hospital between 2009 and 2017. Material(s) and Method(s): Clinicopathologic data collected for analyses included age at diagnosis, history of cigarette use, comorbid conditions, family history, tumor-node-metastasis stage, pathologic subtypes of lung carcinoma, and the given therapy. From July 2017 to February 2018, we collected data of 540 female patients with lung cancer at the Department of Medical Oncology of Acibadem Maslak Hospital. Result(s): Among 540 patients, 185 patients (34.3%) were nonsmokers, 106 (19.6%) were current smokers, and 210 (38.9%) were former smokers. Data on common comorbid conditions such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease were collected, and the conditions were classified according to the smoking status of the patients. Among current and former smokers, 36.7% were diagnosed with hypertension, 18.3% with diabetes mellitus, and 11% with coronary artery diseases. Moreover, 75% of all patients were diagnosed with nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), whereas 16% were diagnosed with small-cell lung cancer. Adenocarcinoma is the most common histological type of cancer seen in patients with NSCLC (77%), followed by patients with squamous cell carcinoma (15%). Conclusion(s): Factors other than tobacco use, such as radon exposure, air pollution, radiation exposure, and an unbalanced diet are responsible for the increasing incidence of lung cancer. However, further studies are warranted to investigate the cause of the epidemic differences in women, particularly the gender bias in nonsmoker patients with lung cancer.Copyright © 2020 by Turkish Society of Medical Oncology.",Excluded

2254,Increased risk of ischemic bowel complications during treatment with bevacizumab after pelvic irradiation: Report of three cases Purpose: To assess the rate of severe bowel complications during treatment with the antivascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibody bevacizumab. Methods and Materials: We performed a retrospective evaluation of bevacizumab-associated severe intestinal adverse events from our institutional database. Result(s): A total of 33 patients started treatment with bevacizumab at our institution during the first 6 months after its approval in Germany. Three patients (9%) presented with severe bowel complications: two with acute ischemic colitis and one with gastrointestinal perforation with a fatal outcome. All 3 patients had undergone radiotherapy directed to the pelvis before treatment with bevacizumab. None of the 30 patients without bowel complications had been pretreated with infradiaphragmatic irradiation. Histologic evaluation of bowel biopsies and resection specimens revealed severe ischemic bowel damage as the pathophysiologic background of the clinical findings. Conclusion(s): This report contributes to the pathophysiologic clarification of bevacizumab-induced bowel complications and points to a potentially increased risk of severe ischemic damage during treatment with bevacizumab in patients who have undergone previous radiotherapy. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.,Excluded
2386,"Impact of PET/CT on precise radiotherapy planning for non-small cell lung cancer OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of PET/CT on the clinical staging, target volume delineation and precise radiotherapy (PAR) planning for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHOD(S): PET/CT scanning was performed in 58 histologically proven NSCLC patients for radical radiotherapy or surgery. The clinical staging of all patients was determined by PET/CT according to 1997 World Health Organization (WHO) staging system. The gross tumor volume (GTV) was delineated and three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) planning was established with identical parameters based on CT image and PET/CT fused image, respectively. The indexes including volume of GTV (V(GTV)), percentage of the total lung volume which received more than 20 Gy (V(20)), mean lung dose (MLD), tumor control probability (TCP), normal tissue complication probability (NTCP), and dose to spinal cord (Ds) were selected and evaluated. The quality of the two plans and the impact of PET/CT on PAR planning was compare and analyzed. RESULT(S): 1. PET/CT image results changed the clinical stages in 21 of 58 (36.2%) patients with 14 upstaged and 7 downstaged, therefore, the management decisions were modified in 16 (27.6%) patients. 2. Among 32 patients who underwent surgery, PET/CT staging result was consistent with pathologic staging in 29 with one false negative and 2 false positive in lymph node staging. The sensitivity of PET/CT was 96.9% and accuracy 90.6%. 3. The differences of indexes including V(GTV) (P = 0.004), V(20) (P = 0.000) and MLD (P = 0.004) between the two radiotherapy plannings were statistically significant, whereas, the Ds, TCP and NTCP (left lung, right lung, skin and spinal cord) was not. CONCLUSION(S): 1. The impact PET/CT on clinical staging of NSCLC and PAR planning was remarkable. 2. PET/CT is more consistent with pathology in staging than CT and, therefore, is an important compensatory staging measure. 3. Compared with CT, PET/CT can reduce the V(GTV) in patients with atelectasis and obstructive pneumonitis when contouring the target volume, so can provide better protection for normal surrounding lung tissue. On the other hand, PET/CT is more sensitive in detecting mediastinal lymph node metastasis than CT, and the V(GTV) can be more precise and guaranteed. 4. Radiopneumonitis may be more effectively prevented because of significant decrease in V(20) and MLD by more precise planning based on PET/CT results. 5. PET/CT not only can provide satisfactory Ds, TCP and NTCP within clinical demand, but also more precise delineation of the radiation target volume and precise radiotherapy planning for NSCLC.",Excluded
1713,"Treatment of nonresectable hepatocellular carcinoma with intrahepatic 90Y-microspheres Treatment for nonresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is palliative. The relatively greater arteriolar density of hepatic tumors compared with normal liver suggests that intrahepatic arterial administration of 90Y-microspheres can be selectively deposited in tumor nodules and results in significantly greater radiation exposure to the tumor than external irradiation. The purpose of this study was to determine the proportion (frequency) and duration of response, survival, and toxicity after intrahepatic arterial injection of 90Y-microspheres in patients with HCC. Method(s): Patients with documented HCC, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-3, adequate bone marrow, and hepatic and pulmonary function were eligible for study. Patients who had significant shunting of blood to the lungs or gastrointestinal (GI) tract or who could not undergo cannulation of the hepatic artery were excluded. Patients received a planned dose of 100 Gy through a catheter placed into the hepatic artery. Result(s): Twenty-two patients were treated with 90Y-microspheres; 20 of the treated patients (median age, 62.5 y) were evaluated for treatment efficacy. Nine patients were Okuda stage I, and 11 were Okuda stage II. The median dose delivered was 104 Gy (range, 46-145 Gy). All 22 treated patients experienced at least 1 adverse event. Of the 31 (15%) serious adverse events, the most common were elevations in liver enzymes and bilirubin and upper GI ulceration. The response rate was 20%. The median duration of response was 127 wk; the median survival was 54 wk. Multivariable analysis suggested that a dose >104 Gy (P = 0.06), tumor-to-liver activity uptake ratio >2 (P = 0.06), and Okuda stage I (P = 0.07) were associated with longer survival. Conclusion(s): Significantly higher doses of radiation can be delivered to a HCC tumor by intrahepatic arterial administration of 90Y-microspheres than by external beam radiation. This treatment appears to be beneficial in nonresectable HCC with acceptable toxicity.",Excluded
2224,"Optimizing the flattening filter free beam selection in RapidArc R-based stereotactic body radiotherapy for Stage I lung cancer OBJECTIVE: To optimize the flattening filter-free (FFF) beam selection in stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) treatment for Stage I lung cancer in different fraction schemes., METHODS: Treatment plans from 12 patients suffering from Stage I lung cancer were designed using the 6XFFF and 10XFFF beams in different fraction schemes of 4 x 12, 3 x 18 and 1 x 34 Gy. Plans were evaluated mainly in terms of organs at risk (OARs) sparing, normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) estimation and treatment efficiency., RESULTS: Compared with the 10XFFF beam, 6XFFF beam showed statistically significant lower dose to all the OARs investigated. The percentage of NTCP reduction for both lung and chest wall was about 10% in the fraction schemes of 4 x 12 and 3 x 18 Gy, whereas only 7.4% and 2.6% was obtained in the 1 x 34 Gy scheme. For oesophagus, heart and spinal cord, the reduction was greater with the 6XFFF beam, but their absolute estimates were <10(-6)%. The mean beam-on time for 6XFFF and 10XFFF beams at 4 x 12, 3 x 18 and 1 x 34 Gy schemes were 2.2 +/- 0.2 vs 1.5 +/- 0.1, 3.3 +/- 0.9 vs 2.0 +/- 0.5 and 6.3 +/- 0.9 vs 3.5 +/- 0.4 min, respectively., CONCLUSION: The 6XFFF beam obtains better OARs sparing and lower incidence of NTCP in SBRT treatment of Stage I lung cancer, whereas the 10XFFF beam improves the treatment efficiency. To balance the OARs sparing and intrafractional variation owing to the prolonged treatment time, the authors recommend using the 6XFFF beam in the 4 x 12 and 3 x 18 Gy schemes but the 10XFFF beam in the 1 x 34 Gy scheme., ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: This study optimizes the FFF beam selection in different fraction schemes in SBRT treatment of Stage I lung cancer.",Excluded
2097,"Ophthalmic Manifestations of Xeroderma Pigmentosum: A Perspective from the United Kingdom Purpose To document the ocular manifestations of xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), presenting via the United Kingdom (UK) XP service, and to analyze the correlations between XP genotype and ophthalmic phenotype. Design Prospective observational case series. Subjects Eighty-nine patients seen by the UK Nationally Commissioned XP Service, from April 2010 to December 2014, with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of XP. Methods Patients underwent a full ophthalmic examination at each visit. Clinical features from both eyes were recorded on a standard proforma. The most recent assessments were analyzed. A 2-tailed Fisher exact test was used to assess for differences in ocular features between patients in XP subgroups with impaired transcription coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) (category 1: XP-A, B, D, F, and G) and preserved TC-NER (category 2: XP-C, E, and V). Main Outcome Measures Lid and periocular abnormalities, ocular surface pathologies, neuro-ophthalmologic abnormalities, lens and retinal abnormalities, and visual acuity (VA). Results Ninety-three percent of XP patients in our cohort had ocular involvement, with 65% describing photophobia. The most common abnormalities were in the periocular skin and ocular surface, including interpalpebral conjunctival melanosis (44%) and conjunctival injection (43%). Eleven percent of patients had required treatment for periocular cancers and 2% for ocular surface cancers. The most common neuro-ophthalmologic finding was minimal pupillary reaction to light (25%). Patients in category 2 had significantly more ocular surface abnormalities than patients in category 1, including a greater proportion of conjunctival injection (P = 0.003), conjunctival corkscrew vessels (P < 0.001), corneal scarring (P = 0.01) and pingueculae under the age of 50 (P = 0.02). Meanwhile, patients in category 1 had a higher proportion of poorly reactive pupils (P < 0.001) and abnormal ocular movements (P = 0.03) compared with those in category 2. Five patients (6%) presented to ophthalmologists with ocular surface signs related to XP, before any formal diagnosis of XP was made. Conclusions A large proportion of XP patients have ocular involvement. Regular examination by an ophthalmologist is essential, especially in screening for eyelid and ocular surface tumors. The ocular phenotype-genotype segregation within XP patients suggests that XP is a heterogeneous and complex disease. With further study, we hope to offer these patients more individualized patient care.Copyright © 2017 American Academy of Ophthalmology",Excluded
2282,"Low-level-laser therapy for treating acute pancreatitis Introduction: Currently, acute pancreatitis (AP) is met in 10 15% of patients out of the total number of surgical patients; the mortality rate in destructive forms varies from 32.2% till 85%. Purpose(s): To study effectiveness of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) in the complex treatment of acute pancreatitis. Material(s) and Method(s): 120 patients with AP had complex treatment. They were mostly men (102) aged 20 40 years (65%); the rest were 18 women older than 40 (15%). Alcoholic genesis dominated over biliary and alimentary one. In the main group (60 patients) traditional therapy was added with intravenous laser blood irradiation (ILBI). Semiconductor laser ""Mulat"" (output power 5 mW, wavelength 0.635 mm, exposure 40 min) was used for this. Patients from the main group had 8 10 ILBI sessions combined with antioxidant therapy. If the exudation in the omental bursa was up to 5 ml, transcutaneous combined laser irradiation with lasers ""Milta-F"" and ""Mustang-2000"" was done. Points at the pancreas head projection as well as points at the pancreas body and tail projections were irradiation with the techniques developed by the authors. Result(s): Comparative assessment of treatment effectiveness was made using findings of standard clinical, ultrasound and laboratory examinations showing levels of malonic dialdehyde, carbonyls, antioxidant activity SH groups and middle molecules. Due to anti-inflammatory and POL-inhibiting (peroxide lipid oxidation) effects of laser and antioxidant therapy clinical AP manifestations in the main group were eradicated 7.1+/-0.2 days earlier, size and parenchyma echogenity were normalized 5.9+/-0.4 days earlier than in patients from the control group (60 patients) who had traditional treatment. Biochemical indexes got normalized 5.1+/-0.8 days earlier than in the main group; in the controls it was seen only on the 14th day. Combined application of LLLT and antioxidant therapy potentiated effects of each method due to which normalization of POL indexes (malonic dialdehyde, carbonyls, antioxidant activity SH groups) and middle molecules took place 8.3+/-0.5 days earlier than in traditional therapyConclusion: Thus, our findings have shown that complex treatment with LLLT and basic traditional pathogenetic therapy accelerates eradication of pathological process in the pancreas, reduces levels of complications and increases speed of recovery.",Excluded

2261,"Variation of radius of curvature around the femoral head and its associations with gender and incident radiographic hip osteoarthritis: Data from the osteoarthritis initiative Purpose: To examine whether the shape of the femoral head is associated with gender or incidence of hip osteoarthritis. Method(s): Participants from the Osteoarthritis Initiative were eligible for this study if they did not have definite radiographic hip osteoarthritis (RHOA) in at least one hip on their baseline visit pelvis x-ray. Cases of incident RHOA were hips which developed definite RHOA by 48-month follow-up. Control hips were randomly selected, frequency matched by contralateral RHOA status, from hips which had not developed RHOA by 48-month follow-up. The femoral head outline on the baseline x-ray was recorded using a semi-automated method with 60 evenly spaced points placed from the inferior point of the narrowest part of the femoral neck around the femoral head to the superior point of the narrowest part of the femoral neck. The angle of the femoral neck was defined as the angle to the horizontal of a line through the centre point of the femoral neck to the centre point of the femoral head. Over each 10 degree arc around the femoral head, the local radius of curvature was calculated using a least squares fit, and was normalized to the radius of curvature fitted to all points within 90 degrees of the neck-head axis direction, to give a relative curvature, which was plotted as a function of the angle at which the point was relative to the femoral head centre. The angular position of the inflection point on the superior side of the head neck junction at which the outline of the femoral head switched from concave to convex was also recorded (see Figure 1). This gave 19 values of relative curvature, along with the inflection point angle which described the shape of the femoral head. Gender differences in relative curvature values and inflection point angle were examined using ANOVA with correction for multiple comparisons. Associations of relative curvature values and inflection point angle with incident RHOA were examined in the following two step process (1) In a univariate analysis, each of the 19 values of relative curvature, along with the inflection point angle was examined as a predictor of incident RHOA using binary logistic regression (with GEE to allow for more than one hip per person in the analysis), with models corrected for covariates of age and body mass index and contralateral RHOA status, (2) Predictors (significant at p<0.05) were then entered into a multivariate model to determine which independently predicted RHOA. Result(s): 678 hips (452 participants) were analysed (265 women, 187 men). In women, there were 68 hips with incident RHOA and 343 control hips. In men, there were 41 hips with incident RHOA and 226 control hips. In hips with no RHOA, inflection point angle was significantly larger in men than women, relative curvature was significantly higher at the supero-lateral (+90 degree) and a more medial position (+40 degrees) in men than women (see Table 1). In the multivariate analysis of the association between femoral head shape and incident RHOA, only 2 relative curvature values (at +80 degrees - supero-medial, and +40 degrees - more medially), along with the inflection point angle were significantly associated with incident RHOA, and all three image based measurements predicted incident RHOA with similar odds ratios (see Table 2). Conclusion(s): Larger inflection angles were associated with increased odds of developing incident RHOA, and larger values existed in normal hips of men compared to women. Flattening of the femoral head superolaterally (+80 degrees) and more medially (+40 degrees) were also independently associated with increased odds of incident RHOA. These two positions were also ones in which gender differences occurred in normal hips. Increased inflection angle may be a measure of pistol grip deformity, known to be associated with RHOA, but this study showed that flattening of the supero-lateral portion of the femoral head (seen more frequently in men) and flattening of the more medial portion of the femoral head (seen more frequently in women) are both independent p edictors of incident RHOA. The mechanisms by which these are associated with gender and incident RHOA, perhaps partly related to incongruence with the acetabulum, need further investigation. (Figure Presented).",Excluded
1250,"Posterior keyhole corpectomy with percutaneous pedicle screw stabilization in the surgical management of lumbar burst fractures OBJECTIVE: The authors present a new method of minimally invasive surgical management of lumbar burst fractures through the posterior approach. The method includes minimally invasive corpectomy and interbody fusion, both of which are performed through a keyhole approach, and percutaneous pedicle screw fixation of the fracture. The technique of the posterior keyhole corpectomy presented in this report is a novel and original concept of the first author (AM). The percutaneous pedicle screw stabilization is performed with the use of a percutaneous instrumentation system (Sextant; Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, MN). The Sextant system has been dedicated and used in nontrauma degenerative cases; the novel aspect of this system is its application in spine fractures. Indications for the method include Denis classification subtype B or Magerl subtype A.3.1 burst fractures. Both subtypes represent fractures with failure and retropulsion of the upper part of the vertebral body. METHOD(S): The clinical experience of this study includes four cases of burst fractures with significant retropulsion and occlusion of the spinal canal. Long-term results were assessed at a minimum follow-up period of 1 year (maximum, 3.5 yr). The follow-up assessments included: 1) the quality of decompression and reconstruction of the spinal canal (computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging scanning); 2) the stability of the operated segment (dynamic x-rays); 3) the quality of interbody fusion (computed tomographic scanning and dynamic x-rays); and 4) correction of the fracture kyphosis and its postoperative loss (measurements of Cobb angles for the assessment of sagittal plane deformity). The minimum armamentarium requirements for this method include a typical micro lumbar discectomy retractor set; a surgical microscope; two-plane intraoperative fluoroscopy; and a system for percutaneous pedicle screw stabilization (Sextant). ""Posterior keyhole corpectomy"" indicates corpectomy of the posterior upper half of the vertebral body or removal of the retropulsed bone fragment via two keyhole skin incisions on both sides of the spinous process (each skin incision measures 2 to 3 cm long). Exposure of the retropulsed fragment (the posterior upper part of the vertebral body) is achieved by medial or complete facetectomy along with complete or medial resection of the pedicle. This has to be performed bilaterally. Percutaneous stabilization requires four additional stab skin incisions. RESULT(S): We observed no surgery-related complications (neurological, hardware, dural tears, or deep or superficial wound infections); there was perfect decompression and clearance of the spinal canal (confirmed by computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging scanning); and there was solid stability at the affected segments (confirmed by dynamic x-rays). Healed fusion was noted in all patients but one. The latter patient had no clinical symptoms of spinal instability. Kyphotic deformity was corrected and reversed into lordosis in three patients. Loss of deformity correction was noted in all patients; however, all patients retained lordotic alignment of the affected segment. CONCLUSION(S): The advantages of this method include sparing the posterior elements (lamina, spinous process, supraspinous and interspinous ligaments, and paravertebral muscles), safety of the decompression provided by the use of a surgical microscope, and perfect illumination of the operating field. The drawbacks of the method include limitation to certain types of burst fractures, the method is surgically demanding, and the method requires development of a special retractor system to eliminate the cumbersome alternate insertion and the reinsertions of the typical microdiscectomy retractor set.

1315,"Sex and tissue-specific differences in low-dose radiation-induced oncogenic signaling PURPOSE: The possible adverse health effects of low-dose radiation (LDR) exposure constitute a growing concern. Clinically and environmentally relevant exposures occur predominantly under chronic conditions, notwithstanding that most studies of LDR effects have been performed using a single acute exposure. Sex- and tissue-specificity of the LDR-induced changes have not been considered before. We investigated LDR-related expression patterns in muscle, liver and spleen of male and female mice subjected to acute and chronic LDR exposure. Genes involved in oncogenic signaling were of specific interest, as radiation is a well-known carcinogen., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the expression pattern of genes coding for growth factors and growth-factor receptors, cytoplasmic serine/threonine protein kinases, G-proteins and nuclear DNA-binding proteins, and other important components of oncogenic signaling., RESULTS: We found sex- and tissue-specific changes in the expression of Ras superfamily members (Nras, Rab2, Rab34, Vav2), protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms (PKCbeta, PKCmu), AP-1 factor components (Jun, JunB and FosB), Wnt signaling pathway members as well as in a variety of other cellular proto-oncogenes and oncogenes. Importantly, Western blot analysis of JunB, PKCmu and Rab2 proteins supported the transcriptomic data., CONCLUSIONS: Substantially different protein levels were observed in all three tissues (muscle, spleen and liver) of acutely and chronically irradiated female and male animals. Based on the obtained data and available literature, we discuss several possible mechanisms that may contribute to radiation-induced carcinogenesis in various tissues of males and females. From our results we could identify the genes that may serve as sex- and tissue-specific biomarkers of the LDR exposure.",Included
1535,"Reirradiation of recurrent high-grade glioma and development of prognostic scores for progression and survival Background: Optimal techniques and patient selection for salvage reirradiation of high-grade glioma (HGG) are unclear. In this study, we identify prognostic factors for freedom from progression (FFP) and overall survival (OS) after reirradiation, risk factors for high-grade toxicity, and validate clinical prognostic scores. Method(s): A total of 116 patients evaluated between 2000 and 2018 received reirradiation for HGG (99 WHO grade IV, 17 WHO grade III). Median time to first progression after initial therapy was 10.6 months. Salvage therapies before reirradiation included surgery (31%) and systemic therapy (41%). Sixty-five patients (56%) received single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) as reirradiation. The median biologically effective dose (BED) was 47.25 Gy, and the median planning target volume (PTV) was 4.8 cc for SRS and 95.0 cc for non-SRS treatments. Systemic therapy was given concurrently to 52% and adjuvantly to 74% of patients. Result(s): Median FFP was 4.9 months, and median OS was 11.0 months. Significant multivariable prognostic factors for FFP were performance status, time to initial progression, and BED; for OS they were age, time to initial progression, and PTV volume at recurrence. High-grade toxicity was correlated to PTV size at recurrence.

1279,"Does Vacuum-assisted Closure Reduce the Risk of Wound Complications in Patients With Lower Extremity Sarcomas Treated With Preoperative Radiation? BACKGROUND: Although preoperative radiation followed by wide local excision yields excellent local control in soft tissue sarcomas, the risk of wound complications is reported to be higher compared with the incidence in patients who were administered postoperative radiation therapy. Vacuum (vac)-assisted closure may improve wound healing, but it is unknown whether vac-assisted closure during soft tissue sarcoma resection may reduce the risk of wound complications or impair local disease control., QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Does the use of a wound vac application at the time of soft tissue sarcoma resection reduce the risk of developing wound complications after lower extremity sarcoma resection? (2) Is vac-assisted closure associated with an increased risk of local relapse?, METHODS: From 2000 to 2016, 312 patients with stage I to III soft tissue sarcomas were treated. Of these, 123 were treated with preoperative radiation +/- chemotherapy followed by limb-sparing resection based on tumor location, size, grade, histology, and patient age. There was a minimum followup of 12 months. Radiation was delivered generally based on tumor size, grade, superficial versus deep nature, and proximity to neurovascular structures. Chemotherapy was administered in patients < 70 years old with high-grade tumors and tumors > 5 cm. Patient, demographic, and treatment variables, including incisional vac application and wound outcomes, were retrospectively evaluated. Incisional vac-assisted closure took place at the time of primary resection in 32% (46 of 123) of patients. Vac-assisted closure was considered when there was a concern for risk of external contamination such as instances in which fixation of adhesives would be difficult or regions where there was a high risk of contamination. Vac-assisted closure may have also been used in instances with increased wound tension at closure or with heightened concern for shearing on the wound such as buttock wounds. Ten patients were lost to followup, two in the vac group and eight in the non-vac group. Potential factors associated with wound complications were evaluated using Fisher's exact test for univariate analysis and logistic regression for multivariate analysis. Local recurrence-free survival was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier estimate., RESULTS: After taking into consideration factors such as tumor size, location, age, and patient comorbidities, it was shown that patients who underwent vac-assisted closure were less likely to experience wound complications compared with patients who did not undergo vac-assisted closure (odds ratio, 0.129; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.041-0.398; p = 0.004). The local control incidence in the entire cohort was 98%. With the numbers available, Kaplan-Meier survivorship free from local recurrence did not differ between patients treated with or without the vac (100% [95% CI, 154.09-154.09] versus 96% [95% CI, 152.21-169.16]; p = 0.211), respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Vac-assisted closure at the time of resection of proximal lower extremity soft tissue sarcomas is associated with a lower risk of wound complications, and its use apparently did not compromise local control. We show that the use of vac-assisted closure may be worth considering in surgeons' attempts to reduce the risk of wound complications among patients with soft tissue sarcomas of the proximal lower extremities., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, therapeutic study.",Included
1955,"Fasciculation-myokymic activity and prolonged nerve conduction block. A physiopathological relationship in radiation-induced brachial plexopathy Fourteen radiation-induced brachial plexus neuropathies in 12 patients suffering from cancer were studied. Neurophysiological evaluation showed a diffuse neurogenic lesion with muscular denervation signs associated with motor and sensory nerve conduction impairment of axonal type in the distal segments of the arm. Somatosensory evoked potentials were frequently abnormal, with absence of N9 in 9 out of the 10 extremities explored. The most characteristic findings were, however, the presence of fasciculation potentials--single and grouped--and myokymic discharges in 78.5% of cases (11 out of 14 plexuses), and a motor nerve conduction block on proximal stimulation, at the supraclavicular as well as cervical spine levels, in all of the cases. Both phenomena showed a high correlation when analyzed in the same neuromuscular territory. The 5 muscles with no voluntary activity and complete--or nearly complete--motor nerve conduction block were the ones with the most intense ectopic activities. The conduction blocks were present after long periods of illness in all cases and, in 2 of the cases, they persisted in successive explorations at intervals of 9 months and 2 years respectively. These data would support a probable cause-effect relationship between a persistent and prolonged motor nerve conduction block and the presence of fasciculation-myokymic type activities. One could even postulate that the infrequent neuropathies, in which both findings have been described as relevant features, have a similar physiopathological mechanism.",Excluded
1729,"Medical diagnostic radiation exposures and risk of gliomas High-dose ionizing radiation is an established risk factor for glioma, but it remains unknown whether moderate- and low-dose radiation increase glioma risk. In this analysis, we assessed the evidence that self-reported exposures to diagnostic ionizing radiation, including computerized tomography (CT) scans, is associated with increased risk of adult glioma. While no independent association was observed for CT scans alone (3+ scans compared to none P = 0.08 and 1-2 scans compared to none P = 0.68), our findings suggest an increased risk of adult gliomas with cumulative exposure to three or more CT scans to the head and neck region (OR = 1.97, 95% CI: 0.92-4.23) limited to those who reported a family history of cancer: the P value for the interaction between having three or more CT scans and family history of cancer was 0.08. The stratum-specific adjusted OR for those with family history of cancer was more than three times that for the sub-group without family history of cancer. While there is some potential for symptom-related bias, one might expect this to be present for all diagnostic procedures rather than specific to one procedure. The interaction between CT scans and glioma with family history of cancer supports the biological plausibility of our findings, because similar results have been found for breast cancer and radiation. This observational data will increase awareness about potential risks associated with CT scans and the need to minimize the use of unnecessary examinations.",Excluded
1958,"An ecological study of cancer incidence and radon levels in South West England To investigate the relationship of domestic radon levels and cancer, the incidence of 14 major cancers in Devon and Cornwall were examined in relation to the local radon levels. Cancer registrations for 1989-1992 were provided by the South-Western Regional Cancer Registry. The average radon levels for postcode sectors were sorted into ten categories from low (< 40 Bq/m3) to extremely high (> or = 230 Bq/m3) and age-standardised incidence rates were calculated for each radon category. The incidence rates for lung cancer, where radon has been claimed to be a risk factor, were very similar across all domestic radon categories. Only non-melanoma skin cancers, showed a significant increase in incidence in the high-radon postcode sectors (> or = 100 Bq/m3) compared with the low-radon sectors (< 60 Bq/m3) and this effect was observed for both sexes. The remaining 12 cancer sites showed no significant trend in incidence rates with increasing radon concentration. There was no significant difference in corrected survival rates for any cancer site between the low- and high-radon areas.

1865,"Pathogenetic mechanisms in immune polioencephalomyelitis: induction of disease in immunosuppressed mice Immune polioencephalomyelitis (IPE) was induced by the i.p. injection of x-irradiated (10, 000 R) syngeneic line Ib malignant lymphocytes into C58 mice that were 7 or more months old and in young mice immunosuppressed by x-ray or drugs. The occurrence of IPE in young immunosuppressed C58 mice was systematically analyzed. When mice less than 2 weeks old were x-irradiated with 600 R, IPE could not be induced. The incidence in 1-month-old mice was approximately 50% and increased progressively with the age except for a drop in incidence at 3 months. An analysis of the dose effects of x-irradiation on the occurrence of IPE in mice of different ages revealed a marked increase in the incidence in 3- and 5-month-old mice beginning at dose levels of 450 R and 300 R, respectively. Considered together, these data indicated that two subpopulations of immunocytes differing in x-ray sensitivity interacted to protect mice from IPE. It appears that under natural conditions an x-ray sensitive cell population, possibly having suppressor function, decreased with age and made mice susceptible ot induction of IPE. Five-month-old mice were immunosuppressed with an LD10 of cyclophosphamide, prednisolone, or methotrexate to determine whether mice immunosuppressed with drugs also were susceptible to the induction of IPE. The incidence was 89%, 13%, and 5%, respectively. The mouse strain specificity of IPE induction also was studied. In 6- to 8-month-old mice suppressed with 600 R, IPE could not be induced in non-H-2k strains: BALB, C57BL/6, NZB. Of the H-2K strains tested (CBA/J, C3H/He, AKR/J, C58), the disease could be induced only in the C58 and AKR/J strains. Histopathologic studies showed that CNS lesions in immunosuppressed C58 and AKR/J mice did not differ significantly from those in old C58 mice with IPE. Taken together, the results of these studies indicate that IPE can be used as a model for analyzing age-dependent diseases of suspected immunopathologic etiology.",Excluded

Each enrolled subject was included in a different phase I study arm, depending on the tumor site and the disease stage (lung, liver, bone, metastatic), and sequentially assigned to a particular dose level. Technical feasibility and dosimetric results were investigated. The acute toxicity, tumor response and early local control were also studied. In total, 25 lesions in 20 consecutive patients (male/female, 11/9; median age, 67 years; age range, 47-86 years) were treated. Of these 25 lesions, 4 were primary or metastatic lung tumors, 6 were liver metastases, 8 were bone metastases and 7 were nodal metastases. The dose-volume constraints for organs at risk (OARs) were observed in 19 patients using a single-arc technique. Only in one patient were two arcs required. The treatment was performed without interruption or any other technical issues. The prescribed dose ranged from 12-26 Gy to the planning target volume (PTV). Delivery time ranged from 4 min to 9 min and 13 sec (median, 6 min and 6 sec). No incidence of grade 2-4 acute toxicity was recorded. The overall response rate was 48% (95% confidence interval (CI), 24.2-70.2) based on computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 89% (95% CI, 58.6-98.7) based on the positron emission tomography (PET) scan.

2037,"GUCY2C signaling opposes the acute radiation-induced GI syndrome High doses of ionizing radiation induce acute damage to epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, mediating toxicities restricting the therapeutic efficacy of radiation in cancer and morbidity and mortality in nuclear disasters. No approved prophylaxis or therapy exists for these toxicities, in part reflecting an incomplete understanding of mechanisms contributing to the acute radiation-induced GI syndrome (RIGS). Guanylate cyclase C (GUCY2C) and its hormones guanylin and uroguanylin have recently emerged as one paracrine axis defending intestinal mucosal integrity against mutational, chemical, and inflammatory injury. Here, we reveal a role for the GUCY2C paracrine axis in compensatory mechanisms opposing RIGS. Eliminating GUCY2C signaling exacerbated RIGS, amplifying radiation-induced mortality, weight loss, mucosal bleeding, debilitation, and intestinal dysfunction. Durable expression of GUCY2C, guanylin, and uroguanylin mRNA and protein by intestinal epithelial cells was preserved following lethal irradiation inducing RIGS. Oral delivery of the heat-stable enterotoxin (ST), an exogenous GUCY2C ligand, opposed RIGS, a process requiring p53 activation mediated by dissociation from MDM2. In turn, p53 activation prevented cell death by selectively limiting mitotic catastrophe, but not apoptosis. These studies reveal a role for the GUCY2C paracrine hormone axis as a novel compensatory mechanism opposing RIGS, and they highlight the potential of oral GUCY2C agonists (Linzess; Trulance) to prevent and treat RIGS in cancer therapy and nuclear disasters.Copyright ©2017 AACR.",Excluded
1404,"Incidence of Breast Cancer in the Life Span Study of Atomic Bomb Survivors: 1958-2009 The importance of reproductive history in breast tissue development and etiology of sporadic breast cancer in females is well established. However, there is limited evidence of factors, other than age, that modify risk of radiation-related breast cancer. In this study, we evaluated breast cancer incidence in the Life Span Study cohort of atomic bomb survivors, adding 11 years of follow-up and incorporating reproductive history data. We used Poisson regression models to describe radiation risks and modifying effects of age and reproductive factors. Among 62,534 females, we identified 1,470 breast cancers between 1958 and 2009. Of 397 new cases diagnosed since 1998, 75% were exposed before age 20. We found a strong linear dose response with excess relative risk (ERR) of 1.12 per Gy [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.73 to 1.59] for females at age 70 after exposure at age 30. The ERR decreased with increasing attained age ( P = 0.007) while excess absolute rate (EAR) increased with attained age up to age 70 ( P < 0.001). Age at menarche was a strong modifier of the radiation effect: for a given dose, both the ERR and EAR decreased with increasing age at menarche ( P = 0.007 and P < 0.001). Also, independently, age-at-exposure effects on ERR and EAR differed before and after menarche ( P = 0.043 and P = 0.015, respectively, relative to log-linear trends), with highest risks for exposures around menarche. Despite the small number of male breast cancers (n = 10), the data continue to suggest a dose response (ERR per Gy = 5.7; 95% CI: 0.3 to 30.8; P = 0.018). Persistently increased risk of female breast cancer after radiation exposure and its modification pattern suggests heightened breast sensitivity during puberty.",Excluded
1771,"Toxicity after volumetric modulated arc therapy for lung cancer: A monocentric retrospective study Background: Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (RT) is now widely implemented and has replaced classical three-dimensional (3D)-RT in many tumor sites, as it allows a better target dose conformity and a better sparing of organs a risk (OAR), at the expense, however, of increasing the volume of low dose to normal tissues. Clinical data on toxicities using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in lung cancer remain scarce. We aimed to report both acute (APT) and late (LPT) pulmonary and acute (AET) and late (LET) oesophageal toxicities in such setting. Method(s): All patients treated for a primary lung cancer with VMAT chemotherapy (ChT) in our center from 2014 to 2018 were retrospectively included. Usual clinical, treatment and dosimetric features were collected. Univariate analysis was performed using the receiver operative characteristics approach while multivariate analysis (MVA) relied on logistic regression, calculated with Medcalc 14.8.1. Result(s): In total, 167 patients were included, with a median age of 66 years (39-88 years). Median radiation dose was 66 Gy (30-66 Gy); 82% patients received concomitant (32.3%), induction (25.7%) or induction followed by concomitant ChT (24%). After a median follow-up of 14.0 months, the G >=2 APT, AET, LPT and LET rates were 22.2%, 30.0%, 16.8% and 5.4%, respectively with low grade >=3 toxicity rates (respectively, 3%, 6.6%, 3% and 0%). On MVA, APT was significantly associated with V30 to the homolateral lung, AET with age, LPT with MEVS while no feature remained significantly correlated with LET.

Dogs exposed repeatedly received a total alveolar deposition of 5.3 +/- 0.9 kBq/kg body mass during 7 to 10 semiannual exposures and accumulated doses of 22 +/- 5 Gy to the lung before death at 4.9 +/- 0.7 years after first exposure. Clearance of the plutonium from the lung in the dogs exposed repeatedly was slower than in the dogs exposed once. All dogs in the repeated-exposure study and all but one dog in the single-exposure study died from radiation effects. Pulmonary fibrosis accounted for 72% of the radiation-related deaths in the single-exposure study and 87% in the repeated-exposure study. The remaining dogs died with pulmonary cancer. Based on total cumulative radiation dose, the times after exposure to death from radiation pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis were not significantly different for single and repeated exposures. Thus dose rate does not appear to be an important factor in predicting death from radiation pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis for dogs inhaling 239PuO2.",Included

The detectability of the vital anatomical structures (anterior ethmoid artery, optic nerve, cribriform plate and lamina papyracea) was scored using a five-point scale (from excellent to unacceptable) by a radiologist and sinus surgeon. Polyp sizes were quantified endoscopically according to the Lildholdt's scale (LS). Olfactory function was tested with the ""Sniffin' Sticks"" test. On the low-dose CT images, detectability ranged from 2.42 (better than poor) for cribriform plate among anosmic cases to 4.11 (better than good) for lamina papyracea in cases without nasal polyps. Identification of lamina papyracea on low-dose scans was significantly worse in each group and the same was the case with cribriform plates in patients with advanced polyposis and anosmia. Cribriform plates were the most poorly identified (between poor and average) among all the structures on low-dose images. Identification of anterior ethmoid artery (AEA) with reduced dose was insignificantly worse than with standard-dose examination. The AEA was scored as an average-defined structure and was the second weakest visualised. In conclusion, preoperatively, low-dose protocols may not sufficiently visualise the surgically relevant anatomical structures in patients with CRS and bronchial asthma, advanced nasal polyps (LS > 2) and history of sinus surgery. Low mAs value enables comparable detectability of sinonasal landmarks with standard-dose protocols in patients without analysed risk factors. In the context of planned surgery, the current preferences of the tube should be carefully evaluated for different patient constitutions to minimise the risk of complications.",Excluded
1612,"Gastroduodenal complications after concurrent chemoradiation therapy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: endoscopic findings and risk factors PURPOSE: Concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) is useful in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but little is known about radiation-induced gastroduodenal complications following therapy. To determine risk factors, we investigated the prevalence and patterns of gastroduodenal complications following CCRT using endoscopy., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Enrolled in the study were 123 patients treated with CCRT for unresectable HCC between January 1998 and December 2005. Radiation-induced gastroduodenal complications were defined as radiation gastritis/duodenitis, radiation gastric/duodenal ulcer, or other gastroduodenal toxicity associated with radiation, based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE 3.0). Serious gastroduodenal complications were defined as events occurring within 12 months from completion of CCRT, those requiring prompt therapeutic intervention, or symptoms equivalent to Grade 3 or 4 radiation-related gastroduodenal toxicity, including nausea or vomiting, based on CTCAE 3.0., RESULTS: A month after completion of CCRT, 65 (52.8%) patients displayed endoscopic evidence of radiation-induced gastroduodenal complications. Radiation gastric and duodenal ulcers were found in 32 (26.0%) and 20 (16.3%) patients, respectively; radiation gastritis and duodenitis were found in 50 (40.7%) and 42 (34.1%) patients, respectively. Radiation-related bleeding was observed in 13 patients (10.6%). Serious gastroduodenal complications occurred in 18 patients (14.6%) and were significantly more frequent in patients with liver cirrhosis than in those without cirrhosis (p=0.043). There were no radiation-related deaths., CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopically detectable radiation-induced gastroduodenal complications were common in HCC following CCRT. Although serious complications were uncommon, the frequency was higher in patients with liver cirrhosis; thus, these patients should be closely monitored when receiving CCRT.

Methods and Materials: We reviewed the records of 209 consecutive patients with desmoid fibromatosis treated with RT, either alone or as combined-modality therapy (CMT) with surgery, at our institution from 1965 to 2015. Result(s): Median follow-up time was 98 months (range, 1-509 months). The 5- and 10-year local control (LC) was 71% and 69%, respectively. Fifty-nine patients (28%) experienced a local recurrence at a median time of 23 months (interquartile range, 15-38 months). Among all patients, on multivariable analysis, adjusting for anatomic site, size, age, treatment era (>2005 vs <=2005), treatment approach (RT alone vs CMT), and an interaction between age and treatment, we found only age <=30 years (hazard ratio [HR], 2.94; P =.005; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.38-6.27) and large tumor size >10 cm (HR, 2.51; P =.03; 95% CI, 1.09-5.78) to be correlated with poorer LC. Notably, for patients receiving RT alone, the 5-year LC was 43% for patients <=30 years old versus 75% for >30 years old (P <.001). On multivariable analyses, for patients receiving RT alone, the only factor associated with inferior LC was age <=30 years (HR, 2.87; P =.001; 95% CI, 1.51-5.47). The same was true for patients treated with CMT; age <=30 years was the only factor associated with inferior LC (HR, 5.36; P =.01; 95% CI, 1.40-20.58). Conclusion(s): Among all patients with desmoid fibromatosis, RT is an effective local therapy for tumor control. However, young patients <= 30 years have notably high rates of local recurrence regardless of treatment strategy, which requires further study. Treatment decisions should be risk-adapted by large referral centers with multidisciplinary expertise in desmoid management.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

Method(s): Nimotuzumab (100. mg, 200. mg and 400. mg) was administered weekly from week 1 to week 8 with palliative radiotherapy (30-36. Gy, 3. Gy/day). If tumor control was achieved, nimotuzumab was continued every 2 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Serial skin biopsies were collected for pharmacodynamic assessment. Result(s): Fifteen patients were enrolled in the study, with cohorts of five patients assigned in each dose level of nimotuzumab. Patients and disease characteristics included median age 73 years; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (PS) 0-1/2 (n=3/12); female sex (n=2); adenocarcinoma (n=5); never-smoker status (n=2); and stages IIB/IIIB/IV (n=1/8/6). All patients were unable to tolerate radical therapy because of old age or multiple comorbidities. The most commonly reported adverse events were lymphopenia and asthenia (grades 1-2 in most patients). No skin rash or allergic toxicities appeared. Dose-limiting toxicity occurred with pneumonia with grade 4 neutropenia at the 200. mg dose of nimotuzumab. Objective response rate and disease control rate inside the radiation field were 46.7% and 100.0%, respectively.

Stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT) of brain metastases is used with good effect around the world, but no consensus exists regarding which prognostic factors that are related to favourable or unfavourable prognosis after the treatment. A better definition of these factors will ensure a more precise application of the treatment. Material and methods. A consecutive cohort of the 198 patients treated for brain metastases with SRT without concurrent whole-brain radiation therapy at our department from 2001 to 2012 was retrospectively analysed. Results. Median survival was seven months and median time to clinical cerebral progression was eight months. The multivariate analysis revealed age >= 65 years, Performance Status >= 2, extracranial metastases and size of metastasis > 20 mm as independent prognostic factors related to shorter survival. No factors were independently related to clinical cerebral progression. Conclusion. We identified four prognostic factors related to survival after SRT for brain metastases. The grouping of patients by these factors is useful to determine the level of treatment. We discourage the delivery of SRT to patients with 3-4 unfavourable prognostic factors because of the very short median survival of two months.Copyright © 2015 Informa Healthcare.",Excluded
2047,"Neurotrophic keratitis after transscleral diode laser cyclophotocoagulation OBJECTIVE: To study the relationship between treatment with diode laser transscleral cyclophotocoagulation and development a neurotrophic keratitis due to the damage of the sensitive corneal innervation., METHODS: A study was conducted on 5 eyes of 5 patients who were treated with diode laser transscleral cyclophotocoagulation and soon developed neurotrophic ulcers. Personal characteristics of the patients were collected, as well as refraction and risk factors for corneal hypoesthesia, and the parameters of the laser used in the surgery., RESULTS: It was found that the 5 patients had predisposing factors of corneal hypoesthesia prior to surgery (chronic use of topical beta blockers, surgery with corneal incisions, diabetes mellitus, or corneal dystrophies); however none had developed neurotrophic keratitis until the cyclophotocoagulation was performed. It also showed that 4 of them were highly myopic, and they all were treated with high laser parameters (with an average of 2880 mW for 3s at an average surface of 275degree), triggering neurotrophic ulcers between 10 and 35 days after surgery., CONCLUSION: Neurotrophic keratitis is a rare complication that can occur after diode laser transscleral cyclophotocoagulation, secondary to the damage of the long ciliary nerves. The emergence of this disorder can be triggered by the existence of previous risk factors, including high myopia, thus it is important to respect the recommended treatment parameters to prevent the development of this disorder.

Six patients died: four cases with disease-related deaths and two patients with GVHD-related deaths. The median survival post-transplant was 19.5 months (range 2.3-44.2 months). The post-transplant survival at 1-year was 62.5%, at 2-years 50%, and at 3-years 37.5%. In our opinion allogeneic transplant improves outcome in aggressive type ATLL.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

1616,"The effects of stimulation frequency and fatigue on the force-intensity relationship for human skeletal muscle OBJECTIVE: Functional electrical stimulation (FES) has not gained widespread application for a number of factors; two of which are rapid muscle fatigue and imprecise control in force. Stimulation intensity is adjusted during FES to overcome the decline in muscle force due to fatigue and precisely control muscle force output. The purpose of this study was to understand the relationship between muscle force output and stimulation intensity and to see how this relationship changes with fatigue., METHODS: Quadriceps femoris muscles of 10 able-bodied adults were tested isometrically. Pre- and post-fatigue muscle force responses to stimulation trains with different intensities and frequencies were recorded and analyzed. In addition, a case study using a subject with spinal cord injury was presented to illustrate the use of the force-intensity relationship to reduce muscle fatigue and improve the control of muscle force during repetitive electrical stimulation., RESULTS: An exponential relationship between muscle force and stimulation intensity was observed; interestingly, the normalized force-intensity relationship did not change with stimulation frequency or fatigue., CONCLUSIONS: The observed consistencies in the force-intensity relationship should assist scientists and clinicians to more accurately predict the forces produced by a muscle with changes in pulse duration during repetitive electrical stimulation., SIGNIFICANCE: The findings of this study provide guidelines for clinicians and researchers to adjust the stimulation intensity to achieve precise control of force repetitively during the application of FES.",Excluded
2354,"Accuracy and reliability of a novel web based analysis software in preoperative planning of patients with lower extremity trauma Introduction: Preoperative Planning is an important part of surgical treatment in patients with lower extremity. The aim of the study is to assess recently released web based software, ""Click2correct"" during preoperative planning of patients with lower extremity trauma. The angular deformity and length measurements of fractured bones is highly dependent to taken reference points. The new proposed system offer easy tools for standardization in determination of reference points, which were aimed to tested in the present study. Material(s) and Method(s): Twentyfour patients (eight females and sixteen males) with lower extremity fracture were admitted sequentially to orthopaedics and traumatology department of the same university. All patients were examined with direct x rays. The from fracture distorted and deformed bones were assessed with measurement tools of the PACS system of the Hospital. The radiographs were also uploaded to the click2correct web site. The angular deormity and leg length changes were also assessed by two researchers. The accuracy, and reliability were tested statistically between researchers and their measurements. Result(s): There were found positive correlations interobservers and intraoberver measurements in terms of assesment of angular deformity and shortening of fractured bones. Before decision of treatment modality the positional analysis of fractured bone parts of tibia and femurs has to be evaluated. The preoperative planning softwares aims to ease these procedure. The recently released software announced web based working solution as an advantage. Also new tools were offered during determination of reference points during measurement for standardization. The present study has found consistency between measurements. Furthermore virtual fracture reduction facility, which also guides in proper implant selection and placement was found useful. Conclusion(s): The rising frequency and penetrance of digital technology allows surgeons precise preoperative measurments and planning. Educational activities may extend usage and the attainability of these novel technologies.",Excluded

1957,"National survey of patient doses from whole-body FDG PET-CT examinations in France in 2011 A national survey of patient doses from 'whole-body PET-CT' examinations was conducted within all French nuclear medicine departments in 2011. Data related to injected [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) activity and to computerised tomography (CT) parameters were received from 56 positron emission tomography (PET)-CT units (answer rate: ~60 %). The average specific injected FDG activity was equal to 4.3 MBq kg(-1), in agreement with European recommendations. The new 'time-of-flight' technology enabled to decreasing the specific activity down to 3.5 MBq kg(-1). The results have shown that current diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) for the diagnostic trunk CT are too high for CT combined with PET, only performed in France for attenuation correction and localisation, and not for diagnostic purpose. Despite wide variations between PET-CT units (4-fold factor in CTDI(vol)), DRLs equal to 8 mGy (CTDI(vol)) and 750 mGy cm (dose-length product) could be proposed for whole-body PET-CT. The average effective dose related to whole-body PET-CT examination in France has been assessed to ~14 mSv.",Excluded
2102,"Preoperative radiation therapy for rectal cancer. An effective therapy in need of a clinical trial Sixty patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the rectum have been treated with preoperative high-dose pelvic irradiation in an attempt to improve operability and increase local control. Fifty-six patients showed no evidence of distant metastases at surgery and their records have been analyzed with respect to recurrence patterns, survival, and complications. The results have been compared with those of a similar analysis of 106 patients treated with curative surgery alone. There was a statistically significant improvement in local control between groups, with 16% of patients in the radiotherapy group having a component of local failure compared with 40% in the surgery group. A dose response was observed, with 67% local control at 4000 rad (4000 cGy) and 91% local control at 5000 rad (5000 cGy). Despite the more advanced clinical stage of the irradiated patients, no significant difference in survival was seen between groups, with a five-year survival rate of 52% in the irradiated patients and 48% in patients treated by surgery alone. Preoperative high-dose radiotherapy was well tolerated, with a 5% incidence of major complications in both groups.",Excluded
2436,"Impact of Vessel Suppressed-CT on Diagnostic Accuracy in Detection of Pulmonary Metastasis and Reading Time Rationale and Objectives: To assess if vessel suppression (VS) improves nodule detection rate, interreader agreement, and reduces reading time in oncologic chest computed tomography (CT). Material(s) and Method(s): One-hundred consecutive oncologic patients (65 male; median age 60y) who underwent contrast-enhanced chest CT were retrospectively included. For all exams, additional VS series (ClearRead CT, Riverrain Technologies, Miamisburg) were reconstructed. Two groups of three radiologists each with matched experience were defined. Each group evaluated the SD-CT as well as VS-CT. Each reader marked the presence, size, and position of pulmonary nodules and documented reading time. In addition, for the VS-CT the presence of false positive nodules had to be stated. Cohen's Kappa (k) was used to calculate the interreader-agreement between groups. Reading time was compared using paired t test. Result(s): Nodule detection rate was significantly higher in VS-CT compared to the SD-CT (+21%; p <0.001). Interreader-agreement was higher in the VS-CT (k = 0.431, moderate agreement) compared to SD-CT (k = 0.209, fair agreement). Almost all VS-CT series had false positive findings (97-99 out of 100). Average reading time was significantly shorter in the VS-CT compared to the SD-CT (154 +/- 134vs. 194 +/- 126; 21%, p<0.001). Conclusion(s): Vessel suppression increases nodule detection rate, improves interreader agreement, and reduces reading time in chest CT of oncologic patients. Due to false positive results a consensus reading with the SD-CT is essential.Copyright © 2020 The Association of University Radiologists",Excluded
2235,"The use of an air bubble curtain to reduce the received sound levels for harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) In December 2005 construction work was started to replace a harbor wall in Kerteminde harbor, Denmark. A total of 175 wooden piles were piled into the ground at the waters edge over a period of 3 months. During the same period three harbor porpoises were housed in a marine mammal facility on the opposite side of the harbor. All animals showed strong avoidance reactions after the start of the piling activities. As a measure to reduce the sound exposure for the animals an air bubble curtain was constructed and operated in a direct path between the piling site and the opening of the animals' semi-natural pool. The sound attenuation effect achieved with this system was determined by quantitative comparison of pile driving impulses simultaneously measured in front of and behind the active air bubble curtain. Mean levels of sound attenuation over a sequence of 95 consecutive pile strikes were 14 dB (standard deviation (s.d.) 3.4 dB) for peak to peak values and 13 dB (s.d. 2.5 dB) for SEL values. As soon as the air bubble curtain was installed and operated, no further avoidance reactions of the animals to the piling activities were apparent.",Excluded

1660,"Plaque quantification by coronary computed tomography angiography using intravascular ultrasound as a reference standard: A comparison between standard and last generation computed tomography scanners Aims: The emerging role of coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) as a non-invasive tool for atherosclerosis evaluation is supported by data reporting a good correlation between CCTA and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) for plaque volume quantification. Aim of the present study was to evaluate whether a last generation CT-scanner may improve coronary plaque volume assessment using IVUS as standard-of-reference. Methods and Results: From a registry of 1915 consecutive, all-comers, patients who underwent a clinically indicated IVUS evaluation we enrolled 59 patients who underwent CCTA with a 64-slice CT (Group 1) and 59 patients who underwent CCTA with whole-heart coverage CT scanner (Group 2). Patients who underwent CCTA with unfavourable heart rhythm were not excluded from the analysis. Image quality (4-point Likert scale) focused on plaque analysis was evaluated. Plaque volume quantification by CCTA was compared to IVUS. No difference in clinical characteristics was found between Group 1 and Group 2. Plaque volume quantification by CCTA was considered not feasible in 11 plaques of Group 1 and in 4 plaques of Group 2 (P = 0.09). Higher correlation for plaque volume quantification by CCTA vs. IVUS was demonstrated in Group 2 when compared with Group 1 (r = 0.9888 vs. 0.9499; P < 0.0001). The Bland-Altman analysis showed plaque volume overestimation by CCTA of 11.9 mm3 in Group 1 and 4 mm2 in Group 2 (P < 0.001). Effective radiation dose of CCTA was significantly lower in Group 2 vs. Group 1 (2.7 +/- 0.9 vs. 8.1 +/- 3.6 mSv, respectively; P < 0.001).

High risk participants (those having two or more elevated lipid values) are identified from monthly voluntary CVD screenings and counseled. Phone counseling consists of reviewing lab values with the participant, discussing dietary fat intake frequency using an intake questionnaire, and promoting the increase in exercise frequency. The participants are followed-up at two-months and five-months for relevant metrics including blood pressure, weight, body mass index (BMI), total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, dietary fat intake, and exercise frequency. Data for three years of the KSC CVD Program included 366 participants, average age of 49 years, 75% male, and 25% female. For those with complete two and five month follow-up data, significant baseline to two-month follow-up comparisons included decreases in systolic blood pressure (p = 0.03); diastolic blood pressure (p = 0.002); total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and dietary fat intake (all three at p < 0.0001) as well as a significant increase in exercise frequency (p = 0.04). Significant baseline to five-month follow-up comparisons included decreases in triglycerides (p = 0.05); and total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and dietary intake (all three at p < 0.0001).

2103,"Evaluation of PRRT after selective catheterization of the hepatic artery as established technique ('Aretaieion' Protocol) using 111In-DTPA-Phe1 octreotide in inoperable liver metastases due to neuroendocrine tumors Aim/Introduction: To evaluate the efficacy of Auger and Internal Conversion Electron Emission of 111In-DTPA-Phe1-Octreotide and their tumoricidal effectiveness due to their high LET, in inoperable liver metastases, positive for sst2 receptor over-expression (verified by Octreoscan and confirmed by biopsy) due to neuroendocrine tumours (NETs). Material(s) and Method(s): In 86 patients 111In-DTPA-Phe1-Octreotide was implemented after selective catheterization of the hepatic artery, in an average activity of 6.3+/-1.3 GBq per patient/ per session, consecutively, with a time interval between sessions of 6-8 weeks. Infusion repetition did not exceed the 12 sessions. Patients, being under repeated Sandostatin-LAR treatment (30 mg per 20 days) did not discontinued the dosage but they were intramuscularly injected 15-20 days prior to the radioactive session. To reduce myelotoxicity, 75 mg of DTPA in trip-trop diluted in about 200 ml normal saline water was infused 30 min before the initialization of the radiopeptide therapy, lasting for about 4 hrs. For the assessment of response, RECIST 1.1 standards were used. CT/MRI scans before, during and after the end of the whole procedure, as well as U/S images at monthly basis were performed. Absorbed doses delivered to metastases, kidneys and red marrow were calculated according to OLINDA/EXM 1.1 program. Toxicity (World Health Organization criteria) was measured using blood and urine tests of renal, hepatic and bone marrow function. Result(s): Three patients resulted in complete response (3.5%); partial response was assessed in 46 (53.5 %), disease stabilization in 21 (24.4 %) and progressive disease in 16 (18.6%). The median PFS and OS were estimated to be 32 and 47.5 months, respectively. The organ average radiation dose was estimated as follows: (a) Liver Tumor 15.2 mGy/MBq, (b) Liver 0.14 mGy/MBq, (c) Kidneys 0.41 mGy/ MBq, (d) Spleen 1.4 mGy/MBq and (f ) Bone marrow 0.0032 mGy/MBq. The average absorbed dose per session to a tumour for a spherical mass of 10 gr was estimated to be 10.8 mGy/MBq, depending on the histotype of the tumour. WHO toxicity grade 2 to 3 erythro-, leuko-and thrombocytopenia occurred in 9 (10.5%) cases observed about after the 3rd session. Conclusion(s): In unresectable metastatic liver lesions, positive for somatostatin receptors, repeated, transhepatic high doses of 111In-DTPA-Phe1-Octreotide resulted in an optimal therapeutic outcome with a disease control (CR+PR+SD) in an about 82 % of the treated patients. Thus, 111In-DTPA-Phe1-Octreotide, intra-arterially applied, can be considered as a potent candidate in the therapeutic pharetra against NETs.",Excluded
1891,"The role of age, sex and steroid sex hormones in radiation cataractogenesis It is critical to identify and gain a better understanding of the factors that enhance or reduce the risk of cataractogenesis, to minimize the possibility of occurrence after deliberate (e.g., radiation therapy, interplanetary travel) or unintentional exposure to ionizing radiation. Both gender and age at the time of exposure have been established as key determinants of cataractogenesis induced by sparsely ionizing (low-LET) and densely ionizing (high-LET) radiation. However, animal data from several older studies are often conflicting and somewhat difficult to interpret, in that the experiments suffered from small group sizes, limited dose ranges or short periods of observation, and human data are sparse or statistical significance is sometimes limited. Steroid sex hormones (SSH) may underlie age and gender-based differences in the progression and prevalence of cataracts that otherwise occur spontaneously in humans and animal models, and may also underlie age and sex-related differences in radiation cataractogenesis. Here, we review data that have aided in our understanding of the role of age, sex and steroid sex hormones in radiation cataractogenesis. © 2013 by Radiation Research Society.",Excluded
1565,"BMI1-KLF4 axis deficiency improves responses to neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with rectal cancer Purpose: Neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is a gold standard treatment for patients with stage II/III rectal cancer. B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion site 1 (BMI1) is a member of the polycomb group of proteins that are involved in regulating gene expression. High levels of BMI1 have been demonstrated to contribute to the malignant phenotypes of several cancers; however, its relevance in rectal cancer treated with CCRT is largely unknown. Methods and materials: We used two patient cohorts to address the clinical relevance of BMI1 in human cancers. In addition, HT-29 and HCT-116 cells were chosen as our in vitro models to verify the role of BMI1 in cell response to ionizing radiation. Stemness-related proteins were analyzed by western blotting and cell survival was determined using clonogenic assays. Result(s): BMI1 overexpression was found to significantly correlate with advanced pre-treatment nodal status (N1-N2; p < 0.001), post-treatment tumor stage (T1-T2; p = 0.015), inferior tumor regression grade (p = 0.001), and also an independent prognosis factor in 172 rectal cancer patients receiving CCRT. Serial cell-based functional examination indicated that BMI1 deficiency sensitized cells to radiation treatment by modulating the gene expression of Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) and enhanced radiosensitivity in microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal cancers. Overexpression of KLF4 partially overcame BMI1-deficiency-mediated gamma-H2AX expression after ionizing radiation exposure. Consistent with in vitro data, an analysis of an additional 30 rectal cancer tissue specimens revealed a positive correlation between BMI1 and KLF4 (p = 0.02). Conclusion(s): Higher levels of BMI1 are associated with poor therapeutic response and adverse outcomes in rectal cancer patients receiving CCRT.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
1692,"The prognostic significance of the treatment response of regional lymph nodes and the refinement of the current TNM staging system in locally advanced rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy The current TNM staging system uses the same category definitions for both rectal cancer patients with and without neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT). However, ypTNM stage, especially ypN stage does not predict patient survival after NCRT well. Whether tumor regression in lymph nodes (LRG) may improve the prediction has not been well studied. In total, 358 patients with rectal cancer who received NCRT followed by radical resection were recruited from 2004 to 2015, and the median follow-up time was 57.5 months. The main outcome measure was disease-free survival (DFS). In univariate analysis, factors associated with DFS were ypT stage, ypN stage, number of negative lymph nodes (NLN), lymph node ratio (LNR), tumor regression grade (TRG), M-TTRG (modified ypT stage by combining ypT stage and TRG), maximum LRG (LRGmax), sum score of LRG (LRGsum), LRG ratio (average value of LRGsum), and M-NLRG (modified ypN stage by combining LRGmax and LNR). In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, M-TTRG and M-NLRG (p < 0.001 and p = 0.030, respectively) were significantly associated with DFS. The estimated 5-year DFS rates were 86.6%, 60.3%, and 36.4% for patients with M-NLRG-0, M-NLRG-1, and M-NLRG-2, respectively (p < 0.001). A significant difference in survival was observed among patients with NCRT after incorporating TRG and LRG simultaneously into the current ypTNM staging system (p < 0.001). LRG was an important prognostic factor in rectal cancer patients treated with NCRT and could refine the ypTNM staging system. The modified ypTNM staging system in combination with LRGmax, LNR, and TRG could improve the DFS prediction in each subset of patients.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

The mean dose and the partial volumes receiving specified doses were determined for each gland from dose-volume histograms (DVHs). Nonstimulated and stimulated saliva flow rates were selectively measured from each parotid gland before RT and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the completion of RT. The data were fit using a generalized linear model and the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model of Lyman-Kutcher. In the latter model, a ""severe complication"" was defined as salivary flow rate reduced to < or =25% pre-RT flow at 12 months., RESULTS: Saliva flow rates data were available for 152 parotid glands. Glands receiving a mean dose below or equal to a threshold (24 Gy for the unstimulated and 26 Gy for the stimulated saliva) showed substantial preservation of the flow rates following RT and continued to improve over time (to median 76% and 114% of pre-RT for the unstimulated and stimulated flow rates, respectively, at 12 months). In contrast, most glands receiving a mean dose higher than the threshold produced little saliva with no recovery over time. The output was not found to decrease as mean dose increased, as long as the threshold dose was not reached. Similarly, partial volume thresholds were found: 67%, 45%, and 24% gland volumes receiving more than 15 Gy, 30 Gy, and 45 Gy, respectively. The partial volume thresholds correlated highly with the mean dose and did not add significantly to a model predicting the saliva flow rate from the mean dose and the time since RT. The NTCP model parameters were found to be TD50 (the tolerance dose for 50% complications rate for whole organ irradiated uniformly) = 28.4 Gy, n (volume dependence parameter) = 1, and m (the slope of the dose/response relationship) = 0.18. Clinical factors including age, gender, pre-RT surgery, chemotherapy, and certain medical conditions were not found to be significantly associated with the salivary flow rates. Medications (diuretics, antidepressants, and narcotics) were found to adversely affect the unstimulated but not the stimulated flow rates., CONCLUSIONS: Dose/volume/function relationships in the parotid glands are characterized by dose and volume thresholds, steep dose/response relationships when the thresholds are reached, and a maximal volume dependence parameter in the NTCP model. A parotid gland mean dose of < or =26 Gy should be a planning goal if substantial sparing of the gland function is desired.",Excluded

Fifty-two (5%) subjects had significant (>or=50%) diameter stenosis and 21 (2%) had severe (>or=75%) stenosis. Thirteen (25%) and 30 (58%) subjects with significant stenosis were classified into National Cholesterol Education Program low-risk and mild coronary calcification (coronary artery calcium scores <100), respectively. Midterm follow-up (17 +/- 2 months) revealed 15 cardiac events only in those with CAD on CTA: 1 unstable angina requiring hospital stay and 14 revascularization procedures. Most (87%) events occurred within 90 days of index CTA., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of occult CAD in apparently healthy individuals was not negligible, although their midterm prognosis was good. CTA has a potential to provide a better insight about the occult CAD in this population.

Nine patients required hospitalization, and 1 patient died., METHODS: To investigate the outbreak, pneumonia case patients were matched to control participants on the basis of age, sex, and community of residence. Participants in the investigation and their household contacts were interviewed, and serum samples and respiratory tract specimens were collected. Risk factors were evaluated by means of conditional logistic regression., RESULTS: Among 32 pneumonia case patients, 21 (65%) had confirmed or probable HAdV-14 infection. None of 32 matched control participants had evidence of HAdV-14 infection (P<.001 for the difference). Factors independently associated with pneumonia included contact with a known HAdV-14-infected case patient (odds ratio [OR], 18.3 [95% confidence interval {CI}, >or=2.0]), current smoking (OR, 6.7 [95% CI, >or=0.9]), and having neither traveled off the island nor attended a large public gathering (OR, 14.7 [95% CI, >or=2.0]). Fourteen (67%) of 21 HAdV-14-positive case patients belonged to a single network of people who socialized and often smoked together and infrequently traveled off the island. HAdV-14 infection occurred in 43% of case-patient household contacts, compared with 5% of control-participant household contacts (P = .005)., CONCLUSIONS: During a community outbreak in Alaska, HAdV-14 appeared to have spread mostly among close contacts and not widely in the community. Demographic characteristics and illness patterns among the case patients were similar to those observed in other recent outbreaks of HAdV-14 infection in the United States.",Excluded

Images were acquired with a maximum interval of 3 mo between them and were analyzed with masking by separate teams. Planar whole-body imaging and SPECT/CT were performed from thorax to pelvis using a double-head 16-slice SPECT/CT scanner 4 h after injection of 111-185 MBq of 99mTc-HYNIC-octreotide. 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT was performed from head to feet using a 16-slice PET/CT scanner 45 min after injection of 185 MBq of tracer. WB DWI was performed in the coronal plane using a 1.5-T scanner and a body coil. The standard method of reference for evaluation of image performance was undertaken: consensus among investigators at the end of the study, clinical and imaging follow-up, and biopsy of suggestive lesions., There are different metabolic imaging methods, various tracers, and emerging anatomic modalities to stage neuroendocrine tumor (NET). We aimed to compare NET lesion detectability among 99mTc-hydrazinonicotinamide (HYNIC)-octreotide (somatostatin receptor scintigraphy [SSRS]) SPECT/CT, 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT, and whole-body diffusion-weighted MR imaging (WB DWI)., Results: McNemar testing was applied to evaluate the detectability of lesions using 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT in comparison to SSRS SPECT/CT and WB DWI: a significant difference in detectability was noted for pancreas (P = 0.0455 and P = 0.0455, respectively), gastrointestinal tract (P = 0.0455 and P = 0.0455), and bones (P = 0.0082 and P = 0.0082). Two unknown primary lesions were identified solely by 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT. 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT, SSRS SPECT/CT, and WB DWI demonstrated, respectively, sensitivities of 0.96, 0.60, and 0.72; specificities of 0.97, 0.99, and 1.00; positive predictive values of 0.94, 0.96, and 1.00; negative predictive values of 0.98, 0.83, and 0.88; and accuracies of 0.97, 0.86, and 0.91., Conclusion: 68Ga PET/CT seems to be more sensitive for detection of well-differentiated NET lesions, especially for bone and unknown primary lesions. NET can be staged with 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT. WB DWI is an efficient new method with high accuracy and without ionizing radiation exposure. SSRS SPECT/CT should be used only when 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT and WB DWI are not available.Copyright COPYRIGHT © 2014 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Inc.",Excluded

It belongs to the category of cytokinins, the natural plant growth hormones that promote cell division and play role in cell differentiation. Overall, N6FA aids in increasing the plant's life span. Human cells also contain small quantities of N6FA. Scientists are trying to understand its function in humans. N6FA is being investigated for its properties such as antiplatelet, antioxidant, antiproliferative and anti-aging effects on human cells. The aim of the present investigation was to prepare solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN) based topical formulations of N6FA and to evaluate its efficacy against ultraviolet (UV) radiation induced skin photodamage. SLNs were prepared by hot microemulsion technique and optimized for the type and concentration of lipid and surfactant(s). The optimized SLN formulation was characterized in terms of particle size, drug entrapment efficiency, zeta potential and pH; evaluated for stability, spreadability, ex-vivo skin permeation and photoprotective effects against UV induced skin damage. The cumulative amount of drug permeated through mice skin using SLNs was 3 folds higher than from conventional cream base. The results of biochemical and histopathological investigations of skin treated with N6FA loaded SLNs clearly demonstrated the efficacy of optimized formulation in preventing photodamage (lesions, ulcers and changes in skin integrity) due to chronic UV exposure. The effects were comparable with widely used marketed formulation, Garnier wrinkle lift anti-aging cream. Results suggested that N6FA incorporated into SLNs may provide therapeutic as well as cosmeceutical benefits.Copyright © 2015 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.",Excluded
1361,"Flipping a Switch ""Down"" When Not Aligned with the Gravitational Vertical INTRODUCTION: To flip a switch ""down,"" our motor system can normally rely on concordant visual, gravitational, and egocentric cues about the vertical. However, divers must sometimes perform this task while visual cues are limited and gravitational cues are misaligned with egocentric cues. Astronauts must also flip switches ""down"" in absence of gravitational cues. Our study evaluates this ability using a laboratory simulation., METHODS: The subjects were 24 healthy volunteers who were blindfolded, tilted into different angles of roll, and asked to silence an alarm by flipping a switch ""down."" The switch was constructed such that it could be flipped in any direction in the subjects' frontal plane., RESULTS: Two subjects deflected the switch in accordance with the direction of gravity, irrespective of their body orientation. Twenty subjects deflected it in accordance with their body orientation, irrespective of the direction of gravity. The remaining two persons could not be classified unequivocally. Notably, some egocentric responders deflected the rod consistently toward their feet, but others deflected it consistently toward other parts of their body., DISCUSSION: Since our findings disagree with perceptual studies where gravitational rather than egocentric cues predominated in the absence of vision, we posit that perception and action may access distinct internal representations of the vertical. On the practical side, our findings indicate that designers of spaceflight and underwater equipment should not rely on divers' intuitive knowledge on how to flip a switch ""down."" Bock O, Bury N.

1703,"The evaluation of a modified technique of Total body irradiation in respect of treatment results and toxicity Introduction. Total body irradiation (TBI) is a well established part of the conditioning regimen prior to bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Numerous different techniques are used and every center elaborates own solutions. The aim of our study to present the method of TBI developed in our department, and to discuss the results of treatment with respect of early and late toxicity. Material and methods. Between 11.2000 and 08.2004 23 patients were treated with fractionated TBI at the Department od Radiotherapy of the M. Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Center and Institute of Oncology in Warsawa (MSCMCC). Conditioning chemotherapy and BMT were performed in different hematological departments. All patients were irradiated with a total midline dose of 12 Gy in 6 fractions over 3 consecutive days. Doses to the lung did not exceed 11 Gy. The TBI method used in our department was evaluated over a few years. The following modifications have been introduced to the previously applied technique: change of photon energy from 6 MV to 15 MV; increase of lung dose from 9 Gy to 11 Gy; the use of an individual bolus as a lung compensator in lateral fields; more frequent boost irradiation of the mediastinum and legs with small fields; calculations of Monitor Units based on dosimetric data. Boost irradiation of the chest wall with electrons has been abandoned. Results. Median follow up was 12 months. Up till now, 17/23 patients are alive, of these 16 with no relapse. Immediate toxicity was low. Early complications were observed during the first 6 months after BMT in 11 patients. In the case of 4 patients these complications were fatal. Late complications were observed in 10 patients, including chronic GVHD and hormone disturbancy. Only one patient had developed the first symptoms of cataract. In one case Lhermitte's syndrome was observed. One patient died due to liver insufficiency. Conclusions. The results of treatment and the complications rates in patients treated with TBI at our department are consistent with those published in literature. We conclud that our method of TBI is safe and well tolerated.",Excluded
1864,"Complex fractures of the distal humerus in the elderly: Is primary total elbow arthroplasty a valid treatment alternative? A series of 20 cases Introduction: Distal humerus fractures are fairly rare. But as our population ages, these fractures become more complex and the choice of treatment more delicate. Poor bone quality results in many technical problems and the fixation hardware stability remains at risk. The goal of this study was to evaluate the functional recovery and morbidity of complex distal humerus fractures in elderly patients when treated with elbow prosthesis. Hypothesis: Good functional recovery can be achieved with a total joint replacement. Patients and Methods: This series consisted of 20 patients (18 women and two men) having an average age of 80years (range 65-93, median 80). Based on the AO classification, there were two Type A2 fractures, two Type B fractures, 15 Type C fractures and one fracture that could not be classified because of previous rheumatoid disease history at this elbow. Two fractures were open. In two cases, the olecranon was also fractured. Treatment consisted of the implantation of a Coonrad-Morrey, hinge-type total elbow prosthesis (Zimmer, Warsaw, IN, USA). The Mayo Clinic surgical approach was used 17 times and the transolecranon approach was used three times. Primary arthroplasty was performed in 19 cases and the surgery was performed after six weeks of conservative treatment (diagnostic delay) in one case. Unrestricted motion was allowed after surgery, but a maximum of 0.5kg could be carried during the first 3months; this was subsequently increased to 2.5kg. Result(s): Fifteen of the 20 patients were available for reevaluation with an average follow-up of 3.6. years (range 1.7-5.5, median 3.4). Four patients had died and one was lost to follow-up. The average range of motion was 97degree (range 60-130degree), comprising an average flexion of 130degree (range 110-140degree) and average loss of extension of 33degree (range 0-80degree). Pronation and supination were normal. The average Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS) was 83 (range 60-100, median 80). X-rays revealed seven cases of radiolucent lines, with two being progressive. There was no visible wear of the polyethylene bushings at the hinge. Six patients had moderate periarticular heterotopic ossification. The two cases of olecranon osteotomy and one case of olecranon fracture had healed. There were no surgical site infections but two cases of ulnar compression, one of which required neurolysis. There was one case of humeral component loosening after 6. years, but the implant was not changed. Discussion(s): The clinical range of motion results were comparable to published data. The functional scores were slightly lower, mainly because of the pain factor. The initial results were encouraging and consistent with published data as long as the indications were well-chosen. Based on this retrospective study, total elbow arthroplasty can be a valid alternative in the surgeon's treatment armamentarium for complex distal humerus fractures in elderly patients who have moderate functional demands. Our results support our hypothesis, since we found good functional recovery without associated morbidity.

1548,"Growth hormone mitigates against lethal irradiation and enhances hematologic and immune recovery in mice and nonhuman primates Medications that can mitigate against radiation injury are limited. In this study, we investigated the ability of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) to mitigate against radiation injury in mice and nonhuman primates. BALB/c mice were irradiated with 7.5 Gy and treated post-irradiation with rhGH intravenously at a once daily dose of 20 mug/dose for 35 days. rhGH protected 17 out of 28 mice (60.7%) from lethal irradiation while only 3 out of 28 mice (10.7%) survived in the saline control group. A shorter course of 5 days of rhGH post-irradiation produced similar results. Compared with the saline control group, treatment with rhGH on irradiated BALB/c mice significantly accelerated overall hematopoietic recovery. Specifically, the recovery of total white cells, CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets, B cells, NK cells and especially platelets post radiation exposure were significantly accelerated in the rhGH-treated mice. Moreover, treatment with rhGH increased the frequency of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells as measured by flow cytometry and colony forming unit assays in bone marrow harvested at day 14 after irradiation, suggesting the effects of rhGH are at the hematopoietic stem/progenitor level. rhGH mediated the hematopoietic effects primarily through their niches. Similar data with rhGH were also observed following 2 Gy sublethal irradiation of nonhuman primates. Our data demonstrate that rhGH promotes hematopoietic engraftment and immune recovery post the exposure of ionizing radiation and mitigates against the mortality from lethal irradiation even when administered after exposure. © 2010 Chen et al.",Excluded

2091,"Gamma band oscillations reveal neural network cortical coherence dysfunction in schizophrenia patients BACKGROUND: Gamma band activity has been associated with many sensory and cognitive functions, and is important for cortico-cortical transmission and the integration of information across neural networks. The aims of the present study were to determine if schizophrenia patients have deficits in the generation and maintenance of coherent, synchronized oscillations in response to steady-state stimulation, and to examine the clinical and cognitive correlates of the electroencephalography (EEG) oscillatory dynamics., METHODS: Schizophrenia patients (n = 100) and nonpsychiatric subjects (n = 80) underwent auditory steady-state event-related potential testing. Click trains varying in rate of stimulation (20, 30, and 40 Hz) were presented; EEG-evoked power and intertrial phase synchronization were obtained in response to each stimulation frequency. Subjects also underwent clinical and neurocognitive assessments., RESULTS: Patients had reductions in both evoked power and phase synchronization in response to 30- and 40-Hz stimulation but normal responsivity to 20-Hz stimulation. Maximal deficits were detected in response to 40-Hz stimulation. A modest association of reduced working memory performance and 40-Hz intertrial phase synchronization was present in schizophrenia patients (r = .32, p <.01)., CONCLUSIONS: Schizophrenia patients have frequency-specific deficits in the generation and maintenance of coherent gamma-range oscillations, reflecting a fundamental degradation of basic integrated neural network activity.",Excluded
2359,"Cement augmentation method for proximal epiphyseal humeral fracture in osteoporotic elderly patients treated by intramedullary nailing and plates and screws: A 4-year follow-up Introduction Proximal epiphyseal humeral fractures are common in elderly people and their treatment has a rate of complications due to technical failure (cut out, head rotation). Methods We studied 24 patients (15 females, 9 males) with an average age of 79.42 years (range 69 to 83 years) and severe osteoporotic bone (1 or 2 Singh score). They all had proximal epiphyseal humeral fracture, classified as type II-III following Neer classification, defined as fractures of the surgical humeral neck. Sixteen patients were treated with T2 proximal humeral nail (Stryker Srl) and 8 with Philos plate and screws (Synthes Srl) with a modified technique consisting in augmentation of the proximal screws. Augmentation was done with The Locker system (Tecres SpA) inserted through the tunnel for the cephalic screws. The evaluation is based on: operating time, early functional recovery using the Constant- Murley score, X-ray evaluation, mechanical and biological complications. Results The Constant-Murley average score was 71.3 after 1 month post-operation, 73.4 after 3 months, 76.7 after 12 months, 75.4 after 48 months. No other complications (infection, cut out and humeral head necrosis) have been reported at the follow-up. Discussion The review of the recent literature highlights the augmentation's method benefits in support of fractures due to osteoporosis. Due to the poor quality of the bone tissue, this is not able to provide sufficient substrate in which the means of synthesis can be anchored stably, leading to complications in the subject. Conclusions The observations based on the reported results allow to conclude that the cement augmentation of proximal screws in severe osteoporotic bone treatedwith T2 nail and Philos plate could improve the mechanical stability of the implant, ensuring early functional recovery.",Excluded

1781,"Eos, o-arm and standard spine radiographs; What is the cumulative radiation exposure during current scoliosis management? Background/introduction: During the course of assessment and treatment for AIS, patients are subjected to repeated radiological exposure. Only a few studies have evaluated the total absorbed radiation dose from standard radiography and EOS during follow-up for scoliosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate and compare total radiation dose exposure from all modalities for a cohort of AIS patients. Purpose of the study: The primary aim of this study was to determine the radiation exposure of AIS patients during scoliosis management. Moreover, this study aimed to compare follow-up algorithms among international spine centers. Material(s) and Method(s): A retrospective review on radiation exposure of patients treated for AIS. Inclusions: patients followed for AIS from 2013 to 2016 without neuromuscular diseases. The O-arm conebeam CT scanner was used for 3D navigation in all surgically managed patients, low dose protocols were used (70 kVp, 80 mAs). A survey asking for information on radiological algorithms and imaging frequencies was sent to a number of international spine centers for comparison with in-house algorithm. Result(s): 61 patients were included, 19 were treated conservatively (M/F: 6/13) and 42 surgically (M/F: 11/31). Median follow up time for the conservative group was 8 (range 0-51) months and 37 (range 13-163) months for the surgical group. Median number of X-rays/EOS were; 2 (range 0-20)/2 (range 0-17) for the conservative group and 15 (range 2-57)/11(range 0-26) for the surgery group. Patients undergoing surgery received a median cumulative radiation dose of 10.31 mSv (range 3.79-20.43) vs. a median dose of 1.09 mSv (range 0.22-7.17) for those treated conservatively. Approximately 25% (39.04/161.82 mSv) of total intraoperative radiation dose for all patients was a result of O-arm 2D fluoroscopy. A mean of 11 levels of the spine were fused during correction surgeries. Median Cobb angle at the beginning/end of follow up were 19-(range 10--50-)/23- (range 12--65-) for the conservative group and 44- (range 10--80-)/15- (range 4--30-) for the surgery group. Median Cobb angle before the surgery was 52- (range 36--82-). The results of the questionnaire showed great variety of radiological follow-up algorithms among 8 spine centers without adherence to any of the published consensus statements. Conclusion(s): Surgically treated patients were, as anticipated, exposed to more, radiation dose than those treated conservatively, almost 10-fold more, owing mainly to intraoperative 3D scans and a larger numbers of radiological follow-up examinations. The use of conebeam CT-based 3D navigation elevates patient safety during deformity surgery. However, patients are potentially exposed to a significant amount of radiation depending on protocol and use of 2D fluoroscopy. Further awareness of ways to reduce radiation dose and optimize radiological protocols is warranted in order to decrease radiation-induced malignancy.",Excluded

1977,"Comparison of different cooling regimes within a shortened liquid cooling/warming garment on physiological and psychological comfort during exercise The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of different cooling regime intensities to maintain physiological and subjective comfort during physical exertion levels comparable to that engaged in during extravehicular activities (EVA) in space. We studied eight subjects (six males, two females) donned in our newly developed physiologically based shortened liquid cooling/warming garment (SLCWG). Rigorous (condition 1) and mild (condition 2) water temperature cooling regimes were compared at physical exertion levels comparable to that performed during EVA to ascertain the effectiveness of a lesser intensity of cooling in maintaining thermal comfort, thus reducing energy consumption in the portable life support system. Exercise intensity was varied across stages of the session. Finger temperature, rectal temperature, and subjective perception of overall body and hand comfort were assessed. Finger temperature was significantly higher in the rigorous cooling condition and showed a consistent increase across exercise stages, likely due to the restriction of heat extraction because of the intensive cold. In the mild cooling condition, finger temperature exhibited an overall decline with cooling, indicating greater heat extraction from the body. Rectal temperature was not significantly different between conditions, and showed a steady increase over exercise stages in both rigorous and mild cooling conditions. Ratings of overall comfort were 30% higher (more positive) and more stable in mild cooling (p<0.001). The mild cooling regime was more effective than rigorous cooling in allowing the process of heat exchange to occur, thus maintaining thermal homeostasis and subjective comfort during physical exertion.",Excluded

1299,"Treatment and prognosis of stage I follicular lymphoma in the modern era-does PET matter? Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most common subtype of indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Patients with stage I disease are usually treated with radiotherapy (RT). In previous studies, mostly from the pre positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) era, the 5 year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates of stage I disease were 60-80% and 80-93%, respectively. This study retrospectively evaluated the outcome of stage I FL which was treated with involved field RT in the PET-CT era between 2002 and 2015. Ninety-one patients were enrolled. Five year PFS and OS rates were 73% and 97%, respectively. Relapse occurred in 19 (21%) patients, 74% occurring outside the radiation field. In conclusion, PET-CT staging of clinical stage I FL may contribute to the improved prognosis in patients treated with RT compared to historical cohorts, possibly due to better identification of ""genuine"" stage I disease.Copyright © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Excluded

2234,"Relationship between interferon regulatory factor 4 genetic polymorphisms, measures of sun sensitivity and risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma OBJECTIVE: Sun exposure and sensitivity, including pigmentation, are associated with risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). One variant in the immune regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) gene (rs12203592) is associated with pigmentation, and a different IRF4 variant (rs12211228) is associated with NHL risk. We evaluated the independent roles of these IRF4 polymorphisms and sun sensitivity in mediating NHL risk and explored whether they are confounded or modified by each other. METHOD(S): Genotyping of tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IRF4 gene was conducted in 990 NHL cases and 828 controls from a multi-center US study. Measures of sun sensitivity and exposure were ascertained from computer-assisted personal interviews. We used logistic regression to compute odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for NHL in relation to sun exposures, sun exposures in relation to IRF4 genotypes, and NHL in relation to sun exposures. We further assessed the effects of sun exposures in relation to IRF4 genotypes. RESULT(S): As previously reported, we found significant associations between IRF4 rs12211228 and NHL and between hair and eye color and NHL. The IRF4 rs12203592 polymorphism (CT/TT genotype) was statistically significantly associated with eye color and particularly with hair color (OR(Light Blonde) = 0.24, 95% CI = 0.11-0.50, overall Chi square p = 0.0002). Analysis of joint effects between eye and hair color with the IRF4 rs12203592 SNP did not reveal statistically significant p-interactions although NHL risk did decline with lighter hair color and presence of the variant IRF4 rs12203592 allele, compared to those without a variant allele and with black/brown hair color. CONCLUSION(S): Our data do not statistically support a joint effect between IRF4 and sun sensitivity in mediating risk for NHL.

All the gamma-irradiated allografts (tibialis anterior tendons) received an irradiation dose of 2.5 Mrad before distribution. Patients in this study had undergone a preoperative magnetic resonance imaging scan and physical examination. Patients were excluded from the study if they had a concomitant injury to other knee ligaments, previous surgery on the injured knee, or articular cartilage lesions greater than Outerbridge grade II.

2032,"Cardiac exposure in the dynamic conformal arc therapy, intensity-modulated radiotherapy and volumetric modulated arc therapy of lung cancer Purpose: To retrospectively evaluate the cardiac exposure in three cohorts of lung cancer patients treated with dynamic conformal arc therapy (DCAT), intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), or volumetricmodulated arc therapy (VMAT) at our institution in the past seven years. Methods and Materials: A total of 140 lung cancer patients were included in this institutional review board approved study: 25 treated with DCAT, 70 with IMRT and 45 with VMAT. All plans were generated in a same commercial treatment planning system and have been clinically accepted and delivered. The dose distribution to the heart and the effects of tumor laterality, the irradiated heart volume and the beam-to-heart distance on the cardiac exposure were investigated. Result(s): The mean dose to the heart among all 140 plans was 4.5 Gy. Specifically, the heart received on average 2.3, 5.2 and 4.6 Gy in the DCAT, IMRT and VMAT plans, respectively. The mean heart doses for the left and right lung tumors were 4.1 and 4.8 Gy, respectively. No patients died with evidence of cardiac disease. Three patients (2%) with preexisting cardiac condition developed cardiac disease after treatment. Furthermore, the cardiac exposure was found to increase linearly with the irradiated heart volume while decreasing exponentially with the beam-to-heart distance. Conclusion(s): Compared to old technologies for lung cancer treatment, modern radiotherapy treatment modalities demonstrated better heart sparing. But the heart dose in lung cancer radiotherapy is still higher than that in the radiotherapy of breast cancer and Hodgkin's disease where cardiac complications have been extensively studied. With strong correlations of mean heart dose with beam-to-heart distance and irradiated heart volume, cautions should be exercised to avoid long-term cardiac toxicity in the lung cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy.Copyright © 2015 Ming et al.

1919,"Exposure to Radiation During Work Shifts and Working at Night Act as Occupational Stressors Alter Redox and Inflammatory Markers Background: Studies of breast cancer etiology suggest evidence that night shift working and occupational exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) are defined risk factors for breast cancer development. There are few studies to clarify neuroendocrine and inflammatory status and the possible consequences particularly in occupational exposure. Aim of the study. Our aim was to associate the redox and inflammatory biomarkers with either nightshift working or occupational radiation exposure, and to compare their levels between the two groups at Alexandria University Hospitals, Alexandria, Egypt. Method(s): We included 150 female nurses at Alexandria University Hospitals: 50 nightshift workers, 50 radiation workers, and 50 dayshift workers as a control group (neither work nightly nor radiation workers). In morning serum sample (7 am), we measured the concentrations of serum melatonin, Cortisol, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) by ELISA; malondialdehyde (MDA) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) levels colorimetrically, and C-reactive protein (C-RP) levels by turbidimetric method. Result(s): Nightshift workers had significantly lower levels of melatonin and TAC, and higher levels of serum inflammatory markers and cortisol, than day shift control group of workers. Workers occupationally exposed to IR had significantly higher levels of serum melatonin, MDA and inflammatory markers, lower levels of serum cortisol, and lower TAC than day shift workers.

1670,"Treatment of bifurcation in-stent restenotic lesions with beta radiation using strontium 90 and sequential positioning pullback technique: procedural details and clinical outcomes BACKGROUND: In-stent restenotic lesions have been problematic for many patients with the need for multiple repeat percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). The need for repeat PCI has been significantly reduced in patients since the advent of vascular brachytherapy. In-stent restenosis resulting in bifurcation presents even more of a challenge. The use of radiation therapy for the treatment of this kind of lesion has not yet been reported. The purpose of this paper is to present five cases of radiation therapy in bifurcation in-stent restenotic lesions using the intraluminal beta radiation catheter delivery system (Beta-Cath System, Novoste Corporation, Norcross, Georgia)., METHODS: We reviewed the database of patients enrolled in our Compassionate Use Registry between August 1999 and April 2002. The data is reported for 5 patients who received radiation in both branches of bifurcation lesions with the Beta-Cath catheter system., RESULTS: The mean diameter of the vessels was 3.1 mm 0.5 mm. The dose administered was from 18.3 to 23 Gy, with an overlap of 3.3 to 10.3 mm; the hinge angle between the branches went from 43.3 to 65.4 . Angiographic follow-up was obtained at 6 months in 4 patients, with a single patient showing a focal (< 5 mm) edge lesion treated by balloon angioplasty (TVR no TLR).

Significant differences were found in eccentric loads in both factors. Natural load has a significant difference in stress, but no differences were found for displacements. The absolute difference in eccentric load applied to the anterior area location on the same patient implies from 5.3% to 40.5% of the stress yield values reported in previous studies. Conclusion(s): Loads applied to the anterior area of the femoral head must be considered in fracture simulations because the percentage of yield stress of pre- and post-irradiated bones shows a significant biomechanical change.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

1691,"Capacity of primary hospitals for diabetes treatment in six Chinese provinces: A cross-sectional survey Background Establishment of a hierarchical medical system is one of the major tasks outlined in China's ambitious health reform, and the ultimate success of this system depends on the treatment capacity of primary hospitals. Among the priorities of primary hospitals is the provision of quality services for chronic diseases, including diabetes, atypical and epidemic chronic disease in China. We aimed to estimate the capacity of primary hospitals for diabetes treatment in six Chinese provinces. Methods We did a cross-sectional survey in China using qualitative and quantitative methods. First, we interviewed 24 related experts (five primary hospital principals, six general practitioner, five drug experts, five medical device experts, two clinical experts, and one health system expert) to establish the capacity standard of primary hospital for diabetes treatment in the hierarchical medical system. Next, we surveyed the treatment capacity with regards to human resources, drug supply, and medical equipment in 28 primary hospitals (17 urban and 11 rural) in six provinces in China (Shanghai, Fujian, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, and Guizhou) between May 20 and July 12, 2016. Finally, we compared the survey results against the standard. We adopted purposive sampling, and used chi2 test and rank sum test for data analyses. Ethics approval was granted by Sichuan University, and all participants provided oral informed consent. Findings The primary hospitals surveyed had a mean of 1.76 general practitioners (SD 2.03) per million residents. The mean number of general practitioners per million residents was 1.48 (1.18) for rural hospitals and 1.92 (2.41) for urban hospitals, which were lower than the standard (2-3, based on the expert interviews and policy review). 11 (65%) urban primary hospitals provided three or more types of drugs, compared with four (36%) rural primary hospitals. Urban primary hospitals had a mean of 8.35 (SD 4.44) types of diabetes drugs and rural ones had 4.45 (3.33), although expert interviews and policy reviews indicated that primary hospitals need provide seven types of drugs that are often used in the clinic. 27 (96%) primary hospitals provided metformin, 26 (93%) sulfonylureas, 18 (64%) alphaglucosidase inhibitors, 16 (57%) insulin, 15 (54%) hypoglycaemic proprietary Chinese medicine, 11 (39%) glinides, and nine (32%) thiazolidinediones; newer antidiabetic drugs such as DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, and GLP-1 receptor agonists were scarcely supplied. All 28 primary hospitals were equipped with blood glucose meters, blood pressure instruments, and electrocardiograph machines; 25 (89%) had biochemical analysers, 27 (96%) B ultrasound machines, 20 (71%) colour Doppler ultrasound machines and x-ray machines, and eight (29%) fundus mirrors, while expert interviews showed that primary hospitals should have with all of these equipment. No significant difference in availability of medical equipment was recorded between rural and urban primary hospitals (p>0.05). Interpretation Primary hospitals in China, especially those in rural areas, do not have sufficient human resources and drugs for diabetes treatment, although they generally have adequate medical equipment. Strategies to enhance the capacity of primary hospitals for diabetes treatment need to increase the number of health-care workers and drug supply.",Excluded
1587,"A novel combination of percutaneous stenting with iodine-125 seed implantation and chemotherapy for the treatment of pancreatic head cancer with obstructive jaundice Purpose: Insertion of radioactive strips through the biliary stent has been reported to offer longer survival and patency than an uncovered conventional self-expanding metal stent in patients with unresectable malignant biliary obstruction. The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and effectiveness of intraluminal brachytherapy combined with 125I seed implantation and transarterial infusion chemotherapy for the treatment of pancreatic head cancer with obstructive jaundice. Method(s): From October 2012 to January 2018, 21 consecutive patients diagnosed with biliary obstruction caused by locally advanced, nonmetastatic pancreatic cancer with cytologically or histologically confirmed by biopsy were enrolled and receive treatment with intraluminal brachytherapy using 125I seed strand and CT-guided percutaneous radioactive seed implantation therapy. The procedure-related and radiation complications were assessed. The outcomes were measured in terms of stent patency, patient survival, complications related to the procedure. Result(s): One of the 22 patients (4.5%, 1/22) with pancreatic head cancer failed to perform the above procedure because the guidewire was unable to pass through the obstruction segment. The remaining 21 patients (95.5%, 21/22) with pancreatic head cancer with obstructive jaundice were successfully placed with biliary stents and radioactive strips through drainage tubes. The median number of 125I seeds loaded was 15, ranging from 12 to 17. After the chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin, no adverse reaction of Grade III ~ occurred in all cases. Median stent patency was 12.50 months (95% CI: 10.26, 14.74). By May 2019, all 21 patients had died, with overall survival of 5.2-23.3 months, with a median survival of 13.20 months (95% CI: 10.96, 15.44). Conclusion(s): Percutaneous 125I seed implantation combined with insertion of radioactive strips through the biliary stent has the characteristics of less trauma, fewer complications, simple operation, and so on. These procedures bring remission of obstructive jaundice combined with the increased survival for the treatment of obstructive jaundice caused by unresectable pancreatic head cancer if follow-up chemotherapy is carried out. The long-term efficacy of this treatment combination needs to be confirmed by further multicenter, large sample size prospective randomized controlled studies.Copyright © 2021 American Brachytherapy Society",Excluded
1571,"Prognostic and Treatment Guiding Significance of MRI-Based Tumor Burden Features and Nodal Necrosis in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma We aimed to develop a nomogram integrating MRI-based tumor burden features (MTBF), nodal necrosis, and some clinical factors to forecast the distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) of patients suffering from non-metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). A total of 1640 patients treated at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (Guangzhou, China) from 2011 to 2016 were enrolled, among which 1148 and 492 patients were randomized to a training cohort and an internal validation cohort, respectively. Additionally, 200 and 257 patients were enrolled in the Foshan and Dongguan validation cohorts, respectively, which served as independent external validation cohorts. The MTBF were developed from the stepwise regression of six multidimensional tumor burden variables, based on which we developed a nomogram also integrating nodal necrosis and clinical features. This model divided the patients into high- and low-risk groups by an optimal cutoff. Compared with those of patients in the low-risk group, the DMFS [hazard ratio (HR): 4.76, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.39-6.69; p < 0.0001], and progression-free survival (PFS; HR: 4.11, 95% CI: 3.13-5.39; p < 0.0001) of patients in the high-risk group were relatively poor. Furthermore, in the training cohort, the 3-year DMFS of high-risk patients who received induction chemotherapy (ICT) combined with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) was better than that of those who were treated with CCRT alone (p = 0.0340), whereas low-risk patients who received ICT + CCRT had a similar DMFS to those who only received CCRT. The outcomes we obtained were all verified in the three validation cohorts. The survival model can be used as a reliable prognostic tool for NPC patients and is helpful to determine patients who will benefit from ICT.© Copyright © 2020 Chen, Cao, Jing, Xia, Ke, Xiang, Liu, Qiang, Liang, Li, Gao, Li, Miao, Liu, Cai, Lv, Guo, Li and Lv.",Excluded
2211,"Totally automatic definition of renal regions of interest from 99mTc-MAG3 renograms: validation in patients with normal kidneys and in patients with suspected renal obstruction INTRODUCTION: An image-processing algorithm (AUTOROI) has been developed to totally automatically (or with manual assistance) detect whole-kidney contours and generate renal regions of interest (ROI) for the extraction of the quantitative measurements used in the interpretation of Tc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine (Tc-MAG3) renograms., METHODS: The 18-20th min dynamic frames post-MAG3 injection were used to automatically define boxes surrounding each kidney, which were then transposed to an early composite image for interpolative and directional background subtraction. Sobel operator and unsharp masking were applied for edge enhancement, and the resulting image histograms were equalized to better define poorly functioning kidneys. AUTOROI searched radially from the center of mass to define each kidney's ROI coordinates. AUTOROI was validated using MAG3 studies from 79 patients referred for suspected obstruction (79 left, 77 right kidneys) and 19 kidney donors with normal kidney function and no obstruction. Renal ROIs were manually defined by a nuclear medicine technologist with 20+ years of experience (reference standard) and an American Board of Nuclear Medicine certified physician. AUTOROI and physician ROIs were automatically compared with the reference standard to determine the border definition error., RESULTS: AUTOROI totally automatically detected the renal borders in 89% (172 of 194) of the kidneys from the entire group of 98 patients. The 22 kidneys missed automatically were subsequently detected with the assistance of a single manually placed fiducial point demarcating the liver/kidney boundary. These 22 kidneys were shown to be associated with markedly reduced MAG3 clearance. The mean error of AUTOROI for all 194 kidneys was 6.66+/-3.77 and 7.31+/-4.52 mm for the left and right kidney, respectively. The physician's error was 6.78+/-2.42 and 6.65+/-2.05 mm for the left and right kidney, respectively. This error difference between AUTOROI and the physician was not statistically significant., CONCLUSION: AUTOROI provides an objective and promising approach to automated renal ROI detection.",Excluded
1447,"Mri of the inferior alveolar nerve and lingual nerve-benchmark values and anatomical variety in healthy subjects Background: Radiation based imaging techniques like panoramic radiography, computed tomography (CT) or cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) are currently the standard for depicting the mandibular canal prior to surgical procedures. However, these modalities are lacking sufficient soft tissue visualization of the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) and the lingual nerve (LN), which is particularly exposed to injury during wisdom tooth removal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using dedicated imaging sequences showed promising results in the direct visualization of the IAN and the LN with high spatial resolution and signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) quantification. The aim of this study was to define standard specifications in MRI which allow for benchmark definition of SNR values in healthy subjects. Method(s): 33 healthy volunteers were examined on a 3T scanner. The conducted sequence protocol consisted of a 3D STIR, 3D WATS and a 3D T1 FFE ""black bone""-sequence. Result(s): The study highlights the feasibility of a direct visualization of proximal and peripheral branches of the IAN and proximal LN. STIR and WATS sequences allowed for morphological discrimination of nerval and vascular components and their anatomical localization within the mandible. The STIR sequence showed significantly higher signalto-noise-ratios for IAN as well as for the LN in the proximal and distal part of the corresponding nerves (p < 0.05). Discussion(s): The data presented in this study reveal, that a direct visualization of the course of the IAN and LN is feasible using high resolution STIR and WATS sequences. Furthermore, the imaging protocol conducted not only allowed for reproducible nerve diameter measurements but also for subsequent calculation of quantitative parameters like aSNR. Conclusion(s): MRI using a dedicated sequence protocol allows for detection, nerve signal quantification and morphological characterization of the course of the IAN and the LN with its variant forms in healthy subjects.",Excluded
2413,"Transanal endoscopic microsurgery for the treatment of rectal cancer: Comparison of wound complication rates with and without neoadjuvant radiation therapy Background: Neoadjuvant therapy for rectal cancer has led to improved tumor downstaging and higher complete pathologic response rates. At the same time, the introduction of transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) technique has renewed interest in local excision of rectal cancer. There has been concern that radiation may make the more radical local excision with TEM unsuitable. Our study compared morbidity rates and wound complication rates for patients undergoing TEM and local excision with and without neoadjuvant radiation to determine whether this could be accomplished safely. Method(s): Data for all patients undergoing TEM are prospectively entered into a database. This database was queried for patients with rectal cancer undergoing TEM from November 1997 to June 2007. Of 64 patients identified, 2 were excluded because of previous radiation to the pelvis. Result(s): The study enrolled 62 patients with a final pathologic diagnosis of rectal cancer: 43 treated using neoadjuvant therapy with radiation (XRT) and 19 patients treated with TEM alone. The patients in the XRT group were 67 years of age (range, 29-86 years) and included 13 women. The patients in the non-XRT group were 66 years of age (range, 40-89 years) and included 8 women. Neither group had any mortalities. The overall morbidity rate was 33% for the XRT group and 5.3% for the non-XRT group, and this difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). The wound complication rates were 25.6% for the XRT group (11 patients) and 0% for the non-XRT group (p = 0.015). Nine patients in the XRT group (82%) had minor wound separations, and two patients (18%) had major wound separation. Ten patients with wound separations were treated as outpatients and administered long-term oral antibiotics. One patient required additional surgery (diverting stoma). Conclusion(s): Not unexpectedly, the wound complication rate was higher in the XRT group. However, 82% of those wounds were minor, and 91% were treated without any additional surgery or intervention. Although a significant concern, wound complications do not prohibit TEM treatment after neoadjuvant treatment. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Excluded

1903,"Patient radiation exposure measurements during interventional procedures: a prospective study This is a prospective study with the purpose of assessing patient radiation dose and stochastic risk (risk for fatal cancer) in a patient population undergoing interventional radiological (IR) procedures. Measurements were performed on 36 consecutive patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA, n=18), transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS, n=3), diagnostic angiography (DA, n=6), arterial embolization (AE, n=3), and hepatic neoplasm chemoembolization (HCE, n=6). Kerma area product (KAP) was used as a measure of x-ray exposure to the patient. Mean KAP value per procedure was 79+/-50 Gy cm for PTA, 139+/-55 Gy cm for TIPS, 110+/-44 Gy cm for DA, 325+/-145 Gy cm for AE, and 150+/-76 Gy cm for HCE. Forty-six percent of total KAP value was attributed to fluoroscopy. In conclusion, we showed that a linear correlation between effective dose and KAP was found (r=0.84), which could be used for estimating patient effective dose using KAP measurements. Small changes to the number of digital frames acquired result in substantial change of the total KAP in interventional radiological procedures. Stochastic risk from IR procedures is quite low for the patient. Measuring KAP is a simple and accurate method, which provides the interventional radiologist with a good estimation of the patient's relative risk for stochastic effects.",Excluded

1985,"Optimized radioiodine therapy of Graves' disease: Analysis of the delivered dose and of other possible factors affecting outcome The best approach to radioiodine dose selection in the treatment of Graves' hyperthyroidism remains highly controversial. The formula to calculate the individual dose of 131I to be delivered has been used for half a century and takes into account the thyroid mass, the effective half- life and the maximum uptake of 131I. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the accuracy of this formula by determining the relationship between the administered dose of 131I calculated to deliver a target dose of 50 Gy to the thyroid and the actual exact organ dose. We further analyzed if therapeutic success, defined by euthyroidism following the individually calculated dose, can be predicted by different pretreatment parameters and particularly by organ dose. One hundred patients with a first episode of Graves' disease and who had received optimal thyroid irradiation after precise dosimetry were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were categorized according to their thyroid function (plasma free thyroxine (T4) serum concentration) as eu-, hyper- or hypothyroid during and 1 year after treatment. The relationship between the administered dose and organ dose was assessed by simple regression. We compared free T4, free tri-iodothyronine, thyroid weight, the number of patients with antithyroperoxidase antibodies and TSH receptor autoantibodies. 24 h urinary iodine excretion, 131I uptake, and the exact dose of 131I delivered to the thyroid as pretreatment variables. Although we found a correlation between administered dose (mCi) and organ dose (Gy) (r = 0.3, P = 0.003), the mean coefficient of variation for organ dose was 45%. Individualized radioiodine therapy enabled euthyroidism in 26% of patients and failed in 74% of patients (33% had persistent or recurrent hyperthyroidism and 41% permanent hypothyroidism). 131I uptake was significantly higher in the hyperthyroidism group in comparison with the euthyroid group. However, organ dose and other pretreatment variables did not differ among the three groups. In conclusion, these results confirm the low performance of individual dosimetry using what are established ratios, since the delivered dose to the gland, although correlated to the intended dose, is highly variable. The finding that other usual pretreatment variables are not different between groups, gives little hope for improving the way of calculating the ideal dose of radioiodine. We suggest to those not yet ready to give a standard or an ablative dose for Graves' hyperthyroidism that they abandon this way to calculate the 131I dose.",Excluded

1726,"Impact of cardiac resynchronisation therapy on cardiologists' exposure to radiation during implantation of pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators Cardiologists are among the health professionals that are most exposed to ionizing radiation, but there is no recent study quantifying overexposure of physicians during cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) procedures compared to 'classical' implantation of pacemakers (PMs) or implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). We aimed to measure and compare operator exposure to radiation during implantation of PM and ICD with or without CRT. The study population comprised all PMs and ICDs implanted in a large referral centre over a six months period. The endpoint was operator radiation exposure, assessed using a personal electronic dosimeter located on operator's chest. In total, 169 PM/ICD implantations were analysed, 19 of which included CRT. Compared with 'classical' implantation, cardiologist radiation exposure was 9-fold greater during CRT procedures (p < 0.001). Physician exposure was related to dose-area product (R2 = 0.21 during 'classical' implantations and R2 = 0.57 during CRT procedures).

1950,"Application of an artificial neural network model for early outcome prediction of gamma knife radiosurgery in patients with trigeminal neuralgia and determining the relative importance of risk factors Objectives: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a minimally invasive modality for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (TN). Outcome prediction of this modality is very important for proper case selection. The aim of this study was to create artificial neural networks (ANN) to predict the clinical outcomes after gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) in patients with TN, based on preoperative clinical factors. Patients and Methods: We used the clinical findings of 155 patients who were underwent GKRS (from March 2000 to march 2015) at Iran Gamma Knife center, Teheran, Iran. Univariate analysis was performed for a long list of risk factors, and those with P-Value < 0.2 were used to create back-propagation ANN models to predict pain reduction and hypoesthesia after GKRS. Pain reduction was defined as BNI score 3a or lower and hypoesthesia was defined as BNI score 3 or 4. Result(s): Typical trigeminal neuralgia (TTN) (P-Value = 0.018) and age>65 (P-Value = 0.040) were significantly associated with successful pain reduction and three other variables including radiation dosage >85 (P-Value = 0.098), negative history of diabetes mellitus (P-Value = 0.133) and depression (P-Value = 0.190). On the other hand, radio dosage>85 (P-Value = 0.008) was significantly associated with hypoesthesia, other related risk factors (with p-Value<0.2), were history of multiple sclerosis (P-Value = 0.106), pain duration more than 10 years before GKRS (P-Value = 0.115), history of depression (P-Value = 0.139), history of percutaneous ablative procedures (P-Value = 0.148) and history of diabetes mellitus (P-Value = 0.169).ANN models could predict pain reduction and hypoesthesia with the accuracy of 84.5% and 91.5% respectively. By mutual elimination of each factor in this model we could also evaluate the contribution of each factor in the predictive performance of ANN. Conclusion(s): The findings show that artificial neural networks can predict post operative outcomes in patients who underwent GKRS with a high level of accuracy. Also the contribution of each factor in the prediction of outcomes can be determined using the trained network.Copyright © 2018",Excluded
1303,"Disc height and motion patterns in the lumbar spine in patients operated with total disc replacement or fusion for discogenic back pain. Results from a randomized controlled trial BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Fusion is considered the ""gold standard"" in surgical treatment of degenerated disc disease; the intended postoperative goal is absence of mobility, but treatment may induce degeneration in adjacent segments. Total disc replacement (TDR) aims to restore and maintain mobility by replacing a painful disc. Little is known about the degree and quality of mobility in artificial discs in vivo and whether maintained mobility reduces the stress on adjacent segments that is believed to occur after fusion. PURPOSE: To see if surgical goals for respective treatments had been reached, if clinical outcome was related to this, and if differences in disc height at treated segments and adjacent segment motion patterns between groups occurred. STUDY DESIGN: Comparison of X-ray measurements in a randomized controlled trial between instrumented posterior fusion and TDR for chronic low back pain (CLBP) assumed to be discogenic. Results were compared with clinical outcome. PATIENT SAMPLE: The material consisted of 152 patients suffering from CLBP assumed to be discogenic. Seventy-two patients were treated with fusion and 80 with TDR. OUTCOME MEASURES: Results of X-ray measurements were compared between groups and related to self-reported clinical results regarding back pain and disability. METHOD(S): Flexion-extension X-rays were analyzed preoperatively and 2 years postoperatively using distortion-compensated Roentgen analysis (DCRA) at treated and adjacent levels, and mobility after fusion and TDR was estimated. Changes in disc height and range of motion (ROM) respective translation in adjacent segments were compared between groups. Results of DCRA measurements were also compared with the clinical outcome. RESULT(S): Preoperative flexion-extension ROM was similar between the fusion and TDR groups, and preoperative disc heights of segments to be treated were between one and two standard deviation less than that previously established in a normative database. Seventy percent of fused patients had no mobility, whereas 85% of TDR patients were mobile. Fulfillment of surgical goals was correlated to neither back pain nor disability. Fused segments were lower and TDR segments were higher than normative values postoperatively. There were also significant differences at adjacent segments, there being more translation and flexion-extension in the fusion group than in the TDR group. CONCLUSION(S): This very accurate X-ray method (DCRA) indicates that surgical goals were reached in most patients. This, however, was not correlated to clinical outcome. Differences between the groups in postoperative disc height at treated segments, respective ROM, and translation at adjacent segments did not affect the clinical outcome after 2 years. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The mean reduction of thyroid volume within 6 month after treatment was 32%. Reduction in thyroid volume and nodule, size was significantly greater within first 3 months than within next 3 months. Patients with smaller nodules (less than 70% of thyroid volume) were characterized by greater reduction of goiter size than patients with nodules bigger or equal to 70% of thyroid volume.",Excluded
1405,"Incidence of breast cancer in the life span study of atomic bomb survivors: 1958-2009 The importance of reproductive history in breast tissue development and etiology of sporadic breast cancer in females is well established. However, there is limited evidence of factors, other than age, that modify risk of radiation-related breast cancer. In this study, we evaluated breast cancer incidence in the Life Span Study cohort of atomic bomb survivors, adding 11 years of follow-up and incorporating reproductive history data. We used Poisson regression models to describe radiation risks and modifying effects of age and reproductive factors. Among 62,534 females, we identified 1,470 breast cancers between 1958 and 2009. Of 397 new cases diagnosed since 1998, 75% were exposed before age 20. We found a strong linear dose response with excess relative risk (ERR) of 1.12 per Gy 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.73 to 1.59 for females at age 70 after exposure at age 30. The ERR decreased with increasing attained age (P = 0.007) while excess absolute rate (EAR) increased with attained age up to age 70 (P < 0.001). Age at menarche was a strong modifier of the radiation effect: for a given dose, both the ERR and EAR decreased with increasing age at menarche (P = 0.007 and P < 0.001). Also, independently, age-At-exposure effects on ERR and EAR differed before and after menarche (P = 0.043 and P = 0.015, respectively, relative to log-linear trends), with highest risks for exposures around menarche. Despite the small number of male breast cancers (n = 10), the data continue to suggest a dose response (ERR per Gy = 5.7; 95% CI: 0.3 to 30.8; P = 0.018). Persistently increased risk of female breast cancer after radiation exposure and its modification pattern suggests heightened breast sensitivity during puberty.Copyright © 2018 by Radiation Research Society.",Excluded

Furthermore, severe malnutrition before EBRT initiation may affect treatment outcome. This study investigated the association of factors, including nutritional status before treatment initiation, with gross tumor volume shrinkage rates (GTVSRs) during EBRT in OSCC patients. Materials/Methods: This retrospective study included 65 consecutive OSCC patients [55 males, 10 females, median age 65 years (38e82)] with no prior OSCC surgery. They were treated with definitive EBRT between November 2006 and December 2014. Tumors were staged as T1 (n = 7, 11%), T2 (n = 21, 32%), T3 (n = 18, 28%), T4a (n = 15, 23%), or T4b (n=4, 6%); N0 (n=9, 14%), N1 (n=3, 5%), N2a (n=3, 5%), N2b (n Z 26, 40%), N2c (n = 18, 27%), or N3 (n = 6, 9%); and as M0 (n = 64, 98%) or M1 (n = 1, 2%).

Computed tomography (CT) images were acquired prior to EBRT initiation and at 3e5 weeks after EBRT initiation for re-planning. Cervical body volume (CBV) was evaluated before EBRT initiation using initial CT images. GTVSRs were calculated based on initial and re-planning CT images. Four patients (6%) received induction chemotherapy (IC). Fifty-seven patients (88%) received concurrent chemotherapy (CC) using following regimen: TPF [docetaxel (DTX), cisplatin (CDDP), and 5-fluorouracil] (n = 29, 44%); another CDDP-based menu (n = 22, 34%); the other DTX-based menu (n = 3, 5%); and cetuximab (n = 3, 5%). Univariate analyses (UA) and multivariate analyses (MA) were performed to identify baseline factors related to the GTVSR. Potential variables include age, gender, T and N stage, use of IC, use of CC, CC menu, use of PEG, serum albumin (Alb), Alb globulin ratio (AGR), C-reactive protein (CRP), CBV, body weight (BW), and body mass index (BMI) before treatment initiation. Variables with UAvalues of P < 0.10 were included in MAs. Result(s): The median GTVSR was 51.1% (range, -9.8e86.8%). The median pretreatment Alb, AGR, CRP, CBV, BWand BMI were as follows: 3.7 g/dl (range, 2.5e4.7 g/dl), 1.2 (range, 0.5e1.7), 0.5 mg/dl (range, 0.1e10.4 mg/dl), 1552.3 cc (range, 962.8e2229.5 cc), 58.3 kg (range, 35.0e80.9 kg), and 20.7 kg/m2 (range, 12.9e28.8 kg/m2). In UAs, N0 stage (P = 0.032), N1>= stage (P = 0.036), Alb (P = 0.006), CBV (P = 0.007), and BW (PZ0.041) were significant. N2a>= stage (PZ0.05), use of PEG (PZ 0.052), DTX-based menu (P = 0.058), and BMI (P =0.05) were marginally significant. MAs revealed an association of higher pretreatment Alb with GTVSR (P = 0.02; 95% confidence interval, 2.94e32.47). Conclusion(s): Higher pretreatment Alb was associated with greater GTVSR during curative EBRT. Assessing pretreatment Alb may be crucial for selecting optimal OSCC treatment strategy.",Excluded
2068,"Cognitive function and social attainment in adult survivors of retinoblastoma: A report from the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study BACKGROUND: Retinoblastoma has a 5-year survival rate exceeding 95%, yet little is known about long-term functional outcomes for these patients. METHOD(S): Sixty-nine adult survivors of retinoblastoma (mean age, 33 years; mean years post-diagnosis, 31) who had enrolled in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study completed clinical cognitive evaluations and questionnaires assessing adult social attainment. Scores on all cognitive measures were converted to z-scores (M = 0, SD = 1) using age-adjusted normative data. Multivariable linear regression analyses, adjusted for age at diagnosis and disease laterality, were used to examine associations between disease and treatment exposures and cognitive outcomes. RESULT(S): Retinoblastoma survivors performed within normative expectations across most cognitive domains. In multivariable models, adjusted for disease laterality, survivors diagnosed at <1 year of age performed significantly better on measures of short-term verbal memory (beta=0.87, P<.01), long-term verbal memory (beta=0.66, P=.02), verbal learning (beta = 0.67, P=.02), and verbal reasoning abilities (beta = 0.79, P<.01) compared with survivors diagnosed at <=1 year of age. In multivariable models, restricted to bilateral survivors and adjusted for age at diagnosis, whole brain radiation exposure was significantly associated with poorer performance on tasks of short-term verbal memory (beta=-0.003, P = .03) and long-term verbal memory (beta = 20.003, P = .01). Reported social attainment was consistent with adult developmental expectations. CONCLUSION(S): Adult survivors of retinoblastoma demonstrate few cognitive or social attainment deficits decades following diagnosis and treatment. Findings suggest the potential for neural reorganization following early insult to the visual system as well as vulnerability of the developing brain to low dose radiation exposure. Early intervention and rehabilitation will be important for these patients.Copyright © 2014 American Cancer Society.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): Study enrolled and randomly assigned 210 patients to standard-dose CT (n = 70) or ultra-low-dose CT (n = 140; 1:2 randomization scheme) protocol. Standard-dose CT settings were reference 110 kVp and 50 mAs, and ultra-low-dose CT settings were fixed at 100Sn kVp and 70 mAs. All PCNBs in patients with small pulmonary lesions (< 3 cm) were performed on a third-generation dual-source CT scanner. Diagnostic performance, complication rate, image quality, and radiation dose were compared. Result(s): Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for diagnosis of malignancy were 95.7%, 100%, and 96.9% with standard-dose CT and 93.8%, 100%, and 95.4% with ultra-low-dose CT (P >.05). Complication rate showed no significant differences between protocols (P >.05). Mean volume CT dose index) and total dose-length product were significantly lower in ultra-low-dose CT compared with standard-dose CT (0.24 mGy vs 3.3 mGy +/- 1.1 and 9.84 mGy-cm +/- 0.70 vs 110.5 mGy-cm +/- 45.1; P <.001). Effective dose for ultra-low-dose CT was significantly lower than that for standard-dose CT (0.14 mSv +/- 0.02 vs 1.78 mSv +/- 0.76; -92.1%; P <.001). Image quality of ultra-low-dose CT met the requirements of PCNB. Conclusion(s): Ultra-low-dose CT-guided PCNB at 100Sn kVp spectral shaping significantly reduced radiation dose on a third-generation dual-source CT, while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy and safety for small pulmonary lesions.Copyright © 2018 SIR",Excluded
1860,"Prognostic value of the micronucleus assay for clinical endpoints in neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy for rectal cancer BACKGROUND: The question whether lymphocyte radiosensitivity is representative of patients' response to radiotherapy (RT) remains unsolved. We analyzed lymphocyte cytogenetic damage in patients who were homogeneously treated with preoperative radiochemotherapy (RCT) for rectal cancer within clinical trials. We tested for interindividual variation and consistent radiosensitivity after in-vivo and in-vitro irradiation, analyzed the effect of patients' and RCT characteristics on cytogenetic damage, and tested for correlations with patients' outcome in terms of tumor response, survival and treatment-related toxicity., METHODS: The cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome (CBMNcyt) assay was performed on the peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLCs) of 134 patients obtained before, during, at the end of RCT, and during the 2-year follow-up. A subset of PBLCs obtained before RCT was irradiated in-vitro with 3 Gy. RCT included 50.4 Gy of pelvic RT with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) alone (n = 78) or 5-FU plus oxaliplatin (n = 56). The analyzed variables included patients' age, gender, RT characteristics (planning target volume size [PTV size], RT technique), and chemotherapy characteristics (5-FU plasma levels, addition of oxaliplatin). Outcome was analyzed as tumor regression, patient survival, and acute and late toxicity., RESULTS: Cytogenetic damage increased significantly with the radiation dose and varied substantially between individuals. Women were more sensitive than men; no significant age-dependent differences were observed. There was a significant correlation between the cytogenetic damage after in-vitro irradiation and in-vivo RCT. We found a significant effect of the PTV size on the yields of cytogenetic damage after RCT, while the RT technique had no effect. Neither the addition of oxaliplatin nor the 5-FU levels influenced cytogenetic damage. We found no correlation between patient outcome and the cytogenetic damage., CONCLUSIONS: We found consistent cytogenetic damage in lymphocytes after in-vivo RCT and in-vitro irradiation. Gender was confirmed as a well-known, and the PTV size was identified as a less well-known influencing variable on lymphocyte cytogenetic damage after partial-body irradiation. A consistent level of cytogenetic damage after in-vivo and in-vitro irradiation may indicate the importance of genetic factors for individual radiosensitivity. However, we found no evidence that in-vivo or in-vitro irradiation-induced cytogenetic damage is an adequate biomarker for the response to RCT in rectal cancer patients.",Excluded
2209,"Does mountaineering increase the incidence of cutaneous melanoma? A hypothesis based on cancer registry data Exposure to ultraviolet radiation is considered a major risk factor for the development of cutaneous melanoma. In white populations in Australia or the USA, the melanoma incidence increases with the vicinity of residence to the equator. In Europe decreasing incidence rates towards southern countries may be due to the darker pigmentation of the Mediterranean population. The comparison of age-standardized incidence rates (world standard population) in Europe shows that Swiss cancer registries and the Austrian Tyrol registry have much higher incidence rates for cutaneous melanoma than other Central European cancer registries. The excess of Swiss/Austrian incidence rates is even more pronounced when head localization is analysed separately. Due to the altitude-related increase in UV radiation two possible explanations for the Swiss/Austrian excess rates may be considered: firstly, as a result of the altitude of residence, higher UV exposure is generally present in these countries; secondly, mountaineering activities may additionally increase UV exposure.",Excluded
1838,"Experience with intensity-modulated radiotherapy in the treatment of head and neck cancer Purpose; Studies using intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in the treatment of head and neck tumors have shown to decrease acute and late radiation toxicity However, the high conformity of this technique can increase the risk of recurrence due to geographic miss. The aim of this study was to analyze whether the results of IMRT met the theoretical expectations concerning treatment efficacy. Method(s): From a total of 185 patients (152 males and 33 females, mean age 58+/-10.36 years) 176 were evaluable and were studied. Eighty-nine (48.1%) patients had surgica, treatment and 50 of them were scheduled for concomitant cisplatin chemotherapy. Irradiation was performed using IMRT, a sliding window with 9 fields in a Varian 2100 C/D linear accelerator, X-ray beam, 6 Me V. The prescribed dose in the planning treatment volume (PTV1), i.e., the area of the primary tumor and nodal area, was 66 Gy/2.2 Gy-7C Gy/2.12 Gy. In the PTV2 (the area at high risk) the dose was 60Gy/2 Gy-59.4 Gy/1.8 Gy, and in the PTV 3 (the area treated with prophylactic irradiation) the prescribed dose was 54 Gy/1.8 Gy-50.4 Gy/1.53 Gy. Result(s): The 3-year overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival RFS of IMRT-treated patients, most of whom were in stages III and IV (158 out of 177), were 50 and 57%, respectively. Using postoperative radiotherapy/chemo-radiotherapy 3-year locoregioncal control was achieved in 75% of the cases as compared with 35% in non-operated patients. Conclusion(s): The worst outcomes were found in oral cavity and hypopharyngeal tumors, and the best in laryngeal and oropharyngeal tumors. Better results were found in surgically treated patients, and in lower disease stages. Despite the high conformity of dose distribution and efforts to spare healthy tissues, most cases of locoregional relapse occurred in areas receiving the full radiation dose.

1566,"Super-enhancers modulate interleukin-6 expression and function in cancers Background: It is widely accepted that inflammatory cytokine, interleukin 6 (IL-6), was not only elevated in cancer but also important in carcinogenesis. But how did IL-6 be produced in tumor microenvironment remains to be addressed. Method(s): Both bioinformatics tools and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to examine the expression of IL-6 in cancer cells. To map super-enhancers of IL-6, sgRNAs were constructed. Stable knockout cells were established and subsequently used for cell proliferation and colony formation assay. The correlation between mapped super-enhancers and IL-6 expression was studied by ATAC-seq analysis. Result(s): The expression of IL-6 was high in multiple cancers, including pancreatic cancer (PAAD). The elevated expression of IL-6 in PAAD was further confirmed by transcriptional data and in a panel of pancreatic cancer cell lines (one immortal HPDE6-C7 cell line and four PDAC cell lines: BxPC-3, PANC-1, AsPC-1 and CFPAC-1). When treated with JQ-1 and I-BET-762, two inhibitors of super-enhancers, the expression of IL-6 in multiple cancer cells including CFPAC-1, HeLa and SUM-159 cells was significantly reduced. By analyzing the H3K27Ac profiling, BRD4 binding, Med1 binding and DNA conservation in CFPAC-1, HeLa and SUM-159 cells, we identified a potential super-enhancer (IL6-SE) that might be important for IL-6 expression in cancer. The super-enhancer (IL6-SE) can be further divided into two elements (IL6-SEa and IL6-SEb). Genetic deletion of IL6-SEa in cancer cells greatly reduces the expression of IL-6. IL6-SEa deficient cells also showed low proliferation and colony formation ability. In patients, the epigenetic activation (ATAC signal) of IL6-SEa is correlated with the expression of IL-6. Conclusion(s): In summary, we not only provide convincing experimental evidence to demonstrate that IL-6 expression in cancer is dependent on super-enhancers but also identified IL6-SEa as a critical DNA regulatory element. Our findings provide new insights to understand the epigenetic regulation of IL-6 expression in cancers.Copyright © Translational Cancer Research. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Method(s): Patients who underwent CT for suspected NSTI were eligible for inclusion. LRINEC score was assessed. CT scans were evaluated for subcutaneous edema, fluid along superficial fascia, fluid along deep fascia, blurring of intermuscular fat planes, fluid collection, and air in the soft tissues. Surgical findings or clinical follow-up served as reference standard. Result(s): Fourteen patients with NSTI and 34 patients with non-NSTI were included. LRINEC score was significantly higher in patients with NSTI (median of 7.5 vs. 6, p = 0.039). Fluid along the deep fascia was significantly more frequently present in patients with NSTI (46.2% vs. 5.9%, p = 0.001). In multiple logistic regression analysis, presence of fluid along the deep fascia was significantly associated with NSTI (odds ratio [OR] = 10.28, 95% CI: 1.57 to 67.18, p = 0.015), whereas the LRINEC score was not significantly associated with NSTI (OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 0.92 to 1.74, p = 0.146). Using presence of fluid along the deep fascia as diagnostic criterion for NSTI, sensitivity was 46.2% (95% CI, 23.2 to 70.9%) and specificity was 94.1% (95% CI, 80.9 to 98.4%). Conclusion(s): Fluid along the deep fascia was the only CT criterion which was significantly associated with NSTI and appeared more useful than the LRINEC score. In the right clinical setting, presence of this CT finding is highly suggestive for NSTI. Its absence, however, does not rule out NSTI. Key Points: * The presence of fluid along the deep fascia at CT is highly suggestive for NSTI in suspected patients. Its absence, however, does not rule out NSTI. `* The use of fluid along the deep fascia as a criterion appears to be more useful than the LRINEC score in diagnosing NSTI.Copyright © 2021, European Society of Radiology.",Excluded
2131,"Inflammatory disease and C-reactive protein in relation to therapeutic ionising radiation exposure in the US Radiologic Technologists Chronic inflammation underlies many autoimmune diseases, including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and rheumatoid arthritis, also type-2 diabetes and osteoarthritis. Associations have been suggested of high-dose ionising radiation exposure with type-2 diabetes and elevated levels of C-reactive protein, a marker of chronic inflammation. In this analysis we used a proportional hazards model to assess effects of radiotherapy on risks of subsequent inflammatory disease morbidity in 110,368 US radiologic technologists followed from a baseline survey (1983-1989/1994-1998) through 2008. We used a linear model to assess log-transformed C-reactive protein concentration following radiotherapy in 1326 technologists. Relative risk of diabetes increased following radiotherapy (p < 0.001), and there was a borderline significant increasing trend per treatment (p = 0.092). For osteoarthritis there was increased relative risk associated with prior radiotherapy on all questionnaires (p = 0.005), and a significant increasing trend per previous treatment (p = 0.024). No consistent increases were observed for other types of inflammatory disease (hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis) associated with radiotherapy. There was a borderline significant (p = 0.059) increasing trend with dose for C-reactive protein with numbers of prior radiotherapy treatments. Our results suggest that radiotherapy is associated with subsequent increased risk of certain inflammatory conditions, which is reinforced by our finding of elevated levels of C-reactive protein.",Included

1488,"Long-term hearing outcomes following stereotactic radiosurgery for vestibular schwannoma: Patterns of hearing loss and variables influencing audiometric decline Object. The goals of this retrospective cohort study were as follows: 1) to describe the long-term prevalence and timing of hearing deterioration following low-dose (12- to 13-Gy marginal dose) stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for vestibular schwannoma (VS); and 2) to identify clinical variables associated with long-term preservation of useful hearing following treatment. Methods. Patients with serviceable hearing who underwent SRS for VS between 1997 and 2002 were studied. Data including radiosurgery treatment plans, tumor characteristics, pre- and posttreatment pure tone average, speech discrimination scores, and American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery hearing class were collected. Time to nonserviceable hearing was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate associations with time to nonserviceable hearing were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results. Forty-four patients met the study criteria and were included. The median duration of audiometric follow- up was 9.3 years. Thirty-six patients developed nonserviceable hearing at a mean of 4.2 years following SRS. The Kaplan-Meier estimated rates of serviceable hearing at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 years following SRS were 80%, 55%, 48%, 38%, and 23%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that pretreatment ipsilateral pure tone average (p < 0.001) and tumor size (p = 0.009) were statistically significantly associated with time to nonserviceable hearing. Conclusions. Durable hearing preservation a decade after low-dose SRS for VS occurs in less than one-fourth of patients. Variables including preoperative hearing capacity and tumor size may be used to predict hearing outcomes following treatment. These findings may assist in pretreatment risk disclosure. Furthermore, these data demonstrate the importance of long-term follow-up when reporting audiometric outcomes following SRS for VS. © AANS, 2013.",Excluded

Our aim is to calculate total organ absorbed dose in patients treated with single or multiple cycles of PRRT. Material(s) and Method(s): Total 67 patients (35 male, 32 female, mean age: 54.4+/-12.2) treated with single or multipl cycles of Lu-177 DOTA TATE (total 149 treatment) were included in the study. Right and left kidney, liver, spleen, bone marrow, tumor and whole body dosimetry were performed. Bone marrow dosimetry was done with the blood samples taken in 3rd, 15th, 30th, 60th, 180th minutes and 24th, 48th and 72nd hours after the infusion. Organ, tumor and whole body dosimetry were calculated with anterior and posterior planar scintigraphic images taken in 4th, 24th, 48th and 72nd hours after the infusion. The necessary organ thickness, body thickness and organ Hounsfield unit values to calculate photon decrease were obtained from CT images. Time-activity curve of all data was drawn and fit in biexponential curves. Regression curves were integrated for all organs, thus cumulative activity for each organ was calculated and organ dose was calculated via MIRD method.

Radiation-induced inflammation itself has been shown to be of high prognostic relevance in patients undergoing preoperative radiochemotherapy (RCT) for locally advanced oesophageal cancer. We assessed the prognostic relevance of FDG uptake in the NTO in an independent cohort of patients treated with definitive RCT., METHODS: This retrospective evaluation included 72 patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated with definitive RCT with curative intent. All patients underwent pretreatment and restaging FDG PET after receiving a radiation dose of 40-50 Gy. Standardized uptake values (SUVmax/SUVmean), metabolic tumour volume (MTV) and relative changes from pretreatment to restaging PET (SUVmax/SUVmean) were determined within the tumour and NTO. Univariate Cox regression with respect to overall survival (OS), local control (LC), distant metastases (DM) and treatment failure (TF) was performed. Independence of parameters was tested by multivariate Cox regression., RESULTS: SUVmax NTO and MTV were prognostic factors for all investigated clinical endpoints (OS, LC, DM, TF). Inclusion of clinical and PET tumour parameters in multivariate analysis showed that SUVmax NTO was an independent prognostic factor. Furthermore, multivariate analysis of SUVmax NTO using previously published cut-off values from preoperatively treated patients revealed that SUVmax NTO was independent prognostic factor for OS (HR = 1.88, p = 0.038), TF (HR = 2.11, p = 0.048) and DM (HR = 3.02, p = 0.047)., CONCLUSION: NTO-related tracer uptake during the course of treatment in patients with oesophageal carcinoma was shown to be of high prognostic relevance. Thus, metabolically activity of NTO measured in terms of SUVmax NTO is a potential candidate for future treatment individualization (i.e. organ preservation).",Excluded

The aim of this study was to estimate the risk of cancer in NM technologists in relation to work history, procedures performed and radioprotection practices. Methods From the US Radiologic Technologists cohort study, 72 755 radiologic technologists who completed a 2003-2005 questionnaire were followed for cancer mortality through 31 December 2012 and for cancer incidence through completion of a questionnaire in 2012-2013. Multivariable-adjusted models were used to estimate HRs for total cancer incidence and mortality by history of ever performing NM procedures and frequency of performing specific diagnostic or therapeutic NM procedures and associated radiation protection measures by decade. Results During follow-up (mean=7.5 years), 960 incident cancers and 425 cancer deaths were reported among the 22 360 technologists who worked with NM procedures. We observed no increased risk of cancer incidence (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.04) or death (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.19) among workers who ever performed NM procedures. HRs for cancer incidence but not mortality were higher for technologists who began performing therapeutic procedures in 1960 and later compared with the 1950s. Frequency of performing diagnostic or therapeutic NM procedures and use of radioprotection measures were not consistently associated with cancer risk. No clear associations were observed for specific cancers, but results were based on small numbers. Conclusion Cancer incidence and mortality were not associated with NM work history practices, including greater frequency of procedures performed.Copyright © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

1881,"Determination of physical parameters associated with self-efficacy in patients with chronic mechanic low back pain BACKGROUND: Self-efficacy that is associated with various pain-related disabilities such as chronic low back pain (LBP), should be questioned besides physical assessments. OBJECTIVE(S): To investigate the physical factors associated with self-efficacy in patients with chronic mechanic LBP. METHOD(S): One hundred nine patients diagnosed as chronic mechanic LBP (65 females, 44 males) between 20-50 years old were included to this study. The intensity of LBP was assessed by using a 10-cm Visual Analogue Scale. For musculoskeletal fitness measurement; muscle strength, muscle endurance, and flexibility tests were applied. Functional Reach Test for balance evaluation, Self-Efficacy Scale for self-efficacy measurement, Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire for disability level evaluation were used. RESULT(S): We found a moderate negative correlation between self-efficacy and pain intensity (r=-0.506); a negative and strong correlation between self-efficacy and disability level (r=-0.654) (p< 0.05). Self efficacy had a significant association with right (r= 0.265) and left (r= 0.290) lateral side bending flexibility (p< 0.05). According to multiple regression analysis results, it was found that disability level had a significant effect on self-efficacy (beta=-2.014; p< 0.01).

We postulated that irradiation and bone marrow transplantation might impact the development and progression of lung remodeling resulting from asbestos inhalation. Our objective was to determine whether irradiation and bone marrow transplantation affected inflammation and fibrosis associated with inhaled asbestos exposure. Inflammation, cytokine production, and fibrosis were assessed in lungs of naive and sex-mismatched chimeric mice exposed to asbestos for 3, 9, or 40 days. Potential engraftment of donor-derived cells in recipient lungs was examined by fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Compared with asbestos-exposed naive (nonchimeric) mice, chimeric mice exposed to asbestos for 3, 9, or 40 days demonstrated significant abrogation of acute increases in asbestos-associated inflammatory mediators and fibrosis. Donor-derived cells trafficked to lung but did not significantly engraft as phenotypic lung cells. Irradiation and bone marrow transplantation alters inflammatory and fibrotic responses to asbestos, likely through modulation of soluble inflammatory mediators.",Excluded
2298,"Cumulative radiation dose incurred during the management of complex pleural space infection Background: Complex pleural space infections are commonly managed with antibiotics, pleural drainage, intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy, and surgery. These strategies often utilize radiographic imaging during management, however little data is available on cumulative radiation exposure received during inpatient management. We aimed to identify the type and quantity of radiographic studies along with the resultant radiation exposure during the management of complex pleural space infections. Method(s): Retrospective review of community network healthcare system from January 2015 to July 2018. Patients were identified through billing databases as receiving intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy and/or surgical intervention. Patient demographics, clinical outcomes, and inpatient radiographic imaging was collected to calculate cumulative effective dose. Result(s): A total of 566 patients were identified with 7275 total radiographic studies performed and a median cumulative effective dose of 16.9 (IQR 9.9-26.3) mSv. Multivariable linear regression analysis revealed computed tomography use was associated with increased cumulative dose, whereas increased age was associated with lower cumulative dose. Over 74% of patients received more than 10 mSv, with 7.4% receiving more than 40 mSv. Conclusion(s): The number of radiographic studies and overall cumulative effective dose in patients hospitalized for complex pleural space infection was high with the median cumulative effective dose > 5 times normal yearly exposure. Ionizing radiation and modern radiology techniques have revolutionized medical care, but are likely not without risk. Additional study is warranted to identify the frequency and imaging type needed during complex pleural space infection management, attempting to keep ionizing radiation exposure as low as reasonably possible.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).",Excluded

When induced after clonal initiation, the frequency of dark clones developing from daughter cells with two YS arms is significantly higher than the frequency of dark clones in the rest of the eye; and this frequency is even higher when induced before clonal initiation. The modifying action of the Y-heterochromatin is exerted, therefore, during and after clonal initiation. Surprisingly, the frequency of dark clones developing from cells with no YS arm is not lower than the frequency of dark clones in the rest of the eye.",Excluded
1336,"Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor CIP2A indicates resistance to radiotherapy in rectal cancer Preoperative (chemo)radiotherapy, (C)RT, is an essential part of the treatment of rectal cancer patients, but tumor response to this therapy among patients is variable. Thus far, there are no clinical biomarkers that could be used to predict response to (C)RT or to stratify patients into different preoperative treatment groups according to their prognosis. Overexpression of cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A) has been demonstrated in several cancers and is frequently associated with reduced survival. Recently, high CIP2A expression has also been indicated to contribute to radioresistance in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, but few studies have examined the connection between CIP2A and radiation response regarding other malignancies. We have evaluated CIP2A protein expression levels in relation to tumor regression after preoperative (C)RT and survival of rectal adenocarcinoma patients. The effects of CIP2A knockdown by siRNA on cell survival were further investigated in colorectal cancer cells exposed to radiation. Patients with low-CIP2A-expressing tumors had more frequently moderate or excellent response to long-course (C)RT than patients with high-CIP2A-expressing tumors. They also had higher 36-month disease-specific survival (DSS) rate in categorical analysis. In the multivariate analysis, low CIP2A expression level remained as an independent predictive factor for increased DSS. Suppression of CIP2A transcription by siRNA was found to sensitize colorectal cancer cells to irradiation and decrease their survival in vitro. In conclusion, these results suggest that by contributing to radiosensitivity of cancer cells, low CIP2A protein expression level associates with a favorable response to long-course (C)RT in rectal cancer patients.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

1534,"Preclinical evaluation of pions in vivo: experience at TRIUMF This paper describes the results obtained from in vivo studies of the pion beam at the TRI University Meson Facility (TRIUMF). The studies encompass work (from 1978 to 1986), designed to evaluate the RBE for early and late effects and to assess the importance of X-ray dose rate and treatment volume on these values. Results with early responding tissues, i.e. mouse and pig skin and mouse intestine indicate a pion RBE of about 1.5 in the clinically relevant dose per fraction range of 2-3 Gy. At these doses, RBE appears to be independent of the reference X-ray dose rate. However, at high doses per fraction, the RBE values become increasingly X-ray dose rate dependent. The induction of late effects by pions has been assessed by monitoring the late dermal response of pig skin; late fibrosis was not assessed in this study. The values obtained using the chosen endpoint indicate that the RBE is not significantly higher than that seen in any of the early responding tissues for pion doses as low as 2-3 Gy per fraction. The effect of increasing the treatment volume for pion therapy has been assessed using mouse intestine. The results show that for a constant field size, RBE decreases with increasing peak width. However, if peak width is held constant and field size increased, there is evidence for an increased RBE.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Excluded

1246,"Residential radon and lung cancer: a cohort study in Galicia, Spain Case-control studies show an association between residential radon and lung cancer. The aim of this paper is to investigate this association through a cohort study. We designed an ambispective cohort study using the Galician radon map, Spain, with controls drawn from a previous case-control study. Subjects were recruited between 2002 and 2009. The data were cross-checked to ascertain lung cancer incidence and then analysed using a Cox regression model. A total of 2,127 subjects participated; 24 lung cancer cases were identified; 76.6% of subjects were drawn from the radon map. The adjusted hazard ratio was 1.2 (95%CI: 0.5-2.8) for the category of subjects exposed to 50Bq/m3 or more. This risk rose when subjects from the case-control study were analyzed separately. In conclusion, we did not observe any statistically significant association between residential radon exposure and lung cancer; however, it appears that with a sample of greater median age (such as participants from the case-control study), the risk of lung cancer would have been higher.",Excluded
2147,"Metabolomics-based discovery of serum biomarkers to predict the side-effects of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma Background/Aim: Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy has side-effects that adversely affect patients' quality of life. The aim of this study was to identify serum metabolite biomarkers that might be used to predict the side-effects of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Patients and Methods: Metabolomic analysis of serum samples from 26 patients with ESCC that were collected before neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy was performed. The metabolites associated with hematological toxicity or nephrotoxicity were evaluated. Result(s): Serum levels of glutaric acid, glucuronic acid, and cystine were significantly higher in hematological toxicity, and phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamines exhibited a tendency to be higher in those with hematological toxicity. The serum level of pyruvic acid was significantly lower in nephrotoxicity, and lysophosphatidylcholines and lysophosphatidylethanolamines tended to be lower in those with nephrotoxicity. Conclusion(s): Our study found that serum levels of some metabolites differed significantly between patients with and without hematological or renal side-effects. These metabolites may be useful biomarkers for predicting hematological toxicity or nephrotoxicity after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for ESCC.Copyright © 2019 International Institute of Anticancer Research.

We tested diagnostic ability and radiation exposure of a novel ultra-low-dose CT protocol that allows concomitant coronary artery evaluation and lung screening. Method(s): We studied 30 current or former heavy smoker subjects with suspected or known coronary artery disease who underwent CT assessment of both coronary arteries and thoracic area (Revolution CT, General Electric). A new ultrafast-low-dose single protocol was used for ECG-gated helical acquisition of the heart and the whole chest. A single IV iodine bolus (70-90 ml) was used. All patients with CT evidence of coronary stenosis underwent also invasive coronary angiography. Result(s): All the coronary segments were assessable in 28/30 (93%) patients. Only 8 coronary segments were not assessable in 2 patients due to motion artefacts (assessability: 98%; 477/485 segments). In the assessable segments, 20/21 significant stenoses (> 70% reduction of vessel diameter) were correctly diagnosed. Pulmonary nodules were detected in 5 patients, thus requiring to schedule follow-up surveillance CT thorax. Effective dose was 1.3 +/- 0.9 mSv (range: 0.8-3.2 mSv). Noteworthy, no contrast or radiation dose increment was required with the new protocol as compared to conventional coronary CT protocol. Conclusion(s): The novel ultrafast-low-dose CT protocol allows lung cancer screening at time of coronary artery evaluation. The new approach might enhance the cost-effectiveness of coronary CT in heavy smokers with suspected or known coronary artery disease.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).",Excluded
2165,"Characteristic imaging findings predicting the risk of conservative treatment resistance in fresh osteoporotic vertebral fractures with poor prognostic features on magnetic resonance imaging Background: Recent studies have reported that confined high-intensity and diffuse low-intensity on sagittal T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are distinctive features that are highly predictive of delayed union or nonunion on osteoporotic vertebral fracture (OVF). The objective of this study was to identify the characteristics of imaging findings predicting the risk for requiring surgical treatment in fresh OVF with poor prognostic features on MRI. Method(s): We conducted a retrospective study of 74 patients (17 men and 57 women with a mean age of 81.1 years) of OVF with the poor prognostic MRI findings. We compared the imaging findings between the surgery group (16 patients) and the conservative group (58 patients): vertebral instability defined as the difference between the vertebral collapse ratio in dynamic X-rays, and the grade of posterior wall injury (Grade I, no spinal canal encroachment; Grade II, <2 mm; Grade III, >=2 mm) as well as the presence or absence of pedicle fracture (Grade I, none; Grade II, unilateral; Grade III, bilateral) on computed tomography. Result(s): The mean vertebral instability was 24.0% +/- 10.1% in the surgery group and 13.0% +/- 7.8% in the conservative group, which was significantly different. Posterior wall injury in the surgery and conservative groups was Grade I in 0 and 29 cases, Grade II in 5 and 21 cases, and Grade III in 11 and 8 cases, respectively, constituting a significant difference. Pedicle fracture in the surgery and conservative groups was Grade I in 5 and 55 cases, Grade II in 6 and 2 cases, and Grade III in 5 and 1 case, respectively, also constituting a significant difference. Conclusion(s): The most high-risk OVF patients with poor prognostic MRI findings who required surgical treatment were those who exhibited greater vertebral instability as well as either more severe posterior wall injury or pedicle fracture.

A more metabolically stable FCH analog, (18)F-fluoromethyl-[1,2-(2)H4]choline ((18)F-D4-FCH), based on the deuterium isotope effect, has been developed. We report the safety, biodistribution, and internal radiation dosimetry profiles of (18)F-D4-FCH in 8 healthy human volunteers., METHODS: (18)F-D4-FCH was intravenously administered as a bolus injection (mean +/- SD, 161 +/- 2.17 MBq; range, 156-163 MBq) to 8 healthy volunteers (4 men, 4 women). Whole-body (vertex to mid thigh) PET/CT scans were acquired at 6 time points, up to 4 h after tracer injection. Serial whole-blood, plasma, and urine samples were collected for radioactivity measurement and plasma radiotracer metabolites. Tissue (18)F radioactivities were determined from quantitative analysis of the images, and time-activity curves were generated. The total numbers of disintegrations in each organ normalized to injected activity (residence times) were calculated as the area under the curve of the time-activity curve normalized to injected activities and standard organ volumes. Dosimetry calculations were performed using OLINDA/EXM 1.1., RESULTS: The injection of (18)F-D4-FCH was well tolerated in all subjects, with no radiotracer-related serious adverse event reported. The mean effective dose averaged over both men and women (+/- SD) was estimated to be 0.025 +/- 0.004 (men, 0.022 +/- 0.002; women, 0.027 +/- 0.002) mSv/MBq. The 5 organs receiving the highest absorbed dose (mGy/MBq) were the kidneys (0.106 +/- 0.03), liver (0.094 +/- 0.03), pancreas (0.066 +/- 0.01), urinary bladder wall (0.047 +/- 0.02), and adrenals (0.046 +/- 0.01). Elimination was through the renal and hepatic systems., CONCLUSION: (18)F-D4-FCH is a safe PET radiotracer with a dosimetry profile comparable to other common (18)F PET tracers. These data support the further development of (18)F-D4-FCH for clinical imaging of choline metabolism.",Excluded
1654,"Simulation of inflorescence dynamics in oil palm and estimation of environment-sensitive phenological phases: a model based analysis For oil palm, yield variation is in large part due to variation in the number of harvested bunches. Each successively-produced phytomer carries a female (productive), male or aborted inflorescence. Since phytomer development takes 3-4 years and nearly two phytomers are produced per month, many inflorescences develop in parallel but have different phenological stages. Environment-dependent developmental rate, sex and abortion probability determine bunch productivity, which, in turn, affects other phytomers via source-sink relationships. Water deficit, solar radiation, temperature and day length are considered key external factors driving variation. Their impact is difficult to predict because of system complexity. To address this question we built a simple model (ECOPALM) to simulate the variation in number of harvested bunches. In this model, trophic competition among organs, expressed through a plant-scale index (Ic), drives sex determination and inflorescence abortion during specific sensitive phases at phytomer level. As a supplemental hypothesis, we propose that flowering is affected by photoperiod at phytomer level during a sensitive phase, thus, contributing to seasonal production peaks. The model was used to determine by parameter optimisation the influence of Ic and day length on inflorescence development and the stages at which inflorescences are sensitive to these signals. Parameters were estimated against observation of number of harvested bunches in Ivory Coast using a genetic algorithm. The model was then validated with field observations in Benin and Indonesia. The sensitive phases determined by parameter optimisation agreed with independent experimental evidence, and variation of Ic explained both sex and abortion patterns. Sex determination seemed to coincide with floret meristem individualisation and occurred 29-32 months before bunch harvest. The main abortion stage occurred 10 months before harvest - at the beginning of rapid growth of the inflorescence. Simulation results suggest involvement of photoperiod in the determination of bunch growth dynamics. This study demonstrates that simple modelling approaches can help extracting ecophysiological information from simple field observations on complex systems.",Excluded

1569,"Early stage transplantation of bone marrow cells markedly ameliorates copper metabolism and restores liver function in a mouse model of Wilson disease Background: Recent studies have demonstrated that normal bone marrow (BM) cells transplantation can correct liver injury in a mouse model of Wilson disease (WD). However, it still remains unknown when BM cells transplantation should be administered. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential impact of normal BM cells transplantation at different stages of WD to correct liver injury in toxic milk (tx) mice. Method(s): Recipient tx mice were sublethally irradiated (5 Gy) prior to transplantation. The congenic wild-type (DL) BM cells labeled with CM-DiI were transplanted via caudal vein injection into tx mice at the early (2 months of age) or late stage (5 months of age) of WD. The same volume of saline or tx BM cells were injected as controls. The DL donor cell population, copper concentration, serum ceruloplasmin oxidase activity and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels in the various groups were evaluated at 1, 4, 8 and 12 weeks post-transplant, respectively. Result(s): The DL BM cells population was observed from 1 to 12 weeks and peaked by the 4th week in the recipient liver after transplantation. DL BM cells transplantation during the early stage significantly corrected copper accumulation, AST across the observed time points and serum ceruloplasmin oxidase activity through 8 to 12 weeks in tx mice compared with those treated with saline or tx BM cells (all P < 0.05). In contrast, BM cells transplantation during the late stage only corrected AST levels from 4 to 12 weeks post-transplant and copper accumulation at 12 weeks post-transplant (all P < 0.05). No significant difference was found between the saline and tx BM cells transplantation groups across the observed time points (P > 0.05). Conclusion(s): Early stage transplantation of normal BM cells is better than late stage transplantation in correcting liver function and copper metabolism in a mouse model of WD. © 2011 Chen et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
1364,"Predictive factors in esophageal cancer after neoadjuvant therapy BACKGROUND: Preoperative chemoradiation therapy (PCX) was introduced to improve the outcome of patients with oesophageal cancer (EC), but conflicting results have been released. Some 20-30% of patients show a complete pathological response, however, the perioperative morbidity and mortality is increased. To search for factors indicating response prior to the onset of PCX we investigated the proliferative activity (MIB-1), the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and the capillary density (CD34) tissue specimens of ECs were available by endoscopy prior to the start of the treatment. METHOD(S): Forty-six (MIB-1) and 21 (VEGF, CD34) tissue specimens of ECs were available from 56 patients undergoing pretherapeutic endoscopy, PCX and surgery. Perioperative morbidity was divided into surgery and non-surgery related morbidity. MIB-1, VEGF and CD34 expression were investigated immunohistochemically. Multivariate analysis was carried out to prove independence of investigated variables. RESULT(S): Postoperative morbidity was noticed in 54 of 56 operated patents. Eight of 56 patients who received PCX died in hospital. Survival was significantly different between the group of complete responders (n=14) and non-responders (n=23; P = 0.0026). None of investigated tumour samples from patients with a complete response (CR) had a proliferation index of less than 45. Tumour samples from patients with a CR showed a VEGF expression of 10.7 compared with 36.58 of tumours with no response (P = 0.035). CD34 expression showed a correlation with VEGF expression. The relation of mean indices of VEGF expression and proliferative activity in tumours from patients with complete, partial or no response was 10. 7:58.8, 18.3:53.8 and 36.6:43.5, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): According to these results, it may be expected that tumours with a VEGF/MIB-1 ratio of 1:5 or less prior to PCX will respond to this therapy.",Excluded

Here we describe that hairless XPA-deficient mice also develop skin tumors with a short latency time and a 100% prevalence after daily exposure to low doses of U.V.B. Surprisingly and in contrast to U.V.B.-exposed repair proficient hairless mice who mainly develop squamous cell carcinomas, the XPA-deficient mice developed papillomas with a high frequency (31%) at a U.V. dose of 32 J/m2 daily. At the highest daily dose of 80 J/m2 mainly squamous cell carcinomas (56%) and only 10% of papillomas were found in XPA-deficient hairless mice. p53 gene mutations were examined in exons 5, 7 and 8 and were detected in only 3 out of 37 of these skin tumors, whereas in tumors of control U.V.B.-irradiated wild type littermates this frequency was higher (45%) and more in line with our previous data. Strikingly, a high incidence of activating ras gene mutations were observed in U.V.B.-induced papillomas (in 11 out of 14 tumors analysed). In only two out of 14 squamous cell carcinomas we found similar ras gene mutations. The observed shift from squamous cell carcinomas in wild type hairless mice to papillomas in XPA-deficient hairless mice, and a corresponding shift in mutated cancer genes in these tumors, provide new clues on the pathogenesis of chemically- versus U.V.B.-induced skin carcinogenesis.",Excluded
1614,"Improvement in automated quantitation of myocardial perfusion abnormality by using iterative reconstruction image in combination with resolution recovery, attenuation and scatter corrections for the detection of coronary artery disease OBJECTIVE: An iterative reconstruction method in combination with resolution recovery, attenuation and scatter corrections (IR-RASC) can improve image quality. It, however, is undetermined whether this technique can improve the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) when automated quantitative analysis is used. This study evaluated diagnostic values of IR-RASC in combination with automated quantitative analysis in stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) in the CAD detection., METHODS: This study enrolled consecutive 64 patients (mean age 66.2 +/- 17.3 years, 39 males) who had undergone both 99mTc-labeled tetrofosmin stress MPI and coronary angiography within 3 months. Stress MPI abnormalities quantified as summed stress score (SSS), summed rest score (SRS) and summed difference score (SDS) by Heart Risk View-S (HRV-S) and Quantitative Perfusion SPECT (QPS) softwares using IR-RASC images were compared with those by using conventional filtered back-projection method (FBP) images and angiographic findings., RESULTS: Based on expert visual assessment, SSS and SRS by HRV-S/QPS softwares with IR-RASC were significantly lower than those by HRV-S/QPS softwares with FBP at mid- and basal left ventricular segments. Receiver-operating characteristics analysis showed that areas under the curve assessed by HRV-S (0.687) and QPS (0.678) with IR-RASC were nearly identical to those (0.717-0.724) by expert assessment with FBP, and were significantly (P < 0.05) greater than those by HRV-S (0.505) and QPS (0.522) with FBP. When HRV-S was used, the specificity and diagnostic accuracy of IR-RASC in the CAD detection were significantly greater than those of FBP: 90.3 versus 51.6%, P < 0.0001 and 79.7 versus 54.7%, P = 0.0027, respectively. Likewise, when QPS was used, the specificity and diagnostic accuracy of IR-RASC in the CAD detection were significantly greater than those of FBP: 80.6 versus 41.9%, P < 0.0001, and 78.1 versus 51.6%, P = 0.0018, respectively. There, however, were no significant differences in sensitivity between IR-RASC and FBP images., CONCLUSIONS: IR-RASC can improve diagnostic accuracy of the CAD detection using an automated scoring system compared to FBP, by reducing false positivity due to artefactual appearance.",Excluded
1733,"Phase I study of involved-field radiotherapy preceding autologous stem cell transplantation for patients with high-risk lymphoma or Hodgkin's disease PURPOSE: This Phase I study was designed to evaluate the tolerability of involved-field radiotherapy (IFRT) to areas of persistent disease in patients with high-risk Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas before autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty-one patients with primary refractory or relapsed Hodgkin's disease (n = 13) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 18) were treated with IFRT followed by high-dose chemotherapy and ASCT. All patients had bulky disease (> or =5 cm) and/or an inadequate response to salvage chemotherapy. The IFRT dose was escalated to a maximum of 36 Gy. Dose-limiting toxicity was defined as Grade 3-4 Bearman toxicity (life-threatening/fatal toxicity occurring within 28 days of ASCT). The chemotherapy regimen consisted of cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and carmustine., RESULTS: The delivered dose of IFRT was 20 Gy in 9 patients, 28-30 Gy in 20, and 32-36 Gy in 2 patients to mediastinal (n = 19) and nonmediastinal (n = 12) sites. The median interval between IFRT completion and ASCT was 19 days. One patient developed Bearman Grade 3 hepatic toxicity. No other Grade 3 or 4 Bearman toxicity was observed. An increased requirement for i.v. narcotics was observed in patients treated with mediastinal IFRT vs. nonmediastinal IFRT (p = 0.02). A trend toward increased mucositis severity was seen in patients previously treated with a larger number of chemotherapy agents (p = 0.09) and in those with a shorter interval between IFRT and ASCT (p = 0.12). Pulmonary toxicity was more common in patients treated with mediastinal IFRT than in those treated with nonmediastinal IFRT (21% vs. 0%, p = 0.13). The 2-year overall and progression-free survival rate was 70% and 49% for all patients, 84% and 50% for patients with Hodgkin's disease, and 59% and 47% for patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, respectively., CONCLUSION: The maximal tolerated dose of IFRT was not reached when Grade 3-4 Bearman toxicity was dose limiting. Increased pulmonary toxicity and mucositis severity was seen after mediastinal IFRT compared with nonmediastinal IFRT. Because local control was excellent, higher doses of IFRT are not recommended. The absolute benefit of IFRT in this patient population needs investigation in future studies.",Excluded

Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of differing light doses. Patients with HGD in BE received oral ALA (60 mg/kg) activated by low (500 J/cm), medium (750 J/cm), high (1,000 J/cm), or highest (1,000 J/cm x2) light dose at 635 nm. Follow-up was by regular endoscopy with quadrantic biopsies. Twenty-four patients were treated. Successful eradication of HGD was significantly correlated with light dose (log rank, p < 0.01). Six of eight patients (75%) treated with the highest light dose, one of two treated with high dose (50%), two of nine (22%) receiving medium light dose, and zero of five receiving low light dose had successful eradication of HGD (median follow-up 45 months, range 1-78 months). No skin photosensitivity or esophageal strictures occurred. The efficacy of ALA-PDT for eradication of HGD in BE is closely related to the light dose used. With a drug dose of 60 mg/kg and light at 635 nm, we recommend a minimum light dose of 1,000 J/cm of esophagus. This dose appears safe.",Excluded
2432,"Prevalence and characteristics of coronary artery anomalies detected by coronary computed tomography angiography in 5 634 consecutive patients in a single centre in Switzerland STUDY PRINCIPLES: Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) allows three-dimensional visualisation of the origin, course and ending of the coronary vessels with high spatial resolution, yielding an accurate depiction of coronary artery anomalies (CAAs). This study sought to determine the prevalence, incidence and characteristics of CAAs detected with CCTA in a single centre in Switzerland., METHODS: CAAs were retrospectively identified in 5 634 consecutive patients referred for CCTA between March 2007 and July 2015. Single coronary arteries, Bland-White-Garland syndrome, anomalous coronary arteries originating from the opposite site of the sinus of Valsalva (ACAOS) with an interarterial course and coronary artery fistulas were classified as potentially malignant CAAs., RESULTS: We identified 145 patients with CAAs, resulting in an overall prevalence of 2.6% and cumulative incidence of 2.1% in all patients referred for CCTA in the observation period. Forty-nine (33.8%) patients showed malignant CAAs including 1 (0.7%) patient with Bland-White-Garland syndrome, 7 (4.8%) with single coronary arteries, 36 (24.8%) with ACAOS and an interarterial course, and 5 (3.5%) with coronary artery fistulas. The remaining 96 (66.2%) patients were classified as having benign variants., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of CAA detected by CCTA is not negligible. Because of its noninvasive nature, relatively low cost and low radiation exposure, a further increase in the utilisation of CCTA may be expected, which may consequently be paralleled by an increasing absolute number of incidentally detected CAAs. Hence, awareness of the main issues and possible management strategies regarding CAAs is of importance for every treating physician.",Excluded
1462,"Increased Postoperative Use of Computed Tomography following Emergency Surgery for Ileocaecal Crohn Disease Multiple imaging modalities are often required for the relapsing nature of Crohn disease (CD). Computed tomography (CT) offers a rapid acquisition of images and shows high specificity and sensitivity. However, CT imaging exposes to a higher dose of ionizing radiation than other abdominal imaging modalities. The aim of this study was to compare the use of preoperative and postoperative CT scan in patients undergoing emergency and elective surgery for CD. Method(s):All patients undergoing emergency and elective surgery for ileocaecal CD January 2014 to December 2018 were included in this prospective observational study. The study objective was to evaluate the frequency of use of CT scan perioperatively with the number and findings of preoperative and postoperative CT being the primary outcomes. The secondary outcomes were operating time, length of hospital stay, reoperations, and rehospitalization. Result(s):A total of 75 patients were included, 33 in the emergency group (43%) and 44 in the elective group (57%). There was a higher use of preoperative CT scan in the emergency surgery group, with 14 patients (42%) having a CT scan before surgery compared with 2 (5%) in the elective group (P=0.14). Thirteen patients (39.4%) had a postoperative CT scan in the emergency surgery group, compared with 10 patients (23.8%) in the elective surgery group. Conclusion(s):Patients undergoing emergency surgery for CD are at increased risk of exposure to ionizing radiations due to high perioperative use of CT scan.Copyright © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

The mean measurable surface area of RIF ([S]) at the time of this study ([S(0)]) was 42 +/- 34 cm(2). The initial Subjective Objective Medical management and Analytic (SOMA) injury evaluation score was 13.2 +/- 5.9 and included evidence of edema, plexitis, restricted movement, and local inflammatory signs. A combination of PTX (800 mg/d) and Vit E (1,000 IU/d) was administered orally for at least 6 months., RESULTS: Treatment was well tolerated. All assessable injuries exhibited continuous clinical regression and functional improvement. Mean RIF surface area and SOMA scores improved significantly (P <.0001) at 3 months ([S(3)], -39%; [SOMA(3)], -22%), 6 months ([S(6)], -53%; [SOMA(6)], -35%), and 12 months ([S(12)], -66%; [SOMA(12)], -48%), and mean linear dimensions ([D]) diminished from the start of the study ([D(0)], 6.5 +/- 2.5 cm) to the end of treatment 12 months later ([D(12)], 4 +/- 2 cm). At the time of the treatment, we did not attempt to achieve the maximum effect, and the study was continued., CONCLUSION: The PTX-Vit E combination reversed human chronic radiotherapy damage and, because no other treatment is presently available for RIF, should be considered as a therapeutic measure.",Excluded
1390,"Lung Cancer Mortality in the Swiss Working Population: The Effect of Occupational and Non-Occupational Factors OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of occupational exposures on lung cancer mortality in Switzerland after adjustment for non-occupational lung carcinogens., METHODS: Using data on 4'351'383 Swiss residents, we used negative binomial regression to assess the effect occupation on lung cancer mortality between 1990 and 2014, accounting for socio-demographic factors, predicted probabilities of smoking and measured environmental radon exposure., RESULTS: After adjustment, male machine operators and workers in mining, stone working and building materials manufacturing showed the highest risk. Women working in electrical engineering, electronics, watchmaking, vehicle construction and toolmaking and transport occupations also remained at high-risk. Radon exposure had no effect on lung cancer mortality, while smoking demonstrated a significant effect in both sexes., CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest the presence of occupational exposures to lung carcinogens in addition to non-occupational factors.

2222,"Predictors of toxicity after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced gall bladder cancer Background: The present study evaluated the correlation of hepatobiliary toxicity and radiation dose received in patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACRT) for locally advanced unresectable gall bladder cancers (LAGBC). Method(s): Twenty-six patients with LAGBC, treated with NACRT (55-57 Gy/25 fractions/5 weeks and weekly gemcitabine 300 mg/m2) within a phase II study, were included. Whenever feasible, surgery was performed after NACRT. Acute and late hepatobiliary toxicity was recorded. Treatment scans were retrieved to delineate central porto-hepatobiliary system (CPHBS), resected liver surface, segment IV B and V, and duodenum. The doses received by these structures were recorded and correlated with toxicity. Result(s): Of 26 patients, 20 (77%) had partial or complete response and 12 (46%) had R0 resection. At the median follow-up of 38 months, overall survival was 38%. Eight (30%) patients had post-treatment toxicity, of which most common was biliary toxicity (30%). A correlation was observed between the biliary leak and V45Gy CPHBS >50 cm3 (P = 0.070). Higher toxicity was observed in those with metallic stents (P = 0.072). Conclusion(s): The incidence of the biliary leak was 46%. CPHBS dose was found to correlate with biliary leaks. Restricting V45Gy CPHBS <50 cm3 and using plastic stent may facilitate a reduction in hepatobiliary toxicity in patients undergoing NACRT and surgery.",Excluded
1549,"Routine computed tomography in the evaluation of vocal fold movement impairment without an apparent cause OBJECTIVE: Routine computed tomography (CT) for vocal fold movement impairment (VFMI) without an apparent cause is common. However, given increased cancer risk associated with ionizing radiation exposure, our purpose is to evaluate the utility of routine scans for these patients., STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series., SETTING: Houston, Texas., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A 5-year review of patients with VFMI diagnosed at an academic institution was conducted. For patients without an apparent cause (eg, recent head, neck, or cardiothoracic surgery or known malignancy), CT head/neck and chest was performed to evaluate the recurrent laryngeal nerve course. Data included demographics, symptoms, radiography, and interventions. Statistical analyses were performed via chi(2) analysis., RESULTS: Of 406 patients with VFMI, 47 (11%) patients had no apparent cause clinically. Routine CT revealed abnormalities in 10 (21%) patients, of which only 3 (6%) could account for VFMI: benign thyroid adenoma (1), papillary thyroid cancer (1), and an esophageal mass (1). The most common lesion detected involved the thyroid. Demographic data and symptom type were not significantly associated with detection of a VFMI-attributable lesion on CT. Overall, routine CT did not identify a focal etiology in 94% patients with VFMI without an apparent cause., CONCLUSION: Routine pan-CT evaluation failed to reveal an etiology in 94% of patients with VFMI without an apparent cause. Patients may be subjected to health risks associated with radiation exposure without significant diagnostic benefit. Further studies should consider more judicious use of CT in the context of risk factors and safer imaging modalities as the initial diagnostic step.

1643,"Preoperative intensified radiochemotherapy for rectal cancer: Experience of a single institution Purpose: The aim of our study was to evaluate the feasibility and the effectiveness of an intensified neoadjuvant protocol with the addition of weekly oxaliplatin in the preoperative strategy of rectal cancer treatment. Patients and Methods: Patients with locally advanced rectal cancer received continous infusion 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) 200 mg/m2/day in combination with weekly oxaliplatin at a dose of 50 mg/m2. Doses of radiotherapy were 45 Gy to the whole pelvis plus 5.4-9 Gy to the tumour mass. The primary end-points of the study were evaluation of toxicity, compliance with radiotherapy and chemotherapy, downstaging, pathological complete response (pCR) and the rate of sphincter preservation for distal cancers. Secondary end-points were relapse-free and overall survival. Result(s): From November 2006 to June 2009, 51 patients were enrolled into the study. Compliance with chemotherapy was 80%. The incidence of G3 diarrhoea and proctitis were 17.6% and 21.5%, respectively. Surgery was performed in 48 patients with 100% R0 resection. 76.4% of low-lying tumours underwent conservative treatment. Seventy-nine percent of patients were downstaged: T and N downstaging were observed in 71% and 75% of patients, respectively. A pCR was obtained in 11 (22.9%) patients. Conclusion(s): Intensification of neoadjuvant treatment for rectal cancer with the addition of weekly oxaliplatin is feasible, with remarkable rates of downstaging and pathological complete response. Data on sphincter preservation for distal cancers were excellent. Phase III trials with a longer follow-up will establish whether this good outcome in terms of surrogate end-points will translate into better rates of disease-free and overall survival. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Excluded
1907,"Development and validation of a nomogram for prediction of survival and local control in laryngeal carcinoma patients treated with radiotherapy alone: A cohort study based on 994 patients Introduction: To advise laryngeal carcinoma patients on the most appropriate form of treatment, a tool to predict survival and local control is needed. Material(s) and Method(s): We performed a population-based cohort study on 994 laryngeal carcinoma patients, treated with RT from 1977 until 2008. Two nomograms were developed and validated. Performance of the models is expressed as the Area Under the Curve (AUC). Result(s): Unfavorable prognostic factors for overall survival were low hemoglobin level, male sex, high T-status, nodal involvement, older age, lower EQD2T (total radiation dose corrected for fraction dose and overall treatment time), and non-glottic tumor. All factors except tumor location were prognostic for local control. The AUCs were 0.73 for overall survival and 0.67 for local control. External validation of the survival model yielded AUCs of 0.68, 0.74, 0.76 and 0.71 for the Leuven (n = 109), the VU Amsterdam (n = 178), the Manchester (n = 403) and the NKI cohort (n = 205), respectively, while the validation procedure for the local control model resulted in AUCs of 0.70, 0.71, 0.72 and 0.62. The resulting nomograms were made available on the website www.predictcancer.org. Conclusion(s): For patients with a laryngeal carcinoma treated with RT alone, we have developed visual, easy-to-use nomograms for the prediction of overall survival and primary local control.

1465,"Analysis of the dynamic response of JSF manikin heads Background: Manikin heads with human-like shape and inertial properties were developed for the Joint Strike Fighter program by the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) to be used to evaluate neck loading for ejection seat testing with Helmet-Mounted Displays (HMDs). Objective: Compare the dynamic responses of the JSF SF-81 (50th percentile head based on volume of small female heads) and JSF LM-110 (95th percentile head volume based on male heads) to the previously used manikin heads, Methods: The Lightest Occupant In Service (LOIS) manikin was fitted with either the JSF SF-81 head or the legacy 5th percentile female VIP head, while the Large Anthropomorphic Research Device (LARD) manikin was fitted with either the JSF LM-110 head or the Hybrid II head. Subjects were tested on AFRL's Horizontal Impact Accelerator (HIA) that produced a -Gx acceleration ranging from 4-10 G's. During testing, neck moments and forces were collected to calculate the Nij neck injury. Data analysis was performed to determine the correlations between the JSF heads, the traditional manikin heads, and human heads, Results/Conclusions: There were significant differences exhibited between the JSF LM-110 head and Hybrid II head on the LARD manikin when comparing upper neck tension and shear force. Significant differences were also exhibited between the JSF SF-81 head and VIP head on the LOIS manikin when comparing upper neck flexion, extension, shear force, NTF (tension-flexion) and NCF (compression-flexion) values.

1515,"Development of [225ac]ac-psma-i&t for targeted alpha therapy according to gmp guidelines for treatment of mcrpc Recently, promising results of the antitumor effects were observed in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with177Lu-labeled PSMA-ligands. Radionu-clide therapy efficacy may even be improved by using the alpha emitter Ac-225. Higher efficacy is claimed due to high linear energy transfer specifically towards PSMA positive cells, causing more double-strand breaks. This study aims to manufacture [225Ac]Ac-PSMA-I&T according to good manufacturing practice guidelines for the translation of [225Ac]Ac-PSMA-I&T into a clinical phase 1 dose escalation study. Quencher addition during labeling was investigated. Quality control of [225Ac]Ac-PSMA-I&T was based on measurement of Fr-221 (218 keV), in equilibrium with Ac-225 in approximately six half-lives of Fr-221 (T12 = 4.8 min). Radio-(i)TLC methods were utilized for identification of the different radiochemical forms, gamma counter for concentration determination, and HPGe-detector for the detection of the radiochemical yield. Radiochemical purity was determined by HPLC. The final patient dose was prepared and diluted with an optimized concentration of quenchers as during labeling, with an activity of 8-12 MBq (+/-5%), pH > 5.5, 100 +/- 20 microg/dose, PSMA-I&T, radiochemical yield >95%, radiochemical purity >90% (up to 3 h), endotoxin levels of <5 EU/mL, osmolarity of 2100 mOsmol, and is produced according to current guidelines.

2344,"High-pitch dual-source CT angiography of the thoracic and abdominal aorta: is simultaneous coronary artery assessment possible? OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate the average heart rate and heart rate variability required for diagnostic imaging of the coronary arteries with high-pitch dual-source CT angiography of the thoracic and thoracoabdominal aorta., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: One hundred consecutively registered patients (82 men, 18 women; mean age, 68 +/- 13 years) underwent clinically indicated CT angiography of the thoracic (n = 33) and thoracoabdominal (n = 67) aorta with a dual-source 128-MDCT scanner in ECG-synchronized high-pitch (pitch, 3.2) data acquisition mode. No beta-blockers were administered. The image quality of the coronary arteries was graded on a 3-point scale by two independent blinded readers. The average heart rate and heart rate variability before data acquisition were noted. Effective radiation doses were calculated., RESULTS: Interobserver agreement on grade of image quality for the 1,414 coronary segments evaluated by both observers was good (kappa = 0.68). Diagnostic image quality was found for 1,375 of the 1,414 segments (97.2%) in 83 of 100 patients (83%). In 17% of the patients, image quality was nondiagnostic for at least one coronary artery segment. Average heart rate and heart rate variability (each p < 0.05) were significantly higher in patients with at least one nondiagnostic coronary segment compared with those without. All patients with an average heart rate less than 63 beats/min and heart rate variability less than 1.2 beats/min had diagnostic image quality in all coronary segments. Effective radiation doses were 2.3 +/- 0.3 mSv for thoracic and 4.4 +/- 0.5 mSv for thoracoabdominal CT angiography. The average scan times were 0.88 +/- 0.06 second for thoracic and 1.67 +/- 0.15 seconds for thoracoabdominal CT angiography., CONCLUSION: For patients with an average heart rate less than 63 beats/min and heart rate variability less than 1.2 beats/min, dual-source CT angiography of the thoracoabdominal aorta at a high pitch of 3.2 delivers diagnostic depiction of the coronary arteries at a low radiation dose.",Excluded
1340,"Response Evaluation of Choroidal Melanoma After Brachytherapy Using Diffusion-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DW-MRI): Preliminary Findings Purpose: To evaluate the role of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) in the assessment of therapeutic response in patients with choroidal melanoma treated with brachytherapy. Material(s) and Method(s): We performed a prospective, unicentric study which included patients with choroidal melanoma and indication for brachytherapy. Three DW-MRI examinations were proposed for each patient, one before and two after treatment. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value was calculated on DW-MRI and compared with local tumor control assessed by ophthalmologic follow-up. Result(s): From 07/2018 to 06/2019, 19 patients were recruited, 13 of whom underwent follow-up examinations. Patients' ages ranged from 24 to 78 years and 52.9% were male. At the ocular ultrasound, the mean tumor thickness and diameter were 6.3 and 11.5 mm, respectively. Two patients (15.4%) showed signs of tumor progression during follow-up (7 and 9 months after treatment). There was no statistically significant difference in tumor size between MR before and after treatment, however, there was a significant reduction in mean ADC in patients with progression (p = 0.02). Conclusion(s): DW-MRI is a promising method for monitoring patients with choroidal melanoma; reduction in the mean ADC values between pre-treatment MRI and the first post-treatment MRI may be related to the lack of response to brachytherapy and increased risk of disease progression.© Copyright © 2020 Bitencourt, Bitencourt, Chojniak, Souza, Castro, Pellizzon and Chojniak.",Excluded
2367,"Natural oil-based emulsion containing allantoin versus aqueous cream for managing radiation-induced skin reactions in patients with cancer: A phase 3, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial Purpose: To investigate the effects of a natural oil-based emulsion containing allantoin versus aqueous cream for preventing and managing radiation-induced skin reactions., Methods and Materials: A total of 174 patients were randomized and participated in the study. Patients received either cream 1 (the natural oil-based emulsion containing allantoin) or cream 2 (aqueous cream). Skin toxicity, pain, itching, and skin-related quality of life scores were collected for up to 4 weeks after radiation treatment., Results: Patients who received cream 1 had a significantly lower average level of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events at week 3 (P<.05) but had statistically higher average levels of skin toxicity at weeks 7, 8, and 9 (all P<.001). Similar results were observed when skin toxicity was analyzed by grades. With regards to pain, patients in the cream 2 group had a significantly higher average level of worst pain (P<.05) and itching (P=.046) compared with the cream 1 group at week 3; however, these differences were not observed at other weeks. In addition, there was a strong trend for cream 2 to reduce the incidence of grade 2 or more skin toxicity in comparison with cream 1 (P=.056). Overall, more participants in the cream 1 group were required to use another topical treatment at weeks 8 (P=.049) and 9 (P=.01)., Conclusion: The natural oil-based emulsion containing allantoin seems to have similar effects for managing skin toxicity compared with aqueous cream up to week 5; however, it becomes significantly less effective at later weeks into the radiation treatment and beyond treatment completion (week 6 and beyond). There were no major differences in pain, itching, and skin-related quality of life. In light of these results, clinicians and patients can base their decision on costs and preferences. Overall, aqueous cream seems to be a more preferred option.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1900,"Human fiber size and enzymatic properties after 5 and 11 days of spaceflight Biopsies from the vastus lateralis muscle were obtained from three astronauts before and after two 5-day flights and from five astronauts before and after one 11-day flight (space shuttle flights: STS-32, -33, and -34). Muscle fibers from two separate samples from each biopsy were classified as type I and II or as type I, IIA, and IIB by using qualitative myofibrillar adenosinetriphosphatase (ATPase) staining. Cross-sectional area (CSA), number of capillaries per fiber, and the activities of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (GPD), and myofibrillar ATPase were determined from one sample of fibers of each myofibrillar ATPase type. Postflight biopsies had 6-8% fewer type I fibers than preflight. Mean fiber CSAs were 16-36% smaller after the 11-day flight with the relative effect being type IIB > IIA > I. Mean fiber CSAs were 11 and 24% smaller in type I and II fibers after 5 days of flight. Myofibrillar ATPase activities increased in type II but not in type I fibers after flight, whereas SDH activity was unaffected in either fast or slow fibers. GPD activity in type I fibers was approximately 80% higher (P > 0.05) postflight compared with preflight. Myofibrillar ATPase/SDH ratios in type II fibers were higher after than before flight, suggesting that some fast fibers were more susceptible to fatigue after flight. The GPD/SDH ratios were elevated in some type I fibers after spaceflight. The number of capillaries per fiber was 24% lower after than before flight, whereas the number of capillaries per unit CSA of muscle tissue was unchanged. These data suggest that adaptations in the size, metabolic properties, and vascularity of muscle fibers can occur rapidly in the space environment. These adaptations were qualitatively similar to those observed in animals after actual or simulated spaceflight conditions for short periods.",Excluded

A previously validated noise-insertion tool was used to simulate reduced-dose scans at 75%, 50%, 25%, and 10% of the original dose at four representative phases of the cryoablation procedure. Images obtained at different dose levels were randomized and reviewed by three radiologists blinded to the level of dose reduction, who scored them independently with a 5-point scale (1-5, with 5 the best). Images with a mean score of 3 or higher were considered diagnostically acceptable. The minimal acceptable dose was that at which 90% of images were considered diagnostically acceptable. Interrater agreement was assessed using the weighted kappa statistic., RESULTS: The weighted kappa value was 0.68, indicating substantial agreement among the reviewers. The averaged percentage of diagnostically acceptable images for the four series was 100% for a full dose, 98-100% for the 75% dose level, 94-98% for the 50% dose level, and less than 90% for images obtained at the 25% and 10% dose levels, which was considered unacceptable., CONCLUSION: On the basis of results from 15 patients (17 procedures), images obtained from CT acquisitions at 50% (volume CT dose index, 12.2 mGy) of the original dose level (volume CT dose index, 24.4 mGy) were acceptable for the purpose of CT monitoring of renal cryoablation procedures.",Excluded

In all subjects the heart rate (HR) was <65 bpm and all CT scans were acquired using a prospective ECG gating and AEC strategy. Mean effective radiation dose and subjective and objective (Noise or N, signal to noise ratio or SNR, contrast to noise ratio or CNR) image quality, were evaluated. Subjective quality was assessed by two experienced radiologists using a 5-point scale (0: non diagnostic-4: excellent) using the 15-segment American Heart Association (AHA) coronary artery classification., RESULTS: Mean effective dose and noise were non significantly different between the two groups: mean effective dose was 2.89 +/- 0.7 mSv in the 100 kV group and 2.80 +/- 0.57 mSv in the 120 kV group (p = 0.25) while noise was 28.9 +/- 3.3 in the 120 kV group and 29.05 +/- 3.6 in the 100 kV group (p = 0.72). Both SNR and CNR were significantly higher in the 100 kV group than in the 120 kV group. This data agrees with the evidence that subjective quality was significantly higher in the 100 kV group in the middle and distal segmental classes., CONCLUSION: Our study shows that, in using a 320 row CCTA with AEC strategy it is better to employ a 100 kV tube voltage protocol because compared to 120 kV tube voltage setting, it appears to significantly improve both subjective and objective image quality without decreasing the mean effective radiation dose.",Excluded
1683,"NASA's space Launch System: Payload opportunities for lunar exploration, science missions Nearing its first launch, the Space Launch System (SLS), NASA's new super heavy-lift launch vehicle, offers highly energetic launches that deliver more mass and provide more volume in 8.4 m-diameter and potentially larger fairings to make a new generation of deep space missions possible. An evolvable launcher available in crew, crew with a co-manifested payload (CPL) and cargo-only configurations, SLS is a crucial capability to enable astronauts to return to the Moon, but it also offers key benefits for science missions. NASA's 21st-century return to the Moon recently received a formal name: the Artemis program. In addition to the core enabling capabilities of SLS and the Orion crew spacecraft, NASA will also enlist international and commercial partnerships for Artemis. The Agency intends to build a scientific outpost in lunar orbit, the Gateway, from which human and robotic missions to and from the surface can rendezvous. SLS will launch Orion on a series of missions leading to landing the first woman and the next man on the Moon as part of Artemis. SLS uses proven propulsion systems: two solid rocket boosters and four RS-25s engines that have been upgraded to provide more thrust and operate in the SLS environment. SLS Block 1 uses a modified Delta IV Heavy upper stage, called the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS) and lifts at least 26 metric tons (t) to trans-lunar injection (TLI). The Block 1 vehicle can also be outfitted with a 5 m-diameter fairing. Block 1B, the next major variant, also uses solid rocket boosters and RS-25 engines to achieve Earth escape velocity, but replaces the single-engine liquid hydrogen (LH2)/liquid oxygen (LOX) ICPS with a four-engine LH2/LOX Exploration Upper Stage (EUS) to increase mass to TLI to 34-37 t, depending on crew or cargo configuration. In the Block 1B crew configuration, a 10 m-tall Universal Stage Adapter (USA) connects the vehicle to Orion and can carry a CPL up to 10 t. The USA provides 286 m3 of unpressurized volume for payloads. For large payloads, 8.4 m- and 10 m-diameter cargo fairings in 19.1 m and 27.4 m lengths are possible. The ultimate SLS vehicle, Block 2, incorporates evolved boosters to reach a lift capacity of more than 45 t to TLI. The capabilities of SLS not only make new missions to the Moon possible, but also game-changing science missions, such as deployment of large-aperture space telescopes, spacecraft to the ice giants or even probes to the interstellar medium. This paper will discuss the capabilities of SLS, the vehicle's planned evolution, missions that can effectively utilize the vehicle and manufacturing status of the vehicle.

To identify complications associated with tumor-related lipid exudation (TRLE) after plaque radiotherapy of posterior uveal melanoma. Methods. Comparative study including 294 patients with posterior uveal melanoma who developed TRLE after plaque radiotherapy (TRLE group) and 294 patients who did not develop TRLE (non-TRLE group). Patients in the TRLE group were matched with patients in the non-TRLE group for age, gender, and initial tumor thickness. results. The TRLE group was associated with significantly higher incidence of postradiation complications including early transient increase of serous retinal detachment (p<0.001), iris neovascularization (NVI) (p<0.001), neovascular glaucoma (NVG) (p<0.001), posterior synechia (p<0.001), vitreous hemorrhage (p<0.001), subretinal hemorrhage (p<0.001), and retinoschisis (p<0.001). A significant relationship was found between extent of TRLE and NVI (p<0.001), NVG (p<0.001), posterior synechia (p = 0.007), and retinoschisis over tumor (p = 0.010). Radiation-induced retinopathy, maculopathy, and papillopathy were not associated with presence or extent of TRLE. Tumor-related lipid exudation was also associated with worse final visual acuity (p = 0.011), higher rate of secondary enucleation (p<0.001), and lower rate of systemic metastasis (p = 0.006). Conclusions. Tumor-related lipid exudation following plaque radiotherapy of posterior uveal melanoma is associated with major intraocular complications and portends poor prognosis for final visual acuity and eye retention. These findings provide evidence for the presence of 2 distinct pathogenic mechanisms, one radiation-induced and one tumor-related, in development of postradiation complications in eyes with posterior uveal melanoma. © 2013 Wichtig Editore.",Excluded

Medical and dosimetry information on the clean-up workers, males, who got radiation doses from April 26, 1986 to April 26, 1987, which was accumulated from 1992 to 2012, was used for the analysis. The total size of the cohort was 42929 people, 12731 deaths were registered in the cohort, among them 1893 deaths from solid cancers and 5230 deaths were from circulation diseases. An average age of the workers was 39 years in 1992 and the mean dose was 164 mGy. The dose-effect relationship was estimated with the use of non-parametric analysis of survival with regard to concurrence of risks of mortality. The risks were estimated in 6 dose groups of similar size (1-70, 70-130, 130-190, 190-210, 210-230 and.230-1000 mGy). The group ""1-70 mGy"" was used as control. Estimated dose-effect relationship related to cancers and circulation diseases is described approximately with a linear model, coefficient of determination (the proportion of variability explained by the linear model) for cancers was 23-25% and for circulation diseases - 2-13%. The slope coefficient of the dose-effect relationship normalized to 1 Gy for the ratio of risks for cancers in the linear model was 0.47 (95% CI: -0.77, 1.71), and for circulation diseases it was 0.22 (95% CI: -0.58, 1.02). Risks coefficient (slope coefficient of excess mortality at a dose of 1 Gy) for solid cancers was 1.94 (95% CI: - 3.10, 7.00) x 10(-2) and for circulation diseases it was 0.67 (95% CI: -9.61, 11.00) x 10(-2). 137 deaths from radiation-induced cancers and 47 deaths from circulation diseases were registered during a follow up period.",Included

Selective enhancement of IgE antibody production by low doses of X-irradiation and by cyclophosphamide Exposure of BALB/c, A/J, and (BALB/c X A/J)F1 mice, which are IgE high responder animals, to total body x-irradiation ranging from 50 to 200 R resulted in a dose-dependent enhancement of the hapten-specific IgE antibody level as compared to unirradiated control mice. In contrast, anti-hapten antibody responses of the IgG class in these same animals were rarely enhanced, and when so, were of a lesser degree. This relatively selective augmentation of the IgE vs IgG antibody responses was observed in both unprimed and primed mice. By utilizing adoptive transfer systems, it was demonstrated that the enhancing effects of x-irradiation resulted from its action on the carrier-primed cell population and not upon the responding B cells or upon macrophages. The data presented herein suggest that this enhancement phenomenon is the result of the elimination of T cells (or their products) with suppressive functions and that these cells are neither dependent upon nor specific for the carrier antigen employed in the immunization. This hypothesis is given indirect support by the observations that treatment of the same strains of mice with cyclophosphamide, in doses known to abrogate suppressive T cell functions, resulted in a similar enhancing effect to that observed after low doses of x-irradiation. In addition an interesting difference between IgE and IgG precursor B lymphocytes was observed by the ability of IgE B cells to differentiate to the secretory state at a strikingly more rapid rate than IgG B lymphocytes when exposed to comparable T cell helper influences. These observations may provide important clues to the cellular mechanisms of the immune regulation of the IgE response and its relationship to allergic diseases.",Excluded
1657,"Loss of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 causes increased tumour latency in p53-deficient mice PARP-1-deficient mice display a severe defect in the base excision repair pathway leading to radiosensitivity and genomic instability. They are protected against necrosis induced by massive oxidative stress in various inflammatory processes. Mice lacking p53 are highly predisposed to malignancy resulting from defective cell cycle checkpoints, resistance to DNA damage-induced apoptosis as well as from upregulation of the iNOS gene resulting in chronic oxidative stress. Here, we report the generation of doubly null mutant mice. We found that tumour-free survival of parp-1(-/-)p53(-/-) mice increased by 50% compared with that of parp- 1(+/+)p53(-/-) mice. Tumour formation in nude mice injected with oncogenic parp-1(-/-)p53(-/-) fibroblasts was significantly delayed compared with parp-1(+/+)p53(-/-) cells. Upon gamma-irradiation, a partial restoration of S-phase radiosensitivity was found in parp-1(-/-)p53(-/-) primary fibroblasts compared with parp-1(+/+)p53(-/-) cells. In addition, iNOS expression and nitrite release were dramatically reduced in the parp-1(-/-)p53(-/-) mice compared with parp-1(+/+)p53(-/-) mice. The abrogation of the oxydated status of p53(-/-) cells, due to the absence of parp-1, may be the cause of the delay in the onset of tumorigenesis in parp-1(-/-)p53(-/-) mice.",Excluded
1470,"Scanning beyond anatomic limits of the thorax in chest CT: findings, radiation dose, and automatic tube current modulation OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine additional radiation dose associated with scanning beyond the anatomic limits of the thorax in chest CT protocol and to assess the effect of z-axis modulation on the additional radiation dose associated with the scanning protocol. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ""Extra"" images for routine chest CT were defined as those above lung apices (supraapical) and those caudal to the lowermost portion of lung parenchyma (infrapulmonary), including images obtained beyond the adrenal glands (infraadrenal). One hundred and forty-eight consecutive chest CT examinations (70 men, 78 women; age range, 15-90 years) performed September 13-25, 2003, were reviewed to determine the number of supraapical, infrapulmonary, and infraadrenal extra images. All examinations were performed using z-axis modulation (n = 70) or fixed tube current (n = 78). The CT dose index volume and dose-length product (DLP) values for the extra images were calculated. Two radiologists reviewed these extra images for pathologic findings. Student's t test was used to perform the statistical analysis. RESULT(S): One hundred forty-four (97%) examinations had supraapical extra images and 145 (98%) had infrapulmonary extra images. A total of 31 additional findings were observed in extra images. Most clinically important findings were identified in patients with a history of malignancy. With z-axis modulation, the mean DLP for supraapical and infrapulmonary extra images was 39.98 mGy x cm and 132.59 mGy x cm, respectively. With fixed tube current, the mean DLP for supraapical and infrapulmonary extra images was 30.31 mGy x cm and 95.91 mGy x cm, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): A substantial number of extra images are acquired during chest CT that do not add clinically important information in patients with nonmalignant indications. The use of z-axis modulation increased radiation dose for the extra images.",Excluded
1504,"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, glioblastoma multiforme, and impact on toxicities and overall survival: The mayo clinic experience Purpose: The diagnoses of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and depression are often found to coexist. The impact of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) on treatment-related toxicity and outcome in patients with GBM is unclear. Methods and Materials: We retrospectively reviewed 160 patients with GBM who received treatment at our institution between 1999 and 2008. Those taking an SSRI during treatment for GBM were identified and toxicities were assessed. Result(s): Median survival for the entire cohort was 1.05 years. A total of 35 patients (21.8%) took an SSRI during initial treatment for GBM. There was no statistical difference in the rate of >=grade 3 toxicity in patients taking an SSRI when compared with those who were not (11.4% vs. 13.6%, respectively; P = 1.00). Two-year survival in the cohort of patients taking an SSRI was 32% versus 17% in those who were not (P = 0.18). After making adjustment for age, recursive partitioning analysis class, and extent of surgery, absence of an SSRI during treatment was associated with a hazard risk of 1.5 (95% confidence interval = 1.00-2.42; P = 0.05). Conclusion(s): This retrospective review suggests that concomitant use of an SSRI during treatment does not adversely affect survival. There was no increased toxicity with the use of SSRI concurrent with treatment of newly-diagnosed GBM. Copyright © 2011 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Excluded
2435,"Falling back to earth: Altered splanchnic vasoreactivity may contribute to microgravity-induced orthostatic intolerance The adaptations of the human cardiovascular system to microgravity, which are well tolerated while in space, can lead to dizziness, blurred vision, and fainting upon reentry. Specifically, orthostatic hypotension, a fall in blood pressure upon standing, poses a major problem for astronauts returning to Earth, and presents a hazard should an emergency ever arise during landing. Female astronauts are affected more frequently than males, suggesting underlying gender-related differences in cardiovascular regulation. One such difference has already been demonstrated: in response to an orthostatic challenge, males experience blood pooling primarily in the legs, while females show much more blood pooling in the abdominal region. Normally, the splanchnic blood vessels should reflexively constrict, initiating mobilization of the blood to supply the brain. In order to determine whether attenuation of this reflex is responsible for post-flight orthostatic intolerance (particularly in females), we examined in vitro vascular reactivity in male and female rats subjected to simulated microgravity (hind-limb unloading; HLU). The constrictor response of third-order mesenteric blood vessels to phenylephrine was measured by wire myograph. The sensitivity of female arteries to phenylephrine was attenuated following HLU. Maximal tensile response to phenylephrine was unchanged in these vessels, while maximal tensile response to high KCI increased. In male arteries, HLU did not significantly change any of these parameters. These results indicate that, after HLU, the mesenteric arteries of females (but not males) can be expected to show reduced sensitivity to noradrenergic sympathetic outflow. This may partially underlie the gender disparity in post-flight orthostatic hypotension.",Excluded
1728,"Comparison of two barium suspensions for dedicated small-bowel series OBJECTIVE. The in vivo radiographic features of two commercially available formulations of barium used as contrast media in dedicated small- bowel series were compared. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Fifty-six consecutive outpatients referred for a dedicated small-bowel series were randomly administered either E-Z-Paque or Entrobar. Representative survey radiographs from each examination were randomized and reviewed by six gastrointestinal radiologists from three institutions. Each observer assigned a numeric score (1 = poor, 2 = fair, 3 = good, and 4 = excellent) that rated the quality of the radiograph with respect to these characteristics: definition of fold pattern, translucency, distention, and integrity of the barium column. Statistical analysis was performed for each characteristic using Wilcoxon's two-sample rank sum test. RESULTS. All six observers found a statistically significant difference between the two barium formulations for mean scores for definition of fold pattern and translucency. Mean scores for fold pattern were 3.3, 3.0, 3.2, 3.6, 3.3, and 3.4 for Entrobar and 2.1, 2.3, 2.4, 3.2, 2.6, and 2.7 for E-Z-Paque. Mean scores for translucency were 2.5, 2.7, 2.8, 3.1, 2.7, and 3.3 for Entrobar and 1.6, 1.7, 2.1, 2.3, 1.9, and 2.7 for E-Z- Paque. No statistically significant difference was found for mean score for distention or integrity of the barium column. CONCLUSION. On radiographs, Entrobar was found to have superior characteristics for visualization of fold pattern and translucency but offered no advantages for distention or integrity of the barium column. Improved translucency and definition of fold pattern may translate into improved sensitivity and confidence in diagnosing small-bowel abnormality.",Excluded

The aim of the study was to analyze the response of antioxidant systems through the determination of the antioxidant markers in the blood of patients exposed to oxidative stress resulting from the routine HRCT examination of the chest. Blood of 35 people aged 60.77 +/- 10.81 taken before and at four time points after the examination constituted the test material. The determination of the total antioxidant capacity expressed as ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) and ferric reducing antioxidant activity and ascorbic acid concentration (FRASC) were performed together with an examination of catalase activity and the concentration of the reduced glutathione. The organism's response to ionizing radiation was associated with a significant decrease in the antioxidant markers' levels at all time-points and showed a significant negative correlation depending on the radiation dose. Visible down-regulation of these markers is a response to increased oxidative stress. In light of the obtained results, the measurement of the selected markers of antioxidant defense may be a useful parameter of oxidative stress caused by ionizing radiation.",Excluded

The radiation exposure and clinical data were collected prospectively in these 5 PCI centers in Sweden as part of the Swedish Coronary Angiography and Angioplasty Registry (SCAAR). A prediction model was made for the radiation exposure (dose-area product) expressed in Gy.cm(2). A total of 20 669 procedures were included in the present study, consisting of 9850 PCI and 10 819 coronary angiography procedures.

1892,"Optimized demineralization of human cancellous bone by application of a vacuum Human demineralized bone matrix derived from cortical bone is used by surgeons due to its ability to promote bone formation. There is also a need for shaped demineralized bone matrices made from cancellous bone, where the properties of the material allow its insertion into defects, therefore acting as a void filler and scaffold onto which new bone can form. In this study, we report that demineralized bone sponges were prepared by dissecting and cutting knee bone into cancellous bone cubes of 1 cm3. These cubes were then taken through a series of warm water washes, some with sonication, centrifugation, and two decontamination chemical washes. The cubes were optimally demineralized into sponges with 0.5N hydrochloric acid under vacuum with constant pH measurement. Demineralization was confirmed by quantitative measurement of calcium and qualitatively by compression. The sponges were freeze dried before terminal sterilisation with a target dose of 25 kGy gamma radiation whilst frozen. Samples of the sponges were histologically examined for calcium and collagen and also tested for osteoinductivity. Data showed well defined collagen staining in the sponges, with little residual calcium. Sponges from two out of three donors demonstrated osteoinductivity when implanted into the muscle of an athymic mouse.Copyright © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded

We hypothesized that early integration of radiotherapy during TKI treatment would decrease the chance of drug resistance and prolong progression-free survival (PFS). Method(s): This study included 25 patients with stage IIIb or IV non-squamous cell, non-small cell lung cancer (NSqCLC) who responded to upfront TKI treatment. Multi-target radiotherapy was administered during the TKI treatment course. Tomotherapy comprising a hypofractionated schedule with a dose of 40-50. Gy in 16-20 fractions was used for individual metastatic lesions. Result(s): The patients' median follow-up duration was 30 months (range, 9-62 months). Of the 23 patients who had stage IV disease, 9 had oligometastases (<=5 gross target volumes) and 14 were in the more advanced stages of the disease. Twelve patients received more than 1 cycle of radiotherapy (median, 3; range, 2-6) with TKI being the only systemic treatment before they were salvaged with chemotherapy. The overall response rate after radiotherapy was 84.0%, and the median PFS was 16 months. The 3-year overall survival rate was 62.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 39.1-85.8%). Toxicities were generally tolerated but it is necessary to prevent radiation-induced pneumonitis. Conclusion(s): We showed that combined first-line TKI therapy and early multi-target radiotherapy are very effective in selected patients that respond to TKI, when the status of mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are not known before the treatment.

Recently, a new UVB source generated by a 308-nm excimer laser has been introduced for the treatment of psoriasis., OBJECTIVE: In this study we investigated the immunohistochemical evaluation of T cells and the expression of various apoptosis-related molecules in the psoriatic hyperproliferative skin before and after treatment with 308-nm monochromatic excimer light (MEL)., METHODS: Ten patients (three women and seven men), ranging in age from 29 to 79 years, affected by plaque-type psoriasis vulgaris, were treated with MEL. Biopsies from psoriatic lesions of MEL-treated sites were taken before, 24 h and/or 48 h after the first irradiation and analysed by the immunophosphatase alkaline technique (APAAP)., RESULTS: MEL treatment was found to cause a significant decrease in the rate of proliferation of keratinocytes and a relevant depletion of T cells in all psoriatic lesions, 48 h after the first irradiation: 308 nm light eliminated T cells from the psoriatic epidermis and also from the dermis, highlighting the ability of this UVB source to penetrate the skin compared with normal UVB and establish direct cytotoxic action on T cells infiltrating skin lesions. Rapid clearing of psoriatic lesions involves potential molecular targets of UVB in T cells including p53, which is upregulated after direct irradiation with 308-nm UVB. Moreover, Bcl-2 expression in healing psoriasis epidermis after MEL treatment is significantly decreased compared with untreated skin and the TUNEL (TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labelling) technique revealed the presence of relevant apoptotic keratinocytes in the irradiated epidermis., CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that psoriatic skin after monochromatic excimer light therapy is associated with significant T-cell depletion and alterations of apoptosis-related molecules accompanied by a decreased proliferation index and clinical remission.",Excluded

Herein, the authors have reported to their knowledge the largest series to date using intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) in the treatment of these patients., METHODS: Between 2013 and 2018, a total of 86 consecutive patients (68 of whom were radiation-naive and 18 of whom were reirradiated) received PT to median doses of 70 grays and 67 grays relative biological effectiveness, respectively. Approximately 53% received IMPT., RESULTS: The median follow-up was 23.4 months (range, 1.7-69.3 months) for all patients and 28.1 months (range, 2.3-69.3 months) for surviving patients. The 2-year local control (LC), distant control, disease-free survival, and overall survival rates were 83%, 84%, 74%, and 81%, respectively, for radiation-naive patients and 77%, 80%, 54%, and 66%, respectively for reirradiated patients. Among radiation-naive patients, when compared with 3-dimensional conformal proton technique, IMPT significantly improved LC (91% vs 72%; P < .01) and independently predicted LC (hazard ratio, 0.14; P = .01). Sixteen radiation-naive patients (24%) experienced acute grade 3 toxicities; 4 (6%) experienced late grade 3 toxicities (osteoradionecrosis, vision loss, soft-tissue necrosis, and soft tissue fibrosis) (grading was performed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [version 5.0]). Slightly inferior LC was noted for patients undergoing reirradiation with higher complications: 11% experienced late grade 3 toxicities (facial pain and brain necrosis). Patients treated with reirradiation had more grade 1 to 2 radionecrosis than radiation-naive patients (brain: 33% vs 7% and osteoradionecrosis: 17% vs 3%)., CONCLUSIONS: PT achieved remarkable LC for patients with nasal cavity and paranasal sinus cancers with lower grade 3 toxicities relative to historical reports. IMPT has the potential to improve the therapeutic ratio in these malignancies and is worthy of further investigation. Copyright © 2020 American Cancer Society.",Excluded

In a previous pilot study, we found that lymphocytes from patients with glioma were more sensitive to gamma-radiation than were lymphocytes from matched control subjects. In this larger case-control study, we compared the gamma-radiation sensitivity of lymphocytes from glioma patients with those from control subjects and investigated the association between mutagen sensitivity and the risk for developing glioma., METHODS: We used a mutagen sensitivity assay (an indirect measure of DNA repair activity) to assess chromosomal damage. We gamma-irradiated (1.5 Gy) short-term lymphocyte cultures from 219 case patients with glioma and from 238 healthy control subjects frequency matched by age and sex. After irradiation, cells were cultured for 4 hours, and then Colcemid was added for 1 hour to arrest cells in mitosis. Fifty metaphases were randomly selected for each sample and scored for chromatid breaks. All statistical tests were two-sided., RESULTS: We observed a statistically significantly higher frequency of chromatid breaks per cell from case patients with glioma (mean = 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.50 to 0.59) than from control subjects (mean = 0.44; 95% CI = 0.41 to 0.48) (P<.001). Using 0.40 (the median number of chromatid breaks per cell in control subjects) as the cut point for defining mutagen sensitivity and adjusting for age, sex, and smoking status, we found that mutagen sensitivity was statistically significantly associated with an increased risk for glioma (odds ratio = 2.09; 95% CI = 1.43 to 3.06). When the data were divided into tertiles, the relative risk for glioma increased from the lowest tertile to the highest tertile (trend test, P<.001)., CONCLUSION: gamma-Radiation-induced mutagen sensitivity of lymphocytes may be associated with an increased risk for glioma, a result that supports our earlier preliminary findings.",Included
1662,"Frameless Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis-Related Trigeminal Neuralgia Background Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) affects 7% of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). In such patients, TN is difficult to manage either pharmacologically and surgically. Radiosurgical rhizotomy is an effective treatment option. The nonisocentric geometry of radiation beams of CyberKnife introduces new concepts in the treatment of TN. Its efficacy for MS-related TN has not yet been demonstrated. Methods Twenty-seven patients with refractory TN and MS were treated. A nonisocentric beams distribution was chosen; the maximal target dose was 72.5 Gy. The maximal dose to the brainstem was <12 Gy. Effects on pain, medications, sensory disturbance, rate, and time of pain recurrence were analyzed. Results Median follow-up was 37 (18-72) months. Barrow Neurological Institute pain scale score I-III was achieved in 23/27 patients (85%) within 45 days. Prescription isodose line (80%) accounting for a dose of 58 Gy incorporated an average of 4.85 mm (4-6 mm) of the nerve and mean nerve volume of 26.4 mm3 (range 20-38 mm3). Seven out of 27 patients (26%) had mild, not bothersome, facial numbness (Barrow Neurological Institute numbness score II). The rate of pain control decreased progressively after the first year, and only 44% of patients retained pain control 4 years later. Conclusions Frameless radiosurgery can be effectively used to perform retrogasserian rhizotomy. Pain relief was satisfactory and, with our dose/volume constraints, no sensory complications were recorded. Nonetheless, long-term pain control was possible in less than half of the patients. This is a limitation that CyberKnife radiosurgery shares with other techniques in MS patients.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1688,"Countermeasures-based Improvements in Stress, Immune System Dysregulation and Latent Herpesvirus Reactivation onboard the International Space Station - Relevance for Deep Space Missions and Terrestrial Medicine The International Space Station (ISS) has continued to evolve from an operational perspective and multiple studies have monitored both stress and the immune system of ISS astronauts. Alterations were ascribed to a potentially synergistic array of factors, including microgravity, radiation, psychological stress, and circadian misalignment. Comparing similar data across 12 years of ISS construction and operations, we report that immunity, stress, and the reactivation of latent herpesviruses have all improved in ISS astronauts. Major physiological improvements seem to have initiated approximately 2012, a period coinciding with improvements onboard ISS including cargo delivery and resupply frequency, personal communication, exercise equipment and protocols, food quality and variety, nutritional supplementation, and schedule management. We conclude that spaceflight associated immune dysregulation has been positively influenced by operational improvements and biomedical countermeasures onboard ISS. Although an operational challenge, agencies should therefore incorporate, within vehicle design limitations, these dietary, operational, and stress-relieving countermeasures into deep space mission planning.

Deterministic effects such as erythema, epilation and ulceration being reported on patients who have undergone these procedures emphasise the importance of optimising radiation dose, whilst not compromising diagnostic efficacy. This study investigated radiation doses delivered to patients for four common types of cardiac radiological examinations: coronary angiography (CA), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary angiograms (which were followed by an interventional procedure (CA-PCI)) and permanent pacemaker insertions (PPIs). 21 cardiac imaging suites participated in the study in 14 hospitals, representing 90% of relevant centres within Ireland. Radiation dose was monitored for 1804 adult patients using dose-area product meters. Operational and examination details, such as cardiologist grade, patient details, examination complexity and exposure factors, were recorded for each examination. Variation factors in dose between centres ranged from 2.7 to 11.1, but these factors were not higher than intrahospital variations previously recorded for other examinations within Ireland, such as chest X-ray. High-dose centres were often associated with long screening times, a high patient body mass index and complexity of the procedure. Preliminary dose reference levels (DRLs) were established using rounded third quartile values at 4200 cGy cm(2), 8400 cGy cm(2), 10,700 cGy cm(2) and 2100 cGy cm(2) for CA, PCI, CA-PCI and PPI, respectively.

This study also examines how the co-occurrence of non-tumor diseases may affect tumor-associated hazards. While exposure to radiation increases the hazard of dying with tumor and non-tumor diseases, dose fractionation modulates these hazards, which varies across different organ systems.

2086,"Malignant melanoma and other second cutaneous malignancies in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The influence of additional therapy after total skin electron beam radiation BACKGROUND: Previous large studies have shown that patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma are at increased risk for basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, and anecdotal case reports have suggested an association with malignant melanoma. It has been postulated that the exposure of cutaneous structures to potentially carcinogenic therapies, such as ionizing radiation or alkylating agents, might be causally associated with the development of these second cutaneous malignancies, but, to date, no study has directly addressed this issue. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of second cutaneous malignancies in a group of patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma treated with total skin electron beam therapy and to examine the additional effects of oral psoralen with UV-A phototherapy, topical mechlorethamine hydrochloride therapy, and further radiation therapy. One hundred sixty-four patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma who had received total skin electron beam therapy between 1974 and 1990 were identified, and information was abstracted from their records., RESULTS: Six patients developed malignant melanoma 12 to 95 months after total skin electron beam therapy. Of the six patients, three had received oral psoralen with UV-A as additional therapy and two had received topical mechlorethamine. None had received additional radiation therapy. Twenty-four patients developed more than 37 basal cell carcinomas and 34 squamous cell carcinomas from 11 months to more than 10 years after total skin electron beam therapy. Of the 24 patients, 15 had received oral psoralen with UV-A and 12 had received mechlorethamine as additional therapy. Additional radiation therapy had been administered to nine patients. During a median follow-up of 6 years, no patients died of any second cutaneous malignancy., CONCLUSION: We found a high rate of both melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer. The additional use of mechlorethamine or oral psoralen plus UV-A, but not radiation, was significantly associated with the development of basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, but not malignant melanoma.",Excluded
1356,"The perception of voice onset time: an fMRI investigation of phonetic category structure This study explored the neural systems underlying the perception of phonetic category structure by investigating the perception of a voice onset time (VOT) continuum in a phonetic categorization task. Stimuli consisted of five synthetic speech stimuli which ranged in VOT from 0 msec ([da]) to 40 msec ([ta]). Results from 12 subjects showed that the neural system is sensitive to VOT differences of 10 msec and that details of phonetic category structure are retained throughout the phonetic processing stream. Both the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and cingulate showed graded activation as a function of category membership with increasing activation as stimuli approached the phonetic category boundary. These results are consistent with the view that the left IFG is involved in phonetic decision processes, with the extent of activation influenced by increased resources devoted to resolving phonetic category membership and/or selecting between competing phonetic categories. Activation patterns in the cingulate suggest that it is sensitive to stimulus difficulty and resolving response conflict. In contrast, activation in the posterior left middle temporal gyrus and the left angular gyrus showed modulation of activation only to the ""best fit"" of the phonetic category, suggesting that these areas are involved in mapping sound structure to its phonetic representation. The superior temporal gyrus (STG) bilaterally showed weaker sensitivity to the differences in phonetic category structure, providing further evidence that the STG is involved in the early analysis of the sensory properties of speech.",Excluded
1308,"Subacute haematotoxicity after PRRT with (177)Lu-DOTA-octreotate: prognostic factors, incidence and course PURPOSE: In peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT), the bone marrow (BM) is one of the dose-limiting organs. The accepted dose limit for BM is 2 Gy, adopted from (131)I treatment. We investigated the incidence and duration of haematological toxicity and its risk factors in patients treated with PRRT with (177)Lu-DOTA(0)-Tyr(3)-octreotate ((177)Lu-DOTATATE). Also, absorbed BM dose estimates were evaluated and compared with the accepted 2 Gy dose limit., METHODS: The incidence and duration of grade 3 or 4 haematological toxicity (according to CTCAE v3.0) and risk factors were analysed. Mean BM dose per unit (gigabecquerels) of administered radioactivity was calculated and the correlations between doses to the BM and haematological risk factors were determined., RESULTS: Haematological toxicity (grade 3/4) occurred in 34 (11 %) of 320 patients. In 15 of the 34 patients, this lasted more than 6 months or blood transfusions were required. Risk factors significantly associated with haematological toxicity were: poor renal function, white blood cell (WBC) count <4.0 x 10(9)/l, age over 70 years, extensive tumour mass and high tumour uptake on the OctreoScan. Previous chemotherapy was not associated. The mean BM dose per administered activity in 23 evaluable patients was 67 +/- 7 mGy/GBq, resulting in a mean BM dose of 2 Gy in patients who received four cycles of 7.4 GBq (177)Lu-DOTATATE. Significant correlations between (cumulative) BM dose and platelet and WBC counts were found in a selected group of patients., CONCLUSION: The incidence of subacute haematological toxicity after PRRT with (177)Lu-DOTATATE is acceptable (11 %). Patients with impaired renal function, low WBC count, extensive tumour mass, high tumour uptake on the OctreoScan and/or advanced age are more likely to develop grade 3/4 haematological toxicity. The BM dose limit of 2 Gy, adopted from (131)I, seems not to be valid for PRRT with (177)Lu-DOTATATE.",Excluded
2071,"Assessment of successful incorporation of cages after cervical or lumbar intercorporal fusion with [(18)F]fluoride positron-emission tomography/computed tomography The purpose of this study is to assess the successful incorporation of cages in patients after cervical or lumbar intercorporal fusion with positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). Twenty patients (14 female and 6 male; mean age 58 years, age range 38-73 years) with 30 cervical (n = 13) or lumbar (n = 17) intercorporal fusions were prospectively enrolled in this study. Time interval between last intercorporal intervention and PET/CT ranged from 2 to 116 months (mean 63; median 77 months). IRB approval was obtained for all patients, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. About 30 min prior to PET/CT scanning, 97-217 MBq (mean 161 MBq) 18F-fluoride were administered intravenously. Patients were imaged in supine position on a combined PET/CT system (Discovery RX/STE, 16/64 slice CT, GE Healthcare). 3D-PET emission data were acquired for 1.5 and 2 min/bed position, respectively, and reconstructed by a fully 3D iterative algorithm (VUE Point HD) using low-dose CT data for attenuation correction. A dedicated diagnostic thin-slice CT was optionally acquired covering the fused region. Areas of increased 18F-fluoride uptake around cages were determined by one double-board certified radiologist/nuclear physician and one board certified radiologist in consensus. In 12/20 (60%) patients, increased 18F-fluoride uptake around cages was observed. Of the 30 intercorporal fusions, 15 (50%) showed increased 18F-fluoride uptake. Median time between intervention and PET/CT examination in cages with increased uptake was 37 months (2-116 months), median time between intervention and PET/CT examination in those cages without increased uptake was 91 months (19-112 months), p (Wilcoxon) = 0.01 (one-sided). 14/29 (48%) cages with a time interval > 1 year between intervention and PET/CT scan showed an increased uptake. In conclusion, PET/CT frequently shows increased 18F-fluoride uptake in cervical and lumbar cages older than 1 year (up to almost 8 years in cervical cages and 10 years in lumbar cages) possibly indicating unsuccessful fusion due to increased stress/microinstability. © Springer-Verlag 2010.",Excluded
2197,"Electrical exposure analysis of galvanic-coupled intra-body communication based on the empirical arm models Background: Intra-body communication (IBC) is one of the highlights in studies of body area networks. The existing IBC studies mainly focus on human channel characteristics of the physical layer, transceiver design for the application, and the protocol design for the networks. However, there are few safety analysis studies of the IBC electrical signals, especially for the galvanic-coupled type. Besides, the human channel model used in most of the studies is just a multi-layer homocentric cylinder model, which cannot accurately approximate the real human tissue layer. Method(s): In this paper, the empirical arm models were established based on the geometrical information of six subjects. The thickness of each tissue layer and the anisotropy of muscle were also taken into account. Considering the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) guidelines, the restrictions taken as the evaluation criteria were the electric field intensity lower than 1.35 x 104 f V/m and the specific absorption rate (SAR) lower than 4 W/kg. The physiological electrode LT-1 was adopted in experiments whose size was 4 x 4 cm and the distance between each center of adjoining electrodes was 6 cm. The electric field intensity and localized SAR were all computed by the finite element method (FEM). The electric field intensity was set as average value of all tissues, while SAR was averaged over 10 g contiguous tissue. The computed data were compared with the 2010 ICNIRP guidelines restrictions in order to address the exposure restrictions of galvanic-coupled IBC electrical signals injected into the body with different amplitudes and frequencies. Result(s): The input alternating signal was 1 mA current or 1 V voltage with the frequency range from 10 kHz to 1 MHz. When the subject was stimulated by a 1 mA alternating current, the average electric field intensity of all subjects exceeded restrictions when the frequency was lower than 20 kHz. The maximum difference among six subjects was 1.06 V/m at 10 kHz, and the minimum difference was 0.025 V/m at 400 kHz. While the excitation signal was a 1 V alternating voltage, the electric field intensity fell within the exposure restrictions gradually as the frequency increased beyond 50 kHz. The maximum difference among the six subjects was 2.55 V/m at 20 kHz, and the minimum difference was 0.54 V/m at 1 MHz. In addition, differences between the maximum and the minimum values at each frequency also decreased gradually with the frequency increased in both situations of alternating current and voltage. When SAR was introduced as the criteria, none of the subjects exceeded the restrictions with current injected. However, subjects 2, 4, and 6 did not satisfy the restrictions with voltage applied when the signal amplitude was >= 3, 6, and 10 V, respectively. The SAR differences for subjects with different frequencies were 0.062-1.3 W/kg of current input, and 0.648-6.096 W/kg of voltage input. Conclusion(s): Based on the empirical arm models established in this paper, we came to conclusion that the frequency of 100-300 kHz which belong to LF (30-300 kHz) according to the ICNIRP guidelines can be considered as the frequency restrictions of the galvanic-coupled IBC signal. This provided more choices for both intensities of current and voltage signals as well. On the other hand, it also makes great convenience for the design of transceiver hardware and artificial intelligence application. With the frequency restrictions settled, the intensity restrictions that the current signal of 1-10 mA and the voltage signal of 1-2 V were accessible. Particularly, in practical application we recommended the use of the current signals for its broad application and lower impact on the human tissue. In addition, it is noteworthy that the coupling structure design of the electrode interface should attract attention.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).",Excluded
2213,"Ocular Radiation Threshold Projection Based off of Fluoroscopy Time During ERCP Objectives: Current international guidelines for ocular radiation exposure suggest a threshold of 20 millisieverts (mSv)/year. Although endoscopists wear lead aprons, use of protective eye wear is optional. This study was conducted to analyze the lens radiation exposure during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for endoscopists to determine the time of fluoroscopy needed to warrant using lens protection during ERCP. Method(s): ERCP patients were prospectively enrolled. Indications, interventions, fluoroscopy time, dose, and attending +/- fellow involvement were recorded. Radiation exposure was collected from body dosimeters and dosimeters placed between the eyes. Cumulative radiation doses were obtained at study completion and averaged over the total fluoroscopy time to determine the mSv/hour exposure. Result(s): A total of 187 cases were included. Attendings and fellows wore lens dosimeters in 178 and 126 cases, respectively, and body dosimeters in 174 and 128 cases, respectively. Attendings and fellows wore lens dosimeters throughout 15.89 and 11.24 h of fluoroscopy, respectively. The cumulative radiation dose absorbed per lens dosimeters was 5.35 mSv for attendings and 2.55 mSv for fellows. The projected lens absorption by the body dosimeters was 19.03 mSv for attendings and 5.21 mSv for fellows. The hourly fluoroscopy lens exposure was 0.34 mSv/hour for attendings and 0.23 mSv/hour for fellows. Conclusion(s): The amount of fluoroscopy hours needed to reach the currently suggested lens threshold limit (20 mSv/year) was 59.41 h for attendings and 88.17 h for fellows. Radioprotective eye wear should be worn by physicians with yearly fluoroscopy times in similarly structured practices that meet or exceed these thresholds.Copyright © 2017 by the American College of Gastroenterology.",Excluded

This may be due to accelerated atherosclerotic changes within the RT-field; however, the real impact of local RT on the carotid artery remains debatable. The aim of the present study was to assess the difference in carotid wall thickness (intima-media thickness) in 42 unilaterally irradiated parotid tumour patients by performing B-mode ultrasonography. A mean difference in intima-media thickness (IMT) of the irradiated compared with the non-irradiated carotid artery of 0.30 mm (P=0.031) was found. A significant correlation was established with a longer post-RT interval (P=0.008). RT on the neck is associated with increased thickening of carotid IMT. Screening and treatment of additional cerebrovascular risk factors which contribute to further IMT thickening and stroke development is recommended, especially in radiotherapy patients with a favourable prognosis.",Excluded
1656,"Detection of Upper Tract Urothelial Malignancies by Computed Tomography Urography in Patients Referred for Hematuria at a Large Tertiary Referral Center Objective To evaluate the age-stratified prevalence of upper tract urothelial malignancies diagnosed on computed tomography urography in a large cohort of patients referred for initial evaluation of hematuria. Materials and Methods A total of 1123 consecutive adults without a history of urothelial cancer underwent initial computed tomography urography for gross hematuria (n = 652), microscopic hematuria (n = 457), or unspecified hematuria (n = 14) at a single institution from October 2006 to October 2012. Imaging findings suggestive of urothelial lesions were correlated with clinical information, including cystoscopy, cytology, and surgical pathology reports. Patients subsequently diagnosed with urothelial cancer following a normal radiographic evaluation were identified and analyzed. Age, gender, smoking history, and location and type of malignancy were analyzed. Results Upper tract urothelial cancer was detected in 4 (0.36%) patients, with a mean age of 66.5 years. All 4 patients presented with gross hematuria and were current or former smokers. None of the 535 patients under age 55 who underwent computed tomography urography were diagnosed with upper tract disease regardless of age, smoking history, or degree of hematuria. Likewise, no upper tract cancers were detected in patients referred for microscopic hematuria, regardless of age. Conclusion Detection of upper tract urothelial cancer by computed tomography urography is exceedingly rare in patients presenting at a tertiary referral center with hematuria, particularly in the lower risk strata (younger age, microscopic hematuria). Further investigation into risk-stratified approaches to imaging for hematuria workup is warranted to minimize unnecessary costs and radiation exposure.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
2313,"Organ doses, effective dose, and cancer risk from coronary CT angiography examinations OBJECTIVE. The purposes of this study were to determine organ and effective doses and to estimate the risk of exposure-induced cancer death (REID) associated with coronary CT angiography (CCTA) examinations. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. CCTA examinations were performed in three stages: calcium score, monitoring, and cardiac phases for all patients. Effective dose was calculated using two methods. The first was based on the scanner-derived dose-length product, and the second entailed use of an organ and effective dose calculator software application. Organ doses were calculated on the basis of the tissue weighting factors of International Commission on Radiation Protection report 103. REID values were assessed with a cancer risk estimator software application. RESULTS. The study included 185 patients (95 men, 90 women). For women, breast doses were high at 52.04 +/- 14.08 mGy. The mean effective dose in the women was greater than that in the men (24.05 vs 16.30 mSv, p < 0.05). The mean REID values in patients undergoing CCTA with a 64-MDCT scanner were 13.4 per 10,000 men (1 in 746) and 19.6 per 10,000 women (1 in 508). The REID values were considerably higher for the younger women. CONCLUSION. The results of this study will help referring physicians justify requesting CCTA examinations by considering their benefits for diagnosis on the one hand and awareness of the risk of radiation-induced cancer on the other. In the case of CCTA scans that are properly justified by clinical indication, patients and physicians should not be concerned about the radiation risks.Copyright © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded
1798,"Detection of point mutations at codon 12 of KI-ras in ophthalmic pterygia AIMS: Ophthalmic pterygium is a potentially vision-threatening lesion of unknown etiology, related to an exposure to solar light. Mutations to the ras genes are frequently observed in lesions related to an exposure to solar light. The present study aims at screening pterygia for mutations at codons 12 and 13 of the ras genes., METHODS: In all, 50 pterygia were examined, together with respective blood samples and specimens of normal conjunctiva. A PCR reaction was performed to amplify sequences containing codons 12 and 13 of Ki-ras, H-ras, and N-ras. An RFLP analysis was then performed to detect point mutations at codon 12. The mutational status at codons 12 and 13 was further explored with sequencing of PCR products., RESULTS: RFLP analysis revealed Ki-ras mutations at codon 12 in five (10%) of pterygia, whereas H-ras or N-ras mutations were not observed. Sequencing confirmed Ki-ras mutations at codon 12 and revealed absence of mutations at codon 13. The presence of Ki-ras mutations was significantly correlated with postoperative recurrence (P=0.02) and young age (P=0.04). Mutations were not observed in specimens of blood or normal conjunctiva for any of the genes examined., CONCLUSIONS: The absence of N-ras mutations is in agreement with previous reports concerning mucosal lesions. The detection of Ki-ras mutations and the association with postoperative recurrence implies a possible role of Ki-ras in the clinical profile of pterygium. The mechanism of Ki-ras mutations is unclear and could be independent of the action of UV light.",Excluded

The aim of the present detailed cost analysis study was to identify the major factors that determine the costs of intensive care medicine. Method(s): In a patient-based investigation lasting 6 months, 104 patients (mean age 64.6 years) on an interdisciplinary surgical intensive care unit were analyzed over 309 hospital occupancy days. Demographic data, drugs administered, infusions, nutrition, blood and coagulation products, invasive measures and monitoring, artificial respiration parameters, other measures and diagnostic services (laboratory, microbiology, x-ray, etc.), as well as four intensive scores (SAPS II, APACHE II, SOFA, TISS 28) were recorded daily. Result(s): The overall cost of 309 occupancy days (n=104) amounted to 457,564.11 euros, the average cost per day being 1,480.78 euros, and the mean case-specific cost 4,747.48 euros. 49 % of the overall cost was generated by medical staff, with medication and material each accounting for 18 %. Of the personnel costs, 70 % were caused by the nursing staff, 22 % by the medical staff and 8 % by cleaning and other personnel. During the course of hospitalisation, an non-significant increase in the costs generated by personnel was observed. A linear correlation was found between cumulated TISS 28 and the mean case costs. While there was no significant relationship between patient-specific score levels and individual case cost, the correlation between length of stay (LOS) and case cost was highly significant. Conclusion(s): The determining factor in the cost calculation of intensive care medicine are personnel costs. Overall cost is determined largely by the LOS, with such additional factors as age, diagnosis, comorbidity, etc. playing only an insignificant role. © Anasth Intensivmed 2010.",Excluded
1575,"IL-6 promotes stemness of cancer stem cells and may contribute to radiation resistance of non-small cell lung cancer Background: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among both men and women. Long-term survival of lung cancer patients remains low despite aggressive therapies including surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Ionizing radiation (IR) is the standard therapy for patients diagnosed with localized unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However local tumor control by standard fractionated radiotherapy (RT) remains poor due to tumor resistance to IR. Accumulating evidences have indicated that cancer stem cells (CSCs, also known as cancer initiating cells) exist as a very minor population in NSCLC tumors, which are composed of heterogeneous cell populations. Our laboratory and others found that CSC population increases upon irradiation, which may contribute to radiation resistance. The role of IL-6 in NSCLC progression has been suggested since high IL-6 levels were detected in sera of lung cancer patients, but not detectable in most patients with benign lung diseases. However, the exact mechanism by which IL-6 influences lung cancer progression and its role in CSCs mediated radioresistance remain unresolved. Method(s): We isolated CD133+ CSC population from 3 NSCLC cell lines (NSCLC-CSCs) and studied the role of IL-6 in CD133+ CSCs growth by treating cells with IL-6. In addition, we manipulated IL-6 expression levels in the IL-6 expressing A549 and H157 cells by the knockdown of IL-6 using lentiviral infection system carrying IL-6siRNA and isolated CD133+ cells for further analyses. The growth and stem cell marker expressions of these CSCs, IL-6 treated or non-treated, or IL-6 expressing or knocked down cells upon irradiation were then investigated. The differences in the activation of signaling pathways and neuroendocrine differentiation were also studied. Results and Conclusion(s): We found that IL-6 increased self-renewal of NSCLC-CSCs significantly and thereby increased NSCLC-CSC population. We also found that IL-6 increased stemness of the isolated CD133+ CSCs when CD133+ cells were treated with IL-6. More importantly, when we irradiated the CD133+ CSCs isolated from the IL-6 knocked down and scramble control A549 cells, we found that the CSCs isolated from the IL-6 knocked down cells exhibited lower survival than the CSCs of control cells. Therefore, we suggest that IL-6 may contribute to NSCLC-CSCs mediated-radioresistance via (i) direct triggering radioresistance, and (ii) increasing self-renewal and stemness of the survived CSCs. Mechanistic dissection studies revealed that the increased self-renewal of CSCs by IL-6 is due to the activation of the hedgehog signaling and the increased expression of bcl-2, while the IL-6 mediated increase of radioresistance is due to the activation of neuroendocrine differentiation, Stat 3 signaling pathway, and increased expression of bcl-2.",Excluded

1505,"Correlation between radiation dose and p53 protein expression levels in human lymphocytes The aim of this research was to evaluate the relationship between p53 protein levels and absorbed doses from in vitro irradiated human lymphocytes. For this, samples of blood from 23 donors were irradiated with 0.5; 1; 2; and 4 Gy from a Cobalt-60 source, and the percentages of lymphocytes expressing p53 were scored using Flow Cytometry. The subjects were divided into 3 groups, in accordance with the p53 levels expressed per radiation dose: low (Group I), high (Group II), and excessive levels (Group III). For all groups, the analyses showed that the p53 expression levels increase with the absorbed dose. Particularly for groups I and II, the correlation between this protein expression and the dose follows the linear-quadratic model, such as for radioinduced chromosomal aberrations. In conclusion, our findings indicate possible applications of this approach in evaluating individual radiosensitivity prior to radiotherapeutical procedures as well as in medical surveillance of occupationally exposed workers. Furthermore, due to the rapidity of flow-cytometric analyses, the methodology here employed would play an important role in emergency responses to a large-scale radiation incident where many people may have been exposed.",Included

However, EVL is associated with complications such as hemorrhage, chest pain, dysphagia, and odynophagia due to post-EVL ulcers in the esophageal mucosa. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of proton pump inhibitor (PPI), pantoprazole on the healing of post-EVL ulcers., METHODS: Forty seven patients were randomly allocated into PPI group and control group. Patients in PPI group received 40 mg of pantoprazole intravenously for 3 days after EVL, then 40 mg of oral pantoprazole for 11 days consecutively. Control patients received intravenous and oral placebo. Endoscopic examinations were performed twice at 7+/-2 days and 14+/-2 days after EVL respectively. Clinical outcomes include the size of ulcers, symptoms reported by patients; chest pain, dysphagia, and odynophagia., RESULTS: Forty seven patients completed the 7 days protocol (PPI/control; 25/22), and twenty six patients completed the 14 days protocol (PPI/control; 16/10). Post-EVL ulcers in PPI group were significantly smaller than those in control group (7 days; 98.7 mm2/119.4 m2, 14 days; 32.3 m2/43.8 m2, p<0.01). No difference was observed between two the groups with respect to summations of symptom scores (p> 0.05).

This study aimed to assess the expression and activity of the gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the DEJ and dentin-pulp complex tissues of teeth irradiated in vivo., STUDY DESIGN: Thirty-six teeth were studied, including 19 irradiated and 17 non-irradiated controls. In situ zymography was used to investigate the gelatinolytic activity in the micromorphologic components of enamel, DEJ, dentin-pulp complex, and caries. Immunohistochemical analysis was conducted on the demineralized samples to assess MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression levels in the DEJ, dentin-pulp complex components, and caries., RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were detected between groups in gelatinolytic activity or in MMP-2 expression levels (P > .05). Odontoblast MMP-9 expression was reduced in the irradiated group (P = .02)., CONCLUSIONS: The study rejected the hypothesis that MMP-2 and MMP-9 would be overexpressed or more activated in the DEJ and dentin-pulp complex of irradiated teeth. Direct effects of radiation should not be regarded as an independent factor for explaining radiation-related caries onset and progression. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

1887,"Loss of osseous homeostasis is present in radiographically normal knees with documented medial meniscus tears Background: Medial compartment arthrosis associated with loss of osseous homeostasis (positive technetium bone scan) is a well recognized long term sequelae in patients with documented medial meniscus tears. The temporal occurrence of this loss of osseous homeostasis has not to the present been shown. Purpose(s): To report the preoperative scintigraphic imaging findings in 79 patients with MRI documented medial meniscus tears and normal radiographs. Material(s) and Method(s): 79 adults (66 males and 13 females) without a history of prior injury or surgery between the ages of 27 and 61 (mean age 41) were included in the study. All patients had a normal preoperative Rosenberg x-ray (weight bearing PA radiograph) an MRI diagnostic of a structurally damaged medial meniscus, and a standard three-hour delayed technetium 99m-MDP bone scan of the knees. Result(s): 77/79 (97%) of the technetium bone scans were positive (increased scintigraphic activity) manifesting loss of osseous homeostasis in the medial compartment of the knees with documented torn medial meniscus findings of in the face of normal structural bone imaging . All patients had surgical documentation of the medial meniscus tears. Discussion(s): Loss of osseous homeostasis of the medial compartment of knees with documented medial meniscus tears was present at a time when the radiographic findings were normal. The conceptualization of the extent of the pathology in such patients needs to include loss of osseous homeostasis. Future studies documenting the post-operative history of surgically treated patients with medial meniscus tears may yield information of interest regarding the development of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. It is postulated that the persistent post-operative loss of osseous homeostasis may identify those knees as ones at risk of the early development of OA, whereas the restoration of osseous homeostasis may be an important marker that such knees are not at risk for the development of OA.",Excluded
1758,"Hypofractionated volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) for fragile patients with oesophageal cancer Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility, safety, and dosimetric results of volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) to deliver hypofractionated radiotherapy (RT) in oesophageal cancer patients, unfit for a multimodality curative strategy. Patients/methods: From 2010 to 2017, 22 patients were treated with hypofractionated VMAT for palliative/symptomatic setting. The prescription dose was 40 Gy in 16 fractions (EQD2 41.7 Gy considering an alpha/beta ratio of 10 Gy, and 44 Gy considering an alpha/beta ratio of 3 Gy). Result(s): Eight patients (36%) were symptomatic for grade 3 baseline dysphagia. RT was generally well tolerated, and no patient interrupted the daily treatment. Acute toxicity was generally mild; no G3 acute toxicities were reported. At the end of treatment, 5 patients (22.7%) experienced a stable dysphagia and 14 (63.6%) an improvement of baseline dysphagia, while 3 patients (13.7%) reported a worsening of oesophagitis. At a mean follow-up of 8.7 months, 15 patients (79%) had a complete clinical recovery (G0-1) of the symptomatic moderate/severe dysphagia. At 3 months after the end of RT, seven patients (31.8%) achieved a partial or complete response. Two coplanar arcs were employed for VMAT delivery. Dosimetric results were consistent in terms of both target coverage and normal tissue sparing. Finally, 1-year progression-free and overall survival was 20% and 27.3%, respectively. Conclusion(s): Hypofractionated VMAT was feasible, safe, and effective to deliver symptomatic radiation in locally advanced oesophageal cancer patients, non-suitable for a standard curative treatment.Copyright © 2020, Federacion de Sociedades Espanolas de Oncologia (FESEO).",Excluded
2288,"Patient doses from X-ray computed tomography examinations by a single-array detector unit: Axial versus spiral mode Background: X-ray computed tomography (CT) examinations deliver a significant amount of radiation doses to patients comparing to conventional radiography examinations. The objective of the current study was to analyze and investigate the average patient received dose from axial and spiral CT exams in a medical imaging center. Material(s) and Method(s): In this study, the patient imaging technique, weight and height were recorded. The patients' doses provided by CT unit in terms of CTDIw were also recorded. Then, other dosimetric quantities including dose-length product (DLP) and effective dose were calculated for each patient using the recorded data. The average values were obtained for all the studied dosimetric quantities. Also, their distribution in terms of examined regions and imaging mode; ie, axial and spiral CT were analyzed by SPSS software. Result(s): For all patients, the mean effective dose of 4.4 mGy with the standard deviation of 9.2 was found. The CTDIw for axial group was two times higher than spiral ones. Conversely, the effective dose of axial group was less than spiral group. Additionally, the effective doses of 2.3 and 5.2 mSv were found for axial and spiral, receptively. For both quantities of CTDIw and effective dose, the observed difference between axial and spiral modes were significant (P<0.001). Conclusion(s): Our results showed that although the patient doses in the current study was comparable with the reported values by similar studies in other countries, it was higher than the reported values of a similar study in Iran.

Following transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), 35 and 6 patients received intravesical instillations of bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and anthracycline-derivants, respectively, whereas 15 received no adjuvant therapy. Five and 2 patients received systemic and local chemotherapy with irradiation, respectively, and six underwent radical cystectomy for invasive potential. The 5-year non-recurrence, progression-free, and overall (cancer-specific) survival rates were 66, 82%, and 76 (88) %, respectively, after a median follow-up of 52 months. The 5-year non-recurrence rates were 24% in non-adjuvant, 85% in BCG, 0% in anthracycline-derivants, 65% in systemic and local chemoradiation therapy, and 68% in cystectomy. The 5-year progression-free and overall (cancer-specific) survival rates of the patients treated with BCG instillation were 91% and 94(100)%. There were no significant differences in the 5-year non-recurrence and progression-free rates between 12 patients with carcinoma in situ (CIS) and 23 patients without CIS. Complete TUR of all visible tumors and a reliable histopathological diagnosis of appropriate specimens bearing the muscle layer are mandatory for assessment of recurrence. G3 Ta-1 bladder cancers and CIS showed a high risk of recurrence, and required aggressive treatment. Since BCG therapy following TURBT significantly reduced the risk of recurrence and progression, adjuvant BCG therapy is considered to be the most promising initial conservative treatment for G3 Ta-1 bladder cancers.",Excluded
1463,"Use of digital auscultation in patients with ARDS: a correlation study with CT imaging Despite being the gold standard for evaluation of lung parenchyma in ARDS patients, chest CT scan may be complicated by requiring patient transportation out of the ICU and is burdened by high costs and significant radiation exposure. We aimed to correlate acoustic features from digital chest auscultation with CT findings to explore the potential role of quantitative lung sound analysis as surrogate of imaging in these patients. We enrolled 4 male and 2 female patients (age: 63y+/-21 ; BMI: 25,7+/-4,4) admitted to ICU for ARDS-related severe respiratory failure (SRF) who underwent chest CT scan while receiving controlled invasive mechanical ventilation. A thoracic radiologist scored twelve lung regions for the prevalent CT pattern - normal, interstitial thickening, ground glass opacity or consolidation - and for the presence of pleural effusion. Digital auscultation was performed within 24 hours from CT scan at corresponding regions. Average frequency of the acoustic signal was higher in lung regions with consolidation (n=32) as compared to those with other patterns (n=38) (difference -2.25 Htz, 95%CI -4-42; -0.7, p=0.043). Increasing signal frequency was significantly associated with evidence of consolidation on CT (OR 1.117, 95%CI 1.00-1.247, p=0.048). Digital auscultation and quantitative lung sound analysis may help assess alveolar ventilation in patients with SRF in a simple, non-invasive way.

1567,"Diffusion tensor imaging study on radiation-induced brain injury in nasopharyngeal carcinoma during and after radiotherapy AIMS AND BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to monitor the mircostructure change of temporal lobe during the acute and subacute stage of radiation-induced brain injury using magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients., METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: Eighty patients diagnosed with nasopharyngeal carcinoma and treated with the first radiotherapy from July 2010 to May 2012 were enrolled. Routine brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and DTI were conducted in all patients before and during radiotherapy (radiation dose was 20, 40, and 60 Gy, respectively). The MRI and DTI were also performed in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd month after radiotherapy in 47 cases of 80 patients. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) of DTI during different stages were dynamically observed and analyzed., RESULTS: The ADC values were increased and the FA values were decreased with the increase of radiation dose (20, 40, and 60 Gy) during the radiotherapy, but there was no significant difference in ADC value or FA value between before and during radiotherapy (p>0.05). Compared with before radiotherapy, the ADC values were significantly increased and the FA values were significantly decreased at the 1st month, 2nd month, and 3rd month after radiotherapy (all p<0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Diffusion tensor imaging reflects the microstructure change of radiation-induced brain injury in the acute and subacute stage, which provides an objective basis for early intervention of potential irreversible brain injury in the late delayed stage, and has important significance for improving the overall efficacy of radiotherapy.",Excluded

Methods Between May 2001 and July 2009, 78 patients (m: f024:54; median age, 56.8 years; range, 20.1-81 years) with 87 intracranial meningiomas (78 WHO I, seven WHO II, two WHO III) were treated with muMLC-LINAC radiosurgery at our institution, either as a primary or salvage treatment following one or more microsurgical procedures. Fifty-eight of 87 tumors (66.7%) were located in the skull base. The remaining 29 meningiomas (33.3%) were located in the convexity of the brain. The median tumor volume was 4.8 ml (range, 0.2-18.3 ml). The median tumor surface dose, maximal dose, and therapeutic isodose were 12 Gy, 16 Gy, and 75%, respectively. Results For retrospective evaluation, we included 70 patients (78 tumors) with a minimum radiological follow-up of 24 months. After a median follow-up of 79.7 months (range, 24.2-109.1 months), 24 patients (34.3%) improved in their clinical status (paresis of N. abducens 18/48, facial paresis 4/8, and hemiparesis 2/9), 41 patients remained stable (58.6%), three patients had treatment-related temporary complaints (4.3%); two patients developed vertigo, and one had a leftsided hemihypesthesia. All complaints recovered completely after steroid medication within 2 weeks. Two patients (2.8%) developed permanent trigeminal neuralgia. Follow-up MR images showed a partial remission in 21 tumors (26.9%) and a stable tumor size in 55 cases (70.5%). Two patients with high-grade meningiomas showed a tumor progression (one WHO II and oneWHO III meningioma). At the end of followup (July 2010), the actuarial 5- and 9-year progression-free survival after radiosurgery were 98 and 96%, respectively. There was no treatment-related mortality.

1928,"Neuropathology of intracranial arteriovenous malformations following conventional radiation therapy Conventional fractionated radiation therapy was used in 15 patients to treat arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the brain deemed inoperable or incompletely obliterated using endovascular or surgical techniques. The AVMs measured from 0.8 to 85 cm3 (mean 28.2 cm3; median 24 cm3). Angiography in 12 patients 1-21 years following radiation therapy demonstrated no significant change in 7, slight reduction in 2, near complete obliteration in 1, and complete obliteration in 2. Magnetic resonance imaging further demonstrated apparent obliteration in one other case. Three irradiated AVMs were available for pathological examination following fatal recurrent hemorrhage after 21 years in case 1 and following surgery after 5 years in cases 2 and 3. Doses of 20 and 45 Gy were delivered to the area of the AVM in 10 and 15 fractions with a 6-MV linear accelerator in case 1 and in cases 2 and 3, respectively. A blinded histopathological comparison was made of the latter cases and three AVMs removed at surgery that were not previously irradiated and that were comparable in size, number of arterial feeders, and location within the brain. Segmental hyalinization of some blood vessels was seen in both irradiated and nonirradiated cases. The single postmortem specimen showed extensive thrombosis but a patent nidus. The findings are in keeping with the clinical impression that conventional fractionated radiation therapy fails to alter the natural history of cerebral AVMs. The favorable outcome of radiosurgery on small- to medium-sized AVMs appears attributable to the shorter duration of therapy using relatively high-dose prescriptions to the nidus.",Excluded

We retrospectively reviewed 124 patients treated with Gamma Knife SRS from January 2018 to December 2019 at our institution using a mask-based immobilization system. Patient and treatment characteristics were collected and summarized as well as interfraction shifts and treatment-related outcomes. This dataset includes 124 patients with an associated 358 intracranial tumors. Twenty-four patients presented with primary brain tumors, which included 14 meningiomas and 10 other histologies, with 100 patients having brain metastases. Sixty tumors were post-operative, while 298 were intact. The median dose for primary tumors was 25 Gy in 5 fractions. Median doses to metastases were 20 Gy in 1 fraction, 27 Gy in 3 fractions, and 25 Gy in 5 fractions. Median interfraction CBCT shifts were submillimeter. Median patient follow-up was 6.28 months. 91% of patients with metastases maintained local control. Our early clinical experience has demonstrated limited toxicity profiles and high patient tolerance, which suggests that mask-based Gamma Knife SRS provides a safe alternative option for frameless SRS. Patients with large target volumes where fractionation is preferred or with small target volumes in non-eloquent areas can be considered for this approach. Response rates are encouraging, and continued follow-up is necessary to investigate long-term control and survival.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
1813,"Phase 2 study of preoperative image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy to reduce wound and combined modality morbidities in lower extremity soft tissue sarcoma BACKGROUND: This study sought to determine if preoperative image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IG-IMRT) can reduce morbidity, including wound complications, by minimizing dose to uninvolved tissues in adults with lower extremity soft tissue sarcoma. METHOD(S): The primary endpoint was the development of an acute wound complication (WC). IG-IMRT was used to conform volumes to avoid normal tissues (skin flaps for wound closure, bone, or other uninvolved soft tissues). From July 2005 to June 2009, 70 adults were enrolled; 59 were evaluable for the primary endpoint. Median tumor size was 9.5 cm; 55 tumors (93%) were high-grade and 58 (98%) were deep to fascia. RESULT(S): Eighteen (30.5%) patients developed WCs. This was not statistically significantly different from the result of the National Cancer Institute of Canada SR2 trial (P =.2); however, primary closure technique was possible more often (55 of 59 patients [93.2%] versus 50 of 70 patients [71.4%]; P =.002), and secondary operations for WCs were somewhat reduced (6 of 18 patients [33%] versus 13 of 30 patients [43%]; P =.55). Moderate edema, skin, subcutaneous, and joint toxicity was present in 6 (11.1%), 1 (1.9%), 5 (9.3%), and 3 (5.6%) patients, respectively, but there were no bone fractures. Four local recurrences (6.8%, none near the flaps) occurred with median follow-up of 49 months. CONCLUSION(S): The 30.5% incidence of WCs was numerically lower than the 43% risk derived from the National Cancer Institute of Canada SR2 trial, but did not reach statistical significance. Preoperative IG-IMRT significantly diminished the need for tissue transfer. RT chronic morbidities and the need for subsequent secondary operations for WCs were lowered, although not significantly, whereas good limb function was maintained.

2022,"Synthesis and application of a thermoplastic plate of poly(Lactide-epsilon-caprolactone) for radiation therapy In this study, the poly(lactide-epsilon-caprolactone) (P(LA-CL)) copolymer is synthesized by ring-opening polymerization with glycol used as a molecular weight regulator to adjust the molecular weight of the polymer. The proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) results demonstrate that the P(LA-CL) copolymer is successfully synthesized, and that the molecular weight can be controlled by the glycol content. The thermoplastic plate is processed with triallyl isocyanurate as a cross-linking agent by a single-screw extruder followed by gamma-ray irradiation. Shape memory test results show that the material had the desired shape memory effect, with deformation recovery rates reaching 100%. After secondary stretching of samples, deformation recovery rates are unchanged. The results of mechanical property measurements indicate that with added lactide, the tensile strength is improved and shore hardness is increased by 20%-30%. Data from clinical trials also reveal that the material has good clinical effects in thermoplastic membrane fixation.Copyright © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Excluded
1289,"The upper esophageal sphincter is not round: a pilot study evaluating a novel, physiology-based approach to upper esophageal sphincter dilation OBJECTIVES: Recent basic science investigations have suggested that the upper esophageal sphincter (UES), in cross section, is not round, but that it more closely approximates a kidney shape. Dilation with simultaneous use of two cylindrical dilators provides a novel, physiology-based approach to UES distention. We evaluated the initial safety and efficacy of UES dilation with simultaneous use of two controlled radial expansion balloon dilators., METHODS: Using a computerized database, we reviewed the charts of all persons who underwent UES dilation with simultaneous use of two radial expansion balloon dilators between December 1, 2011, and March 15, 2012. Information regarding patient demographics, indications, technique, and complications was abstracted. Self-reported swallowing impairment was assessed with the validated 10-item Eating Assessment Tool (EAT-10)., RESULTS: Ten individuals underwent simultaneous dilation with two dilators. Their mean age was 65 years (SD, 14 years), and 7 (70%) of them were male. The indications for dilation were radiation-induced UES stenosis (50%), cricopharyngeus muscle dysfunction (30%), upper esophageal web (10%), and anastomotic stricture (10%). After the double-balloon dilation, no complications were reported. The mean EAT-10 score improved significantly, from 34.3 (SD, 13.5) to 16.7 (SD, 8.4), after the simultaneous dilation (p = 0.003)., CONCLUSIONS: Pilot data suggest that simultaneous dilation of the UES with two controlled radial expansion balloon dilators is feasible, safe, and effective. Future investigation is necessary to confirm the safety of this technique in a larger cohort and to use objective measures of efficacy to compare the technique to conventional dilation with a single dilator.",Excluded
1937,"Gamma irradiation. An effective procedure for bone banks, but does it make sense from an osteobiological perspective? BACKGROUND: Bone grafts promote bone healing by supplying a three-dimensional structure that supports bone ingrowth. Autologous bone therefore still remains the ""gold standard"" for grafts. Unfortunately, autologous bone grafts are associated with an increased morbidity. In order to avoid such problems, intensive research has been carried out on alternative materials such as allogeneic bone. However, its use is dependent on bone banks and its availability is limited. Gamma irradiation is now becoming established as a procedure for inactivating bacteria, fungal spores and viruses. Its effects on the biomechanical properties of bone have been analyzed in numerous studies. However, the current literature provides little information as to the effects of gamma sterilization on the osteobiology of allogeneic bone grafts., PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of gamma-sterilized bone grafts on immunocompetent cells by an in vitro model (a culture of human bone marrow cells)., METHODS: We decided to use the model of human bone marrow cells in culture for the in vitro analysis because the physiological conditions in the human body can best be simulated in this model and the observed reactions are applicable to humans., RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION: In sum, we found a maximum immune response in gamma-irradiated bone grafts, which, interpreted as a sole result, must be seen as a negative biological effect. However, in view of the good clinical results for gamma-sterilized bone grafts other influences would seem to be the determining factors in clinical outcome. Further research is needed to gain a more exact understanding of these factors.",Included

The aim of this study is to compare prospectively in a single, high-volume center the outcome of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ablation performed specifically by second-generation cryoballoon or contact force radiofrequency ablation., METHODS: Consecutive patients scheduled for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation transcatheter ablation have been included and prospectively followed up. Aiming to reduce potential bias deriving from baseline characteristics, a propensity score matching analysis has been performed to analyze safety and efficacy outcomes., RESULTS: Out of consecutive patients undergoing atrial fibrillation transcatheter ablation between January 2015 and December 2016, 46 patients approached by cryoablation were matched 1 : 1 by propensity score to a similar population treated by last-generation radiofrequency ablation. Freedom from atrial fibrillation after 12 months (76 vs. 78%, P = 0.804) and incidence of complications (4 vs. 6%, P = 0.168) did not differ between the two groups. Radiological exposure was higher for the cryoballoon group (11 vs. 4 min, P < 0.001), whereas procedural duration did not differ (P = 0.174). Aiming to assess the potential impact of a learning curve in patients undergoing cryoablation, the first-third of patients (n = 15) were compared with the remaining, reporting longer radiological exposure (P < 0.001), but similar safety and efficacy., CONCLUSION: In this propensity score analysis, last-generation cryoballoon and radiofrequency catheters for atrial fibrillation ablation present similar efficacy and safety.

Symptoms after drug discontinuation were monitored. Ambulatory 24 h esophageal pH monitoring was performed on patients, whose symptom recurred within 8 weeks after treatment. BMI, Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) were detected., RESULTS: Among the 28 patients with GERD, 15 (53.6%) recurred symptoms after withdraw of PPIs. Compared with the asymptomatic group after withdraw of PPIs, the pretreatment duration of pH 4 (supine), 24 h total acid reflux time, number of time periods with acid reflux > 5 minutes, the maximal acid reflux time and 24 h total number of acid reflux in the symptomatic recurrence group were statistically significantly increased (11.7% vs 4.5%, 138.8 minutes vs 62.1 minutes, 6.0 vs 2.0, 27.0 minutes vs 12.4 minutes, 74.0 times vs 43.0 times, respectively, all P values < 0.05). There were no significant differences in BMI, SAS and SDS between the two groups., CONCLUSIONS: The basic level of esophageal acid exposure of patients with GERD before PPIs therapy may influence the esophageal acid exposure after PPIs therapy and then may affect the recurrence of symptoms. Although anxiety and depression is common in patients with GERD, it is not found that the recurrence of acid-related symptoms after the discontinuation of PPIs therapy is related to the anxiety and depression.",Excluded

2351,"Total effective radiation dose attributable to medical imaging in patients with acute chest pain: A single-center comparison study between dual-source coronary ct angiography and usual care Introduction: Coronary CT angiography (CCTA) can safely disposition low to intermediate risk chest pain (CP); however, there is conflicting data with respect to cumulative radiation exposure when compared with usual care over short follow-up intervals. Objective(s): We report the effective radiation dose from index and downstream testing in low to intermediate risk symptomatic patients evaluated for chest pain in the ED with either CCTA or usual care to define various sources of patient radiation dose and quantify effective dose over a year and a half of follow-up. Patients and Methods: We evaluated radiation exposure from initial and downstream testing in a prospectively collected, matched cohort evaluated for CP in the emergency department (ED) with either CCTA compared with usual care over a median follow-up of 19.6 months. Effective radiation dose was calculated using published conversion factors. Result(s): Prospective, ECG-triggered acquisition using a 128-slice dual-source multidetector computed tomography (DSCT) scanner was performed in 92.9% of scans with a median effective dose from CCTA of 6.8 mSv (IQR 5.2, 9.1 mSv). CCTA cohort patients were more likely to undergo cardiac testing with exposure to radiation (P < 0.001); however, the median effective dose in patients exposed to radiation from cardiac testing was significantly lower in the CCTA cohort (7.1 mSv vs. 11.8 mSv, P < 0.001). Fewer patients in the CCTA cohort had additional non-cardiac thoracic imaging radiation exposure (40.8%) compared with usual care (92.8%). Total radiation exposure from any source was similar between the CCTA and usual care groups (100% vs 98.4%, P = 0.087), as was median total effective radiation dose (P = 0.105). Upfront CCTA was not associated with higher rates of incidental non-cardiac findings. Conclusion(s): Initial evaluation of acute chest pain in the ED with CCTA was not associated with an increase in total radiation exposure over a follow-up period of 19 months. CCTA offers a more comprehensive evaluation of multiple thoracic organ systems leading to reduced radiation exposure from non-cardiac thoracic testing and no increase in incidental imaging findings. This may represent an added benefit in this population of patients presenting acutely.Copyright © 2015, Iranian Society of Echocardiography.",Excluded
1334,"ID: 3522009 NON-RADIATION EUS-BASED ERCP FOR CHOLEDOCHOLITHIASIS Background: ERCP inherently involves ionizing radiation exposure to the patient and operating staff. Non-radiation EUS-based ERCP was developed and previously reported by our group. We assessed the feasibility, safety, and outcomes of non-radiation ERCP in consecutive patients with choledocholithiasis. Method(s): Retrospective review of a prospectively collected database of consecutive patients treated by non-radiation -ERCP over a 33-month period (February 2018 to November 2020). Exclusion criteria: Surgically altered anatomy. Prior to ERCP, EUS with a standard echoendoscope was performed to document the presence, number, and size of stones. The echoendoscope was exchanged for a duodenoscope. Free-hand deep cannulation with an ultra-tapered tip sphincterotome was performed without fluoroscopy. Bile duct access was verified by visible bile aspiration. Aspiration of clear fluid indicated pancreatic duct (PD) cannulation. Precut was performed if the PD was cannulated 3 times. For stone extraction, a sphincterotomy length tailored to stone size was performed using pure cutting current. Stone(s) were removed using a 22mm Dormia basket. Clearance was confirmed by water irrigation method (water ""gush"") with optional cholangioscopy. The number of stones extracted was matched to the number seen on EUS. Result(s): Non-radiation ERCP was performed in 55 consecutive patients (69.10+17.56yrs, 20M:35F) by a single operator (KFB). Bile duct cannulation was successful in all (100%).

2342,"ARFI cut-off values and significance of standard deviation for liver fibrosis staging in patients with chronic liver disease Background. Acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastometry quantifies hepatic stiffness, and thus degree of fibrosis, non-invasively. Our aim was to analyse the diagnostic accuracy of ARFI cut-off values, and the significance of a defined limit of standard deviation (SD) as a potential quality parameter for liver fibrosis staging in patients with chronic liver diseases (CLD). Material and methods. 153 patients with CLD (various aetiologies) undergoing liver biopsy, and an additional 25 patients with known liver cirrhosis, were investigated. ARFI measurements were performed in the right hepatic lobe, and correlated with the histopathological Ludwig fibrosis score (inclusion criteria: at least 6 portal tracts). The diagnostic accuracy of cut-off values was analysed with respect to an SD limit of 30% of the mean ARFI value. Results. The mean ARFI elastometry showed 1.95 +/- 0.87 m/s (range 0.79-4.40) in 178 patients (80 female, 98 male, mean age: 52 years). The cut-offs were 1.25 m/s for F >= 2, 1.72 m/s for F >= 3 and 1.75 m/s for F = 4, and the corresponding AUROC 80.7%, 86.2% and 88.7%, respectively. Exclusion of 31 patients (17.4%) with an SD higher than 30% of the mean ARFI improved the diagnostic accuracy: The AUROC for F >= 2, F >= 3 and F = 4 were 86.1%, 91.2% and 91.5%, respectively. Conclusion. The diagnostic accuracy of ARFI can be improved by applying a maximum SD of 30% of the mean ARFI as a quality parameter - which however leads to an exclusion of a relevant number of patients. ARFI results with a high SD should be interpreted with caution.",Excluded
1696,"Therapeutic applications of PARP inhibitors: Anticancer therapy and beyond The aim of this article is to describe the current and potential clinical translation of pharmacological inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) for the therapy of various diseases. The first section of the present review summarizes the available preclinical and clinical data with PARP inhibitors in various forms of cancer. In this context, the role of PARP in single-strand DNA break repair is relevant, leading to replication-associated lesions that cannot be repaired if homologous recombination repair (HRR) is defective, and the synthetic lethality of PARP inhibitors in HRR-defective cancer. HRR defects are classically associated with BRCA1 and 2 mutations associated with familial breast and ovarian cancer, but there may be many other causes of HRR defects. Thus, PARP inhibitors may be the drugs of choice for BRCA mutant breast and ovarian cancers, and extend beyond these tumors if appropriate biomarkers can be developed to identify HRR defects. Multiple lines of preclinical data demonstrate that PARP inhibition increases cytotoxicity and tumor growth delay in combination with temozolomide, topoisomerase inhibitors and ionizing radiation. Both single agent and combination clinical trials are underway. The final part of the first section of the present review summarizes the current status of the various PARP inhibitors that are in various stages of clinical development. The second section of the present review summarizes the role of PARP in selected non-oncologic indications. In a number of severe, acute diseases (such as stroke, neurotrauma, circulatory shock and acute myocardial infarction) the clinical translatability of PARP inhibition is supported by multiple lines of preclinical data, as well as observational data demonstrating PARP activation in human tissue samples. In these disease indications, PARP overactivation due to oxidative and nitrative stress drives cell necrosis and pro-inflammatory gene expression, which contributes to disease pathology. Accordingly, multiple lines of preclinical data indicate the efficacy of PARP inhibitors to preserve viable tissue and to down-regulate inflammatory responses. As the clinical trials with PARP inhibitors in various forms of cancer progress, it is hoped that a second line of clinical investigations, aimed at testing of PARP inhibitors for various non-oncologic indications, will be initiated, as well. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

2372,"Long-term survival and symptom palliation in small primary bronchial carcinomas following treatment with intraluminal radiotherapy alone Between April 1988 and December 1992, 37 patients with small, previously unirradiated, primary non-small cell carcinomas of the bronchus causing symptoms due to endobronchial disease were treated at the Christie Hospital, Manchester, with a single fraction of high dose rate intraluminal radiotherapy (ILT) using the microSelectron-HDR machine. Small primary (SP) lesions were defined as being less than 2 cm in diameter in a direction perpendicular to the central axis of the iridium-192 treatment source. Fifteen patients (41%) were treated to a dose of 15 Gy and 22 patients (59%) to 20 Gy at a distance of 1 cm from the central axis of the source. At 6 weeks following ILT, improvement in symptoms was seen in the following percentages of patients: haemoptysis 96%, pulmonary collapse 69%, cough 55% and dyspnoea 52%. The magnitude of improvement in these symptoms was largely maintained in patients surviving to 4 months and then 12 months post-ILT. Median actuarial survival was 709 days, 2-year survival 49.4% and 5-year survival 14.1%. Overall, there was no significant difference in survival after treatment with 20 Gy compared with 15 Gy at 1 cm. At the close of study, there were four patients still alive without disease recurrence with survivals of 38, 48, 49 and 63 months. All had had biopsy-proven squamous cell carcinomas and all had been treated with 20 Gy at 1 cm. Five patients died from massive haemoptysis as a terminal event at 4, 9, 9, 10 and 11 months post-ILT, well below the median survival for this group of patients. Again, all had been treated with 20 Gy as opposed to 15 Gy at 1 cm. Over the same time period, 287 patients with non-small cell carcinomas of more than 2 cm in diameter (large primary lesions, LP), were treated with a single fraction of ILT only, as their initial treatment. A consistently greater percentage of patients with SP lesions showed an improvement in the symptoms of haemoptysis and pulmonary collapse when compared with patients with LP lesions. Patients with LP lesions demonstrated a decreased actuarial survival when compared with SP lesions, with median survival being 156 days, 2-year survival 3.1% and no survivors beyond 39 months. This study demonstrates that, in patients with small endobronchial carcinomas a single fraction of ILT can give efficient palliation of symptoms and lead to long term disease-free survival, but that a dose of 20 Gy may be at the limit of bronchial radiation tolerance for a single dose technique employing a high dose rate source.",Excluded
1486,"Risk of cancer after low doses of ionising radiation: retrospective cohort study in 15 countries OBJECTIVES: To provide direct estimates of risk of cancer after protracted low doses of ionising radiation and to strengthen the scientific basis of radiation protection standards for environmental, occupational, and medical diagnostic exposures., DESIGN: Multinational retrospective cohort study of cancer mortality., SETTING: Cohorts of workers in the nuclear industry in 15 countries., PARTICIPANTS: 407 391 workers individually monitored for external radiation with a total follow-up of 5.2 million person years., MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Estimates of excess relative risks per sievert (Sv) of radiation dose for mortality from cancers other than leukaemia and from leukaemia excluding chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, the main causes of death considered by radiation protection authorities., RESULTS: The excess relative risk for cancers other than leukaemia was 0.97 per Sv, 95% confidence interval 0.14 to 1.97. Analyses of causes of death related or unrelated to smoking indicate that, although confounding by smoking may be present, it is unlikely to explain all of this increased risk. The excess relative risk for leukaemia excluding chronic lymphocytic leukaemia was 1.93 per Sv (< 0 to 8.47). On the basis of these estimates, 1-2% of deaths from cancer among workers in this cohort may be attributable to radiation., CONCLUSIONS: These estimates, from the largest study of nuclear workers ever conducted, are higher than, but statistically compatible with, the risk estimates used for current radiation protection standards. The results suggest that there is a small excess risk of cancer, even at the low doses and dose rates typically received by nuclear workers in this study.",Included
2393,"Is it possible to avoid hypopituitarism after the irradiation of pituitary adenomas by the Leksell gamma-knife? Radiation therapy is used in the treatment of pituitary adenomas, especially in failures of neurosurgery and pharmacotherapy to reduce the size of adenomas and normalize their hypersecretion. Conventional fractionated radiotherapy has achieved good results, but only after a long latency, with considerable postradiation morbidity and with very frequent appearance of hypopituitarism. The focal stereotactic targeting allowed by Leksell gamma-knife (LGK) was supposed to decrease the incidence of hypopituitarism, however our first patients treated by LGK developed hypopituitarism in 38.2%. Consequently, we have analyzed factors leading to this unfavorable outcome and suggested that the mean dose of irradiation on pituitary tissue is the most important cause of hypopituitarism. Result(s): Seventy-five patients (47 women and 28 men) with pituitary adenomas (39 with acromegaly, 17 prolactinomas, 8 with Cushing's disease, 1 with Nelson's syndrome and 9 functionless adenomas), where the mean dose of irradiation on pituitary tissue was measured, were followed 60-180 (mean 91.1) months. In 41 patients, the mean dose of irradiation on pituitary was more than 15 Gy. The hypopituitarism at least in one axis developed in 29 (70.7%) patients during 10-126 months after the irradiation. In 34 patients, the mean dose on pituitary was less than 15 Gy. Only one patient (1.2%) developed hypopituitarism 12 months after the irradiation. This patient had undergone two previous pituitary surgeries and had already central hypothyreosis when irradiated. Conclusion(s): To avoid hypopituitarism the radiation dose of 15 Gy is the maximum safe limit of the mean dose of radiation to the pituitary tissue surrounding the adenoma. This cut off should become a rule when irradiating pituitary adenomas - just like the dose rules of 7 Gy on the optical tract or 14 Gy on the brainstem.",Excluded
1434,"Use of handheld X-ray fluorescence as a non-invasive method to distinguish between Asian and African elephant tusks We describe the use of handheld X-ray fluorescence, for elephant tusk species identification. Asian (n=72) and African (n=85) elephant tusks were scanned and we utilized the species differences in elemental composition to develop a functional model differentiating between species with high precision. Spatially, the majority of measured elements (n=26) exhibited a homogeneous distribution in cross-section, but a more heterologous pattern in the longitudinal direction. Twenty-one of twenty four elements differed between Asian and African samples. Data were subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis followed by a stepwise discriminant analysis, which identified elements for the functional equation. The best equation consisted of ratios of Si, S, Cl, Ti, Mn, Ag, Sb and W, with Zr as the denominator. Next, Bayesian binary regression model analysis was conducted to predict the probability that a tusk would be of African origin. A cut-off value was established to improve discrimination. This Bayesian hybrid classification model was then validated by scanning an additional 30 Asian and 41 African tusks, which showed high accuracy (94%) and precision (95%) rates. We conclude that handheld XRF is an accurate, non-invasive method to discriminate origin of elephant tusks provides rapid results applicable to use in the field.",Excluded
1712,"Patterns of diagnostic imaging and associated radiation exposure among long-term survivors of young adult cancer: a population-based cohort study BACKGROUND: Survivors of young adult malignancies are at risk of accumulated exposures to radiation from repetitive diagnostic imaging. We designed a population-based cohort study to describe patterns of diagnostic imaging and cumulative diagnostic radiation exposure among survivors of young adult cancer during a survivorship time period where surveillance imaging is not typically warranted., METHODS: Young adults aged 20-44 diagnosed with invasive malignancy in Ontario from 1992-1999 who lived at least 5 years from diagnosis were identified using the Ontario Cancer Registry and matched 5 to 1 to randomly selected cancer-free persons. We determined receipt of 5 modalities of diagnostic imaging and associated radiation dose received by survivors and controls from years 5-15 after diagnosis or matched referent date through administrative data. Matched pairs were censored six months prior to evidence of recurrence., RESULTS: 20,911 survivors and 104,524 controls had a median of 13.5 years observation. Survivors received all modalities of diagnostic imaging at significantly higher rates than controls. Survivors received CT at a 3.49-fold higher rate (95% Confidence Interval [CI]:3.37, 3.62) than controls in years 5 to 15 after diagnosis. Survivors received a mean radiation dose of 26 miliSieverts solely from diagnostic imaging in the same time period, a 4.57-fold higher dose than matched controls (95% CI: 4.39, 4.81)., CONCLUSIONS: Long-term survivors of young adult cancer have a markedly higher rate of diagnostic imaging over time than matched controls, imaging associated with substantial radiation exposure, during a time period when surveillance is not routinely recommended.",Excluded
2118,"Impact of proton pump inhibitor treatment on gastrointestinal bleeding associated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use among post-myocardial infarction patients taking antithrombotics: Nationwide study Study question What is the effect of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) on the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in post-myocardial infarction patients taking antithrombotics and treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)? Methods This was a nationwide cohort study based on linked administrative registry data from all hospitals in Denmark between 1997 and 2011. The study included patients aged 30 years and over admitted with a first myocardial infarction who survived at least 30 days after discharge. The association between PPIs and risk of gastrointestinal bleeding according to NSAID plus antithrombotic therapy was estimated using adjusted time dependent Cox regression models. Study answer and limitations The use of PPIs was independently associated with decreased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in postmyocardial infarction patients taking antithrombotics and treated with NSAIDs. Of 82 955 post-myocardial infarction patients (mean age 67.4 years, 64% (n=53 070) men), all of whom were taking single or dual antithrombotic therapy, 42.5% (n=35 233) filled at least one prescription for NSAIDs and 45.5% (n=37 771) received PPIs. Over a mean follow-up of 5.1 years, 3229 gastrointestinal bleeds occurred. The crude incidence rates of bleeding (events/100 person years) on NSAID plus antithrombotic therapy were 1.8 for patients taking PPIs and 2.1 for those not taking PPIs. The adjusted risk of bleeding was lower with PPI use (hazard ratio 0.72, 95% confidence interval 0.54 to 0.95) regardless of antithrombotic treatment regimen, type of NSAID, and type of PPI used. The main limitation of the study is its observational nonrandomised design. The results suggest that PPI treatment probably has a beneficial effect regardless of underlying gastrointestinal risk and that when NSAIDs cannot be avoided in post-myocardial infarction patients, physicians might prescribe a PPI as well. The study does not clarify whether PPIs might be safely omitted in specific subgroups of patients with a low risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. What this study adds In post-myocardial infarction patients, bleeding complications have been associated with both antithrombotic and NSAID treatment. Concurrent use of PPIs was independently associated with a decreased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in postmyocardial infarction patients taking antithrombotics and NSAID, regardless of antithrombotic treatment regimen, type of NSAID, and type of PPI used.

Material(s) and Method(s): From 1996 to 2002, 71 patients (pts) with SCACC were treated with PDR brachytherapy. The median age was 61.2 years (35-88), with a sex ratio of 1 M/6.5 F. The TNM classification was: 14 T1, 41 T2, 15 T3 and 1 T4, 52 N0, 13 N1, 3 N2 and 3 N3. All the pts were M0. Treatment started with external beam irradiation to the posterior pelvis (mean dose: 45.5 Gy). Forty-seven patients received chemotherapy (neoadjuvant/concomitant or both). After an interval of 2-6 weeks, PDR interstitial brachytherapy was performed. The mean dose was 17.8 Gy to the 85% reference isodose of the Paris system. Result(s): Treatment was interrupted in only one pt. With a median follow-up of 28.5 months, 2-year actuarial overall survival was 90%. Fourteen relapses occurred (four distant, three regional, and seven local). Ten patients developed a grade III complication (Lent Soma scale) and two a grade IV complication (colostomy or abdominal perineal resection for necrosis).

1801,"Diagnosing fish bone and chicken bone impactions in the emergency department setting: Measuring the system utility of the plain film screen Objectives: In the emergency department, fish and chicken bone impactions are typically evaluated with screening x-rays. We sought to determine whether this modality ultimately improves system outcomes, including length of stay (LOS), cost, and radiation dosage. Method(s): We reviewed patients >=18 years old presenting to an urban academic emergency department over a 4-year period who received a screening soft-tissue x-ray to determine the presence of a retained fish or chicken bone. We calculated the diagnostic accuracy of x-ray and computed tomography (CT) evaluations, respectively, in addition to system outcomes. Result(s): Twenty-seven of the 78 patients included for analysis were ultimately positive for bone impaction. Initial x-ray interpretations demonstrated a sensitivity of 24.0% (95% CI, 9.4%-45.1%) and a specificity of 90.0% (95% CI, 78.2%-96.7%). However, initial CT interpretation (ie, a preliminary read from on-call residents) demonstrated a sensitivity of 75% (95% CI, 19.4%-99.4%) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI, 59.0%-100%). LOS, cost, and radiation dosage were not significantly different between patients who ultimately had true bone impactions and those who did not (P > .05). Conclusion(s): X-rays are poor screening tools in determining fish or chicken bone impactions with poor diagnostic and system utility. Further studies should be performed to evaluate the role of a low-radiation CT screen.Copyright © The Author(s) 2015.",Excluded
1859,"Lifelong hematopoiesis in both reconstituted and sublethally irradiated mice is provided by multiple sequentially recruited stem cells Objective. To evaluate the dynamics of stem cell production to hematopoiesis, the number of active stem cell clones and the lifespan of individual clones were studied. Materials and Methods. The clonal contribution of primitive hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) responsible for long-term hematopoiesis was determined using two approaches. In one model, irradiated female mice were reconstituted with retrovirally marked male hematopoietic cells. In the second model, mice were irradiated sublethally without hematopoietic cell transplantation. In both models, bone marrow cells were serially sampled from the same mouse throughout a 12- to 20-month period and injected into irradiated recipients for analysis of day 10 colony-forming unit-spleen (CFU-S). The donor origin of CFU-S was determined by the presence of retrovirally marked cells or cells with chromosomal aberrations. Results. The results of the two essentially different models show that 1) hematopoiesis is mainly the product of small clones of hematopoietic cells; 2) the lifespan of the majority of clones is only 1 to 2 months; 3) the clones usually function locally; and 4) the vast majority of the clones replace one another sequentially. Primitive HSCs capable of producing long-lived clones (about 10% among all clones), which exist during the entire life of a mouse, were detected by the radiation-marker technique only. Conclusion. Multiple short-living clones (at least on the level of CFU-S production) comprise the vast majority of the active stem cells in transplanted recipients or after endogenous recovery from sublethal irradiation. © 2001 International Society for Experimental Hematology.",Excluded
1698,"Dynamic CT for Parathyroid Adenoma Detection: How Does Radiation Dose Compare With Nuclear Medicine? OBJECTIVE: Dynamic CT is increasingly used for preoperative localization of parathyroid adenomas, but concerns remain about the radiation effective dose of CT compared with that of 99mTc-sestamibi scintigraphy. The purpose of this study was to compare the radiation dose delivered by three-phase dynamic CT with that delivered by 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT performed in accordance with our current protocols and to assess the possible reduction in effective dose achieved by decreasing the scan length (i.e., z-axis) of two phases of the dynamic CT protocol., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effective dose of a 99mTc-sestamibi nuclear medicine parathyroid study performed with and without coregistration CT was calculated and compared with the effective dose of our current three-phase dynamic CT protocol as well as a proposed protocol involving CT with reduced scan length., RESULTS: The median effective dose for a 99mTc-sestamibi nuclear medicine study was 5.6 mSv. This increased to 12.4 mSv with the addition of coregistration CT, which is higher than the median effective dose of 9.3 mSv associated with the dynamic CT protocol. Reducing the scan length of two phases in the dynamic CT protocol could reduce the median effective dose to 6.1 mSv, which would be similar to that of the dose from the 99mTc-sestamibi study alone., CONCLUSION: Dynamic CT used for the detection of parathyroid adenoma can deliver a lower radiation dose than 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT. It may be possible to reduce the dose further by decreasing the scan length of two of the phases, although whether this has an impact on accuracy of the localization needs further investigation.",Excluded
1252,"Late radiation-associated dysphagia (late-RAD) with lower cranial neuropathy after oropharyngeal radiotherapy: A preliminary dosimetric comparison Background and objectives Late radiation-associated dysphagia (late-RAD) is a rare delayed toxicity, in oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) survivors. Prevention of late-RAD is paramount because the functional impairment can be profound and refractory to standard therapies. The objective of this analysis is to identify candidate dosimetric predictors of late-RAD and associated lower cranial neuropathies after radiotherapy (RT) or chemo-RT (CRT) for OPC. Materials and methods An unmatched retrospective case-control analysis was conducted. Late-RAD cases were identified among OPC patients treated with definitive RT or CRT. Controls were selected with minimum of 6 years without symptoms of late-RAD. Dysphagia-aspiration related structures (DARS) and regions of interest containing cranial nerve paths (RCCNPs) were retrospectively contoured. Dose volume histograms were calculated. Non-parametric bivariate associations were analyzed with Bonferroni correction and multiple logistic regression models were fit. Results Thirty-eight patients were included (12 late-RAD cases, 26 controls). Median latency to late-RAD was 5.8 years (range: 4.5-11.3 years). Lower cranial neuropathies were present in 10 of 12 late-RAD cases. Mean superior pharyngeal constrictor (SPC) dose was higher in cases relative to controls (median: 70.5 vs. 61.6 Gy). Mean SPC dose significantly predicted late-RAD (p = 0.036) and related cranial neuropathies (p = 0.019). RCCNPs did not significantly predict late-RAD or cranial neuropathies. Conclusions SPC dose may predict for late-RAD and related lower cranial neuropathies. These data, and those of previous studies that have associated SPC dose with classical dysphagia endpoints, suggest impetus to constrain dose to the SPCs when possible. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

2107,"Biodistribution and Radiation Dosimetry of 124I-DPA-713, a PET Radiotracer for Macrophage-Associated Inflammation Whole-body PET/CT was performed using 124I-DPA-713, a radioligand for the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO), to determine biodistribution and radiation dosimetry. Methods: Healthy subjects aged 18-65 y underwent whole-body PET/CT either at 4, 24, and 48 h or at 24, 48, and 72 h after intravenous injection of 124I-DPA-713. Time-activity curves were generated and used to calculate organ time-integrated activity coefficients for each subject. The resulting time-integrated activity coefficients provided input data for calculation of organ absorbed doses and effective dose for each subject using OLINDA. Subjects were genotyped for the TSPO polymorphism rs6971, and plasma protein binding of 124I-DPA-713 was measured. Results: Three male and 3 female adults with a mean age of 40 +/- 19 y were imaged. The mean administered activity and mass were 70.5 +/- 5.1 MBq (range, 62.4-78.1 MBq) and 469 +/- 34 ng (range, 416-520 ng), respectively. There were no adverse or clinically detectable pharmacologic effects in any of the 6 subjects. No changes in vital signs, laboratory values, or electrocardiograms were observed. 124I-DPA-713 cleared rapidly (4 h after injection) from the lungs, with hepatic elimination and localization to the gastrointestinal tract. The mean effective dose over the 6 subjects was 0.459 +/- 0.127 mSv/MBq, with the liver being the dose-limiting organ (0.924 +/- 0.501 mGy/MBq). The percentage of free radiotracer in blood was approximately 30% at 30 and 60 min after injection. Conclusion: 124I-DPA-713 clears rapidly from the lungs, with predominantly hepatic elimination, and is safe and well tolerated in healthy adults.

1410,"Lumbar disc geometry affects the risk for rod fracture in adult spinal deformity (ASD) surgery BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Rod fracture (RF) has significant consequences for patients, including pain, loss of correction, and revision surgery. Risk factors associated with RF include previous spine surgery, insufficient sagittal vertical axis (SVA) correction and pedicle subtraction osteotomy (PSO). Increased lumbar disc geometry, regardless of PSO, SVA or previous surgery, may be a risk factor affecting RF rates. PURPOSE: To evaluate if larger disc geometry affects rod stresses adjacent to the PSO or apical lumbar vertebra increasing the risk of rod fracture. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Single center retrospective review. PATIENT SAMPLE: Thirty-nine patients with ASD who underwent open posterior fusion constructs crossing the T/L junction and pelvis with scoliosis x-rays and 2-year follow-up. OUTCOME MEASURES: Rod fracture complication; lumbar disc height, diameter, and volume. METHOD(S): All patients with ASD having open posterior fusion constructs crossing the T/L junction and pelvis with scoliosis x-rays and 2-year follow-up were included. Patients were divided into 2 Groups: Group 1-patients with RF; Group 2-No RF. RESULT(S): Thirty-nine of 52 patients met inclusion criteria. Group 1-included 15/39 (38%) patients with RF all requiring revision surgery. Group 2-included 24 (62%) patients without RF. There was no difference in age, construct length, number of nonfused lumbar discs, previous spinal surgery, pre- or postoperative SVA or PSOs between the Groups (Table 1). Vertical stature and male gender were significantly higher in the RF Group. There were significant differences between the RF vs No RF Groups in L1/2 disc heights (H) (8.5 vs 6.5 mm, p=.03), L2/3 H (9.6 vs 6.7 mm, p=.015); L1/2 diameters (D) (41.4 vs 34 mm, p<.01), L2/3 D (43.2 vs 36.2 mm, p=.01); and L1/2 volumes (V) (11714 vs 7817 mm3, p=.02), L2/3 V (14025 vs 8955 mm3, p=.02), respectively. L3/4 and L4/5 disc geometry was larger in the RF Group but did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION(S): The overall prevalence of RF was 38% with no differences in previous spinal surgery, SVA, or PSOs between the 2 Groups.Vertical stature and male gender were significantly higher in the RF Group. Patients with RF had significantly larger nonfused disc heights, diameters, and volumes adjacent to the PSO or apical lumbar vertebra. Increased disc geometrics may allow for increased micro-motion and increased rod stresses and rates of RF.",Excluded
1240,"Characterization of neurons of the nucleus tractus solitarius pars centralis Esophageal sensory afferent inputs terminate principally in the central subnucleus of the tractus solitarius (cNTS). Neurons of the cNTS comprise two major neurochemical subpopulations. One contains neurons that are nitric oxide synthase (NOS) immunoreactive (-IR) while the other comprises neurons that are tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-IR. We have shown recently that TH-IR neurons are involved in esophageal-distention induced gastric relaxation. We used whole cell patch clamp techniques in rat brainstem slices combined with immunohistochemical and morphological reconstructions to characterize cNTS neurons. Postrecording reconstruction of cNTS neurons revealed two morphological neuronal subtypes; one group of cells (41 out of 131 neurons, i.e., 31%) had a multipolar soma, while the other group (87 out of 131 neurons, i.e., 66%) had a bipolar soma. Of the 43 cells in which we conducted a neurochemical examination, 15 displayed TH-IR (9 with bipolar morphology, 6 with multipolar morphology) while the remaining 28 neurons did not display TH-IR (18 with bipolar morphology, 10 with multipolar morphology). Even though the range of electrophysiological properties varied significantly, morphological or neurochemical distinctions did not reveal characteristics peculiar to the subgroups. Spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSC) recorded in cNTS neurons had a frequency of 1.5 +/- 0.15 events s(-1) and an amplitude of 27 +/- 1.2 pA (Vh = -50 mV) and were abolished by pretreatment with 30 muM AP-5 and 10 muM CNQX, indicating the involvement of both NMDA and non-NMDA receptors. Some cNTS neurons also received a GABAergic input that was abolished by perfusion with 30-50 muM bicuculline. In conclusion, our data show that despite the heterogeneity of morphological and neurochemical membrane properties, the electrophysiological characteristics of cNTS neurons are not a distinguishing feature.",Excluded
1961,"An exploratory analysis of public awareness and perception of ionizing radiation and guide to public health practice in Vermont Exposure to ionizing radiation has potential for acute and chronic health effects. Within the general public of the United States, there may be a discrepancy between perceived and actual health risks. In conjunction with the Vermont Department of Health, a survey designed to assess public perception and knowledge of ionizing radiation was administered at 6 Vermont locations (n = 169). Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were conducted. Eighty percent of respondents underestimated the contribution of medical imaging tests to total ionizing radiation exposure. Although only thirty-nine percent of participants were confdent in their healthcare professional's knowledge of ionizing radiation, most would preffer to receive information from their healthcare professional. Only one-third of individuals who received a medical imaging test in the past year were educated by their healthcare professional about the risks of these tests. Tose who tested their home for radon were twice as likely to choose radon as the greatest ionizing radiation risk to self. Although respondents had an above-average education level, there were many misperceptions of actual risks of exposure to ionizing radiation, particularly of medical imaging tests. Educating healthcare professionals would therefore have a profound and positive impact on public understanding of ionizing radiation.Copyright © 2015 Katherine M. Evans et al.",Excluded
2448,"Extensive experience in the management of macroprolactinomas Objectives Macroprolactinomas are pituitary tumours that can be managed with dopamine agonists (DA), surgery and radiotherapy. We aimed to assess the outcomes of these treatment modalities. Design Retrospective case-note study of patients managed in a single tertiary referral centre. Patients One hundred patients (68 male) diagnosed with macroprolactinoma between 1971 and 2009. Measurements We assessed the response to first-line treatment in terms of reduction in serum prolactin, endocrine status, symptomatic improvement and tumour shrinkage. Patients were divided into a group that received only DA therapy and a group that received surgery, radiotherapy or both, with or without a DA. We compared pituitary function at baseline and at last clinic visit between the two groups. Results In total, there were 1170 patient years of follow-up. Pituitary surgery was performed in 29/100 patients. Fourteen patients received pituitary radiotherapy (8/14 surgery also). At last clinic visit, the nonmedical therapy group had a higher risk of gonadotrophin deficiency (77.4% vs 44.8%, P = 0.0037), TSH deficiency (54.8% vs 25.4%, P = 0.0009) and ACTH deficiency (56.2% vs 17.2%, P = 0.0001). When last reviewed, 23/29 (79.3%) patients who underwent surgery and 10/14 (71.4%) patients who received radiotherapy were taking a DA. Conclusions Treatment with a DA alone is associated with better outcomes in terms of pituitary function and as such represents the optimal first-line therapy for macroprolactinomas. Surgery and radiotherapy should be reserved for patients who are either intolerant of or resistant to DAs. Following surgery and/or radiotherapy, the majority of patients still require a DA for control of prolactin hypersecretion. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Excluded
2455,"Association of radiation risk in the second and third generations with polymorphisms in the genes CYP1A1, CYP2E1, GSTP1 and changes in the thyroid Background: To study the association of radiation risk in the 2nd-3rd generations with polymorphisms in the genes CYP1A1, CYP2E1, GSTP1 and changes in the thyroid. Method(s): 5 polymorphic gene variants (rs1048943, rs4646421, rs2070676, rs3813867, rs1695) were studied in 399 people living in the East Kazakhstan region in this research. 248 people of the 2nd-3rd generation lived in the territory with radiation exposure in Abai, Borodulikha areas, and 151 people the comparison group lived in Kurchum district without radiation exposure comparable in sex and age with control group. Result(s): The results show that there is a significant association of rs1048943 in exposed and unexposed groups (p < 0.003), and the absence of association of rs4646421, rs2070676, rs3813867, rs1695 in the studied groups. The mean value of thyroxine in carriers of the AG + GG genotype of rs4646421 is significantly lower than in AA genotype carriers (p = 0.04); no significant changes were found in genotypes' distribution with thyroid-stimulating hormone and anti-thyroid peroxidase indicators. Significant changes were in levels of anti-thyroid peroxidase between exposed and unexposed groups (p = 0.007). The thyroxine-thyroid-stimulating hormone levels were not significantly different in exposed and unexposed groups (p > 0.3).

2391,"Innate immune responses of Drosophila melanogaster are altered by spaceflight Alterations and impairment of immune responses in humans present a health risk for space exploration missions. The molecular mechanisms underpinning innate immune defense can be confounded by the complexity of the acquired immune system of humans. Drosophila (fruit fly) innate immunity is simpler, and shares many similarities with human innate immunity at the level of molecular and genetic pathways. The goals of this study were to elucidate fundamental immune processes in Drosophila affected by spaceflight and to measure host-pathogen responses post-flight. Five containers, each containing ten female and five male fruit flies, were housed and bred on the space shuttle (average orbit altitude of 330.35 km) for 12 days and 18.5 hours. A new generation of flies was reared in microgravity. In larvae, the immune system was examined by analyzing plasmatocyte number and activity in culture. In adults, the induced immune responses were analyzed by bacterial clearance and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of selected genes following infection with E. coli. The RNA levels of relevant immune pathway genes were determined in both larvae and adults by microarray analysis. The ability of larval plasmatocytes to phagocytose E. coli in culture was attenuated following spaceflight, and in parallel, the expression of genes involved in cell maturation was downregulated. In addition, the level of constitutive expression of pattern recognition receptors and opsonins that specifically recognize bacteria, and of lysozymes, antimicrobial peptide (AMP) pathway and immune stress genes, hallmarks of humoral immunity, were also reduced in larvae. In adults, the efficiency of bacterial clearance measured in vivo following a systemic infection with E. coli post-flight, remained robust. We show that spaceflight altered both cellular and humoral immune responses in Drosophila and that the disruption occurs at multiple interacting pathways.",Excluded
2002,"Somatic (craniocervical) tinnitus and the dorsal cochlear nucleus hypothesis Purpose: Of all nonauditory sensory systems, only the somatosensory system seems to be related to tinnitus (eg, temporomandibular joint syndrome and whiplash). The purpose of this study is to describe the distinguishing characteristics of tinnitus associated with somatic events and to use these characteristics to develop a neurological model of somatic tinnitus. Material(s) and Method(s): Case series. Result(s): Some patients with tinnitus, but no other hearing complaints, share several clinical features including (1) an associated somatic disorder of the head or upper neck, (2) localization of the tinnitus to the ear ipsilateral to the somatic disorder, (3) no vestibular complaints, and (4) no abnormalities on neurological examination. Pure tone and speech audiometry of the 2 ears is always symmetric and usually within normal limits. Based on these clinical features, it is proposed that somatic (craniocervical) tinnitus, like otic tinnitus, is caused by disinhibition of the ipsilateral dorsal cochlear nucleus. Nerve fibers whose cell bodies lie in the ipsilateral medullary somatosensory nuclei mediate this effect. These neurons receive inputs from nearby spinal trigeminal tract, fasciculus cuneatus, and facial, vagal, and glossopharyngeal nerve fibers innervating the middle and external ear. Conclusion(s): Somatic (craniocervical) modulation of the dorsal cochlear nucleus may account for many previously poorly understood aspects of tinnitus and suggests novel tinnitus treatments.",Excluded

1952,"Hemoglobin levels and acute radiotherapy-induced toxicity AIMS AND BACKGROUND: To analyze the possible correlation between hemoglobin concentration and the appearance of acute radiotherapy-induced toxicity., METHODS: We prospectively studied hemoglobin levels and acute radiotherapy-induced toxicity in 86 patients treated for 3 months. Both sexes were considered to have anemia if their hemoglobin level was < or = 12 g/dL. No patient received corrective treatment for hemoglobin levels. Acute toxicity was analyzed weekly during radiotherapy and 45 days after therapy ended. The possible relationship between anemia and toxicity was analyzed, as was the correlation between hemoglobin values and the degree of toxicity., RESULTS: The findings were similar for all prognostic factors in patients with and without anemia. Hemoglobin concentration was < or = 12 g/dL in 24 patients (27.9%; mean, 10.93 +/- 0.78 g/dL). At the end of radiotherapy, hemoglobin levels were < or = 12 g/dL in 18 patients (20.9%; mean, 11.26 +/- 1.06 g/dL). The correlation between pretherapy and posttherapy hemoglobin concentration was significant at r = 0.729 (P = 0.01). The correlation between absolute hemoglobin values and the degree of toxicity, and the possible relationship between hemoglobin concentration and the appearance or the degree of toxicity after radiotherapy, was not significant., CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between hemoglobin concentration and oxygenation of the tumor and healthy tissues was not linear. This may account for the influence of hemoglobin levels on control of the disease as reported in earlier studies, but it does not account for their influence on acute toxicity after radiotherapy.",Excluded
2318,"The epidemiology of vitamin D and colorectal cancer: recent findings PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To highlight the human studies published over the past year examining the influence of vitamin D on risk of colorectal cancer., RECENT FINDINGS: Studies over the past year have added more support to the idea that higher levels of vitamin D may decrease risk of colorectal cancer. Further, typical dietary intakes such as 200-400 IU/day may be too low to exert appreciable benefits, and protection may occur with higher levels of vitamin D associated with exposure to sunshine. Recent studies also suggest a potential benefit of vitamin D on other digestive-tract cancers, and that vitamin D status at the time of diagnosis and treatment may influence survival of cancer. However, the evidence for these latter findings is based on limited data and needs to be confirmed. Higher vitamin D levels may also be associated with a higher rate of apoptosis in colorectal mucosa., SUMMARY: Recent studies add more support to a potential role of vitamin D on risk of colorectal cancer, but suggest that intakes higher than customary are required if solar ultraviolet-B exposure is low. More studies are required to determine the optimal levels and intakes of this vitamin to reduce cancer risk. Potential benefits of vitamin D on other digestive-tract cancers and on survival in patients with colorectal cancer have been suggested by recent studies, but require confirmation.",Excluded

Methods In accordance with the RTOG scoring criteria, ninety-two patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy were evaluated for acute ROM which was defined as severe when the score >=3. Patients' medical records and dosimetric data exported from IMRT plan enable the authors to perform a statistical analysis for the parameters as potential predictors of severe ROM. Results Body weight loss and V30 Gy (p = 0.017 and 0.003, respectively) are related factors to severe ROM. As the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve shows, the threshold value of V30 for severe ROM was 73.155% (sensitivity, 0.842; specificity, 0.671), and the area under V30 Gy curves was 0.753 (p = 0.001).

Material(s) and Method(s): Between July 1996 and June 2010, 104 patients underwent surgery for rectal cancer after preoperative CRT. The median dose of radiotherapy was 50.4 Gy (range, 43.2 to 54.4 Gy) for 6 weeks. Chemotherapy was a bolus injection of 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin for the first and last week of radiotherapy (n=84, 77.1%) or capecitabine administered daily during radiotherapy (n=17, 16.3%). Low anterior resection (n=86, 82.7%) or abdominoperineal resection (n=18, 17.3%) was performed at a median 47 days from the end of radiotherapy, and four cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy was administered. The serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level was checked at initial diagnosis and just before surgery. Result(s): After a median follow-up of 48 months (range, 9 to 174 months), 5-year disease free survival (DFS) was 74.5% and 5-year overall survival (OS) was 86.4%. Down staging of T diagnoses occurred in 32 patients (30.8%) and of N diagnoses in 40 patients (38.5%). The CEA change from initial diagnosis to pre-surgery (high-high vs. highnormal vs. normal-normal) was a statistically significant prognostic factor for DFS (p=0.012), OS (p=0.002), and distant metastasis free survival (p=0.018) in a multivariate analysis. Conclusion(s): Patients who achieve normal CEA level by the time of surgery have a more favorable outcome than those who retain a high CEA level after preoperative CRT. The normalization of CEA levels can provide important information about the prognosis in rectal cancer treatment. © 2013 by the Korean Cancer Association.",Excluded

Design Retrospective analysis of electronic patient records. Setting Tertiary academic health science centre and designated centre for high consequence infectious diseases in London, UK. Participants 1198 patients who attended the emergency department with paired reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) swabs for SARS-CoV-2 and CXR between 16 March and 16 April 2020. Main outcome measures Sensitivity and specificity of CXR and CT for diagnosis of COVID-19 using the British Society of Thoracic Imaging reporting templates. Reference standard was any RT-PCR positive naso-oropharyngeal swab within 30 days of attendance. ORs of CXR in association with vital signs, laboratory values and 30-day outcomes were calculated. Results Sensitivity and specificity of CXR for COVID-19 diagnosis were 0.56 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.60) and 0.60 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.65), respectively. For CT scans, these were 0.85 (95% CI 0.79 to 0.90) and 0.50 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.60), respectively. This gave a statistically significant mean increase in sensitivity with CT of 29% (95% CI 19% to 38%, p<0.0001) compared with CXR. Specificity was not significantly different between the two modalities. CXR findings were not statistically significantly or clinically meaningfully associated with vital signs, laboratory parameters or 30-day outcomes. Conclusions CT has substantially improved diagnostic performance over CXR in COVID-19. CT should be strongly considered in the initial assessment for suspected COVID-19. This gives potential for increased sensitivity and considerably faster turnaround time, where capacity allows and balanced against excess radiation exposure risk.Copyright ©",Excluded

Thyroid function tests were performed before and 72 hours after rhTSH administration. Both 4-hour and 24-hour RAIU studies were done after rhTSH administration and repeated at 48 to 52 hours and at 72 hours, respectively. Then all patients were treated with 30 mCi of 131 I., RESULTS: All study patients experienced symptomatic relief by 1 to 2 months. In addition to the previously reported twofold increase over the baseline RAIU at 24 hours, we found that a second 24-hour RAIU showed a further twofold increase (quadrupling of the RAIU over baseline) at 72 hours after administration of 0.1 mg of rhTSH (from 22% to 43%; P<0.001) and 0.3 mg of rhTSH (from 16% to 37%; P = 0.002), with no significant difference between doses on the RAIU at 24 hours or at 72 hours. Additionally, the RAIU value at 4 hours and 52 hours after administration of 0.1 mg and 0.3 mg of rhTSH revealed a fourfold increase for each dose--from 7% to 28% (P<0.001) and from 5% to 21% (P = 0.002), respectively., CONCLUSION: In patients with symptomatic toxic or nontoxic multinodular goiter, 0.1 mg and 0.3 mg of rhTSH were equally efficacious at inducing a quadrupling of the low or low-normal baseline RAIU values at 72 hours after injection. Subsequent radioiodine therapy alleviated compressive and thyrotoxic symptoms in all 30 treated patients. Future studies should help determine doses of rhTSH and radioiodine therapy that are optimal in iodine-sufficient and insufficient regions of the world.",Excluded

Method(s): Pre-operative MRI reports of 144 glioma patients in a single institution were collected retrospectively. Words were transformed to lowercase letters. White spaces, punctuations, and stop words were removed. Stemming was performed. A word cloud method applied to processed text matrix visualized language behavior. Spearman's rank correlation assessed the correlation between the subjective descriptions of the enhancement pattern. The T1-contrast images associated with enhancement descriptions were selected. The keywords associated with IDH status were evaluated by chi2 value ranking. Random forest, k-nearest neighbors and Support Vector Machine algorithms were used to train models based on report features and age. All statistical analysis used two-tailed test with significance at p <.05. Result(s): Longer word counts occurred in reports of older patients, higher grade gliomas, and wild type IDH gliomas. We identified 30 glioma enhancement descriptions, eight of which were commonly used: peripheral, heterogeneous, irregular, nodular, thick, rim, large, and ring. Five of eight patterns were correlated. IDH mutant tumors were characterized by words related to normal, symmetric or negative findings. IDH wild type tumors were characterized words by related to pathological MR findings like enhancement, necrosis and FLAIR foci. An integrated KNN model based on report features and age demonstrated high-performance (AUC: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.88-0.90). Conclusion(s): Report length depended on age, glioma grade, and IDH status. Description of glioma enhancement was varied. Report descriptions differed for IDH wild and mutant gliomas.

The Spanish translation was carried out following international guidelines for the process of cross-cultural adaptation of self-report measures. A cross-sectional design study was carried out. One hundred and thirty-eight nurses from four different hospitals in Barcelona (Spain) completed the Spanish version of the scale. The total score of the scale was calculated. The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) was used to evaluate a possible correlation between score and years of experience. A t-test for independent samples was used to evaluate significant differences between different groups. Cronbach's alpha, the corrected item-total correlation coefficient and the test-retest coefficient were used to determine internal consistency. The exploratory factor and parallel analysis were also calculated. All statistical tests were carried out with a level of significance alpha = 0.05.

2095,"Comparative evaluation of radiation therapy techniques for mediastinum irradiation in lymphoma patients using IMRT, B-VMAT, 3DCRT Introduction: Radiation therapy is effective in treating mediastinal lymphomas, but the question of its long-term radiation effects, such as induced breast cancer, lung cancer, and heart disease, has been increasingly raised in recent years. The aim of our work was to compare the radiation doses that receive heart, lungs, and mammary glands (MG) during irradiation of mediastinal lymphomas by 3 different techniques: IMRT, B-VMAT, 3DCRT. Method(s): A radiation therapy plan was calculated for each of the indicated techniques for 7 mediastinal lymphoma patients. Photon energy: 6 MV, target dose: 30 Gy/15 fractions, planned target volume (PTV) coverage: 98% PTV covered by at least 95% isodose. IMRT and B-VMAT plans were calculated by inverse planning, and 3DCRT by direct planning using the Monte Carlo algorithm. Each IMRT plan consists of 7 coplanar fields almost equally spaced around a patient, using the ability not to pass through MG. B-VMAT plan is a composition of 3 non-coplanar VMAT arcs, couch 0degree G330degree/G30degree, couch 0degree G150degree/G180degree+G181degree/G210degree and couch 270degree G330degree/G30degree. 3DCRT plan is a couple of AP-PA fields with an addition of small portion of posterior oblique fields that lead to maximum dose outside PTV avoidance without adding any significant dose to lungs. An extra sub-volume ""heart inside PTV"" was created for inverse optimization in order to keep its dose theraputical and avoid any possible maximum inside the heart. Result(s): With a probability of p < 0.05, the following parameters were estimated. Average volumes of PTV (620 +/- 170) cc, MG (710 +/- 660) cc, total lung (2950+/-420) cc and heart (590 +/- 90) cc. Dose-Volume relations are given in following table Conclusion(s): With the stated above PTV coverage, the IMRT technique can significantly increase the conformity index of the plan and lead to the lowest dose to the heart in all studied parameters, but showed the highest dose to the lungs-both mean dose and V20. The B-VMAT technique can significantly reduce V4 MG while maintaining minimum V25 heart and V20 lungs. At the same time, despite the low mean dose to the heart-inside-PTV, the mean dose to the whole heart with this technique is higher compared to the IMRT technique due to the increase in V5 heart. The standard 3DCRT technique achieves the lowest average dose to the lungs, but has not shown any advantages in the rest of considered critical organs. The scatter of the data is due to the large variability of the physiological parameters of the patients, in order to specify the obtained data the study is proceeded. .",Excluded
1507,"DNA Damage Baseline Predicts Resilience to Space Radiation and Radiotherapy Deep space exploration will require real-time, minimally invasive monitoring of astronaut health to mitigate the potential health impairments caused by space radiation and microgravity. Genotoxic stress in humans can be monitored by quantifying the amount of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in immune cells from a simple finger prick. In a cohort of 674 healthy donors, we show that the endogenous level of DSBs increases with age and with latent cytomegalovirus infection. To map the range of human responses to space radiation, we then study DSB induction and repair in immune cells from 319 healthy donors after the cells are exposed to galactic cosmic ray components and lymphocytes from 30 cancer patients after radiotherapy. Individuals with low baseline DSB have fewer clinical complications, enhanced DNA damage repair responses, and a functional dose-dependent cytokine response in healthy donor cells. This supports the use of DSB monitoring for health resilience in space., Pariset et al. find that individuals with a lower baseline level of DNA damage are resilient to clinical complications after radiotherapy and present higher radiation-induced levels of DNA repair foci and inflammatory cytokines. These findings support the use of baseline DNA damage as a biomarker for radiation sensitivity.Copyright © 2020",Included
1826,"Inter- and Intraobserver Agreement in Measuring Urolithiasis Density on Nonenhanced Computed Tomography Introduction: Treatment choice for urolithiasis is partially based on measuring stone density in HU on nonenhanced computed tomography (NECT). Interobserver variability in these measurements could have treatment consequences. This study aims to assess the observer agreement of measuring HU and whether the use of a protocol leads to a better agreement. Material(s) and Method(s): We retrospectively included 155 consecutive NECTs of patients with stones >=4 mm. Five observers (two radiologists, one urologist, one urology resident, and one radiology resident) assessed all anonymized NECTs four times in randomized order. HU was measured without instruction (rounds 1 and 2) and subsequently using two protocols (A and B, rounds 3 and 4). Protocols comprised using bone setting, zoom, and measuring HU without the penumbra, in either three (A) or one (B) axial plane. The inter- and intraobserver agreement was evaluated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Result(s): Interobserver agreement on HU measurement without protocol was as follows: ICC = 0.84 (confidence interval [CI]: 0.79-0.87). Agreement diminished with protocol A, ICC = 0.62 (CI: 0.37-0.76), and improved with protocol B, ICC = 0.90 (CI: 0.86-0.92). Intraobserver agreement without protocol was ICC = 0.87, with protocol A, ICC = 0.87, and with protocol B, ICC = 0.93. The biggest improvement was seen for urologists' agreement from no protocol to protocol B, where ICC improved from 0.81 (CI: 0.70-0.87) to 0.91 (CI: 0.84-0.94). Conclusion(s): Observer agreement of HU measurement of urolithiasis without protocol is already good but using zoom, bone setting, and measuring in a representative plane is recommended. This protocol results in higher agreement, especially among urologists. Measuring in three axial planes does not increase agreement.Copyright © 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.",Excluded

Result(s): Thirteen patients were enrolled with a median age of 66 years. All patients completed treatment. Seven (54%) experienced grade 3+ treatment-related AEs. Severe gastric ulceration occurred in 2 patients despite receipt of >=43 Gy to only 1% (2-3 cm3) of the stomach. Lymphopenia (n = 7) was the only other severe AE that occurred in >1 patient. In 7 of the 13 patients, disease had progressed outside the pancreas at restaging. Five of the 13 underwent resection, and all had >10% viable tumor. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.4 months (95% CI 1.9-5.9), and median survival was 9.1 months (95% CI 5.9-not reached). Among those who underwent resection, median PFS was 13.0 months (95% CI 4.4-not reached). Median survival was not reached. Conclusion(s): Given the limited efficacy signal and severe gastric ulcerations, we do not recommend this regimen for pancreatic cancer. We also do not recommend the use of high doses per fraction outside a clinical trial. © 2014 by International Society of Gastrointestinal Oncology.",Excluded
2194,"Efficacy of bortezomib in non-IgM type I cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis: a single-centre retrospective case series Introduction: Treatment of non-IgM type I cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis (CV) is challenging. Corticosteroids are first-line therapy, but relapses are frequent leading to therapeutic escalation. Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor with rapid effect on monoclonal component. However, its use in non-IgM type I CV has been barely reported. Objective(s): To assess the efficacy of bortezomib in non-IgM type I CV. Method(s): Single-centre case series of four patients with non-IgM type I CV treated with bortezomib monotherapy. Result(s): Two men and two women, 60-84 years old, received bortezomib monotherapy. Monoclonal component was IgG-lambda (n = 2), IgA-lambda and IgG-kappa. Clinical features were necrotic rash (n = 3), synovitis (n = 3) and sensitive neuropathy (n = 2). CV was refractory to corticosteroids (n = 4), cyclophosphamide (n = 3) and rituximab (n = 2). Three patients experienced dramatic clinical improvement with undetectable cryoglobulin after three cycles (bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 weekly). Each patient relapsed 4-18 months after treatment discontinuation. Bortezomib was unsuccessful after four cycles in one patient. Bortezomib toxicity included one pneumonia and 1 case of worsening neuropathic pain. Conclusion(s): Bortezomib in monotherapy should be considered as a valuable option in refractory non-IgM type I CV because of its swift efficacy and acceptable tolerance profile.Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

2067,"Neurosurgery and prognosis in patients with radiation-induced brain injury after nasopharyngeal carcinoma radiotherapy: A follow-up study Background: Radiotherapy is the standard radical treatment for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and may cause radiation-induced brain injury (RI). Treatment for RI remains a challenge. We conducted this study to investigate the indications of neurosurgery, operation time and prognosis of patients with RI after NPC radiotherapy who underwent neurosurgical management. Method(s): This was a follow-up study between January 2005 and July 2011. Fifteen NPC cases of RI who underwent neurosurgery were collected. Brain Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), surgery and histology were studied. The outcome was assessed by LENT/SOMA scales and modified Rankin scale. Result(s): Brain lesion resection (86.7%) was more common than decompressive craniotomy (13.3%). According to LENT/SOMA scale before and six months after surgery, 13 of 15, 12 of 15, 14 of 15, and 14 of 15 cases showed improvement at subjective, objective, management and analytic domains, respectively. 12 of 15 patients showed improvement of modified Rankin scale after surgery. Three patients who underwent emergency surgery showed significant improvement (average score increment of 2, 2.7, 2.7, 3 and 2 at LENT/SOMA scale subjective, objective, management, analytic, and modified Rankin scale, respectively), as compared with 12 cases underwent elective surgery (average score increment of 1, 1, 1.4, 1.8 and 1 at LENT SOMA scale subjective, objective, management, analytic, and modified Rankin scale, respectively). Conclusion(s): Neurosurgery, including brain necrotic tissue resection and decompressive craniotomy, improves the prognosis for RI patients, especially for those with indications of emergency surgery. © 2013 Li et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
2110,"Dramatic and prolonged decrease of whole salivary secretion in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients treated with radiotherapy Objectives. This study evaluates: (1) the change in whole salivary secretion rates of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients before, during, and after radiotherapy, especially during the first week of irradiation; (2) the recovery capability of salivary glands up to 2 years postirradiation; and (3) the possible prognostic factors affecting salivary gland functions. Study design. Fifty patients who completed conventional radiotherapy using either once-per-day or hyperfractionated technique were included. Both unstimulated and stimulated whole salivary flow rates and ratios (flow rate compared with baseline) were measured before, during, 1, 3, and 6 months, and 1 and 2 years after radiotherapy. Multivariate analysis of potential prognostic factors affecting the salivary secretion ratio was made. Results. Salivary glands were very radiosensitive and responded to radiation very early. After 720 cGy at the fourth day of the 8-week treatment, the unstimulated and stimulated salivary flow rates had decreased by 40%-50%. The nadir was reached in many patients after 3600 cGy (4 weeks). A second phase of decrease in salivary secretion was noted after completion of radiotherapy. Conclusions. Different mechanisms may be responsible for salivary response after low and high dose of radiation. This study shows no recovery of salivary secretion during the follow-up period, and the best strategy for managing radiation-induced salivary gland damage may be reduction of radiation dose to the glands. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

1341,"Bone healing andweight bearingmanagement in tibial diaphysis fracture unilateral external fixation Objective: Tibial diaphysis fracture represents the commonest long bone fracture and is a major cause of professional and social absenteeism for the patient. Its management is included in the everyday practice of an Orthopaedic surgeon having various available treatment options. We wanted to evaluate the time to bone healing in tibial diaphysis fractures treated with unilateral external fixator regarding the weight bearing management. Method(s): After obtaining the hospital ethics committee approval, we retrospectively reviewed the x-rays and case notes of 54 patients who underwent an Orthofix unilateral external fixator after sustaining a tibial diaphysis closed fracture. Our primary outcome was the time to clinical and radiological bone healing and the secondary outcome of our review was the different weight bearing postoperative management. The patients were separated in 3 groups regarding the commencement of post-op weight bearing. Group 1 contained patients who started weight bearing from day 1 to day 30, in group 2 were patients who started bearing weight from day 31 until day 60 and group 3 had patients who commenced bearing weight on the affected limp after 61 days postop. Result(s): The mean time to clinical and radiological bone healing was 21 weeks after the application of the tibial diaphysis fracture unilateral external fixator. Group 1 achieved the shortest mean time to bone healing with 15 weeks. Conclusion(s): The weight bearing management regarding its early commencement could favor the time to bone healing in tibial diaphysis fracture unilateral external fixation.",Excluded
1409,"Fluoro-less ureteral stent placement following uncomplicated ureteroscopic stone removal: a feasibility study OBJECTIVE: To test the feasibility of ureteral stent placement without image guidance after uncomplicated ureteral stone removal and to compare the outcomes of fluoro-less and conventional ureteral stent placement., METHODS: A technique was devised to allow placement of a ureteral stent without image guidance by substituting fluoroscopy with visual and tactile cues. A retrospective review of 25 patients using fluoro-less stent placement was compared with 25 consecutive patients who underwent conventional stent placement with fluoroscopy. Stent placement was graded on a 6-point scale to assess coil symmetry and location. Comparisons between the fluoro-less stent placements and controls were performed with the Mann-Whitney U test. All hypotheses were 2-sided and conducted at an alpha level of 0.05., RESULTS: All 25 ureteral stent placements were performed successfully without the use of fluoroscopy for image guidance. There was no significant difference in age, gender, body mass index, stone size, or complication rates when fluoro-less and conventional stent placements were compared. In addition, grade 1 placement was achieved in 76% of the fluoro-less group and in 64% of the conventional group. Although placement accuracy was higher in the fluoro-less group this was not statistically significant (P = .13)., CONCLUSION: Ureteral stent placement without fluoroscopic guidance is feasible. It maintains comparable efficacy and complication rates with conventional ureteral stent placement. This technique allows reduced radiation exposure in patients requiring ureteral stent placement.

1924,"Standardisation of the neck-shaft angle and measurement of age-, gender- and BMI-related changes in the femoral neck using DXA Introduction The morphology of the proximal femur has often been investigated in the literature, but the normal population ranges and standard deviations have still not been determined for this area. This study aimed to determine the age-, gender- and body mass index (BMI)-related changes in the femoral neck, especially on the neck-shaft angle, by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurements. Method s Retrospective analyses of DXA images of the proximal femur from 18,943 individuals aged 20-108 years were performed. The age, gender, weight and height of each individual were obtained at the time of bone measurement. Data on theta angle were obtained from DXA measurements. Simple linear regression analysis and Pearson's correlation coefficients were used to investigate the relationships between theta and age, gender and BMI. Results There was a significant correlation between theta and age (p < 0.001). We also found a significant difference between the various age groups using analysis of variance (p < 0.001), but there was no meaningful correlation between theta and BMI (p = 0.377) and the BMI groups (p = 0.180). There were small but statistically significant differences in the neck-shaft angle between males and females (p < 0.05). Conclusion In this study, DXA-based measurements were used and many parameters of proximal femur geometry were calculated with limited radiation exposure. We have demonstrated that the mean neck-shaft angle is greater in males than in females, and that theta increases with age. We also found a significant difference between different age groups, but no meaningful correlation between theta and BMI.",Excluded

2139,"The impact of the effective dose to immune cells on lymphopenia and survival of esophageal cancer after chemoradiotherapy Purpose: To test the hypothesis that effective dose to circulating immune cells (EDIC) impacts the severity of radiation-induced lymphopenia and clinical outcomes of esophageal cancer patients treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). Material(s) and Method(s): 488 esophageal cancer patients treated with CCRT with and without surgery were analyzed. The EDIC model considers the exposure of circulating immune cells as the proportion of blood flow to lung, heart, liver, and the volume of the exposed area of the body, with the basis of mean lung dose (MLD), mean heart dose (MHD), mean liver dose (MlD), and integral dose (ITD) of the body region scanned, calculated as: EDIC=0.12*MLD+0.08*MHD+0.15*0.85*MlD*[Formula presented]1/2+0.45+0.35*0.85*[Formula presented]1/2*[Formula presented] Where n is the fraction number. Correlations of EDIC with overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), distant metastasis free survival (DMFS), and locoregional control (LRC) rates were analyzed using both univariable and multivariable Cox models. Lymphopenia during CCRT was graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. Result(s): Grade 4 lymphopenia resulted in inferior clinical outcomes, including OS, PFS, and DMFS. The median EDIC was 3.6 Gy (range, 0.8-6.0 Gy). Higher EDIC was strongly associated with severe lymphopenia, particularly when EDIC was above 4 Gy. Patients with EDIC > 4.0 Gy had more G4 lymphopenia than those with EDIC <= 4.0 Gy (67.3% vs. 40.8%; P < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, increasing EDIC was independently and inversely associated with worse OS, PFS, and DMFS. Conclusion(s): EDIC can be recommended as a useful tool to predict lymphopenia and inferior clinical outcomes, and it should be minimized below 4 Gy.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded

2041,"Real-time optical image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) of breast/chest wall cancer Purpose/Objective(s):We are developing real-time 3D/4D video guidance to reduce breast and chest wall setup errors and track target motion during post-mastectomy chest wall/nodal irradiation, breast only irradiation, and breast nodal irradiation in a clinical trial. We have also compared the reliability, accuracy, and precision of camera-based IGRT with results of weekly portal image verification and weekly CBCT volumetric matching. Materials/Methods: One-hundred forty patients, 102 breast only, 23 breast + nodal, and 15 chest wall + nodal, were accrued in an IRB-approved clinical trial of IGRT using 3D/4D optical images at daily setup and beamon time. Breast board and vacuum bag were used for all patients. Eleven patients with left-side diseases were treated under deep inspiration breath hold using ABC device and twenty-two patient using IMRT. Target shifts and rotations relating to CT-based planned reference surface were determined with real-time optical surface images using modified iterativeclosest-point alignment. A selected light ray intersecting the middle-upper abdominal surface and the anterior surface of the target projected onto the principal components were used as the real-time point/marker-based and surface/volume-based motion tracking, respectively. The optical guidance and real-time respiratory motion tracking were completely performed by therapists and results were semi-automatically saved in the camera-control computer. The target displacements (shifts and rotations) were compared with results of the weekly CBCT and portal images from EPID. Motion curves of surface Intersection point and surface principal components were also compared with breathing volume curves from the ABC system. Result(s): Daily target setup errors were reduced from 0.9 cm to <0.4 cm by using the 3D/4D video surface-guidance that was always consistent with results of portal images and CBCT if there were no big body motion during CBCT scanning. Higher accuracy and precision of 0.2 cm and longer stability without hardware change for clinical usage in four years were achieved for the video camera operated at the imaging speed and tracking rate of 15 frames per second. The novel intersection point and surface motion trackings were also more sensitive and accurate than that of commercial RPM and ABC systems. UP to 2 cm body sag on the slant breast board during longer IMRT treatments and surface deformation for five large breasts and some patients undertaken deep breath hold irradiation were detected. Conclusion(s): Accurate and precise optical image-guided setup of breast and chest wall targets was clinically validated with thousands of portal images and CBCT scans on 140 patients. More importantly, one can reliably track irregular target motion during daily dose delivery and detect gross target deformation during the entire course of treatment. The video guidance provides us all-time IGRT of breast and chest wall cancer without large volume low dose irradiation in taking daily CBCT and/or portal images.",Excluded
1668,"Probability of mediastinal involvement in non-small-cell lung cancer: A statistical definition of the clinical target volume for 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy? Purpose: Conformal irradiation (3D-CRT) of non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is largely based on precise definition of the nodal clinical target volume (CTVn). A reduction of the number of nodal stations to be irradiated would facilitate tumor dose escalation. The aim of this study was to design a mathematical tool based on documented data to predict the risk of metastatic involvement for each nodal station. Methods and Materials: We reviewed the large surgical series published in the literature to identify the main pretreatment parameters that modify the risk of nodal invasion. The probability of involvement for the 17 nodal stations described by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) was computed from all these publications. Starting with the primary site of the tumor as the main characteristic, we built a probabilistic tree for each nodal station representing the risk distribution as a function of each tumor feature. Statistical analysis used the inversion of probability trees method described by Weinstein and Feinberg. Validation of the software based on 134 patients from two different populations was performed by receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves and multivariate logistic regression. Result(s): Analysis of all of the various parameters of pretreatment staging relative to each level of the ATS map results in 20,000 different combinations. The first parameters included in the tree, depending on tumor site, were histologic classification, metastatic stage, nodal stage weighted as a function of the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic examination used (positron emission tomography scan, computed tomography scan), and tumor stage. Software is proposed to compute a predicted probability of involvement of each nodal station for any given clinical presentation. Double cross validation confirmed the methodology. A 10% cutoff point was calculated from ROC and logistic model giving the best prediction of mediastinal lymph node involvement. Conclusion(s): To more accurately define the CTVn in NSCLC three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy, we propose a software that evaluates the risk of mediastinal lymph node involvement from easily accessible individual pretreatment parameters. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

Multiple sheaths have been created for various takeoffs. The purpose of this article is to show the feasibility of the ""shape-the-sheath"" method in left atrial appendage closure., METHODS: Ten consecutive patients undergoing LAA occlusion without the ""shape-the-sheath"" method were compared to 10 consecutive patients undergoing LAA occlusion with the ""shape-the-sheath"" method using the Amplatzer Cardiac Plug (ACP) system and the Amplatzer TorqVue 45x45 sheath., RESULTS: The ""shape-the-sheath"" method resulted in significant decreases in fluoroscopy time (7.2+/-3.0 min vs. 13.7+/-6.7 min, P<0.05), number of partial recaptures (0% vs. 50%, P<0.05), with a trend toward decrease in the number of complete recaptures (0 vs. 40%, P=0.09) compared to conventional sheath use., CONCLUSIONS: Shaping-the-sheath is a simple, elegant way to help conform delivery systems to better access the LAA and ensure stable position.

1446,"The morphologic effects of radiation administered therapeutically for intracranial gliomas: a postmortem study of 25 cases To investigate the pathologic consequences of therapeutic radiation, this morphologic study evaluated the brains of 25 patients with intracranial gliomas treated both with and without this form of therapy. Although beneficial effects such as the retardation of tumor growth were evident in these studies, among the seventeen patients who received from 5000--6000 rads for malignant gliomas, four developed ""late delayed"" radiation necrosis. The strong predilection of this tissue response for the white matter adjacent to the neoplasm suggests a local sensitivity which may have been engendered or enhanced by cerebral edema. A fifth case disclosed focal demyelination in the mid-brain suggesting ""early delayed"" radiation necrosis, and an additional case had distinctive foci of necrosis within the brain stem. Changes of diffuse cerebral edema were noted in many of the radiated brains. It is concluded that radiation therapy in commonly employed dosages for malignant gliomas carries a risk of injury to surrounding cerebral tissues.",Included
2020,"Establishing locoregional control of malignant pleural mesothelioma using high-dose radiotherapy and 18F-FDG PET/CT scan correlation Introduction: The management of malignant pleural mesothelioma represents one of the most challenging issues in oncology, as there is no proven long-term benefit from surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy alone or in combination. Locoregional progression remains the major cause of death, but radical surgical resection may produce major postoperative morbidity. While radical or postoperative radiotherapy using conventional techniques has resulted in severe toxicity with no impact on survival, recent advances in radiotherapy delivery may be more effective. Method(s): We treated patients with locally advanced mesothelioma whose tumours had been sub optimally resected with high-dose three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) or intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) to large volumes of one hemithorax, using CT and positron emission tomography (PET) scan-based treatment planning. Clinical outcomes were assessed by determining patterns of failure and metabolic changes in total glycolytic volume (TGV) between pre- and post-irradiation18F-FDG PET/CT scans and by recording acute and late toxicity grades. Result(s): Fourteen patients were analysed with 40 PET scans performed before and up to 4.5 years after radiotherapy. Eleven patients had pleurectomy/decortications, one had an extrapleural pneumonectomy and two had no surgery. Four patients who received chemotherapy had all progressed prior to radiotherapy. After radiotherapy, the in-field local control rate was 71%. No progression occurred in two patients, one was salvaged with further radiotherapy to a new site, four recurred inside the irradiated volume all with concurrent distant metastases and the other seven had distant metastases only. The TGVs were reduced by an average of 67% (range 12-100%) after doses of 45 to 60 Gy to part or all of one hemithorax. There were no serious treatment-related toxicities. Median survival was 25 months from diagnosis and 17 months after starting radiotherapy. Conclusion(s): We have established that mesothelioma can be locally controlled with high radiation doses using 3DCRT or IMRT, and that strict normal tissue dose constraints have limited radiation toxicities. Radiotherapy should be considered to prevent or delay the local manifestations of progressive disease in suitable patients after surgery including extrapleural pneumonectomy and pleurectomy/decortication. Higher radiation doses may allow more effective palliation. © 2011 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists.",Excluded
