2375,"Effects of Probiotics with or without Honey on Radiation-induced Diarrhea Background: Diarrhea is a well-recognized side effect associated with pelvic radiation; however, there is not any effective common treatment for radiation-induced diarrhea. A popular alternative is probiotics, which have been used in several gastrointestinal disorders. Probiotics are live microbial food supplements. Furthermore, honey is a putative nutritional with a variety of health effects, including antibacterial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and prebiotic. The present study evaluated the effects of probiotic with or without honey on radiation-induced diarrhea. Material(s) and Method(s): Sixty-seven adult patients with pelvic cancer underwent radiotherapy for four weeks. They randomized to receive probiotic (n = 22), probiotic plus honey (n = 21) or placebo (n = 24) from one week before radiotherapy for five weeks. Diarrhea grade and stool consistency score were recorded weekly according to the Common Toxicity Criteria system and the Bristol scales, respectively. Result(s): The results showed a decrease in the daily number of bowel movements (p = 0.003 and 0.006), diarrhea grade (p = 0.001 and 0.001) and the need for antidiarrheal medication (p = 0.021 and 0.041) also an increase in the stool consistency (p = 0.004 and 0.005) in patients who either used probiotic or probiotic plus honey (respectively), these were significant in weeks 4 and 5 of treatment. Conclusion(s): Probiotics with or without honey can reduce the incidence of radiation-induced diarrhea and the need for antidiarrheal medication.",Excluded
1363,"Dose and image quality of high-pitch dual source computed tomography for the evaluation of cervical lymph node status - comparison to regular 128-slice single source computed tomography PURPOSE: A high-pitch dual-source CT (DSCT) was compared to a standard single-source CT protocol in terms of dose and image quality for malignant lymphoma staging., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 43 patients who underwent DSCT (group 1) of the neck for staging of malignant lymphoma and 40 patients who underwent regular single source CT (group 2) were investigated retrospectively. Volume CT dose index (CTDIvol), dose length product (DLP), background noise (BN), attenuation values, signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR), scan time, effective tube current-time product (eff. mAs), subjective diagnostic image quality and artifact burden were compared., RESULTS: CTDIvol (5.5 +/- 0.8 mGy vs. 12.4 +/- 1.4 mGy), DLP (172 +/- 27 mGycm vs. 344 +/- 60 mGycm, p<0.0001), eff. mAs (98 +/- 15 mAs vs. 183 +/- 20 mAs, p<0.0001) and scan time (0.64 +/- 0.05 s vs. 8.21 +/- 0.72 s) were lower for group 1. BN was higher (p<0.001) for group 1 with a mean difference of 2.6 HU. SNR for sternocleidomastoid and pectoral muscle was lower (6.6-12.3 vs. 7.8-19.1) for group 1. Subjective image quality (1.55 +/- 0.6 vs. 1.42 +/- 0.5) and artifact burden (1.62 +/- 1.0 vs. 1.57 +/- 0.9) were not rated significantly different (p=0.47 and p=0.80) with a good inter-observer agreement (kappa=0.59-0.90)., CONCLUSION: High-pitch DSCT allows reduction of patient dose for cervical lymphoma staging while diagnostic image quality is preserved.

2125,"Minimally Invasive Stereotactical Radio-ablation of Adrenal Metastases as an Alternative to Surgery PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to study the clinical outcome for patients with metastases of the adrenal gland treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-six patients were studied retrospectively. The dose prescription was 40 Gy in four fractions. Dosimetric analysis was performed using the dose volume histograms while clinical outcome was assessed using actuarial analysis with determination of the overall survival (OS) and local control (LC) rates., RESULTS: The planning objectives were met for all patients. With a median follow-up period of 7.6 months, at the last follow-up 42 patients (91.3%) were alive and four had died because of distant progression. The actuarial mean OS was 28.5+/-1.6 months, the median was not reached. One-year and 2-year OS were 87.6+/-6.1%. None of the risk factors was significant in univariate analysis. Actuarial mean LC was 14.6+/-1.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 11.0 to 18.2) and median LC was 14.5+/-2.0 months (95% CI, 10.5 to 18.5). One-year and 2-year LC were 65.5+/-11.9% and 40.7+/-15.8%, respectively. A mild profile of toxicity was observed in the cohort of patients. Forty patients (86.9%) showed no complication (grade 0); two patients reported asthenia, six patients (13.1%) reported either pain, nausea, or vomiting. Of these six patients, five patients (10.9%) were scored as grade 1 toxicity while one patient (2.2%) was scored as grade 2., CONCLUSION: Stereotactic body radiation therapy treatment provided an adequate clinical response in the management of adrenal gland metastases.",Excluded
2223,"Are low ultraviolet B and vitamin D associated with higher incidence of multiple myeloma? Background The purpose of this study was to determine whether an inverse association exists between latitude, solar ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiance, and incidence rates of multiple myeloma.Methods Associations of latitude and UVB irradiance with age-standardized incidence rates of multiple myeloma were analyzed for 175 countries while controlling for sex-specific obesity prevalence, cigarette consumption, and alcohol consumption using multiple linear regression.Results Incidence rates of multiple myeloma were greater at higher latitudes (R2 for latitude for males = 0.31, p < 0.0001; females R2 = 0.27, p < 0.0001). In regression models for males (R2 = 0.62, p < 0.0001) and females (R2 = 0.51, p < 0.0001), UVB irradiance was independently inversely associated with incidence rates.Conclusions Age-adjusted incidence rates of multiple myeloma were higher in countries with lower solar UVB irradiance. Further investigation is warranted in individuals of the association of prediagnostic serum 25(OH)D with risk.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Excluded
1270,"Pathogenesis of post-irradiation infections. I. Yersinia enterocolitica administered to normal and irradiated rats Infections after irradiation can be due to a great variety of microorganisms many of which are normally non-pathogenic or conditionally pathogenic for the host. The strain of Y. enterocolitica used was not pathogenic to a variety of unirradiated rats nor to athymic or B lymphocyte deprived, macrophage depleted rats, nor to normal rats irradiated by 5.7 Gy 24 hours before. However similarly irradiated rats receiving Y. enterocolitica 5 to 10 days later showed a substantial mortality. It is concluded that the radiosensitive mechanism for protection against Y. enterocolitica is not humoral nor cellular immunity as mediated by T and B lymphocytes or macrophages.",Included
1458,"Individual, Environmental, and Meteorological Predictors of Daily Personal Ultraviolet Radiation Exposure Measurements in a United States Cohort Study Background: Individual exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is challenging to measure, particularly for diseases with substantial latency periods between first exposure and diagnosis of outcome, such as cancer. To guide the choice of surrogates for long-term UVR exposure in epidemiologic studies, we assessed how well stable sun-related individual characteristics and environmental/meteorological factors predicted daily personal UVR exposure measurements. Method(s): We evaluated 123 United States Radiologic Technologists subjects who wore personal UVR dosimeters for 8 hours daily for up to 7 days (N = 837 days). Potential predictors of personal UVR derived from a self-administered questionnaire, and public databases that provided daily estimates of ambient UVR and weather conditions. Factors potentially related to personal UVR exposure were tested individually and in a model including all significant variables. Result(s): The strongest predictors of daily personal UVR exposure in the full model were ambient UVR, latitude, daily rainfall, and skin reaction to prolonged sunlight (R2 = 0.30). In a model containing only environmental and meteorological variables, ambient UVR, latitude, and daily rainfall were the strongest predictors of daily personal UVR exposure (R2 = 0.25). Conclusion(s): In the absence of feasible measures of individual longitudinal sun exposure history, stable personal characteristics, ambient UVR, and weather parameters may help estimate long-term personal UVR exposure.",Excluded
1645,"Radiosurgery for solitary brain metastases using the cobalt-60 gamma unit: methods and results in 24 patients To define the role of stereotactic radiosurgery in the treatment of metastatic brain tumors we treated 24 consecutive patients (20 men, 4 women) with the 201-source 60Co gamma unit between May 1988 and March 1990. The primary tumors included malignant melanoma (n = 10), non-small cell lung carcinoma (n = 6), renal cell carcinoma (n = 3), colorectal carcinoma (n = 1), oropharyngeal carcinoma (n = 1), and adenocarcinoma of unknown origin (n = 3). All tumors were less than or equal to 3.0 cm in greatest diameter. Twenty patients received a planned combination of 30-40 Gy whole brain fractionated irradiation and a radiosurgical ""boost"" of 16-20 Gy to the tumor margins; one patient refused conventional fractionated irradiation. Three patients with recurrent, persistent, or new non-small cell lung carcinomas had radiosurgical treatment 12-20 months after receiving 30-42.5 Gy whole-brain external beam irradiation. Stereotactic computed tomographic imaging was used for target coordinate determination and imaging-integrated dose planning. All tumors were enclosed by the 50-90% isodose shell using one (n = 22), two (n = 1), or three (n = 1) irradiation isocenters. During this 23-month period (median follow-up of 7 months) no patient died from progression of a radiosurgically-treated brain metastasis. Ten patients died of systemic disease (n = 8) or remote central nervous system metastasis (n = 2) between 1 week and 10 months after radiosurgery. One patient had tumor progression and underwent craniotomy and tumor excision 5 months after radiosurgery. To date, median survival after radiosurgery has been 10 months; 1-year survival was 33.3%. Stereotactic radiosurgery eliminated the surgical and anesthetic risks associated with craniotomy and resection of solitary brain metastases. Radiosurgery also effectively controlled the growth of tumors considered ""resistant"" to conventional irradiation.",Excluded
1390,"Lung Cancer Mortality in the Swiss Working Population: The Effect of Occupational and Non-Occupational Factors OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of occupational exposures on lung cancer mortality in Switzerland after adjustment for non-occupational lung carcinogens., METHODS: Using data on 4'351'383 Swiss residents, we used negative binomial regression to assess the effect occupation on lung cancer mortality between 1990 and 2014, accounting for socio-demographic factors, predicted probabilities of smoking and measured environmental radon exposure., RESULTS: After adjustment, male machine operators and workers in mining, stone working and building materials manufacturing showed the highest risk. Women working in electrical engineering, electronics, watchmaking, vehicle construction and toolmaking and transport occupations also remained at high-risk. Radon exposure had no effect on lung cancer mortality, while smoking demonstrated a significant effect in both sexes., CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest the presence of occupational exposures to lung carcinogens in addition to non-occupational factors.

1447,"Mri of the inferior alveolar nerve and lingual nerve-benchmark values and anatomical variety in healthy subjects Background: Radiation based imaging techniques like panoramic radiography, computed tomography (CT) or cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) are currently the standard for depicting the mandibular canal prior to surgical procedures. However, these modalities are lacking sufficient soft tissue visualization of the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) and the lingual nerve (LN), which is particularly exposed to injury during wisdom tooth removal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using dedicated imaging sequences showed promising results in the direct visualization of the IAN and the LN with high spatial resolution and signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) quantification. The aim of this study was to define standard specifications in MRI which allow for benchmark definition of SNR values in healthy subjects. Method(s): 33 healthy volunteers were examined on a 3T scanner. The conducted sequence protocol consisted of a 3D STIR, 3D WATS and a 3D T1 FFE ""black bone""-sequence. Result(s): The study highlights the feasibility of a direct visualization of proximal and peripheral branches of the IAN and proximal LN. STIR and WATS sequences allowed for morphological discrimination of nerval and vascular components and their anatomical localization within the mandible. The STIR sequence showed significantly higher signalto-noise-ratios for IAN as well as for the LN in the proximal and distal part of the corresponding nerves (p < 0.05). Discussion(s): The data presented in this study reveal, that a direct visualization of the course of the IAN and LN is feasible using high resolution STIR and WATS sequences. Furthermore, the imaging protocol conducted not only allowed for reproducible nerve diameter measurements but also for subsequent calculation of quantitative parameters like aSNR. Conclusion(s): MRI using a dedicated sequence protocol allows for detection, nerve signal quantification and morphological characterization of the course of the IAN and the LN with its variant forms in healthy subjects.",Excluded
1777,"Apollo Lunar Astronauts Show Higher Cardiovascular Disease Mortality: Possible Deep Space Radiation Effects on the Vascular Endothelium As multiple spacefaring nations contemplate extended manned missions to Mars and the Moon, health risks could be elevated as travel goes beyond the Earth's protective magnetosphere into the more intense deep space radiation environment. The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether mortality rates due to cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, accidents and all other causes of death differ in (1) astronauts who never flew orbital missions in space, (2) astronauts who flew only in low Earth orbit (LEO), and (3) Apollo lunar astronauts, the only humans to have traveled beyond Earth's magnetosphere. Results show there were no differences in CVD mortality rate between non-flight (9%) and LEO (11%) astronauts. However, the CVD mortality rate among Apollo lunar astronauts (43%) was 4-5 times higher than in non-flight and LEO astronauts. To test a possible mechanistic basis for these findings, a secondary purpose was to determine the long-term effects of simulated weightlessness and space-relevant total-body irradiation on vascular responsiveness in mice. The results demonstrate that space-relevant irradiation induces a sustained vascular endothelial cell dysfunction. Such impairment is known to lead to occlusive artery disease, and may be an important risk factor for CVD among astronauts exposed to deep space radiation.",Included
2155,"Potential values of metabolic tumor volume and heterogeneity measured with 18F-FDG PET/CT pretreatment to evaluate local control for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated with nonsurgical therapy Objectives: The aim of the study was to evaluate the predictive value of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET/computed tomography (CT) pretreatment on local control (LC) and survival after radical radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and to discuss its potential value for establishing optimal radiation treatment plans. Method(s): Fifty-eight patients with pathologically proven esophageal SCC who underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT pretreatment in our center were retrospectively reviewed. We examined the correlation between the PET parameters of primary tumors and LC and overall survival. The coefficient of variation was used to estimate the 18F-FDG uptake in heterogeneity. Result(s): The mean duration of follow-up for surviving patients was 38 months, and 36 patients died because of tumor recurrence or other diseases. The rates of 3-year overall survival and LC were 40.4 and 50.4%, respectively. Multivariate analysis of LC revealed that metabolic tumor volume (MTV) greater than 16.08ml was the only predictor of outcome, with a lower 3-year LC (P = 0.017, hazard ratio: 1.608, 95% confidence interval: 1.090-2.371). The coefficient of variations of their primary lesion were higher compared with those of patients who had smaller MTVs. Conclusion(s): In this study, MTV assessed by PET/CT might be an adverse factor for predicting LC in esophageal SCC. For those with higher MTVs, higher intratumor heterogeneity suggests that irradiation may need to be boosted in stable high-uptake regions to improve LC. These results need to be prospectively validated in larger cohorts.Copyright © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2153,"Initial conservative treatment for grade 3 Ta-1 superficial bladder cancer We retrospectively investigated the therapeutic outcomes of our series of 7 Ta and 62 T1 bladder cancers with grade 3 (G3) malignancy in 61 men and 8 women having a mean age of 66.2 years. Following transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), 35 and 6 patients received intravesical instillations of bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and anthracycline-derivants, respectively, whereas 15 received no adjuvant therapy. Five and 2 patients received systemic and local chemotherapy with irradiation, respectively, and six underwent radical cystectomy for invasive potential. The 5-year non-recurrence, progression-free, and overall (cancer-specific) survival rates were 66, 82%, and 76 (88) %, respectively, after a median follow-up of 52 months. The 5-year non-recurrence rates were 24% in non-adjuvant, 85% in BCG, 0% in anthracycline-derivants, 65% in systemic and local chemoradiation therapy, and 68% in cystectomy. The 5-year progression-free and overall (cancer-specific) survival rates of the patients treated with BCG instillation were 91% and 94(100)%. There were no significant differences in the 5-year non-recurrence and progression-free rates between 12 patients with carcinoma in situ (CIS) and 23 patients without CIS. Complete TUR of all visible tumors and a reliable histopathological diagnosis of appropriate specimens bearing the muscle layer are mandatory for assessment of recurrence. G3 Ta-1 bladder cancers and CIS showed a high risk of recurrence, and required aggressive treatment. Since BCG therapy following TURBT significantly reduced the risk of recurrence and progression, adjuvant BCG therapy is considered to be the most promising initial conservative treatment for G3 Ta-1 bladder cancers.",Excluded
2073,"Neoadjuvant radiotherapy for rectal cancer: adherence to evidence-based guidelines in clinical practice Implementation of evidence-based standards is problematic. Level 1 evidence, largely predicated on the German Rectal Cancer Study, supports neoadjuvant treatment for patients with stage II/III rectal cancer. The purpose of this study was to determine to what extent this evidence has affected clinical practice. Stage II/III rectal cancer patients undergoing surgery from 1998 to 2007 were identified in the SEER tumor registry. Variables were analyzed with SPSS software. Trends were evaluated with regression models. Survivals were compared with the log-rank test. A total of 22,136 patients were identified and 15,021 (67.8%) were treated with adjuvant radiotherapy. A large percentage were >60 years old (64.4%), white (83.0%), male (58.8%), at stage III (55.1%), and treated with neoadjuvant radiotherapy (35.5%). A significant increase in the use of neoadjuvant radiotherapy occurred: from 17% in 1998 to 51% in 2007 (p < 0.001). Scatter-plot best-fit lines for neoadjuvant and adjuvant radiotherapy intersected at approximately year 2002. Significant increases in preoperative radiotherapy were observed for all races and cancer stages (p < 0.001). On unadjusted analysis, race (p = 0.018), sex (p < 0.001), year of diagnosis (p < 0.001), age (p < 0.001), and stage (p < 0.001) were associated with increased likelihood of neoadjuvant radiotherapy. On logistic regression analysis, male sex [odds ratio (OR) 1.14, p < 0.001), year (OR 1.223, p < 0.001), and stage II (OR 1.39, p < 0.001) were predictors of neoadjuvant therapy. When adjuvant radiotherapy was utilized, there was rapid adoption of a neoadjuvant approach. This trend predated publication of prospective randomized data.",Excluded
1667,"Usefulness of doppler techniques in the diagnosis of peripheral iatrogenic pseudoaneurysms secondary to minimally invasive interventional and surgical procedures: imaging findings and diagnostic performance study The pseudoaneurysm (PA) is a perfused sac directly connecting with the arterial lumen by an interruption of the vessel wall continuity, more commonly secondary to trauma or iatrogenic causes. Aim of our study was to determine the accuracy and usefulness of Doppler techniques in the diagnosis of peripheral iatrogenic PAs secondary to minimally invasive procedures. From a three year prospective research, 20 Duplex Ultrasound (DUS) studies in as many patients presenting with periarterial pulsating mass clinically suspected for PA secondary to minimally invasive procedures were selected. The PA final diagnosis was confirmed by angiography in 12 patients (60% cases), by computed tomography angiography in 5 patients (25%), by surgery in 2 patients (10%), and by magnetic resonance angiography in 1 patient (5%). The vessels involved by PA formation were: common femoral artery in 8 cases (40%); superficial femoral artery in 4 cases (20%); brachial artery in 3 cases (15%); popliteal artery in 2 cases (10%); superficial temporal artery (STA) in 2 cases (10%); dorsal medial digital artery of the foot in 1 case (5%). Our study confirmed the usefulness of doppler techniques in the diagnosis of peripheral iatrogenic PAs. Specifically, a sensitivity of 90-95%, a specificity of 100% and predictive values of 100% (VPP) and 83-90% (VPN) were reported. The radiologist must always suspect a PA in the differential diagnosis of lesions contiguous to an artery vessel. This is to prevent potential complications such as e.g. massive haemorrhage. In this order, DUS allows a careful selection of patients who require to undergo in-depth imaging methods or surgical therapy, thus contributing to a significant reduction of contrast medium and exposure to ionizing radiation.Copyright © 2020, Societa Italiana di Ultrasonologia in Medicina e Biologia (SIUMB).",Excluded

Methods and Materials Patients with inoperable (due to medical comorbid conditions or patient's refusal to undergo surgery) or unresectable gastric cancer received up to 2 21-day cycles of preradiation and postradiation chemotherapy (docetaxel 37.5 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8, cisplatin 25 mg/m2 on days 1-3, and a continuous infusion of fluorouracil [FU] 750 mg/m2 on days 1-5), respectively. CCRT between preradiation and postradiation chemotherapy was initiated on day 43 and consisted of intensity modulated radiation therapy (50.4 Gy) plus concurrent docetaxel 20 mg/m2 weekly for 6 weeks. Results 36 patients were evaluable; 21 patients with comorbid conditions were unsuitable for surgery (group 1), 8 had unresectable disease (group 2), and 7 refused surgery (group 3). The clinical complete response (cCR) rate for the 36 evaluable patients was 36% (95% confidence interval [CI], 19%-53%) and the overall response rate was 83% (95% CI, 75%-97%). The median survival time and estimated 2-year survival rate were 25.8 months (95% CI, 7.1-44.5 months) and 52% (95% CI, 38%-67%), respectively. The estimated median OS and 2-year OS rates for groups 1, 2, and 3 were 37.0 months (95% CI, 7.9-66.1 months) and 52% (95% CI, 31%-73%), 17.7 months (95% CI, 7.8-27.6 months) and 20% (95% CI, 0%-49%), and 38.9 months (95% CI, 16.6-58.3 months) and 67% (95% CI, 30%-100%), respectively. Achieving a cCR was associated with significantly better overall survival (P=.004) and progression-free survival (P=.003). The most common grade 3 or greater toxicity during the chemotherapy phase was neutropenia. Common grade 3/4 toxicities during CCRT were nausea and vomiting.

2344,"High-pitch dual-source CT angiography of the thoracic and abdominal aorta: is simultaneous coronary artery assessment possible? OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate the average heart rate and heart rate variability required for diagnostic imaging of the coronary arteries with high-pitch dual-source CT angiography of the thoracic and thoracoabdominal aorta., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: One hundred consecutively registered patients (82 men, 18 women; mean age, 68 +/- 13 years) underwent clinically indicated CT angiography of the thoracic (n = 33) and thoracoabdominal (n = 67) aorta with a dual-source 128-MDCT scanner in ECG-synchronized high-pitch (pitch, 3.2) data acquisition mode. No beta-blockers were administered. The image quality of the coronary arteries was graded on a 3-point scale by two independent blinded readers. The average heart rate and heart rate variability before data acquisition were noted. Effective radiation doses were calculated., RESULTS: Interobserver agreement on grade of image quality for the 1,414 coronary segments evaluated by both observers was good (kappa = 0.68). Diagnostic image quality was found for 1,375 of the 1,414 segments (97.2%) in 83 of 100 patients (83%). In 17% of the patients, image quality was nondiagnostic for at least one coronary artery segment. Average heart rate and heart rate variability (each p < 0.05) were significantly higher in patients with at least one nondiagnostic coronary segment compared with those without. All patients with an average heart rate less than 63 beats/min and heart rate variability less than 1.2 beats/min had diagnostic image quality in all coronary segments. Effective radiation doses were 2.3 +/- 0.3 mSv for thoracic and 4.4 +/- 0.5 mSv for thoracoabdominal CT angiography. The average scan times were 0.88 +/- 0.06 second for thoracic and 1.67 +/- 0.15 seconds for thoracoabdominal CT angiography., CONCLUSION: For patients with an average heart rate less than 63 beats/min and heart rate variability less than 1.2 beats/min, dual-source CT angiography of the thoracoabdominal aorta at a high pitch of 3.2 delivers diagnostic depiction of the coronary arteries at a low radiation dose.",Excluded
2133,"Curvature in the cancer mortality dose response in Japanese atomic bomb survivors: absence of evidence of threshold PURPOSES: To investigate the evidence for a threshold in the cancer dose-response curve., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Japanese atomic bomb survivor cancer mortality data, based on follow-up to 1990, was used, taking account of random errors in DS86 dose estimates., RESULTS: For all solid cancers analysed together, there is a significant positive dose response (two-sided p<0.05) if all survivors who received <0.5 Sv are considered, but the significance vanishes if doses of <0.2 Sv are considered; the same is also true for leukaemia. For solid cancer mortality there is no indication of curvilinearity in the dose response: no statistically significant improvement in fit to a linear relative risk model is provided by addition of quadratic or threshold dose terms. If a relative risk model with a threshold (the dose response is assumed linear above the threshold) is fitted to solid cancer mortality data, the best estimate of the threshold is < 0.00 Sv (95% CI <0.00-0.13). If a linear-quadratic-threshold model is used the best estimate of the threshold is < 0.00 Sv (95% CI < 0.00-0.15). For leukaemia mortality there is highly statistically significant upward curvature in the dose response. In particular, if a relative risk model with a threshold (the dose response is assumed linear above the threshold) is fitted to the leukaemia data, the best estimate of the threshold is 0.16 Sv (95% CI 0.05-0.40) (two-sided p=0.001 for test of departure of threshold from 0). However, there is no evidence for a threshold effect (two-sided p = 0.16) when a quadratic term is included in the dose response: the best estimate of threshold in this case is 0.09Sv (95% CI <0.00-0.29). Moreover, addition of a quadratic term improves the fit of a linear-threshold model at borderline levels of statistical significance (two-sided p = 0.07). Therefore, the most parsimonious description of the leukaemia dose response is provided by a linear-quadratic function of dose., CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence of threshold-type departures from the linear-quadratic dose response either for solid tumours or for leukaemia in the Japanese atomic bomb survivor mortality data.",Included

1654,"Simulation of inflorescence dynamics in oil palm and estimation of environment-sensitive phenological phases: a model based analysis For oil palm, yield variation is in large part due to variation in the number of harvested bunches. Each successively-produced phytomer carries a female (productive), male or aborted inflorescence. Since phytomer development takes 3-4 years and nearly two phytomers are produced per month, many inflorescences develop in parallel but have different phenological stages. Environment-dependent developmental rate, sex and abortion probability determine bunch productivity, which, in turn, affects other phytomers via source-sink relationships. Water deficit, solar radiation, temperature and day length are considered key external factors driving variation. Their impact is difficult to predict because of system complexity. To address this question we built a simple model (ECOPALM) to simulate the variation in number of harvested bunches. In this model, trophic competition among organs, expressed through a plant-scale index (Ic), drives sex determination and inflorescence abortion during specific sensitive phases at phytomer level. As a supplemental hypothesis, we propose that flowering is affected by photoperiod at phytomer level during a sensitive phase, thus, contributing to seasonal production peaks. The model was used to determine by parameter optimisation the influence of Ic and day length on inflorescence development and the stages at which inflorescences are sensitive to these signals. Parameters were estimated against observation of number of harvested bunches in Ivory Coast using a genetic algorithm. The model was then validated with field observations in Benin and Indonesia. The sensitive phases determined by parameter optimisation agreed with independent experimental evidence, and variation of Ic explained both sex and abortion patterns. Sex determination seemed to coincide with floret meristem individualisation and occurred 29-32 months before bunch harvest. The main abortion stage occurred 10 months before harvest - at the beginning of rapid growth of the inflorescence. Simulation results suggest involvement of photoperiod in the determination of bunch growth dynamics. This study demonstrates that simple modelling approaches can help extracting ecophysiological information from simple field observations on complex systems.",Excluded
2295,"Supermicrosurgical lymphaticovenous anastomosis for a patient with breast lymphedema secondary to breast cancer treatment Breast lymphedema (BLE) has been reported as a complication following breast cancer treatment. As for extremity lymphedema treatment, supermicrosurgical lymphaticovenous anastomosis (LVA) is considered an option for the treatment of progressive BLE refractory to conservative treatments, but no case has been reported so far. We report the first case of BLE successfully treated with supermicrosurgical LVA. A 55-year-old female presented with left BLE after breast conserving surgery and axillary lymph node dissection and adjuvant radiotherapy. After the cancer treatments, the patient suffered from pronounced swelling, sensation of tension, and pain of the left breast with frequent episodes of breast cellulitis. Conservative treatments had been performed for 7 years, but were not effective, and the patient was referred for further surgical treatment. Supermicrosurgical LVA was performed at the left breast. LVA surgery resulted in three anastomoses, in which three lymphatic vessels were anastomosed to three nearby veins in an intima-to-intima coaptation manner. After LVA, the left breast decreased in size, and the sensation of tension disappeared. One year postoperatively, the patient had no distress nor cellulitis episode, and was satisfied with the results of normal breast conditions. Although further clinical studies are required to confirm efficacy, supermicrosurgical LVA has the potential to be an option for the treatment of progressive BLE refractory to conservative treatments.Copyright © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
2121,"Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in the combined modality treatment of anal cancer patients Objective: To report clinical and dosimetric outcomes of a consecutive series of patients with anal cancer treated with volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) concomitant to chemotherapy (CT). Method(s): A cohort of 39 patients underwent VMAT employing a schedule consisting of 50.4Gy/28 fractions to the gross tumour volume (GTV) and 42Gy/28 fractions to the elective nodal volumes for patients with cT2N0 disease. Patients with cT3-T4/N0-N3 tumours were prescribed 54Gy/30 fractions to the GTV and 50.4Gy/30 fractions to the gross nodal volumes if sized #3cm or 54Gy/30 fractions if . 3cm. Elective nodal regions were given 45Gy/30 fractions. CT was administered concurrently following Nigro's regimen. The primary end point was acute toxicity. Secondary end points were colostomy-free survival (CFS), disease-free survival (DFS), cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS). Dosimetric data are also provided. Result(s): Median follow-up was 21 months. Maximum acute toxicities were: dermatologic-G3: 18%; gastrointestinal-G3: 5%; genitourinary-G3: 2%; anaemia-G2: 7%; leukopenia-G3: 28%; G4: 8%; neutropenia-G3: 13%; G4: 18%; thrombocytopenia-G3: 11%; and G4: 2%. The actuarial 2-year CFS was 77.9% [95% confidence interval (CI): 54-90.4%]. Actuarial 2-year OS and CSS were 85.2% (95% CI: 60.1-95.1%), while DFS was 75.1% (95% CI: 52.4.7-88.1%). Conclusion(s): Our clinical results support the use of VMAT as a safe and effective intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) option in the combined modality treatment of anal cancer, with consistent dosimetry, mild toxicity and promising sphincter preservation and survival rates.Copyright © 2016 The Authors.",Excluded
1953,"Increased metabolic activity in the spinal cord of patients with long-standing Lhermitte's sign PURPOSE: To investigate the pathophysiology of the radiation-induced, chronic Lhermitte's sign (LS) on the basis of long-standing case histories with partial functional recovery., PATIENTS AND METHODS: As radiotherapy in two nasopharyngeal cancer patients, a biologically effective dose (BED) of 103.8 Gy(2) (case 1) and 94.8 Gy(2) (case 2) was delivered to the cervical spinal cord. Neurologic signs relating to the irradiated spinal cord segments developed after 2 months (case 1) and 5 years (case 2), with radiation-induced damage equivalent to grade 3 (case 1) and grade 2 (case 2) toxicity (Common Toxicity Criteria, Version 2.0). The clinical status improved to grade 2 (case 1) and grade 1 (case 2). Positron emission tomography (PET) and fibroblast clonogen assay were applied 25 and 7 years postirradiation, respectively, to characterize this rare clinical picture., RESULTS: PET demonstrated increased [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) accumulation and [(15)O]butanol perfusion, but negligible [(11)C]methionine uptake in the irradiated spinal cord segments in both patients. In clonogenic assays, fibroblasts from case 1 displayed much higher radiation sensitivity than in healthy controls, while in case 2 the fibroblasts sensitivity was normal., CONCLUSIONS: These data suggests a close direct relationship between regional perfusion and metabolism of the spinal cord, similarly as in the brain. The postirradiation recovery may be related to energy-demanding conduction, explaining the increased metabolism and perfusion. The increased radiosensitivity and higher spinal cord BED may have contributed to the more severe sequelae in case 1.",Excluded
2203,"Dose-painting intensity-modulated proton therapy for intermediate- and high-risk meningioma Background: Newly diagnosed WHO grade II-III or any WHO grade recurrent meningioma exhibit an aggressive behavior and thus are considered as high- or intermediate risk tumors. Given the unsatisfactory rates of disease control and survival after primary or adjuvant radiation therapy, optimization of treatment strategies is needed. We investigated the potential of dose-painting intensity-modulated proton beam-therapy (IMPT) for intermediate- and high-risk meningioma. Material(s) and Method(s): Imaging data from five patients undergoing proton beam-therapy were used. The dose-painting target was defined using [68]Ga-[1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane tetraacetic acid]- d-Phe1,Tyr3-octreotate ([68]Ga-DOTATATE)-positron emission tomography (PET) in target delineation. IMPT and photon intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment plans were generated for each patient using an in-house developed treatment planning system (TPS) supporting spot-scanning technology and a commercial TPS, respectively. Doses of 66 Gy (2.2 Gy/fraction) and 54 Gy (1.8 Gy/fraction) were prescribed to the PET-based planning target volume (PTVPET) and the union of PET- and anatomical imaging-based PTV, respectively, in 30 fractions, using simultaneous integrated boost. Result(s): Dose coverage of the PTVsPET was equally good or slightly better in IMPT plans: dose inhomogeneity was 10 +/- 3% in the IMPT plans vs. 13 +/- 1% in the IMRT plans (p = 0.33). The brain Dmean and brainstem D50 were small in the IMPT plans: 26.5 +/- 1.5 Gy(RBE) and 0.002 +/- 0.0 Gy(RBE), respectively, vs. 29.5 +/- 1.5 Gy (p = 0.001) and 7.5 +/- 11.1 Gy (p = 0.02) for the IMRT plans, respectively. The doses delivered to the optic structures were also decreased with IMPT. Conclusion(s): Dose-painting IMPT is technically feasible using currently available planning tools and resulted in dose conformity of the dose-painted target comparable to IMRT with a significant reduction of radiation dose delivered to the brain, brainstem and optic apparatus. Dose escalation with IMPT may improve tumor control and decrease radiation-induced toxicity.Copyright © 2015 Madani et al.; licensee BioMed Central.",Excluded
1717,"Selection of comparable anatomical locations of muscle cross-sectional images in the Osteoarthritis Initiative MRI data Purpose: Muscle forces and cross sectional areas (CSA) play an important role in the onset and progression of OA. The OA Initiative provides images of muscle CSAs of both limbs. These images are acquired starting 10 cm proximally of the distal epiphyseal line of the femur and cover 15 slices of 0.5 mm (7.5 cm) in proximal direction. The images therefore have a variable anatomical location with regard to the femur and thigh muscles in short and tall individuals, and this poses limits on the comparability between participants in cross sectional studies. The objectives were therefore to determine a) the location of the 15 slices in relation to the femur (%length) in persons with variable body height, b) which part of the femur (% length) is covered in all subjects, and c) whether the inter-subject variability of the location of these cross sectional images (versus the femoral length) can be effectively reduced, when accounting for differences in body height. Method(s): Clinical data, MR images of the thigh muscles, and full limb X-rays from 48 OA participants with calculated Kellgren Lawrence grade 3 were studied (OAI public data sets 0.2.2, 0.E.1, 1.E.1). The subjects were selected to cover the full body height distribution in men and women. In the women (n=24), the body height ranged from 151.1 to 180.2 cm, and in the men (n=24) from 162.8 to 188.8 cm. From the full-limb X-rays, the femoral length (distance of the knee joint space to the proximal end of the femoral head was determined in vertical direction. The position of the epiphyseal line (in the femur) was measured in MRI scout views which were used to plan the thigh muscle MRI acquisitions. Result(s): The femoral length (F) in the full-limb X-rays varied from 47.3 to 55.1 cm in men, and from 44.2 to 55.9 cm in women The relationship between F and the body height (H) was similar in men and women (F=29.4% of H in women [min:27.5%, max:31.5%], and F=30.0% of H in men [min: 27.9%, max:33.8%]). Linear regression analysis provided the equations F=0.29xH mm + 15.7mm for men (r2=63%) and F=0.33 x Hmm - 51.93mm for women (r2=57%) as estimates of F. The epiphyseal line was clearly visible in 24 of the 48 MRI scout views; its relative position in the femur (from distal) was 6.0% in women (min:3.4%; max:8.5%), and 7.2% in men (min:5.5%, max:8.8%), The location was significantly different (p=0.03) between sexes. From these data, it was derived that a region of 29.4% to 36.7% of the femoral length (from distal) was covered by the 15 axial MRI muscle slices in all men, and a region between 31.1% and 35.7% in all women, across the full range of body heights. Therefore a target slice located at 33% of F (from distal to proximal) was selected, so that all participants could be included in a measurement, independent of body height. This location corresponded to slice No7 (from distal to proximal) in a person of average height (=mean across the 48 subjects). When selecting slice No7 in every participant, its location varied between 30% and 37% of the femoral length (standard deviation [SD]=1.5%). When choosing the most appropriate slice after accounting for differences in body height (slice number 4 to 9), its location varied only between 32.5% and 33.5% (SD=0.3%). Conclusion(s): Measurement of the femoral length and the epiphyseal line allows for the precise selection of comparable slices for measuring muscle CSAs in subjects with different heights. In cases where no full limb radiographs are available, the use of body height (H) as an estimate of femoral length (F) can reduce the variability of the slice location as expressed by the standard deviation by a factor of 5 compared with choosing the same slice across all subjects.",Excluded

2209,"Does mountaineering increase the incidence of cutaneous melanoma? A hypothesis based on cancer registry data Exposure to ultraviolet radiation is considered a major risk factor for the development of cutaneous melanoma. In white populations in Australia or the USA, the melanoma incidence increases with the vicinity of residence to the equator. In Europe decreasing incidence rates towards southern countries may be due to the darker pigmentation of the Mediterranean population. The comparison of age-standardized incidence rates (world standard population) in Europe shows that Swiss cancer registries and the Austrian Tyrol registry have much higher incidence rates for cutaneous melanoma than other Central European cancer registries. The excess of Swiss/Austrian incidence rates is even more pronounced when head localization is analysed separately. Due to the altitude-related increase in UV radiation two possible explanations for the Swiss/Austrian excess rates may be considered: firstly, as a result of the altitude of residence, higher UV exposure is generally present in these countries; secondly, mountaineering activities may additionally increase UV exposure.",Excluded

Eye Physics I-125 plaque treatment modeled with Plaque Simulator (PS) software yields similar results to COMS. Herein, we report results from a series of 15 patients treated with ruthenium-106 (Ru-106) plaque brachytherapy using PS pretreatment modeling for plaque localization and dosimetry., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fifteen patients with medium-sized choroidal melanomas (2.84-5.5 mm in apical height and a basal diameter of 7.8-12.6 mm) treated with ruthenium brachytherapy from 2003 to 2005 were evaluated retrospectively. Baseline and followup data were evaluated for tumor height, best corrected visual acuity, radiation retinopathy, radiation optic neuropathy, postradiation cataract formation, diplopia, and ptosis. Tumor response for both Ru-106 and I-125 plaques planned using the same PS pretreatment modeling was evaluated and compared., RESULTS: Isotope-specific radiation profiles were compared, and rates of local treatment failure (0%), optic neuropathy (6.7%), retinopathy (20%), and cataracts (33%) were evaluated. Five year-treated tumor heights were approximately 0.61 +/- 0.29 (I-125, n = 16) and 0.53 +/- 0.17 (Ru-106, n = 6) of their heights at diagnosis., CONCLUSIONS: This patient subset had background characteristics very similar to those of the COMS and patients treated at our institution with I-125 plaques. Treatment response was equivalent although radiation complications occurred slightly less frequently in the Ru-106 group compared with those treated with I-125. Image-guided three-dimensional pretreatment modeling for plaque localization and dosimetry seems to work equally as well for Ru as for I-125 plaques and justifies more extensive investigation.

1305,"The effect of head-to-trunk position on the direction of arm movements before, during, and after space flight This contribution deals with the examination of the consequences of different head-to-trunk positions on arm movements under normal gravity and during prolonged space flight. One of the objectives of this study was to investigate the influence of weightlessness on the condition of the spatial analysis system. Aimed arm movements in the horizontal plane (pointings towards two visual targets) were recorded, first with eyes open, head straight (learning part), then with eyes closed, head straight and during yaw or roll position of the head (performance part). Measurements related to these different head-to-trunk-positions were taken in one short-term and nine long-term cosmonauts preflight, inflight, and postflight. Terrestrial control experiments were carried out with an extended experimental design in 14 healthy volunteers. The analysis of these experiments revealed that, with eyes closed and the head in yaw position, cosmonauts before flight and control subjects exhibit significant slants of the movement plane of the arm. Contrary to terrestrial measurements, in space experiments roll tilt of the head to the right is correlated with considerable counterclockwise slant of the movement plane. This slant of the movement plane of the arm was interpreted as tilt of the internal representation of the horizontal coordinate. The effect is larger with greater distortion induced by the changed head position and with larger muscular involvement to keep this position. This effect is also increased by the reduction of information (for example, in microgravity). The amount and the direction of the horizontal offset of the arm movements are shown to be dependent on the head-to-trunk position, too. Additionally, we have found changes in the amplitude and in the duration of the arm movement, in the vertical offset, and in the curvature of the movement paths, depending on the experimental conditions.",Excluded
1563,"Injectable bone graft for the repair of nonunion of midshaft clavicular fracture after internal fixation BACKGROUND: Treatment of nonunion of clavicular fractures usually requires the insertion of bone material to facilitate bone healing. Injectable bone grafts have been successfully used in the treatment of limb fractures and lumbar fusion. However, there are few studies on its use in the treatment of nonunion. OBJECTIVE(S): To investigate the clinical effect of injection bone graft in the treatment of nonunion of clavicle fracture after internal fixation. METHOD(S): Totally 13 patients (9 males and 4 females aged 19-54 years old) with nonunion after internal fixation of clavicular fractures in the middle segment of the clavicle, who were treated in the No. 908 Hospital of Joint Logistic Support Force of Chinese PLA from January 2015 to December 2016, were selected. All of them were treated with ALLOMATRIX injection bone graft. Postoperative follow-up was conducted for 12 months. The fracture healing quality was evaluated by Lane-Sandhu X-ray score, and the shoulder joint function was evaluated by Constant score. This experiment was approved by the Ethics Committee of No. 908 Hospital of Joint Logistic Support Force of Chinese PLA.

1838,"Experience with intensity-modulated radiotherapy in the treatment of head and neck cancer Purpose; Studies using intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in the treatment of head and neck tumors have shown to decrease acute and late radiation toxicity However, the high conformity of this technique can increase the risk of recurrence due to geographic miss. The aim of this study was to analyze whether the results of IMRT met the theoretical expectations concerning treatment efficacy. Method(s): From a total of 185 patients (152 males and 33 females, mean age 58+/-10.36 years) 176 were evaluable and were studied. Eighty-nine (48.1%) patients had surgica, treatment and 50 of them were scheduled for concomitant cisplatin chemotherapy. Irradiation was performed using IMRT, a sliding window with 9 fields in a Varian 2100 C/D linear accelerator, X-ray beam, 6 Me V. The prescribed dose in the planning treatment volume (PTV1), i.e., the area of the primary tumor and nodal area, was 66 Gy/2.2 Gy-7C Gy/2.12 Gy. In the PTV2 (the area at high risk) the dose was 60Gy/2 Gy-59.4 Gy/1.8 Gy, and in the PTV 3 (the area treated with prophylactic irradiation) the prescribed dose was 54 Gy/1.8 Gy-50.4 Gy/1.53 Gy. Result(s): The 3-year overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival RFS of IMRT-treated patients, most of whom were in stages III and IV (158 out of 177), were 50 and 57%, respectively. Using postoperative radiotherapy/chemo-radiotherapy 3-year locoregioncal control was achieved in 75% of the cases as compared with 35% in non-operated patients. Conclusion(s): The worst outcomes were found in oral cavity and hypopharyngeal tumors, and the best in laryngeal and oropharyngeal tumors. Better results were found in surgically treated patients, and in lower disease stages. Despite the high conformity of dose distribution and efforts to spare healthy tissues, most cases of locoregional relapse occurred in areas receiving the full radiation dose.

1271,"Effects of parental radiation exposure on developmental instability in grasshoppers Mutagenic and epigenetic effects of environmental stressors and their transgenerational consequences are of interest to evolutionary biologists because they can amplify natural genetic variation. We studied the effect of parental exposure to radioactive contamination on offspring development in lesser marsh grasshopper Chorthippus albomarginatus. We used a geometric morphometric approach to measure fluctuating asymmetry (FA), wing shape and wing size. We measured time to sexual maturity to check whether parental exposure to radiation influenced offspring developmental trajectory and tested effects of radiation on hatching success and parental fecundity. Wings were larger in early maturing individuals born to parents from high radiation sites compared to early maturing individuals from low radiation sites. As time to sexual maturity increased, wing size decreased but more sharply in individuals from high radiation sites. Radiation exposure did not significantly affect FA or shape in wings nor did it significantly affect hatching success and fecundity. Overall, parental radiation exposure can adversely affect offspring development and fitness depending on developmental trajectories although the cause of this effect remains unclear. We suggest more direct measures of fitness and the inclusion of replication in future studies to help further our understanding of the relationship between developmental instability, fitness and environmental stress.

Proton therapy may offer an advantage in the reirradiation setting due to the lack of exit dose and potential sparing of previously radiated normal tissues., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between June 2010 and February 2014, 14 patients with a history of thoracic radiation and newly diagnosed or locally recurrent esophageal cancer began proton beam reirradiation on a prospective trial. Primary endpoints were feasibility and acute toxicity. Toxicity was graded according Common Toxicity Criteria version 4.0., RESULTS: The median follow-up was 10 months (2-25 months) from the start of reirradiation. Eleven patients received concurrent chemotherapy. The median interval between radiation courses was 32 months (10-307 months). The median reirradiation prescription dose was 54.0 Gy (relative biological effectiveness [RBE]) (50.4-61.2 Gy[RBE]), and the median cumulative prescription dose was 109.8 Gy (76-129.4 Gy). Of the 10 patients who presented with symptomatic disease, 4 patients had complete resolution of symptoms, and 4 had diminished or stable symptoms. Two patients had progressive symptoms. The median time to symptom recurrence was 10 months. Maximum acute nonhematologic toxicity attributable to radiation was grade 2 (64%, N=9), 3 (29%, N=4), 4 (0%), and 5 (7%, N=1). The acute grade 5 toxicity was an esophagopleural fistula more likely related to tumor progression than radiation. Grade 3 nonhematologic acute toxicities included dysphagia, dehydration, and pneumonia. There was 1 late grade 5 esophageal ulcer more likely related to tumor progression than radiation. There were 4 late grade 3 toxicities: heart failure, esophageal stenosis requiring dilation, esophageal ulceration from tumor, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube dependence. The median time to local failure was 10 months, and the median overall survival was 14 months., CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that proton reirradiation is feasible, with an encouraging symptom control rate, modest radiation-related toxicity, and favorable survival in this high-risk population.

1441,"Solid cancer risk dependence on the Pasquill-Gifford atmospheric stability classes in a radiological event In a radiological event, the lack of preliminary information about the site of explosion and the difficulty in predicting the accurate path and distribution of radioactive plumes makes it difficult to predict expected health effects of exposed individuals. So far, in such a health evaluation, radiation-induced stochastic health effects such as cancer are not included. The Pasquill-Gifford atmospheric classes generally allow connecting atmospheric stability with dispersion of radioactive contaminants to the environment. In this work, an environmental release of radioactive Cs-137 was simulated and the resulting relative risk for solid cancer incidence among the affected population calculated. The HotSpot health physics code was used to simulate the radioactive atmospheric dispersion and calculate the Total Effective Dose Equivalent (TEDE), which was then used to estimate the relative risk of cancer incidence. The main results from this work suggest that the relative cancer risk and atmospheric stability classes are linked by differences in the TEDE. Such a finding may support triage, because it adds additional information on the potentially affected population at the early stages of an emergency response.",Excluded
1713,"Treatment of nonresectable hepatocellular carcinoma with intrahepatic 90Y-microspheres Treatment for nonresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is palliative. The relatively greater arteriolar density of hepatic tumors compared with normal liver suggests that intrahepatic arterial administration of 90Y-microspheres can be selectively deposited in tumor nodules and results in significantly greater radiation exposure to the tumor than external irradiation. The purpose of this study was to determine the proportion (frequency) and duration of response, survival, and toxicity after intrahepatic arterial injection of 90Y-microspheres in patients with HCC. Method(s): Patients with documented HCC, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-3, adequate bone marrow, and hepatic and pulmonary function were eligible for study. Patients who had significant shunting of blood to the lungs or gastrointestinal (GI) tract or who could not undergo cannulation of the hepatic artery were excluded. Patients received a planned dose of 100 Gy through a catheter placed into the hepatic artery. Result(s): Twenty-two patients were treated with 90Y-microspheres; 20 of the treated patients (median age, 62.5 y) were evaluated for treatment efficacy. Nine patients were Okuda stage I, and 11 were Okuda stage II. The median dose delivered was 104 Gy (range, 46-145 Gy). All 22 treated patients experienced at least 1 adverse event. Of the 31 (15%) serious adverse events, the most common were elevations in liver enzymes and bilirubin and upper GI ulceration. The response rate was 20%. The median duration of response was 127 wk; the median survival was 54 wk. Multivariable analysis suggested that a dose >104 Gy (P = 0.06), tumor-to-liver activity uptake ratio >2 (P = 0.06), and Okuda stage I (P = 0.07) were associated with longer survival.

We obtained radon testing data to evaluate patterns of radon testing in Allentown, the third largest city in Pennsylvania. Radon exposure is the second leading cause of lung cancer after smoking and is associated with over 21,000 lung cancer deaths in the US annually. It is estimated that 1 in every 15 homes in the US has elevated radon levels above the recommended action level set by the US Environmental Protection Agency. Allentown has some of the highest reported levels of indoor radon in the country, yet only a small portion of the population has tested their homes. This is true particularly among self-identified Hispanics, who make up nearly half of the city's population. This study seeks to (1) characterize the difference in testing rates between self-identified Hispanics and non-Hispanics in Allentown, (2) quantify the level of radon awareness and knowledge, (3) identify potential obstacles to radon testing among the Allentown population that self-identifies as Hispanic, and (4) determine whether more effective risk communication is needed. Method(s): Radon test results in Allentown were analyzed to better understand the nature of radon testing. To evaluate radon awareness and knowledge, a cross-sectional study was conducted using a face-to-face survey. This data was informative in assessing testing and mitigation practices, ethnicity, income level, age, education level, homeowner status, zip code and primary language. Result(s): Ethnicity was an independent predictor of radon awareness and knowledge. Statistically significant differences were found between the number of self-identified Hispanics (39%) and non-Hispanics (84%) who indicated that they had ever heard of radon; 13% of Hispanics and 49% of non-Hispanics knew that they lived in an area with typically high radon levels. There was a statistically significant association between self-reported ethnicity and radon testing with non-Hispanics (43%) more likely to test their homes for radon than Hispanics (32%). Conclusion(s): Individual and community understanding of the risks of exposure to radiation sources such as radon is dependent upon communication that informs and spurs appropriate action. This study demonstrates the need for culturally appropriate radon risk communication strategies targeted to a Hispanic population. Successful communication will raise awareness and knowledge that can lead to better public health protection.© 2020, Copyright © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group LLC.",Excluded
1279,"Does Vacuum-assisted Closure Reduce the Risk of Wound Complications in Patients With Lower Extremity Sarcomas Treated With Preoperative Radiation? BACKGROUND: Although preoperative radiation followed by wide local excision yields excellent local control in soft tissue sarcomas, the risk of wound complications is reported to be higher compared with the incidence in patients who were administered postoperative radiation therapy. Vacuum (vac)-assisted closure may improve wound healing, but it is unknown whether vac-assisted closure during soft tissue sarcoma resection may reduce the risk of wound complications or impair local disease control., QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Does the use of a wound vac application at the time of soft tissue sarcoma resection reduce the risk of developing wound complications after lower extremity sarcoma resection? (2) Is vac-assisted closure associated with an increased risk of local relapse?, METHODS: From 2000 to 2016, 312 patients with stage I to III soft tissue sarcomas were treated. Of these, 123 were treated with preoperative radiation +/- chemotherapy followed by limb-sparing resection based on tumor location, size, grade, histology, and patient age. There was a minimum followup of 12 months. Radiation was delivered generally based on tumor size, grade, superficial versus deep nature, and proximity to neurovascular structures. Chemotherapy was administered in patients < 70 years old with high-grade tumors and tumors > 5 cm. Patient, demographic, and treatment variables, including incisional vac application and wound outcomes, were retrospectively evaluated. Incisional vac-assisted closure took place at the time of primary resection in 32% (46 of 123) of patients. Vac-assisted closure was considered when there was a concern for risk of external contamination such as instances in which fixation of adhesives would be difficult or regions where there was a high risk of contamination. Vac-assisted closure may have also been used in instances with increased wound tension at closure or with heightened concern for shearing on the wound such as buttock wounds. Ten patients were lost to followup, two in the vac group and eight in the non-vac group. Potential factors associated with wound complications were evaluated using Fisher's exact test for univariate analysis and logistic regression for multivariate analysis. Local recurrence-free survival was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier estimate., RESULTS: After taking into consideration factors such as tumor size, location, age, and patient comorbidities, it was shown that patients who underwent vac-assisted closure were less likely to experience wound complications compared with patients who did not undergo vac-assisted closure (odds ratio, 0.129; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.041-0.398; p = 0.004). The local control incidence in the entire cohort was 98%. With the numbers available, Kaplan-Meier survivorship free from local recurrence did not differ between patients treated with or without the vac (100% [95% CI, 154.09-154.09] versus 96% [95% CI, 152.21-169.16]; p = 0.211), respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Vac-assisted closure at the time of resection of proximal lower extremity soft tissue sarcomas is associated with a lower risk of wound complications, and its use apparently did not compromise local control. We show that the use of vac-assisted closure may be worth considering in surgeons' attempts to reduce the risk of wound complications among patients with soft tissue sarcomas of the proximal lower extremities., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, therapeutic study.",Included
2211,"Totally automatic definition of renal regions of interest from 99mTc-MAG3 renograms: validation in patients with normal kidneys and in patients with suspected renal obstruction INTRODUCTION: An image-processing algorithm (AUTOROI) has been developed to totally automatically (or with manual assistance) detect whole-kidney contours and generate renal regions of interest (ROI) for the extraction of the quantitative measurements used in the interpretation of Tc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine (Tc-MAG3) renograms., METHODS: The 18-20th min dynamic frames post-MAG3 injection were used to automatically define boxes surrounding each kidney, which were then transposed to an early composite image for interpolative and directional background subtraction. Sobel operator and unsharp masking were applied for edge enhancement, and the resulting image histograms were equalized to better define poorly functioning kidneys. AUTOROI searched radially from the center of mass to define each kidney's ROI coordinates. AUTOROI was validated using MAG3 studies from 79 patients referred for suspected obstruction (79 left, 77 right kidneys) and 19 kidney donors with normal kidney function and no obstruction. Renal ROIs were manually defined by a nuclear medicine technologist with 20+ years of experience (reference standard) and an American Board of Nuclear Medicine certified physician. AUTOROI and physician ROIs were automatically compared with the reference standard to determine the border definition error., RESULTS: AUTOROI totally automatically detected the renal borders in 89% (172 of 194) of the kidneys from the entire group of 98 patients. The 22 kidneys missed automatically were subsequently detected with the assistance of a single manually placed fiducial point demarcating the liver/kidney boundary. These 22 kidneys were shown to be associated with markedly reduced MAG3 clearance. The mean error of AUTOROI for all 194 kidneys was 6.66+/-3.77 and 7.31+/-4.52 mm for the left and right kidney, respectively. The physician's error was 6.78+/-2.42 and 6.65+/-2.05 mm for the left and right kidney, respectively. This error difference between AUTOROI and the physician was not statistically significant., CONCLUSION: AUTOROI provides an objective and promising approach to automated renal ROI detection.",Excluded
1375,"Increased oxidative stress in barn swallows from the Chernobyl region The Chernobyl nuclear accident produced the largest unintended release of radionuclides in history, with dramatic consequences for humans and other organisms. Exposure to ionizing radiation is known to reduce circulating and stored levels of specific antioxidants in birds and humans, thus potentially increasing oxidative stress. However, overall effects of radioactive exposure on oxidative status have never been investigated in any free ranging vertebrate. We measured plasma antioxidant capacity and concentration of reactive oxygen metabolites in adult barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) from colonies with variable background radiation levels in the Chernobyl region in Ukraine and Belarus. We predicted that antioxidants would decrease while reactive oxygen metabolites would increase with exposure to increasing levels of radiation at the breeding sites. Consistent with this expectation, radiation level positively predicted plasma concentration of reactive oxygen metabolites, whereas no significant covariation was found with non-enzymatic plasma antioxidant capacity. An index of oxidative stress was also larger in barn swallows exposed to high contamination levels. Thus, radioactive contamination appeared to be responsible for the increased generation of reactive oxygen metabolites and the imbalance between reactive oxygen metabolites and non-enzymatic plasma antioxidant capacity. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

1766,"Analysis of EPR and FISH studies of radiation doses in persons who lived in the upper reaches of the Techa River Waterborne radioactive releases into the Techa River from the Mayak Production Association in Russia during 1949-1956 resulted in significant doses to about 30,000 persons who lived in downstream settlements. The residents were exposed to internal and external radiation. Two methods for reconstruction of the external dose are considered in this paper, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements of teeth, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) measurements of chromosome translocations in circulating lymphocytes. The main issue in the application of the EPR and FISH methods for reconstruction of the external dose for the Techa Riverside residents was strontium radioisotopes incorporated in teeth and bones that act as a source of confounding local exposures. In order to estimate and subtract doses from incorporated (89,90)Sr, the EPR and FISH assays were supported by measurements of (90)Sr-body burdens and estimates of (90)Sr concentrations in dental tissues by the luminescence method. The resulting dose estimates derived from EPR to FISH measurements for residents of the upper Techa River were found to be consistent: The mean values vary from 510 to 550 mGy for the villages located close to the site of radioactive release to 130-160 mGy for the more distant villages. The upper bound of individual estimates for both methods is equal to 2.2-2.3 Gy. The EPR- and FISH-based dose estimates were compared with the doses calculated for the donors using the most recent Techa River Dosimetry System (TRDS). The TRDS external dose assessments are based on the data on contamination of the Techa River floodplain, simulation of air kerma above the contaminated soil, age-dependent lifestyles and individual residence histories. For correct comparison, TRDS-based doses were calculated from two sources: external exposure from the contaminated environment and internal exposure from (137)Cs incorporated in donors' soft tissues. It is shown here that the TRDS-based absorbed doses in tooth enamel and muscle are in agreement with EPR- and FISH-based estimates within uncertainty bounds. Basically, this agreement between the estimates has confirmed the validity of external doses calculated with the TRDS.",Excluded
1531,"Harderian Gland Tumorigenesis: Low-Dose and LET Response Increased cancer risk remains a primary concern for travel into deep space and may preclude manned missions to Mars due to large uncertainties that currently exist in estimating cancer risk from the spectrum of radiations found in space with the very limited available human epidemiological radiation-induced cancer data. Existing data on human risk of cancer from X-ray and gamma-ray exposure must be scaled to the many types and fluences of radiations found in space using radiation quality factors and dose-rate modification factors, and assuming linearity of response since the shapes of the dose responses at low doses below 100 mSv are unknown. The goal of this work was to reduce uncertainties in the relative biological effect (RBE) and linear energy transfer (LET) relationship for space-relevant doses of charged-particle radiation-induced carcinogenesis. The historical data from the studies of Fry et al. and Alpen et al. for Harderian gland (HG) tumors in the female CB6F1 strain of mouse represent the most complete set of experimental observations, including dose dependence, available on a specific radiation-induced tumor in an experimental animal using heavy ion beams that are found in the cosmic radiation spectrum. However, these data lack complete information on low-dose responses below 0.1 Gy, and for chronic low-dose-rate exposures, and there are gaps in the LET region between 25 and 190 keV/mum. In this study, we used the historical HG tumorigenesis data as reference, and obtained HG tumor data for 260 MeV/u silicon (LET ~70 keV/mum) and 1,000 MeV/u titanium (LET ~100 keV/mum) to fill existing gaps of data in this LET range to improve our understanding of the dose-response curve at low doses, to test for deviations from linearity and to provide RBE estimates. Animals were also exposed to five daily fractions of 0.026 or 0.052 Gy of 1,000 MeV/u titanium ions to simulate chronic exposure, and HG tumorigenesis from this fractionated study were compared to the results from single 0.13 or 0.26 Gy acute titanium exposures. Theoretical modeling of the data show that a nontargeted effect model provides a better fit than the targeted effect model, providing important information at space-relevant doses of heavy ions.",Excluded
2330,"A pilot study of continuous, hyperfractionated, accelerated radiotherapy in rectal adenocarcinoma This pilot study investigated the feasibility, toxicity and effect of continuous, hyperfractionated, accelerated radiotherapy (CHART) in 19 patients with adenocarcinoma of the rectum who were treated at Mount Vernon Hospital between April 1992 and April 1994. A total dose of 54 Gy was given in 36 fractions over 12 consecutive days; three fractions of 1.5 Gy were employed each day with an interfraction interval of 6 hours. Of these 19 patients, 13 had local pelvic recurrence from rectal carcinoma, four had a primary rectal carcinoma (which was unsuitable for abdominoperineal resection because of patient frailty), and two had large, fixed, unresectable tumours and were given radiotherapy preoperatively to a lower dose of 42 Gy in 28 fractions over 10 days to facilitate surgery. However, none of the 19 patients subsequently underwent surgical resection. Treatment compliance with radiotherapy was 95%. Acute bowel toxicity was assessed by means of a daily bowel chart for 6 weeks and then at 8, 12 and 26 weeks after the completion of radiotherapy. Patients were subsequently scored using the World Health Organization (WHO) grading system. No toxic deaths were observed in this study. There were five grade 3 and one grade 4 toxicities (WHO scale) observed in six patients. There has been minimal acute bladder toxicity in two patients and skin reactions have been surprisingly minimal in all but three patients. Small bowel obstruction and late bowel damage, possibly attributable to radiotherapy, occurred in three patients. Complete pain relief was achieved in recurrent rectal cancer in 100% of patients, at a median of 15 days since commencing radiotherapy (range 7-63 days), and has been maintained for mean and median durations of 19 and 18 months respectively (range 1.5-45 months). Five patients have had a recurrence of pain at 3, 4, 8, 9 and 18 months respectively. All four patients with primary rectal adenocarcinoma achieved a complete response, which has been sustained for 4 months (until death), 54 and 57 months, although one patient relapsed locally at 8 months. In summary, CHART appears to be a feasible treatment for pelvic tumours with regard to toxicity. Patients with pain from a locoregional recurrence achieved rapid complete pain relief, which was sustained for many months.",Excluded
1842,"Vertebral fracture assessment: A valid tool to detect vertebral fractures in elderly community Introduction: Vertebral fractures (VFx) are associated with higher morbidity and mortality, increasing the risk of incident fractures. Although only 30% of the VFx cause symptoms, this finding is a relevant issue for managing patients with high fracture risk, as well prevention of new fractures, independently of bone mineral density. Studies have shown effectiveness of Vertebral Fracture Assessment (VFA) to detect prevalent VFx comparable to the spine X-ray, considered as gold standard method. The aim of this study was to compare the performance between VFA and X-ray to identify VFx in healthy elderly men and women from community. Patients and Methods: 429 non-institutionalized subjects (60% women), aged over 65 years, from community (Butanta area, Sao Paulo, Brazil) were enrolled in this cohort. VFA by DXA measurements and spine X-ray (T4 to L4) were analyzed according to semiquantitative method (Genant HK, 1993). The first one was evaluated by two expert rheumatologists by consensus between them. The second one was evaluated by one expert radiologist. The interobserver correlation between VFA and spine X-ray to identify VFx was analyzed by kappa (k) scores. P<0.05 was set as significant. Result(s): The prevalence of VFx in both methods was 29.4%, without significant difference between men and women. Unavailable vertebrae were significantly lower in spine X-ray than VFA (1% and 5.5% respectively, p<0.001), especially among T4-T6. According to VFA, 5013 (96%) vertebrae were considered as normal, 144 (2.7%) had grade 1 fractures, 58 (1.1%) with grade 2 fractures and 12 (0.2) grade 3 fractures. To identify VFx, the sensitivity of VFA was 73% and the specificity was 99.1%. After excluding deformities grade 1, the sensitivity increased to 93% and specificity to 99.6%. The correlation between VFA and X-ray was good (k=0.74). Again, without grade 1, the agreement was also better (k=0.84). The correlation vertebrae by vertebrae between VFA and spine X-ray was lower in T5-T7. There was not significant difference between methods, according by gender (k=0.72 in men, k=0.75 in women). Conclusion. In elderly community, VFA had similar performance to conventional spine X-ray to identify VFx in visible vertebrae. The sensitivity increased after excluding of mild deformities. Thus, this methodology is easy and feasible to be performed during routine DXA measurements, in order to improve the management of patients with higher risk of osteoporotic fractures.",Excluded
2165,"Characteristic imaging findings predicting the risk of conservative treatment resistance in fresh osteoporotic vertebral fractures with poor prognostic features on magnetic resonance imaging Background: Recent studies have reported that confined high-intensity and diffuse low-intensity on sagittal T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are distinctive features that are highly predictive of delayed union or nonunion on osteoporotic vertebral fracture (OVF). The objective of this study was to identify the characteristics of imaging findings predicting the risk for requiring surgical treatment in fresh OVF with poor prognostic features on MRI. Method(s): We conducted a retrospective study of 74 patients (17 men and 57 women with a mean age of 81.1 years) of OVF with the poor prognostic MRI findings. We compared the imaging findings between the surgery group (16 patients) and the conservative group (58 patients): vertebral instability defined as the difference between the vertebral collapse ratio in dynamic X-rays, and the grade of posterior wall injury (Grade I, no spinal canal encroachment; Grade II, <2 mm; Grade III, >=2 mm) as well as the presence or absence of pedicle fracture (Grade I, none; Grade II, unilateral; Grade III, bilateral) on computed tomography. Result(s): The mean vertebral instability was 24.0% +/- 10.1% in the surgery group and 13.0% +/- 7.8% in the conservative group, which was significantly different. Posterior wall injury in the surgery and conservative groups was Grade I in 0 and 29 cases, Grade II in 5 and 21 cases, and Grade III in 11 and 8 cases, respectively, constituting a significant difference. Pedicle fracture in the surgery and conservative groups was Grade I in 5 and 55 cases, Grade II in 6 and 2 cases, and Grade III in 5 and 1 case, respectively, also constituting a significant difference. Conclusion(s): The most high-risk OVF patients with poor prognostic MRI findings who required surgical treatment were those who exhibited greater vertebral instability as well as either more severe posterior wall injury or pedicle fracture.

2294,"Clinical implementation of an emergency department coronary computed tomographic angiography protocol for triage of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome Objectives: To evaluate the efficiency and safety of emergency department (ED) coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) during a 3-year clinical experience. Method(s): Single-center registry of coronary CTA in consecutive ED patients with suspicion of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The primary outcome was efficiency of coronary CTA defined as the length of hospitalization. Secondary endpoints of safety were defined as the rate of downstream testing, normalcy rates of invasive coronary angiography (ICA), absence of missed ACS, and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) during follow-up, and index radiation exposure. Result(s): One thousand twenty two consecutive patients were referred for clinical coronary CTA with suspicion of ACS. Overall, median time to discharge home was 10.5 (5.7-24.1) hours. Patient disposition was 42.7 % direct discharge from the ED, 43.2 % discharge from emergency unit, and 14.1 % hospital admission. ACS rate during index hospitalization was 9.1 %. One hundred ninety two patients underwent additional diagnostic imaging and 77 underwent ICA. The positive predictive value of CTA compared to ICA was 78.9 % (95 %-CI 68.1-87.5 %). Median CT radiation exposure was 4.0 (2.5-5.8) mSv. No ACS was missed; MACE at follow-up after negative CTA was 0.2 %. Conclusion(s): Coronary CTA in an experienced tertiary care setting allows for efficient and safe management of patients with suspicion for ACS. Key points: * ED Coronary CTA using advanced systems is associated with low radiation exposure. * Negative coronary CTA is associated with low rates of MACE. * CTA in ED patients enables short median time to discharge home. * CTA strategy is characterized by few downstream tests including unnecessary ICA.Copyright © 2016, European Society of Radiology.",Excluded
2044,"Use of radiomics combined with machine learning method in the recurrence patterns after intensity-modulated radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma: A preliminary study Objective: To analyze the recurrence patterns and reasons in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and to investigate the feasibility of radiomics for analysis of radioresistance. Method(s): We analyzed 306 NPC patients treated with IMRT from Jul-2009 to Aug-2016, 20 of whom developed with recurrence. For the NPCs with recurrence, CT, MR, or PET/CT images of recurrent disease were registered with the primary planning CT for dosimetry analysis. The recurrences were defined as in-field, marginal or out-of-field, according to dose-volume histogram (DVH) of the recurrence volume. To explore the predictive power of radiomics for NPCs with in-field recurrences (NPC-IFR), 16 NPCs with non-progression disease (NPC-NPD) were used for comparison. For these NPC-IFRs and NPC-NPDs, 1117 radiomic features were quantified from the tumor region using pretreatment spectral attenuated inversion-recovery T2-weighted (SPAIR T2W) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) was calculated to identify influential feature subset. Kruskal-Wallis test and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis were employed to assess the capability of each feature on NPC-IFR prediction. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed for feature reduction. Artificial neural network (ANN), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and support vector machine (SVM) models were trained and validated by using stratified 10-fold cross validation. Result(s): The median follow up was 26.5 (range 8-65) months. 9/20 (45%) occurred in the primary tumor, 8/20 (40%) occurred in regional lymph nodes, and 3/20 (15%) patients developed a primary and regional failure. Dosimetric and target volume analysis of the recurrence indicated that there were 18 in-field, and 1 marginal as well as 1 out-of-field recurrence. With pre-therapeutic SPAIR T2W MRI images available, 11 NPC-IFRs (11 of 18 NPC-IFRs who had available pre-therapeutic MRI) and 16 NPC-NPDs were subsequently employed for radiomic analysis. Results showed that NPC-IFRs vs. NPC-NPDs could be differentiated by 8 features (AUCs: 0.727-0.835). The classification models showed potential in prediction of NPC-IFR with higher accuracies (ANN: 0.812, KNN: 0.775, SVM: 0.732). Conclusion(s): In-field and high-dose region relapse were the main recurrence patterns which may be due to the radioresistance. After integration in the clinical workflow, radiomic analysis can be served as imaging biomarkers to facilitate early salvage for NPC patients who are at risk of in-field recurrence.Copyright © 2018 Li, Wang, Hou, Yang, Ren, Gao, Meng, Wu, Liu, Liu and Yan.

2074,"The risk of cataractogenesis after gamma knife radiosurgery: a nationwide population based case-control study BACKGROUND: Medical radiation is considered a factor responsible for cataractogenesis. However, the incidence of this ophthalmologic complication resulting from gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) has not yet been reported. The present study aimed to determine the risk of cataractogenesis associated with radiation exposure from GKRS., METHODS: This study used information from a random sample of one million persons enrolled in the nationally representative Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. The GK group consisted of patients who underwent GKRS between 2000 and 2009. The non-GK group was composed of subjects who had never undergone GKRS, but who were matched with the case group for time of enrollment, age, sex, history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and diabetes., RESULTS: There were 277 patients in the GK group and 2770 matched subjects in the non-GK group. The GK group had a higher overall incidence of cataracts (10.11% vs. 7.26%; crude hazard ratio [cHR], 1.59; 95% CI, 1.07-2.36; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.25; 95% CI, 0.82-1.90) than the non-GK group. Patients who had undergone computed tomography and/or cerebral angiography (CT/angio) studies had a higher risk of developing cataracts than those who did not (10.82% vs. 6.64%; cHR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.31-2.30; aHR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.22-2.23). The age group between 30 and 50 years had the highest risk of cataractogenesis in both the GK and CT/angio groups (cHR, 3.50; 95% CI, 1.58-7.72; aHR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.02-5.81; cHR, 2.96; 95% CI, 1.47-5.99; aHR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.05-4.93, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: Radiation exposure due to GKRS and CT/angio study may be independently associated with increased risk of cataractogenesis. We suggest routine dosimetry measurement of eye lens and proper protection for patients with benign lesions during GKRS. Regular follow-up imaging studies should avoid the use of CT/angio, and particular care should be taken in the 30-50-year-old age group, due to their significantly increased risk of cataract formation.",Included

This study was to explore rationality of irradiated area of lateral faciocervical field and lateral facial field through analyzing the data of some patients presenting locoregional recurrence after conventional radiotherapy. METHOD(S): Clinical data of the patients, treated in 1999 and presented locoregional failure and had reports of CT examinations before and after radiotherapy and after recurrence, were reviewed. The regions of recurrent lesions were analyzed. Dosimetric analysis of recurrent regions was performed for the patients with available data of irradiating fields. If no less than 95% of the volume of local recurrent lesion was within 95% isodose curve, it was defined as in-field failure; 20% to less than 95% of the volume was within 95% isodose curve as marginal failure; less than 20% of the volume was within 95% isodose curve as out-field failure. RESULT(S): Clinical data of 40 patients could be analyzed, and dosimetric analysis of recurrent regions was performed for 15 patients. Local recurrences mainly occurred in the nasopharyngeal cavity and the skull base bone. Dosimetric analysis showed 9 cases of in-field failure, 4 cases of marginal failure, and 2 cases of out-field failure. For the 6 cases of marginal and out-field failure, the main reasons of recurrence were low dose area in target volume due to not strictly following the guidelines of defining field limit, or inappropriately estimating the involved regions of lesions.

2005,"Smoking, chromosomal aberrations, and cancer incidence in healthy subjects Chromosomal aberrations (CAs) in peripheral blood lymphocytes can be used as biomarkers of cancer risk. Cytogenetic tests were conducted on 2396 healthy Hungarian individuals and cancer incidence was followed up from 1989 to 2018. Venous blood samples were obtained from the subjects and metaphases from lymphocyte cultures were prepared. We compared the CA frequencies of the various smoking (1-5; 6-10; 11-19; or 20-40 cigarettes/day) and exposure (irradiation; chemical industry; chemical research laboratory) groups. Chromatid break (p = 0.0002), total aberration (p = 0.002), and aberrant cell (p = 0.001) frequencies were higher in smokers than in non-smokers. For very heavy smokers, total CAs were significantly higher than for non-smokers (<0.001) or less intensive smokers (p = 0.003-0.0006). Intensity of smoking was a predictor of chromosomal aberrations, while duration was not. During follow-up, 177 (7.3 %) cancer cases were found. A Cox-regression model showed that subjects with cell values >=2 CAs developed cancer more frequently (hazard ratio = 1.39; 95 % CI, 1.02-1.90). The relative risks of cancer were 1.06 (95 % CI 0.53-2.06) for light smokers and 1.74 (95 % CI 1.08-2.77) for very heavy smokers. The distributions of cancer sites showed differences between smoker and non-smoker groups: in male smokers, lung cancer, in non-smokers, prostate, and in females (both groups) breast cancer were most common.

1656,"Detection of Upper Tract Urothelial Malignancies by Computed Tomography Urography in Patients Referred for Hematuria at a Large Tertiary Referral Center Objective To evaluate the age-stratified prevalence of upper tract urothelial malignancies diagnosed on computed tomography urography in a large cohort of patients referred for initial evaluation of hematuria. Materials and Methods A total of 1123 consecutive adults without a history of urothelial cancer underwent initial computed tomography urography for gross hematuria (n = 652), microscopic hematuria (n = 457), or unspecified hematuria (n = 14) at a single institution from October 2006 to October 2012. Imaging findings suggestive of urothelial lesions were correlated with clinical information, including cystoscopy, cytology, and surgical pathology reports. Patients subsequently diagnosed with urothelial cancer following a normal radiographic evaluation were identified and analyzed. Age, gender, smoking history, and location and type of malignancy were analyzed. Results Upper tract urothelial cancer was detected in 4 (0.36%) patients, with a mean age of 66.5 years. All 4 patients presented with gross hematuria and were current or former smokers. None of the 535 patients under age 55 who underwent computed tomography urography were diagnosed with upper tract disease regardless of age, smoking history, or degree of hematuria. Likewise, no upper tract cancers were detected in patients referred for microscopic hematuria, regardless of age. Conclusion Detection of upper tract urothelial cancer by computed tomography urography is exceedingly rare in patients presenting at a tertiary referral center with hematuria, particularly in the lower risk strata (younger age, microscopic hematuria). Further investigation into risk-stratified approaches to imaging for hematuria workup is warranted to minimize unnecessary costs and radiation exposure.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
2069,"Treatment of symptomatic atrial tachycardia in complex anatomic conditions: Use and outcome of ablation in patients after damus-kaye-stansel surgery Background: Atrial tachycardias (AT) are amongst the most frequent complications in adult patients with congenital heart disease (ACHD). Their incidence mainly depends on age and complexity of underlying defect. AT has a marked impact on morbidity and mortality and is associated with sudden cardiac death particularly in complex ACHD patients. The arrhythmic substrate can be variable from re-entry to multifocal resulting in demanding requirements for electrophysiologic ablation procedures (EP) and thus, relatively high rates of recurrence. Methods and Results: Retrospective analysis of ACHD patients with prior Damus-Kaye-Stansel (DKS) surgery treated at one of the largest specialized tertiary centers for ACHD patients worldwide. Analysis focussed on occurrence of AT, respective treatment and outcome of EP. Over a median observation time of 15 years, 13 patients with prior DKS surgery and complex congenital heart defects of different types but uniformly Fontan circulation, were identified (median age 22.0 years (IQR 20.5 - 25.5), 76.9% male, 92.3% NYHA Class I, median systemic ventricular ejection fraction 58.5%, 69.2% extracardiac tunnel). Seven patients (53.8%) presented with symptomatic AT (median cyclic length 440 ms (IQR 360.0 - 517.5)). Of these, six patients underwent EP. Median procedure time was 180.5 min (IQR 160.8 - 274.5), median fluoroscopy time 1.56 min (IQR 0.51 - 4.73) and radiofrequency time 851 sec (265.0 -2005.0). Remote magnetic navigation was used to access ablation site through a retrograde access via the aortic as well as the neo-aortic valve. Three-dimensional image integration aided in mapping and ablation. Throughout the procedure as well as in follow-up visits, no reportable complications were observed. After a mean of 1.5 procedures, all analysed patients stayed complaint-free throughout a median time-interval of 13 months. Conclusion(s): AT are frequent in complex univentricular situations after Damus-Kaye-Stansel surgery (53.8%). Although more than one procedure (mean 1.5) was necessary to achieve satisfactory results even in experienced hands, EP appears to be an appropriate treatment strategy in this young and otherwise healthy patient cohort. According to our analysis, EP is feasible and safe in centers with knowledge of specific anatomic characteristics of congenital heart disease and when the appropriate technical infrastructure is present. Access to ablation site was performed by remote magnetic navigation in the majority of procedures. The floppy catheter was navigated through the neo-aortic as well as through the aortic valve without observable peri- or postinterventional complications. Mapping with three-dimensional image integration facilitated EP and led to a relatively low radiation exposure with the known benefits for the patient as well as for the healthcare professionals involved in the procedure.",Excluded

1504,"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, glioblastoma multiforme, and impact on toxicities and overall survival: The mayo clinic experience Purpose: The diagnoses of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and depression are often found to coexist. The impact of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) on treatment-related toxicity and outcome in patients with GBM is unclear. Methods and Materials: We retrospectively reviewed 160 patients with GBM who received treatment at our institution between 1999 and 2008. Those taking an SSRI during treatment for GBM were identified and toxicities were assessed. Result(s): Median survival for the entire cohort was 1.05 years. A total of 35 patients (21.8%) took an SSRI during initial treatment for GBM. There was no statistical difference in the rate of >=grade 3 toxicity in patients taking an SSRI when compared with those who were not (11.4% vs. 13.6%, respectively; P = 1.00). Two-year survival in the cohort of patients taking an SSRI was 32% versus 17% in those who were not (P = 0.18). After making adjustment for age, recursive partitioning analysis class, and extent of surgery, absence of an SSRI during treatment was associated with a hazard risk of 1.5 (95% confidence interval = 1.00-2.42; P = 0.05). Conclusion(s): This retrospective review suggests that concomitant use of an SSRI during treatment does not adversely affect survival. There was no increased toxicity with the use of SSRI concurrent with treatment of newly-diagnosed GBM. Copyright © 2011 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Excluded

1442,"Determinants of Sunburn and Sun Protection of Agricultural Workers during Occupational and Recreational Activities Objective: The aim of this study was to identify determinants of occupational sunburn in agricultural workers and assess their occupational and recreational sun protection habits. Method(s): Specific surveys of agricultural workers in Switzerland and France were conducted (N=1538). Multivariate logistic regressions identified occupational sunburn determinants. Occupational and recreational sun protection habits were estimated and correlated. Result(s): One-year occupational and recreational sunburn prevalences were 19.8% and 11.5%, respectively. Occupational sunburn increased with having a recent recreational sunburn, highly sensitive skin, young age, high perceived skin cancer risk, using sunscreen, and not wearing a hat. Correlation between protection habits during work and leisure was substantial (r s 0.5 to 0.7). Skin health knowledge was high and pro-tanning attitude moderate. Conclusion(s): Potentially modifiable sunburn determinants and suboptimal recreational and occupational sun protection practices were identified in agricultural workers. Refining and tailoring sun protection messages targeting the agricultural sector are needed.© Copyright 2017 American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine.",Excluded
1328,"Monochromatic excimer light (308 nm): an immunohistochemical study of cutaneous T cells and apoptosis-related molecules in psoriasis BACKGROUND: Various types of UVB radiation source (290-320 nm) are used in treating psoriasis and their therapeutic mechanism has been attributed to immunosuppressive properties. Recently, a new UVB source generated by a 308-nm excimer laser has been introduced for the treatment of psoriasis., OBJECTIVE: In this study we investigated the immunohistochemical evaluation of T cells and the expression of various apoptosis-related molecules in the psoriatic hyperproliferative skin before and after treatment with 308-nm monochromatic excimer light (MEL)., METHODS: Ten patients (three women and seven men), ranging in age from 29 to 79 years, affected by plaque-type psoriasis vulgaris, were treated with MEL. Biopsies from psoriatic lesions of MEL-treated sites were taken before, 24 h and/or 48 h after the first irradiation and analysed by the immunophosphatase alkaline technique (APAAP)., RESULTS: MEL treatment was found to cause a significant decrease in the rate of proliferation of keratinocytes and a relevant depletion of T cells in all psoriatic lesions, 48 h after the first irradiation: 308 nm light eliminated T cells from the psoriatic epidermis and also from the dermis, highlighting the ability of this UVB source to penetrate the skin compared with normal UVB and establish direct cytotoxic action on T cells infiltrating skin lesions. Rapid clearing of psoriatic lesions involves potential molecular targets of UVB in T cells including p53, which is upregulated after direct irradiation with 308-nm UVB. Moreover, Bcl-2 expression in healing psoriasis epidermis after MEL treatment is significantly decreased compared with untreated skin and the TUNEL (TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labelling) technique revealed the presence of relevant apoptotic keratinocytes in the irradiated epidermis., CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that psoriatic skin after monochromatic excimer light therapy is associated with significant T-cell depletion and alterations of apoptosis-related molecules accompanied by a decreased proliferation index and clinical remission.",Excluded
1386,"Evidence for variation in human radiosensitivity and its potential impact on radiological protection Radiological protection standards generally assume that all members of the population are equally sensitive to the adverse health effects associated with radiation exposure, recognising the age- and sex-related differences in sensitivity to radiation-induced cancer. It has become very clear over recent years that genetic and lifestyle factors can play important roles in the susceptibility of individuals to a range of diseases; as such, the same may apply to radiation-associated diseases. Evidence is accumulating from studies at many levels of biological organisation - cells, experimental organisms, and humans - that a range of radiosensitivity exists between individuals in the population. Consideration of improvements in radiological protection practices to take account of such differences will require the availability of robust and accurate ways to assess the sensitivity of an individual or population subgroup. In addition, there will need to be careful consideration of the ethical aspects relating to use of individual sensitivity information. These ethical considerations are very likely to be exposure context dependent, and require careful risk-benefit balance consideration before practical application.

2141,"The feasibility of evaluating radiation dose to the heart by integrating kilovoltage-cone beam computed tomography in stereotactic body radiotherapy of early non-small-cell lung cancer patients BACKGROUND: To investigate the feasibility of contouring the planning risk organ volume (PRV) for the heart, and to determine the probability of evaluating radiation dose to the heart using kilovoltage-cone beam computed tomography (kV-CBCT) in early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, who received stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventeen NSCLC patients who received SBRT (5Gy/f x 10f dose) were enrolled and subjected to CBCT and CT imaging analyses to plan treatment. Sequential planning CBCT images of individual patient's hearts were analyzed for reproducibility of heart contouring and volume. Comparative analyses were made between the planning CT- and CBCT-detected heart margins and dose-volume indices for treatment., RESULTS: The heart volume from planning CT images was significantly smaller than that from CBCT scans (p < 0.05), and the volumes based on the different series of CBCT images were similar (p > 0.05). The overlap of the heart region on the same anatomical section between the first series of CBCT scans and other scans reached 0.985 +/- 0.020 without statistically significant differences (p > 0.05). The mean margins of the heart from planning CT and CBCT scans were 10.5 +/- 2.8 mm in the left direction, 5.9 +/- 2.8 mm in the right direction, 2.2 +/- 1.6 mm in the direction of the head, 3.3 +/- 2.2 mm in the direction of the foot, 6.7 +/- 1.1 mm in the anterior direction, and 4.5 mm +/- 2.5 mm in the posterior direction. All relative and absolute dose-volume indices obtained from CBCT images were significantly larger than those from planning CT scans (p < 0.05), with the exception of the volume in the 5Gy region., CONCLUSION: The PRV of heart contouring based on kV-CBCT is feasible with good reproducibility. More accurate and objective dose-volume indices may be obtained for NSCLC patients by using kV-CBCT, instead of CT, to plan SBRT.",Excluded
1859,"Lifelong hematopoiesis in both reconstituted and sublethally irradiated mice is provided by multiple sequentially recruited stem cells Objective. To evaluate the dynamics of stem cell production to hematopoiesis, the number of active stem cell clones and the lifespan of individual clones were studied. Materials and Methods. The clonal contribution of primitive hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) responsible for long-term hematopoiesis was determined using two approaches. In one model, irradiated female mice were reconstituted with retrovirally marked male hematopoietic cells. In the second model, mice were irradiated sublethally without hematopoietic cell transplantation. In both models, bone marrow cells were serially sampled from the same mouse throughout a 12- to 20-month period and injected into irradiated recipients for analysis of day 10 colony-forming unit-spleen (CFU-S). The donor origin of CFU-S was determined by the presence of retrovirally marked cells or cells with chromosomal aberrations. Results. The results of the two essentially different models show that 1) hematopoiesis is mainly the product of small clones of hematopoietic cells; 2) the lifespan of the majority of clones is only 1 to 2 months; 3) the clones usually function locally; and 4) the vast majority of the clones replace one another sequentially. Primitive HSCs capable of producing long-lived clones (about 10% among all clones), which exist during the entire life of a mouse, were detected by the radiation-marker technique only. Conclusion. Multiple short-living clones (at least on the level of CFU-S production) comprise the vast majority of the active stem cells in transplanted recipients or after endogenous recovery from sublethal irradiation. © 2001 International Society for Experimental Hematology.",Excluded
1936,"New strategy for lower advanced rectal cancer : Preoperative chemoradiotherapy with uft/leucovorin/ irinotecan regimen BACKGROUND: We previously reported that UFT/leucovorin/ irinotecan (TEGAFIRI) is a feasible chemotherapy regimen for preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for lower advanced rectal cancer (LARC) in a phase I/II trial. Here we report the short-term outcomes for further accumulated LARC cases treated with this regimen. METHOD(S): A total of 41 LARC patients were treated with preoperative CRT with TEGAFIRI regimen (irinotecan 80 mg/m2 on day 1, 15, 29, 43, UFT 300 mg/m2 and leucovorin 75 mg/ body with irradiation 50.4 Gy/28Fr) followed by curative intent surgery. The relative dose intensity (RDI), adverse events (AEs), surgical findings, and pathological regression grade and complete response (pCR) rate were examined. RESULT(S): The mean RDI was 0.86 for irinotecan, 0.97 for UFT, and 0.998 for irradiation. Grade 3 AEs were diarrhea in 5 patients (12.1%), anemia in 4 (9.8%), and leukopenia and neutropenia in 3 (7.3%) respectively, and no grade 4 or 5 AEs were observed. The circumferential resection margin was negative in all cases. The pathological regression grade 1a/1b/ 2/3 was observed in 4/10/20/7 cases, and the pCR rate was 17.1%. In 26 patients treated with irinotecan at 80 mg/m2, the pCR rate was 19.2% and the grade 2/3 regression was observed in 73.1% of the patients.

The primary purpose of our study was to determine the entrance surface dose (ESD) for men and women, from which we established an easy estimation equation for ESD, using the body mass index (BMI) as a variable. From April 2000 to March 2002, 15424 patients (8586 men, 6838 women; mean age, 58 years old; age range, 20 to 90 years old) were recruited in this study. Estimated equation of ESD was obtained from the dispersion data of BMI and ESD. Welch's t-test was used as the test of significance. P values evaluated levels of significance at 5%. Analysis for correlation coefficients was used for Peason's correlation coefficient test. And, we also performed a simple regression analysis. The results of the simple regression equation with BMI as variable (y: ESD [mGy], x: BMI [kg/m(2)), and the median values of ESD were as follows: for chest PA, men, 0.22, y = 0.0145 x - 0.0876, women, 0.20, y = 0.0126 x - 0.0704; for abdomen AP, men, 2.12, y = 0.2707 x - 3.7206, women, 1.65, y = 0.2561 x - 3.7989; for pelvis AP, men, 1.87, y = 0.0517 x + 0.8753, women, 1.77, y = 0.0674 x + 0.4775; for lumbar spine AP, men, 3.08, y = 0.3462 x - 4.1416, women, 2.66, y = 0.2525 x - 2.8131; and for lumbar spine lateral, men, 9.31, y = 0.6012 x - 3.7216, women, 7.42, y = 0.3147 x + 0.3384.

The resultant radiation doses represent less than one per cent of those received by a Northern Ireland individual over a period of 40 years from natural background radiation sources. The added risk to any individual from the Chernobyl accident will therefore be very small and may best be judged in the context of the enormously greater risk of death due to potentially preventable diseases, such as smoking-related lung cancer, and coronary heart disease.",Excluded

The aim of this study was to identify serum metabolite biomarkers that might be used to predict the side-effects of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Patients and Methods: Metabolomic analysis of serum samples from 26 patients with ESCC that were collected before neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy was performed. The metabolites associated with hematological toxicity or nephrotoxicity were evaluated. Result(s): Serum levels of glutaric acid, glucuronic acid, and cystine were significantly higher in hematological toxicity, and phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamines exhibited a tendency to be higher in those with hematological toxicity. The serum level of pyruvic acid was significantly lower in nephrotoxicity, and lysophosphatidylcholines and lysophosphatidylethanolamines tended to be lower in those with nephrotoxicity. Conclusion(s): Our study found that serum levels of some metabolites differed significantly between patients with and without hematological or renal side-effects.

1364,"Predictive factors in esophageal cancer after neoadjuvant therapy BACKGROUND: Preoperative chemoradiation therapy (PCX) was introduced to improve the outcome of patients with oesophageal cancer (EC), but conflicting results have been released. Some 20-30% of patients show a complete pathological response, however, the perioperative morbidity and mortality is increased. To search for factors indicating response prior to the onset of PCX we investigated the proliferative activity (MIB-1), the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and the capillary density (CD34) tissue specimens of ECs were available by endoscopy prior to the start of the treatment. METHOD(S): Forty-six (MIB-1) and 21 (VEGF, CD34) tissue specimens of ECs were available from 56 patients undergoing pretherapeutic endoscopy, PCX and surgery. Perioperative morbidity was divided into surgery and non-surgery related morbidity. MIB-1, VEGF and CD34 expression were investigated immunohistochemically. Multivariate analysis was carried out to prove independence of investigated variables. RESULT(S): Postoperative morbidity was noticed in 54 of 56 operated patents. Eight of 56 patients who received PCX died in hospital. Survival was significantly different between the group of complete responders (n=14) and non-responders (n=23; P = 0.0026). None of investigated tumour samples from patients with a complete response (CR) had a proliferation index of less than 45. Tumour samples from patients with a CR showed a VEGF expression of 10.7 compared with 36.58 of tumours with no response (P = 0.035). CD34 expression showed a correlation with VEGF expression. The relation of mean indices of VEGF expression and proliferative activity in tumours from patients with complete, partial or no response was 10. 7:58.8, 18.3:53.8 and 36.6:43.5, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): According to these results, it may be expected that tumours with a VEGF/MIB-1 ratio of 1:5 or less prior to PCX will respond to this therapy.",Excluded
1839,"Use of unstable chromosome aberrations for biological dosimetry after the first postirradiation mitosis The loss of unstable chromosome aberrations after the first postirradiation mitosis makes their use difficult in radiation dosimetry. We describe here a method which, in a cell population observed at this stage, allows retrospective estimation of the frequencies of the unstable aberrations induced at the time of irradiation, and their use as a dosimeter. The laws controlling the behavior of unstable aberrations during mitosis were defined from a large-scale experiment on irradiated human lymphocytes. For cells undergoing the first, second, or third mitosis after irradiation, relationships were determined between the frequency, at irradiation time, of acentric fragments not arising from formation of dicentrics or rings, and the ratio of dicentrics and centric rings appearing without acentric fragments to the total number of dicentrics plus rings. On the basis of this ratio, the method described here provides an assessment of the postirradiation mitotic activity in a cell population. This assessment permitted estimation of the cell distribution and frequency of dicentrics plus centric rings, and of the frequency of acentric fragments at the time of irradiation. The use of this method for retrospective dosimetry after whole-body irradiation under various conditions of exposure is illustrated.",Excluded

A multifunctional skin physiology monitor was used to measure SC hydration., RESULTS: In comparison with non-sun exposure, sun exposure does not cause a significant change in SC hydration in either young males or young females, whereas in aged females, a significant reduction of SC hydration is seen on the forehead and the dorsal hand of sun-exposed subjects. SC hydration on the canthus of both aged males and aged females is significantly lower than that of young subjects. Additionally, SC hydration on the dorsal hand of aged females is also significantly lower as compared with young females. Sun-induced reduction of SC hydration is more evident on the dorsal hand of aged females than that of males (P<0.001). Moreover, the SC rehydration capacity is significantly lower in sun-exposed aged females than in age-matched males., CONCLUSION: These results demonstrated that sun-induced changes of the SC hydration property vary with age and gender.

2342,"ARFI cut-off values and significance of standard deviation for liver fibrosis staging in patients with chronic liver disease Background. Acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastometry quantifies hepatic stiffness, and thus degree of fibrosis, non-invasively. Our aim was to analyse the diagnostic accuracy of ARFI cut-off values, and the significance of a defined limit of standard deviation (SD) as a potential quality parameter for liver fibrosis staging in patients with chronic liver diseases (CLD). Material and methods. 153 patients with CLD (various aetiologies) undergoing liver biopsy, and an additional 25 patients with known liver cirrhosis, were investigated. ARFI measurements were performed in the right hepatic lobe, and correlated with the histopathological Ludwig fibrosis score (inclusion criteria: at least 6 portal tracts). The diagnostic accuracy of cut-off values was analysed with respect to an SD limit of 30% of the mean ARFI value. Results. The mean ARFI elastometry showed 1.95 +/- 0.87 m/s (range 0.79-4.40) in 178 patients (80 female, 98 male, mean age: 52 years). The cut-offs were 1.25 m/s for F >= 2, 1.72 m/s for F >= 3 and 1.75 m/s for F = 4, and the corresponding AUROC 80.7%, 86.2% and 88.7%, respectively. Exclusion of 31 patients (17.4%) with an SD higher than 30% of the mean ARFI improved the diagnostic accuracy: The AUROC for F >= 2, F >= 3 and F = 4 were 86.1%, 91.2% and 91.5%, respectively. Conclusion. The diagnostic accuracy of ARFI can be improved by applying a maximum SD of 30% of the mean ARFI as a quality parameter - which however leads to an exclusion of a relevant number of patients. ARFI results with a high SD should be interpreted with caution.",Excluded
1869,"Significance of radioiodine uptake at 72 hours versus 24 hours after pretreatment with recombinant human thyrotropin for enhancement of radioiodine therapy in patients with symptomatic nontoxic or toxic multinodular goiter OBJECTIVE: To report the effects of pretreatment with recombinant human thyrotropin (rhTSH) on radioiodine uptake (RAIU) and subsequent radioiodine therapy in 30 patients with symptomatic nontoxic or toxic multinodular goiter., METHODS: Patients received a single injection of rhTSH (0.1 mg in 21 and 0.3 mg in 9 patients). Thyroid function tests were performed before and 72 hours after rhTSH administration. Both 4-hour and 24-hour RAIU studies were done after rhTSH administration and repeated at 48 to 52 hours and at 72 hours, respectively. Then all patients were treated with 30 mCi of 131 I., RESULTS: All study patients experienced symptomatic relief by 1 to 2 months. In addition to the previously reported twofold increase over the baseline RAIU at 24 hours, we found that a second 24-hour RAIU showed a further twofold increase (quadrupling of the RAIU over baseline) at 72 hours after administration of 0.1 mg of rhTSH (from 22% to 43%; P<0.001) and 0.3 mg of rhTSH (from 16% to 37%; P = 0.002), with no significant difference between doses on the RAIU at 24 hours or at 72 hours. Additionally, the RAIU value at 4 hours and 52 hours after administration of 0.1 mg and 0.3 mg of rhTSH revealed a fourfold increase for each dose--from 7% to 28% (P<0.001) and from 5% to 21% (P = 0.002), respectively., CONCLUSION: In patients with symptomatic toxic or nontoxic multinodular goiter, 0.1 mg and 0.3 mg of rhTSH were equally efficacious at inducing a quadrupling of the low or low-normal baseline RAIU values at 72 hours after injection. Subsequent radioiodine therapy alleviated compressive and thyrotoxic symptoms in all 30 treated patients.

1298,"Low-energy He/Ne laser in the prevention of radiation-induced mucositis: A multicenter phase III randomized study in patients with head and neck cancer Use of the low-energy helium-neon laser (LEL) appears to be a simple atraumatic technique for the prevention and treatment of mucositis of various origins. Preliminary findings, and significant results obtained for chemotherapy-induced mucositis in a previous phase III study, prompted a randomized multicenter double-blind trial to evaluate LEL in the prevention of acute radiation-induced stomatitis. Irradiation by LEL corresponds to local application of a high-photon-density monochromatic light source. Activation of epithelial healing for LEL-treated surfaces, the most commonly recognized effect, has been confirmed by numerous in vitro studies. The mechanism of action at a molecular and enzymatic level is presently being studied. From September 1994 to March 1998, 30 patients were randomized. Technical specification: 60 mW (25 mW at Reims, 1 patient), He-Ne, wavelength 632.8 nm. The trial was open to patients with carcinoma of the oropharynx, hypopharynx and oral cavity, treated by radiotherapy alone (65 Gy at a rate of 2 Gy/fraction, 5 fractions per week) without prior surgery or concomitant chemotherapy. The malignant tumor had to be located outside the tested laser application areas (9 points): posterior third of the internal surfaces of the cheeks, soft palate and anterior tonsillar pillars. Patients were randomized to LEL or placebo light treatment, starting on the first day of radiotherapy and before each session. The treatment time (t) for each application point was given by the equation: t (s)=energy (J/cm2) x surface (cm2)/Power (W). Objective assessment of the degree of mucositis was recorded weekly by a physician blinded to the type of treatment, using the WHO scale for grading of mucositis and a segmented visual analogue scale for pain evaluation. Protocol feasibility and compliance were excellent. Grade 3 mucositis occurred with a frequency of 35.2% without LEL and of 7.6% with LEL (P<0.01). The frequency of 'severe pain' (grade 3) was 23.8% without LEL, falling to 1.9% with LEL (P < 0.05). Pain relief was significantly reduced throughout the treatment period (weeks 2-7). LEL therapy is capable of reducing the severity and duration of oral mucositis associated with radiation therapy. In addition, there is a tremendous potential for using LEL in combined treatment protocols utilizing concomitant chemotherapy and radiotherapy.",Excluded

We investigated whether VA use during RT for glioblastoma was associated with overall survival by retrospective multivariable analysis in a large cohort. The results suggest that HDAC inhibitors, like VA, may improve the results of RT and should be subjected to clinical trials. Purpose(s): Valproic acid (VA) is an antiepileptic drug (AED) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor taken by patients with glioblastoma (GB) to manage seizures, and it can modulate the biologic effects of radiation therapy (RT).

Analyses were performed to determine the association of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group recursive partitioning analysis (RTOG RPA) class, seizure history, and concurrent temozolomide (TMZ) and AED use during RT with OS. Result(s): Seizures before the end of RT were noted in 217 (40%) patients, and 403 (74%) were taking an AED during RT; 29 (7%) were taking VA. Median OS in patients taking VA was 16.9 months (vs 13.6 months taking another AED, P=.16). Among patients taking an AED during RT, OS was associated with VA (P=.047; hazard ratio [HR], 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.27-1.07), and RTOG RPA class (P<.0001; HR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.37-1.61). Of the 5 most common AEDs, only VAwas associated with OS. Median OS of patients receiving VA and TMZ during RT was 23.9 months (vs 15.2 months for patients taking another AED, P=.26). When the analysis was restricted to patients who received concurrent TMZ, VA use was marginally associated with OS (P=.057; HR, 0.54; 95% CI, -0.09 to 1.17), independently of RTOG RPA class and seizure history. Conclusion(s): VA use during RT for GB was associated with improved OS, independently of RTOG RPA, seizure history, and concurrent TMZ use. Further studies of treatment that combines HDAC inhibitors and RT are warranted. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1425,"CT in necrotizing soft tissue infection: diagnostic criteria and comparison with LRINEC score Objective: To investigate which computed tomography (CT) criteria are most useful in diagnosing necrotizing soft tissue infection (NSTI) and how CT performs with respect to the Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotizing Fasciitis (LRINEC) score. Method(s): Patients who underwent CT for suspected NSTI were eligible for inclusion. LRINEC score was assessed. CT scans were evaluated for subcutaneous edema, fluid along superficial fascia, fluid along deep fascia, blurring of intermuscular fat planes, fluid collection, and air in the soft tissues. Surgical findings or clinical follow-up served as reference standard. Result(s): Fourteen patients with NSTI and 34 patients with non-NSTI were included. LRINEC score was significantly higher in patients with NSTI (median of 7.5 vs. 6, p = 0.039). Fluid along the deep fascia was significantly more frequently present in patients with NSTI (46.2% vs. 5.9%, p = 0.001). In multiple logistic regression analysis, presence of fluid along the deep fascia was significantly associated with NSTI (odds ratio [OR] = 10.28, 95% CI: 1.57 to 67.18, p = 0.015), whereas the LRINEC score was not significantly associated with NSTI (OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 0.92 to 1.74, p = 0.146). Using presence of fluid along the deep fascia as diagnostic criterion for NSTI, sensitivity was 46.2% (95% CI, 23.2 to 70.9%) and specificity was 94.1% (95% CI, 80.9 to 98.4%). Conclusion(s): Fluid along the deep fascia was the only CT criterion which was significantly associated with NSTI and appeared more useful than the LRINEC score. In the right clinical setting, presence of this CT finding is highly suggestive for NSTI. Its absence, however, does not rule out NSTI. Key Points: * The presence of fluid along the deep fascia at CT is highly suggestive for NSTI in suspected patients. Its absence, however, does not rule out NSTI. `* The use of fluid along the deep fascia as a criterion appears to be more useful than the LRINEC score in diagnosing NSTI.Copyright © 2021, European Society of Radiology.",Excluded
1517,"Biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of deuterium-substituted 18F-fluoromethyl-[1, 2-2H4]choline in healthy volunteers UNLABELLED: (11)C-choline and (18)F-fluoromethylcholine ((18)F-FCH) have been used in patients to study tumor metabolic activity in vivo; however, both radiotracers are readily oxidized to respective betaine analogs, with metabolites detectable in plasma soon after injection of the radiotracer. A more metabolically stable FCH analog, (18)F-fluoromethyl-[1,2-(2)H4]choline ((18)F-D4-FCH), based on the deuterium isotope effect, has been developed. We report the safety, biodistribution, and internal radiation dosimetry profiles of (18)F-D4-FCH in 8 healthy human volunteers., METHODS: (18)F-D4-FCH was intravenously administered as a bolus injection (mean +/- SD, 161 +/- 2.17 MBq; range, 156-163 MBq) to 8 healthy volunteers (4 men, 4 women). Whole-body (vertex to mid thigh) PET/CT scans were acquired at 6 time points, up to 4 h after tracer injection. Serial whole-blood, plasma, and urine samples were collected for radioactivity measurement and plasma radiotracer metabolites. Tissue (18)F radioactivities were determined from quantitative analysis of the images, and time-activity curves were generated. The total numbers of disintegrations in each organ normalized to injected activity (residence times) were calculated as the area under the curve of the time-activity curve normalized to injected activities and standard organ volumes. Dosimetry calculations were performed using OLINDA/EXM 1.1., RESULTS: The injection of (18)F-D4-FCH was well tolerated in all subjects, with no radiotracer-related serious adverse event reported. The mean effective dose averaged over both men and women (+/- SD) was estimated to be 0.025 +/- 0.004 (men, 0.022 +/- 0.002; women, 0.027 +/- 0.002) mSv/MBq. The 5 organs receiving the highest absorbed dose (mGy/MBq) were the kidneys (0.106 +/- 0.03), liver (0.094 +/- 0.03), pancreas (0.066 +/- 0.01), urinary bladder wall (0.047 +/- 0.02), and adrenals (0.046 +/- 0.01). Elimination was through the renal and hepatic systems., CONCLUSION: (18)F-D4-FCH is a safe PET radiotracer with a dosimetry profile comparable to other common (18)F PET tracers. These data support the further development of (18)F-D4-FCH for clinical imaging of choline metabolism.",Excluded
2156,"T cell expansion study using the lesional skin provides evidence for the role of drug-specific Tc1 and Th17 cells in severe drug eruptions Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS) are life threatening adverse drug reactions. It is considered that antigen-specific T cells are involved in the pathogenesis. However, the role of drug-specific T cells in the skin lesions is not fully investigated. We expanded skin-infiltrating T cells from 4-mm biopsied lesional skin samples of TEN, SJS, DIHS, and erythema multiforme (EM) using anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies and IL-2. We obtained >107 cells/specimen by this method. For the drug reactivity, T cells labeled with CFSE were cultured with X-ray-irradiated PBMCs from the same patients and causative drugs, and the proliferation was assessed by flow cytometry. The cytokine profiles of responding T cells were also examined by intracellular staining for interferon (IFN)-gamma;, IL-4, and IL-17, or by cytokine quantification of the supernatants. Both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells proliferated to the causative drugs in all cases. Notably, 80% of expanded CD8+ T cells with the causative drugs expressed high levels of IFN-gamma. The expanded CD4+ T cells bore IFN-gamma, IL-4 or IL-17A at various frequencies. The culture supernatants contained IL-17A at various concentrations. The ability of T cells to produce IL-17A did not correlate with their ability to produce the other cytokines. In DIHS, however, the IL-17A production levels appeared to fluctuate in parallel with the clinical courses. Our results demonstrate that drug-specific T cells are definitely present in the skin infiltrate of severe drug eruptions. It is suggested that drug-reactive, IFN-gamma-producing CD8+ T cells infiltrate at a high frequency and Th17 cells also participate in the formation of lesional skin depending on cases.",Excluded

All patients were assessed for resectability after 6 weeks by clinical examination and by CT scan and those deemed resectable underwent surgery., RESULTS: A total of 90 patients were randomized, 46 to Arm 1 and 44 to Arm 2. Eighty seven patients (44 in Arm 1 and 41 in Arm 2) completed the prescribed treatment protocol. Overall resectability rate was low in both the groups; R0 resection was achieved in 20 (43 %) patients in Arm 1 vs. 15 (34 %) in Arm 2. Adverse factors that significantly affected the resectability rate in both the groups were extension of tumor to pelvic bones and signet ring cell pathology. Complete pathological response was seen in 7 and 11 %, respectively. There was greater morbidity such as wound infection and delayed wound healing in Arm 2 (16 vs. 40 %; p = 0.03)., CONCLUSION: Escalated radiation dose without chemotherapy does not achieve higher complete (R0) tumor resectability in locally advanced inoperable rectal cancers, compared to concurrent chemoradiation.",Excluded
2431,"[Vitamin D levels in patients with hip fracture in Madrid] BACKGROUND: Vitamin D appears to be implicated in the loss of bone mass and its most severe complication is the hip fracture. A change is produced in the metabolism of vitamin D in elderly people although its study has received little attention in many countries., METHODS: With the aim of evaluating vitamin D and its metabolites in the elderly people with hip fracture in our geographic environment (Madrid, Spain), 58 patients with hip fracture over the age of 70, and 39 subjects without a fracture or the similar age were studied. Both groups were evaluated during the season of minimum solar irradiation. The plasma concentrations of intact PTH and the serum concentrations of calcidiol and calcitriol were studied in all the patients., RESULTS: The patients with hip fracture presented significantly lower concentrations of calcidiol (11.7 +/- 6.4 vs. 18.4 +/- 12.7 nmol/l) and calcitriol (60.1 +/- 24.7 vs. 76.1 +/- 25.0 pmol/l) than in elderly persons without fracture, with similar PTH values being observed in both groups (4.8 +/- 1.9 vs. 5.1 +/- 2.3 pmol/l)., CONCLUSIONS: Although Madrid, Spain is considered to be a geographical area of high solar irradiation, the elderly population studied presented a vitamin D deficiency which was found to be greater in those with hip fracture.",Excluded
1909,"Cancer risk estimation of genotoxic chemicals based on target dose and a multiplicative model A mechanistic model and associated procedures are proposed for cancer risk assessment of genotoxic chemicals. As previously shown for ionizing radiation, a linear multiplicative model was found to be compatible with published experimental data for ethylene oxide, acrylamide, and butadiene. The validity of this model was anticipated in view of the multiplicative interaction of mutation with inherited and acquired growth-promoting conditions. Concurrent analysis led to rejection of an additive model (i.e. the model commonly applied for cancer risk assessment). A reanalysis of data for radiogenic cancer in mouse, dog and man shows that the relative risk coefficient is approximately the same (0.4 to 0.5 percent per rad) for tumours induced in the three species. Doses in vivo, defined as the time- integrated concentrations of ultimate mutagens, expressed in millimol x kg- 1 x h (mMh) are, like radiation doses given in Gy or rad, proportional to frequencies of potentially mutagenic events. The radiation dose equivalents of chemical doses are, calculated by multiplying chemical doses (in mMh) with the relative genotoxic potencies (in rad x mMh-1) determined in vitro. In this way the relative cancer incidence increments in rats and mice exposed to ethylene oxide were shown to be about 0.4 percent per rad-equivalent, in agreement with the data for radiogenic cancer. Our analyses suggest that values of the relative risk coefficients for genotoxic chemicals are independent of species and that relative cancer risks determined in animal tests apply also to humans. If reliable animal test data are not available, cancer risks may be estimated by the relative potency. In both cases exposure dose/target dose relationships, the latter via macromolecule adducts, should be determined.",Excluded
2037,"GUCY2C signaling opposes the acute radiation-induced GI syndrome High doses of ionizing radiation induce acute damage to epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, mediating toxicities restricting the therapeutic efficacy of radiation in cancer and morbidity and mortality in nuclear disasters. No approved prophylaxis or therapy exists for these toxicities, in part reflecting an incomplete understanding of mechanisms contributing to the acute radiation-induced GI syndrome (RIGS). Guanylate cyclase C (GUCY2C) and its hormones guanylin and uroguanylin have recently emerged as one paracrine axis defending intestinal mucosal integrity against mutational, chemical, and inflammatory injury. Here, we reveal a role for the GUCY2C paracrine axis in compensatory mechanisms opposing RIGS. Eliminating GUCY2C signaling exacerbated RIGS, amplifying radiation-induced mortality, weight loss, mucosal bleeding, debilitation, and intestinal dysfunction. Durable expression of GUCY2C, guanylin, and uroguanylin mRNA and protein by intestinal epithelial cells was preserved following lethal irradiation inducing RIGS. Oral delivery of the heat-stable enterotoxin (ST), an exogenous GUCY2C ligand, opposed RIGS, a process requiring p53 activation mediated by dissociation from MDM2. In turn, p53 activation prevented cell death by selectively limiting mitotic catastrophe, but not apoptosis. These studies reveal a role for the GUCY2C paracrine hormone axis as a novel compensatory mechanism opposing RIGS, and they highlight the potential of oral GUCY2C agonists (Linzess; Trulance) to prevent and treat RIGS in cancer therapy and nuclear disasters.Copyright ©2017 AACR.",Excluded
1803,"Retreatment of vestibular schwannomas with Gamma Knife surgery OBJECT: The response rate of vestibular schwannomas (VSs) to radiosurgery has reached the 97% level in several published series. When failure rarely occurs, some controversy has existed as to whether the tumor has to be resected or can be safely retreated with radiosurgery. The authors retrospectively studied the outcome of retreating 11 patients with Gamma Knife surgery (GKS)., METHODS: The authors studied 11 patients at the New England Gamma Knife Center who had undergone GKS as a second radiosurgical treatment for VS from 1994 to 2007. One patient underwent proton-beam radiotherapy as the first treatment, and the other 10 patients had undergone GKS initially. Tumor control (size before and after the first and the second treatment) was evaluated using MR imaging to demonstrate the course after the 2 treatments. Facial nerve function (House-Brackmann grading system), trigeminal nerve function, hearing (Gardner-Robertson classification), and any adverse radiation effects were evaluated. The prescription dose was 12 Gy (11-13.2 Gy) for both treatments., RESULTS: Of the 11 patients, 2 showed increase, 1 had no change, and, in 8, the VS decreased in size after the retreatment. One tumor remained unchanged over the first 6 months, but demonstrated signs of internal necrosis. All patients demonstrated stable facial nerve function. Regarding facial numbness, 2 patients experienced increases, 8 no change, and 1 decreased numbness. There was no functional hearing prior to the second treatment in 10 patients, and hearing was impaired in 1 patient. Adverse radiation effects (slight peduncular edema) were seen in 2 patients after the second treatment, and 1 patient had edema after the first treatment as well., CONCLUSIONS: Vestibular schwannomas can be retreated with GKS with good tumor control response and low risk of toxicity.",Excluded
2168,"Bone marrow-derived cells rescue salivary gland function in mice with head and neck irradiation Treatment for most patients with head and neck cancers includes ionizing radiation. A consequence of this treatment is irreversible damage to salivary glands (SGs), which is accompanied by a loss of fluid-secreting acinar-cells and a considerable decrease of saliva output. While there are currently no adequate conventional treatments for this condition, cell-based therapies are receiving increasing attention to regenerate SGs. In this study, we investigated whether bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) can differentiate into salivary epithelial cells and restore SG function in head and neck irradiated mice. BMDCs from male mice were transplanted into the tail-vein of 18 Gy-irradiated female mice. Salivary output was increased in mice that received BMDCs transplantation at week 8 and 24 post-irradiation. At 24 weeks after irradiation (IR), harvested SGs (submandibular and parotid glands) of BMDC-treated mice had greater weights than those of non-treated mice. Histological analysis shows that SGs of treated mice demonstrated an increased level of tissue regenerative activity such as blood vessel formation and cell proliferation, while apoptotic activity was increased in non-transplanted mice. The expression of stem cell markers (Sca-1 or c-kit) was detected in BMDC-treated SGs. Finally, we detected an increased ratio of acinar-cell area and approximately 9% of Y-chromosome-positive (donor-derived) salivary epithelial cells in BMDC-treated mice. We propose here that cell therapy using BMDCs can rescue the functional damage of irradiated SGs by direct differentiation of donor BMDCs into salivary epithelial cells. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

1308,"Subacute haematotoxicity after PRRT with (177)Lu-DOTA-octreotate: prognostic factors, incidence and course PURPOSE: In peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT), the bone marrow (BM) is one of the dose-limiting organs. The accepted dose limit for BM is 2 Gy, adopted from (131)I treatment. We investigated the incidence and duration of haematological toxicity and its risk factors in patients treated with PRRT with (177)Lu-DOTA(0)-Tyr(3)-octreotate ((177)Lu-DOTATATE). Also, absorbed BM dose estimates were evaluated and compared with the accepted 2 Gy dose limit., METHODS: The incidence and duration of grade 3 or 4 haematological toxicity (according to CTCAE v3.0) and risk factors were analysed. Mean BM dose per unit (gigabecquerels) of administered radioactivity was calculated and the correlations between doses to the BM and haematological risk factors were determined., RESULTS: Haematological toxicity (grade 3/4) occurred in 34 (11 %) of 320 patients. In 15 of the 34 patients, this lasted more than 6 months or blood transfusions were required. Risk factors significantly associated with haematological toxicity were: poor renal function, white blood cell (WBC) count <4.0 x 10(9)/l, age over 70 years, extensive tumour mass and high tumour uptake on the OctreoScan. Previous chemotherapy was not associated. The mean BM dose per administered activity in 23 evaluable patients was 67 +/- 7 mGy/GBq, resulting in a mean BM dose of 2 Gy in patients who received four cycles of 7.4 GBq (177)Lu-DOTATATE. Significant correlations between (cumulative) BM dose and platelet and WBC counts were found in a selected group of patients., CONCLUSION: The incidence of subacute haematological toxicity after PRRT with (177)Lu-DOTATATE is acceptable (11 %). Patients with impaired renal function, low WBC count, extensive tumour mass, high tumour uptake on the OctreoScan and/or advanced age are more likely to develop grade 3/4 haematological toxicity. The BM dose limit of 2 Gy, adopted from (131)I, seems not to be valid for PRRT with (177)Lu-DOTATATE.",Excluded

The aim of the study was to evaluate retrospectively clinical course of 27 patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) diagnosed and treated by different surgical approaches. Initial therapy-diagnostic approach included surgery with total tumour reduction (TTR) performed in 12 patients (44.4%), while partial reduction and biopsy were performed in 8 (29.7%) and 7 (25.9%) patients, respectively. All patients were treated with chemotherapy based on high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) with/without whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT). Results. The median overall survival (OS) and event-free survival were 37 and 31 months, respectively, with overall response rate of 74%. The patients who underwent an open surgery with TTR had significantly longer OS (median not reached), comparing with partial tumour reduction or biopsy only (Log-Rank chi2 6.08, p = 0.014) when median OS was 23 months. In patients with performance status according to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG PS) >= 3, OS was 23 months, contrary to ECOG PS 1-2 when median was not reached. The International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group score (low, intermediate and high) also influenced OS between three risk groups (Log-Rank chi2 12.5, p = 0.002). Conclusion. The treatment of PCNSL still remains doubtful, however possible benefit from the TTR followed with HD-MTX with/without WBRT should be reconsidered.Copyright © 2015 The Neurosurgical Foundation.",Excluded
1781,"Eos, o-arm and standard spine radiographs; What is the cumulative radiation exposure during current scoliosis management? Background/introduction: During the course of assessment and treatment for AIS, patients are subjected to repeated radiological exposure. Only a few studies have evaluated the total absorbed radiation dose from standard radiography and EOS during follow-up for scoliosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate and compare total radiation dose exposure from all modalities for a cohort of AIS patients. Purpose of the study: The primary aim of this study was to determine the radiation exposure of AIS patients during scoliosis management. Moreover, this study aimed to compare follow-up algorithms among international spine centers. Material(s) and Method(s): A retrospective review on radiation exposure of patients treated for AIS. Inclusions: patients followed for AIS from 2013 to 2016 without neuromuscular diseases. The O-arm conebeam CT scanner was used for 3D navigation in all surgically managed patients, low dose protocols were used (70 kVp, 80 mAs). A survey asking for information on radiological algorithms and imaging frequencies was sent to a number of international spine centers for comparison with in-house algorithm. Result(s): 61 patients were included, 19 were treated conservatively (M/F: 6/13) and 42 surgically (M/F: 11/31). Median follow up time for the conservative group was 8 (range 0-51) months and 37 (range 13-163) months for the surgical group. Median number of X-rays/EOS were; 2 (range 0-20)/2 (range 0-17) for the conservative group and 15 (range 2-57)/11(range 0-26) for the surgery group. Patients undergoing surgery received a median cumulative radiation dose of 10.31 mSv (range 3.79-20.43) vs. a median dose of 1.09 mSv (range 0.22-7.17) for those treated conservatively. Approximately 25% (39.04/161.82 mSv) of total intraoperative radiation dose for all patients was a result of O-arm 2D fluoroscopy. A mean of 11 levels of the spine were fused during correction surgeries. Median Cobb angle at the beginning/end of follow up were 19-(range 10--50-)/23- (range 12--65-) for the conservative group and 44- (range 10--80-)/15- (range 4--30-) for the surgery group. Median Cobb angle before the surgery was 52- (range 36--82-). The results of the questionnaire showed great variety of radiological follow-up algorithms among 8 spine centers without adherence to any of the published consensus statements. Conclusion(s): Surgically treated patients were, as anticipated, exposed to more, radiation dose than those treated conservatively, almost 10-fold more, owing mainly to intraoperative 3D scans and a larger numbers of radiological follow-up examinations. The use of conebeam CT-based 3D navigation elevates patient safety during deformity surgery. However, patients are potentially exposed to a significant amount of radiation depending on protocol and use of 2D fluoroscopy. Further awareness of ways to reduce radiation dose and optimize radiological protocols is warranted in order to decrease radiation-induced malignancy.",Excluded

In all patients, dose-volumetric parameters were analyzed according to their relation to development of HT, and thyroid volumes spared from doses >=10, 20, 30, 40 and 50Gy (V10, V20, V30, V40 and V50) were analyzed from the dose volume histograms (DVHs)., RESULTS: Median follow-up duration was 31months. At the end of study, 33 patients (42.3%) developed HT and the cumulative incidence of HT was 24.6%, 36.5% and 42.3% at one, two and three years, respectively. V30 of 42.1% (P=0.005) was defined as dose-volumetric threshold of radiation-induced HT in HNSCC patients. Our analysis showed that V30 separates patients into low- and high-risk groups; the incidence of radiation-induced HT in the group with V30<42.1% and V30>=42.1% was 29.4% and 71.4%, respectively (P=0.002)., CONCLUSIONS: The V30 may predict risk of developing HT after RT for HNSCC patients.

Dynamic instability of wrist--occurring during joint motion--is a complex condition that has assumed increased importance in musculoskeletal medicine. The objective of this study was to develop an MRI protocol for evaluating the wrist during continuous active motion, to show that dynamic imaging of the wrist is realizable, and to demonstrate that the resulting anatomical images enable the measurement of metrics commonly evaluated for dynamic wrist instability., METHODS: A 3-Tesla ""active-MRI"" protocol was developed using a bSSFP sequence with 475 ms temporal resolution for continuous imaging of the moving wrist. Fifteen wrists of 10 asymptomatic volunteers were scanned during active supination/pronation, radial/ulnar deviation, ""clenched-fist"", and volarflexion/dorsiflexion maneuvers. Two physicians evaluated distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) congruity, extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) tendon translation, the scapholunate (SL) interval, and the SL, radiolunate (RL) and capitolunate (CL) angles from the resulting images., RESULTS: The mean DRUJ subluxation ratio was 0.04 in supination, 0.10 in neutral, and 0.14 in pronation. The ECU tendon was subluxated or translated out of its groove in 3 wrists in pronation, 9 wrists in neutral, and 11 wrists in supination. The mean SL interval was 1.43 mm for neutral, ulnar deviation, radial deviation positions, and increased to 1.64 mm during the clenched-fist maneuver. Measurement of SL, RL and CL angles in neutral and dorsiflexion was also accomplished., CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the initial performance of active-MRI, which may be useful in the investigation of dynamic wrist instability in vivo.",Excluded

Genetically determined mutagen sensitivity predisposes individuals to a variety of cancers, including glioma. However, polymorphisms in DNA strand break repair genes that may determine mutagen sensitivity are not well studied in cancer risk, especially in gliomas., METHODS: We correlated genotype data for tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) of DNA strand break repair genes with a gamma-radiation-induced mutagen sensitivity phenotype [expressed as mean breaks per cell (B/C)] in samples from 426 glioma patients. We also conducted analysis to assess joint and haplotype effects of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on mutagen sensitivity. We further validate our results in an independent external control group totaling 662 subjects., RESULTS: Of the 392 tSNPs examined, we found that mutagen sensitivity was modified by one tSNP in the EME2 gene and six tSNPs in the RAD51L1 gene (P < 0.01). Among the six RAD51L1 SNPs tested in the validation set, one (RAD51L1 rs2180611) was significantly associated with mutagen sensitivity (P = 0.025). Moreover, we found a significant dose-response relationship between the mutagen sensitivity and the number of adverse tSNP genotypes. Furthermore, haplotype analysis revealed that RAD51L1 haplotypes F-A (zero adverse allele) and F-E (six adverse alleles) exhibited the lowest (0.42) and highest (0.93) mean B/C values, respectively. A similar dose-response relationship also existed between the mutagen sensitivity and the number of adverse haplotypes., CONCLUSION: These results suggest that polymorphisms in and haplotypes of the RAD51L1 gene, which is involved in the double-strand break repair pathway, modulate gamma-radiation-induced mutagen sensitivity.",Included
1565,"BMI1-KLF4 axis deficiency improves responses to neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with rectal cancer Purpose: Neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is a gold standard treatment for patients with stage II/III rectal cancer. B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion site 1 (BMI1) is a member of the polycomb group of proteins that are involved in regulating gene expression. High levels of BMI1 have been demonstrated to contribute to the malignant phenotypes of several cancers; however, its relevance in rectal cancer treated with CCRT is largely unknown. Methods and materials: We used two patient cohorts to address the clinical relevance of BMI1 in human cancers. In addition, HT-29 and HCT-116 cells were chosen as our in vitro models to verify the role of BMI1 in cell response to ionizing radiation. Stemness-related proteins were analyzed by western blotting and cell survival was determined using clonogenic assays. Result(s): BMI1 overexpression was found to significantly correlate with advanced pre-treatment nodal status (N1-N2; p < 0.001), post-treatment tumor stage (T1-T2; p = 0.015), inferior tumor regression grade (p = 0.001), and also an independent prognosis factor in 172 rectal cancer patients receiving CCRT. Serial cell-based functional examination indicated that BMI1 deficiency sensitized cells to radiation treatment by modulating the gene expression of Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) and enhanced radiosensitivity in microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal cancers. Overexpression of KLF4 partially overcame BMI1-deficiency-mediated gamma-H2AX expression after ionizing radiation exposure. Consistent with in vitro data, an analysis of an additional 30 rectal cancer tissue specimens revealed a positive correlation between BMI1 and KLF4 (p = 0.02). Conclusion(s): Higher levels of BMI1 are associated with poor therapeutic response and adverse outcomes in rectal cancer patients receiving CCRT.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
2087,"Systemic radionuclide therapy in pain palliation Several radiopharmaceuticals were investigated to determine their efficacy and toxicity in the palliation of painful bone metastases. Data on the influence of rhenium-188 hydroxyethylidene diphosphonate (188Re-HEDP), rhenium-186 hydroxyethylidene diphosphonate (186Re-HEDP), and strontium-89 (89Sr) on pain symptoms, quality of life, and bone-marrow function were obtained in 64 patients with breast and prostate cancer. Thirty-one patients were treated with 188Re-HEDP (3194 +/- 387 MBq), 15 patients with 186Re-HEDP (1358 +/- 158 MBq), and 18 patients with 89Sr (152 +/- 19 MBq). The 188Re-HEDP group included six breast cancer patients and 25 prostate cancer patients; the 186Re-HEDP group included three breast cancer patients and 12 prostate cancer patients; and the 89Sr group included three breast cancer patients and 15 prostate cancer patients. All subjects participated in an interview using a standardized sets of questions before and after the 12-week term of therapy. Blood counts were taken weekly for six weeks and after 12 weeks. Results showed that 77 percent of patients reported pain relief after treatment with 188Re-HEDP, 67 percent after treatment with 186Re-HEDP, and 72 percent after treatment with 89Sr. Sixteen percent of patients treated with 188Re-HEDP, 13 percent treated with 186Re-HEDP, and 17 percent treated with 89Sr were able to discontinue their analgesics and were pain-free. Patients described an improvement on Karnofsky performance status (KPS) from 73 +/- 7 percent to 85 +/- 8 percent 12 weeks after 188Re-HEDP (p < 0. 05), from 72 +/- 13 percent to 79 +/- 12 percent after 186Re-HEDP (p = 0.251), and from 62 +/- 14 percent to 69 +/- 16 percent after 89Sr (p = 0.415). Only three patients undergoing 188Re-HEDP therapy, one undergoing 186Re-HEDP therapy, and three undergoing 89Sr therapy had thrombocytopenia (platelet count below 100 x 10(3)/microl) following treatment. The maximum nadir of platelet and leukocyte counts was observed between the second and fifth week after treatment for all radionuclides and was reversible within 12 weeks. The nadir was earlier for 188Re-HEDP with a shorter physical half-life compared with 89Sr. There were no significant differences in bone marrow toxicity (p = 0.123-0.421). Results of this study indicate that all evaluated radiopharmaceuticals were effective in pain palliation without induction of severe side effects. The increase in KPS after 188Re-HEDP was the only statistically significant finding (p = 0.001).",Excluded
1901,"Validation of a New Method for 2D Fusion Imaging Registration in a System Prepared Only for 3D Purpose: To validate a new 2D-3D registration method of fusion imaging during aortic repair in a system prepared only for 3D-3D registration and to compare radiation doses and accuracy. Materials and Methods: The study involved 189 patients, including 94 patients (median age 70 years; 85 men) who underwent abdominal endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) with 2D-3D fusion on an Artis zee imaging system and 95 EVAR patients (median age 70 years; 81 men) from a prior study who had 3D-3D registration done using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT). For the 2D-3D registration, an offline CBCT of the empty operating table was imported into the intraoperative dataset and superimposed on the preoperative computed tomography angiogram (CTA). Then 2 intraoperative single-frame 2D images of the skeleton were aligned with the patient's skeleton on the preoperative CTA to complete the registration process. A digital subtraction angiogram was done to correct any misalignment of the aortic CTA volume. Values are given as the median [interquartile range (IQR) Q1, Q3]. Results: The 2D-3D registration had an accuracy of 4.0 mm (IQR 3.0, 5.0) after bone matching compared with the final correction with DSA (78% within 5 mm). By applying the 2D-3D protocol the radiation exposure (dose area product) from the registration of the fusion image was significantly reduced compared with the 3D-3D registration [1.12 Gy.cm2 (IQR 0.41, 2.14) vs 43.4 Gy.cm2 (IQR 37.1, 49.0), respectively; p<0.001). Conclusion: The new 2D-3D registration protocol based on 2 single-frame images avoids an intraoperative CBCT and can be used for fusion imaging registration in a system originally designed for 3D-3D only. This 2D-3D registration protocol is accurate and leads to a significant reduction in radiation exposure.",Excluded
1521,"Fragility fracture and osteoarthritis: Interaction between bone mineral and bone mass index Increased bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mass index (BMI) are associate with increased risk of osteoarthritis (OA) and reduced risk of fragility fracture. However, little is known about the relationship between fragility fracture and osteoarthritis. In this study, we sought to examine the interactions between BMD and BMI in the determination of the OA-fracture relationship. The study was part of the on-going Dubbo Osteoporosis Epidemiology Study, which involved 2,412 women and 1,452 men aged between 46 to 99 years. The individuals had been followed up for a median of 7 years (range: 0.1 to 21 years). Baseline BMD was measured at femoral neck (FNBMD) and lumbar spine (LSBMD) by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (GE-Lunar, Madison, WI). Osteoarthritis was ascertained by self-report. The incidence of fragility fracture was ascertained by X-ray report during the follow-up period. In addition, data concerning demographic characteristics, clinical history, and lifestyle factors were obtained by a structured questionnaire. A total of 1,077 participants (691 women and 386 men) had reported a diagnosis of OA. Overall, the risk of OA was associated significantly with increased LSBMD in men (odds ratio [OR] 1.34, 95%CI, 1.19-1.52) and women (1.20; 1.09-1.32). Elevation in FNBMD was significantly associated with increased risk of OA in men (OR 1.16; 1.02-1.32), but not in women. When stratified by BMI, significant association remained between OA risk and high LSBMD amongst women with BMI < 25kg/m2 (OR 1.26; 1.07-1.47) and BMI >30kg/m2 (1.26; 1.05-1.51); and in men with BMI < 25kg/m2 (OR 1.75; 1.37-2.27) or BMI 25-30kg/m2 (1.21; 1.02-1.43). OA was associated with an increased risk of fracture. After adjusting for LSBMD women with OA had significant increased fracture risk (1.41; 1.16-1.72); however, the association was not significant in men (OR 0.96; 0.69-1.32). Moreover, the association between OA and fracture risk was particularly pronounced in women with BMI 25-30kg/m2 (OR 1.45; 1.05-1.99, adjusted for LSBMD).These data suggest that high BMD is associated with a greater risk of OA in both men and women, particularly those with low BMI. The results also suggest that BMD could be a useful measure for identifying individuals at high risk of OA, particularly among those at lower BMI spectrum. Despite having higher bone density, women with self-reported OA, especially those overweight, have an increased risk of fragility fracture, suggesting that the OA-fracture association is mediated via non-BMD factors.",Excluded
1426,"Treatment of squamous cell anal canal carcinoma (SCACC) with pulsed dose rate brachytherapy: A retrospective study Background and purpose: To evaluate the results of pulsed dose rate brachytherapy (PDR) in SCACC. Material(s) and Method(s): From 1996 to 2002, 71 patients (pts) with SCACC were treated with PDR brachytherapy. The median age was 61.2 years (35-88), with a sex ratio of 1 M/6.5 F. The TNM classification was: 14 T1, 41 T2, 15 T3 and 1 T4, 52 N0, 13 N1, 3 N2 and 3 N3. All the pts were M0. Treatment started with external beam irradiation to the posterior pelvis (mean dose: 45.5 Gy). Forty-seven patients received chemotherapy (neoadjuvant/concomitant or both). After an interval of 2-6 weeks, PDR interstitial brachytherapy was performed. The mean dose was 17.8 Gy to the 85% reference isodose of the Paris system. Result(s): Treatment was interrupted in only one pt. With a median follow-up of 28.5 months, 2-year actuarial overall survival was 90%. Fourteen relapses occurred (four distant, three regional, and seven local). Ten patients developed a grade III complication (Lent Soma scale) and two a grade IV complication (colostomy or abdominal perineal resection for necrosis). Conclusion(s): PDR appears to be an effective treatment for SCACC. It is capable of reproducing the results usually observed with continuous LDR. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

1306,"Radiographic changes of chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis that persisted into adulthood Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) is a rare non-infectious autoinflammatory disorder typically seen in young women. We describe the case of a young man who presented at 13 years of age with pain in the tibia, humerus, clavicle and hip. Worsening of the condition through clinical presentation and radiographic imaging was observed over 10 years. Radiographic imaging initially showed some sclerotic changes, but worsened to osteolytic lesions of the proximal tibia, elevation of the lateral cortex and thickening of the anterior cortex. Bone biopsy of his right anterior proximal tibia showed no infection or neoplasia. But, laboratory results showed elevation of inflammatory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein. The patient was diagnosed with CRMO and treated with antibiotics for suspicion of chronic bacterial osteomyelitis.

2229,"Gender-related significance of time interval between radiotherapy and surgery in hypofractionated preoperative radiotherapy for rectal cancer patients' survival Aim and background: An optimal break between radiotherapy (RT) and surgery in short-course of RT (SCRT) for locally advanced rectal cancer is not clearly established.The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of the break in the preoperative SCRT and overall treatment time (OTT) for locally advanced rectal cancer patients (whole group and male/female subgroups) on patients overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), metastasis-free survival (MFS). Material(s) and Method(s): 131 patients were treated with SCRT (5 Gy/5 days), followed by surgery 3-53 days later. Break was calculated as the time interval between the end of irradiation to surgery and OTT as time interval from the beginning of RT to surgery. Result(s): Mean break was 21.5 (range 3-53.0) days and mean OTT was 26.5 (range 7-58.0) days. In univariate analysis, a break longer than 15 days and OTT >23 days were negative prognostic factors for OS for all patients, and particularly for the male patients' subgroup. RFS was non-significantly higher (P = 0.066) for patients treated with a break <=15 days and OTT <=23 days (P = 0.099), irrespectively of patients' sex. Patients treated with a break longer than 15 days and OTT >23 days had non-significantly lower level of MFS than those treated with a shorter break (P = 0.269) and OTT <=23 days (P = 0.498). Conclusion(s): In SCRT, a break in the treatment longer than 15 days, especially in the male patients subgroup, should be avoided, because it negatively affects patients' survival.Copyright © 2016 Greater Poland Cancer Centre.",Excluded

2388,"8 Gy single-dose radiotherapy is effective in metastatic spinal cord compression: Results of a phase III randomized multicentre Italian trial Background and purpose: In a previous randomized trial we showed that the short-course radiotherapy (RT) regimen of 8 Gy x 2 was feasible in patients with metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC) and short life expectancy. This phase III trial was planned to determine whether in the same category of patients 8 Gy single-dose is as effective as 8 Gy x 2. Material(s) and Method(s): Three hundred and twenty-seven patients with MSCC and short life expectancy were randomly assigned to a short-course of 8 Gy x 2 or to 8 Gy single-dose RT. Median follow-up was 31 months (range, 4-58). Result(s): A total of 303 (93%) patients are assessable, 150 treated with the short-course and 153 with the single-dose RT. No difference in response was found between the two RT schedules adopted. Median duration of response was 5 and 4.5 months for short-course and single-dose RT (p = 0.4), respectively. The median overall survival was 4 months for all cases. Light acute toxicity was registered in a minority of cases. Late toxicity was never recorded. Conclusion(s): Both RT schedules adopted were effective. As already shown in several trials evaluating RT regimens in uncomplicated painful bone metastases, also MSCC patients may achieve palliation with minimal toxicity and inconvenience with a single-dose of 8 Gy. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

1339,"Nuclear Cardiology Practices and Radiation Exposure in the Oceania Region: Results From the IAEA Nuclear Cardiology Protocols Study (INCAPS) BACKGROUND: There is concern about radiation exposure with radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). This sub-study of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Nuclear Cardiology Protocols Study reports radiation doses from MPI, and use of dose-optimisation protocols in Australia and New Zealand (ANZ), and compares them with data from the rest of the world., METHODS: Data were collected from 7911 MPI studies performed in 308 laboratories worldwide in one week in 2013, including 439 MPI studies from 34 ANZ laboratories. For each laboratory, effective radiation dose (ED) and a quality index (QI) score (out of 8) based on pre-specified ""best practices"" was determined., RESULTS: In ANZ patients, ED ranged from 0.9-17.9 milliSievert (mSv). Median ED was similar in ANZ compared with the rest of the world (10.0 (IQR: 6.5-11.7) vs. 10.0 (IQR 6.4-12.6, P=0.15), as were mean QI scores (5.5+/-0.7 vs. 5.4+/-1.3, P=0.84).

1905,"Clinical characteristics of patients with intradialytic hypertension Introduction and Aims: Intradialytic hypertension with a prevalence of 15% among hemodialysis patients is with unknown pathophysiology, demographic, laboratory and clinical characteristic of patients, and it's influence on long - lasting clinical effects (cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, rate of hospitalization). So, the aim of the study is to present the clinical, laboratory and demographic characteristics of patients with intradialytic hypertension in our dialysis center. Method(s): Of total 110 hemodialysis patients, 17 patients (15,45%) were intradialytic hypertensive - started at a systolic pressure greater than 140 mm Hg or had an increase in systolic pressure more than 10 mm Hg during the session, and 17 patients were normotensive or had a drop in blood pressure during the dialysis. HD were performed 3 times per week with a duration of 4-5 hours, on machines with controlled ultrafiltration and high flux syntetic membrane ( polyetersulfon) sterilized with gamma rays. It was used dialysate with standard electrolytes content (Na+ 138 mmol/L, K+ 2,0 mmol/L, Ca++ 1,5 mmol/L, Mg +1,0 mmol/L, CH3COO- 3,0 mmol/L, Cl -110 mmol/l, HCO3- 35 mmol/L). Analysed demographic and clinical characteristics were: gender, age, BMI, dialysis vintage, vascular acces, cardiovascular comorbidity (cardiomyopathy, ischemic cardiac disease, peripheral artery disease, heart valve disease), number and type of antihypertensive drugs, a weekly dose of erythropoesis - stimulating agent, standard monthly, three and six months laboratory analyzes, and sp Kt/V and PCR. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 17.0. Result(s): In the both groups were more men (IDH group 88,23%, control group 64,07%). IDH group was older (59,00+/- 7,64 versus 49.00+/- 13,91, p= 0,314) and with lower BMI (p = 0,246) compared to control group. Significantly lower serum sodium and higher sodium gradient had IDH patients (135,75+/-2,03 versus 137,33 +/-1,97, p= 0,042; 2,25+/-1,98 versus 0,66+/-1,44, p=0,0267, respestively).

2106,"Abdominal circumference but not the degree of lumbar flexion affects the accuracy of lumbar interspace identification by Tuffier's line palpation method: An observational study Background: Lumbar puncture for spinal or epidural anesthesia is commonly performed by palpating bony landmarks, but identification of the desired intervertebral level is often inaccurate. It is unclear whether such inaccuracy is related to patient factors, such as body mass index and degree of lumbar flexion. We hypothesized that overweight patients and patients with less of an ability to hyperflex their lumbar spines are prone to inaccurate lumbar spinous intervertebral level identification. Method(s): 52 adult volunteers were included in this study. 7 anesthesiologists with different years of experience identified and marked subjects' levels of the iliac crests, then marked the presumed interspaces. Lumbar X-ray was then performed with metal markers, and actual radiographic findings were identified and compared to the initial markings. Result(s): Patients with larger abdominal circumferences (mean (SD), 94.0(12.1) cm), higher body mass indices (25.9(3.9) kg/m), and aged between 50 and 70 years old had lumbar interspaces that were higher than the presumed level; patients with smaller abdominal circumferences (82.8(13.5) cm) and lower body mass indices (21.6(4.1) kg/m) had intervertebral levels that were lower than the presumed level. Cobb's angle, indicating the degree of lumbar flexion, did not affect the accuracy obtained. Conclusion(s): Patients' abdominal circumference, body mass index, and age are factors that may impact the accuracy of lumbar level identification. Tuffier's line, as identified by palpation, does not seem to be a reliable landmark for proper lumbar interspace identification in all cases.Copyright © Lin et al.",Excluded
2277,"Radiosurgery for the treatment of spinal melanoma metastases BACKGROUND: The role of stereotactic radiosurgery in treating metastatic melanoma involving the spine has previously been limited. Conventional external beam radiotherapy lacks the precision to allow delivery of large single-fraction doses of radiation and simultaneously to limit the dose delivered to radiosensitive structures such as the spinal cord. This study evaluated the clinical efficacy of radiosurgery for the treatment of melanoma spinal metastases in 28 patients., METHODS: Thirty-six melanoma spine metastases were treated with a single-session radiosurgery technique (1 cervical, 11 thoracic, 13 lumbar, and 11 sacral) with a follow-up period of 3-43 months (median 13 months). Tumor volume ranged from 4.1 to 153 cm3 (mean 47.6 cm3). Twenty-three of the 36 lesions had received prior external beam irradiation., RESULTS: Maximum tumor dose was maintained at 17.5-25 Gy (mean 21.7 Gy). Spinal cord volume receiving > 8 Gy ranged from 0.0 to 0.7 cm3 (mean 0.26 cm3); spinal canal volume at the cauda equina level receiving > 8 Gy ranged from 0.0 to 3.5 cm3 (mean 0.98 cm3). No radiation-induced toxicity occurred during the follow-up period. Axial and radicular pain improved in 27 of 28 patients (96%) who were treated primarily for pain. Long-term tumor control was seen in 3 of 4 cases treated primarily for radiographic tumor progression. Two patients went on to require open surgical intervention for tumor progression resulting in neurological deficit., CONCLUSIONS: Spinal radiosurgery offers a therapeutic modality for the safe delivery of large dose fractions of radiation therapy in a single fraction for the management of spinal metastases in patients with advanced melanoma that are often poorly controlled with alternative conventional external beam radiation therapy, and is successful even in patients with previously irradiated lesions.

1392,"Cell-free DNA levels and correlation to stage and outcome following treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer Accurate staging of rectal cancer remains essential for optimal patient selection for combined modality treatment, including radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery. We aimed at examining the correlation of cell free DNA with the pathologic stage and subsequent risk of recurrence for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer undergoing preoperative chemoradiation. We examined 75 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer receiving preoperative chemoradiation. Blood samples for translational use were drawn prior to rectal surgery. The level of cell free DNA was quantified by digital droplet PCR and expressed as copy number of beta 2 microglobulin. We found a median level of cell free DNA in the AJCC stages I-III of 3100, 8300, and 10,700 copies/mL respectively. For patients with 12 sampled lymph nodes or above, the median level of cell free DNA were 2400 copies/mL and 4400 copies/mL (p = 0.04) for node negative and node positive disease respectively. The median follow-up was 39 months and 11 recurrences were detected (15%). The median level for patients with recurrent disease was 13,000 copies/mL compared to 5200 copies/mL for non-recurrent patients (p = 0.08). We have demonstrated a correlation between the level of total cell free DNA and the pathologic stage and nodal involvement. Furthermore, we have found a trend towards a correlation with the risk of recurrence following resection of localized rectal cancer.Copyright © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",Excluded
2432,"Prevalence and characteristics of coronary artery anomalies detected by coronary computed tomography angiography in 5 634 consecutive patients in a single centre in Switzerland STUDY PRINCIPLES: Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) allows three-dimensional visualisation of the origin, course and ending of the coronary vessels with high spatial resolution, yielding an accurate depiction of coronary artery anomalies (CAAs). This study sought to determine the prevalence, incidence and characteristics of CAAs detected with CCTA in a single centre in Switzerland., METHODS: CAAs were retrospectively identified in 5 634 consecutive patients referred for CCTA between March 2007 and July 2015. Single coronary arteries, Bland-White-Garland syndrome, anomalous coronary arteries originating from the opposite site of the sinus of Valsalva (ACAOS) with an interarterial course and coronary artery fistulas were classified as potentially malignant CAAs., RESULTS: We identified 145 patients with CAAs, resulting in an overall prevalence of 2.6% and cumulative incidence of 2.1% in all patients referred for CCTA in the observation period. Forty-nine (33.8%) patients showed malignant CAAs including 1 (0.7%) patient with Bland-White-Garland syndrome, 7 (4.8%) with single coronary arteries, 36 (24.8%) with ACAOS and an interarterial course, and 5 (3.5%) with coronary artery fistulas. The remaining 96 (66.2%) patients were classified as having benign variants., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of CAA detected by CCTA is not negligible. Because of its noninvasive nature, relatively low cost and low radiation exposure, a further increase in the utilisation of CCTA may be expected, which may consequently be paralleled by an increasing absolute number of incidentally detected CAAs. Hence, awareness of the main issues and possible management strategies regarding CAAs is of importance for every treating physician.",Excluded

2154,"Utility of positron emission tomography/computed tomography in extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma Background: Natural killer (NK/) T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, is an aggressive form of extranodal lymphoma that is common in Asia, but rare in Europe and North America. Although NK/T-cell lymphoma involves upper aerodigestive sites such as the nasal cavity and nasopharynx, it frequently involves other extranodal sites, including the gastrointestinal tract, bone marrow, adrenal gland, and skin. Because of the frequency of extranodal site involvement, pretreatment evaluation of disease extension is important for staging and treatment. Recently, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) was evaluated for its usefulness in the prognosis and treatment response of aggressive B-cell lymphoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma, and relevant results were obtained. Many studies have evaluated the value of PET/CT for various types of B-cell lymphomas, but other similar studies involving T-cell and NK-cell lymphomas are rare. In the present study, we compared the utility of PET/CT and conventional modalities, particularly CT, in extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma. Patients and Method: From January 2006 to April 2010, 19 untreated patients with extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (11 males and 8 females; median age 61 years; range 13-90 years) were included in the study. PET/CT and conventional procedures (e.g., CTs and biopsies) were compared and evaluated for their abilities to detect tumor lesions and their influence in staging and treatment strategies. PET/CT was performed as an initial staging procedure. In addition to PET/CT, all patients underwent initial staging workups, including whole-body CT with contrast media, biopsies from the bone marrow and other sites, and panendoscopies of the upper aerodigestive tract. Patients were evaluated for clinical stage by both evaluation modalities (PET/CT and conventional modalities) according to the Ann Arbor Staging System, and treatment strategies were first planned based on staging results. Following PET/CT, the clinical stage was reevaluated in each patient, and treatment strategies were decided based on the re-staging results. Result(s): Seven patients (37%) had bone marrow involvement, eight (42%) were in Ann Arbor stage I-II, and 11 (58%) had a systemic dissemination. Most patients with systemic dissemination (9/11, 82%) had cutaneous lesions. The median number of disease sites was 4 (range, 1-15). The median number of positive lesions was 3 (range, 1-15) by PET/CT compared to 2 (range, 0-14) by CT (p = 0.12). Using PET/CT, 108 lesions (93%) were detected, and at least one FDG-avid lesion was observed at initial staging workups in all patients. In contrast, 70 lesions (60%) were detected by CT, and three patients (16%) did not show any positive lesion. Two lesions (2%) at the nasal cavity that were detected by biopsy were undetectable by either PET/CT or CT. The nodal and extranodal regions were separately evaluated by PET/CT and conventional modalities. In total, 28 nodal lesions were detected: all (100%) were positive by PET/CT and 26 (93%) by CT. Conversely, 89 extranodal lesions were detected, and 83 (93%) and 44 (49%) were positive by PET/CT and CT (p = 0.003), respectively. For the detection of upper aerodigestive lesions, PET/CT and CT demonstrated similar results: 23 lesions (92%) vs. 17 (68%), respectively. Notably, PET/CT was superior to CT in detecting cutaneous lesions [31 lesions (100%) vs. 19 lesions (61%), respectively; p = 0.026]. Bone marrow involvement was confirmed pathologically in only seven patients; four cases (57%) were positive by PET/CT and none by CT. Using conventional modalities, 11 patients (58%) were in the localized stage and eight (42%) were in the advanced stage. Using PET/CT, eight (42%) were in stage I-II and 11 (58%) were in stage III-IV. Most patients received chemotherapy plus local irradiation in stage I-II, and intensive chemotherapy with or without hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in stage III-IV. One patient did not receive treatment because of unwillingness for treatment and older age. PET/CT findin s altered the stage and treatment strategy in four (21%) and two cases (11%). Conclusion(s): In extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, PET/CT demonstrated a high detection rate for nodal and extranodal lesions, except in the bone marrow. PET/CT may have an impact on treatment strategy and is essential for risk-adapted treatment.",Excluded
1553,"Study on reflection of human skin with liquid paraffin as the penetration enhancer by spectroscopy Optical clearing agents can improve tissue optical transmittance by reducing the diffuse reflection. The reflection on in vivo human skin before and after applying anhydrous glycerol and 30 to 50% liquid paraffin glycerol mixed solution are investigated in this paper. From their visible and near-infrared reflection spectroscopy, all of their diffuse reflections are reduced after applying the agents. It is found that the three mixed solutions show stronger effect than that of anhydrous glycerol. These results further prove liquid paraffin can enhance the percutaneous penetration of glycerol and take synergistically optical clearing effect with glycerol over visible and near-infrared wave bands.",Excluded
1552,"Early stage non-small cell lung cancer treated with pencil beam scanning particle therapy: Retrospective analysis of early results on safety and efficacy Background: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of particle therapy (PT) using pencil beam scanning (PBS) technique for early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Method(s): From 08/2014 to 03/2018, 31 consecutive patients with sum of the longest diameters of primary tumor and hilar lymph node < 5 cm, N0-1, M0 NSCLC treated with PT were retrospectively analyzed. Gating/active breathing control techniques were used to control tumor motion in 20 and 7 patients. PBS-based proton radiotherapy (PRT) or carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) plans were designed via Syngo planning system. PRT, PRT + CIRT boost, and CIRT were used in 6, 6 and 19 patients, respectively. Prescriptions were categorized to 3 levels: 5-7.5 GyE*8-10 Fx, 4-5 GyE*15-16 Fx and 2.25-3.5 GyE*20-31 Fx. Result(s): Thirty-one patients (20 males and 11 females) with a median age of 71 (50-80) years were enrolled with a median follow-up time of 12.1 (2.9-45.2) months. Fourteen were adenocarcinomas, 7 squamous cell carcinomas, 4 non-specified NSCLC and 6 had no histological diagnosis (4/6 had previous resected lung cancer). The median tumor size was 3.1 (1.1-4.7) cm. No grade 4-5 toxicities were observed. One patient experienced grade 3 (per the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03) radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) at 6.7 months from radiation started. Grade 2 acute toxicities included hematological toxicities (5 cases), RILI (2), plural pain (1) and dermatitis (1). Grade 2 late toxicities included RILI (3) and asymptomatic rib fracture (1). Three patients had progressed disease at 4.0~10.6 months after the initiation of PT. One experienced local failure with simultaneous distant failure and died of brain metastasis at 10.8 months; one developed regional and distant failure and died of lung infection at 8.7 months; the other experienced isolated distant failure only and his disease was well controlled after salvage systemic therapy. The estimated rates of progression-free survival, local control, cause-specific survival and overall survival at 1, 2 years were 85.5% and 85.5%, 95.2% and 95.2%, 95.0% and 95.0%, 90.7% and 90.7%, respectively.

1659,"Temozolomide and irradiation combined treatment-induced Nrf2 activation increases chemoradiation sensitivity in human glioblastoma cells Resistance to chemoradiotherapy is a major obstacle to successful treatment of glioblastoma. Recently, the role of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in enhancing chemoradiation sensitivity has been reported in several types of cancers. Here, we investigated whether temozolomide (TMZ) and irradiation (IR) combined treatment induced Nrf2 activation in human glioblastoma cells. And we further performed a preliminary study about the effect of Nrf2 on chemoradiation sensitivity. Immunohistochemical staining for Nrf2 in paired clinical specimens showed that TMZ and IR combined treatment increased the expression and nuclear localization of Nrf2 in human glioblastoma tissues. Moreover, we found nuclear Nrf2 expression in the glioblastoma tissues obtained from the patients undergoing TMZ and IR combined treatment was associated with the time to tumor recurrence. In vitro, we further verified these findings. First, we detected increased nuclear localization of Nrf2 following treatment with TMZ+IR in human glioblastoma cell lines. Second, we demonstrated TMZ+IR increased the levels of Nrf2 protein in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of U251 cells and induced Nrf2 target genes expression. Finally, downregulating Nrf2 expression increased TMZ+IR-induced cell death in the U251 cells. These findings suggest TMZ+IR combined treatment induces Nrf2 activation in human glioblastoma cells. The activation of Nrf2 may be associate with enhancing chemoradiation sensitivity in human glioblastoma cell. Blocking Nrf2 activation may be a promising method enhancing chemoradiation sensitivity of glioblastoma cells.",Excluded
2116,"Investigation of sinonasal anatomy via low-dose multidetector CT examination in chronic rhinosinusitis patients with higher risk for perioperative complications The aim of the study was to compare visualisation of the surgically relevant anatomical structures via low- and standard-dose multidetector CT protocol in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and higher risk for perioperative complications (i.e. presence of bronchial asthma, history of sinus surgery and advanced nasal polyposis). 135 adult CRS patients were divided randomly into standard-dose (120 kVp, 100 mAs) or low-dose CT groups (120 kVp, 45 mAs). The detectability of the vital anatomical structures (anterior ethmoid artery, optic nerve, cribriform plate and lamina papyracea) was scored using a five-point scale (from excellent to unacceptable) by a radiologist and sinus surgeon. Polyp sizes were quantified endoscopically according to the Lildholdt's scale (LS). Olfactory function was tested with the ""Sniffin' Sticks"" test. On the low-dose CT images, detectability ranged from 2.42 (better than poor) for cribriform plate among anosmic cases to 4.11 (better than good) for lamina papyracea in cases without nasal polyps. Identification of lamina papyracea on low-dose scans was significantly worse in each group and the same was the case with cribriform plates in patients with advanced polyposis and anosmia. Cribriform plates were the most poorly identified (between poor and average) among all the structures on low-dose images. Identification of anterior ethmoid artery (AEA) with reduced dose was insignificantly worse than with standard-dose examination. The AEA was scored as an average-defined structure and was the second weakest visualised. In conclusion, preoperatively, low-dose protocols may not sufficiently visualise the surgically relevant anatomical structures in patients with CRS and bronchial asthma, advanced nasal polyps (LS > 2) and history of sinus surgery. Low mAs value enables comparable detectability of sinonasal landmarks with standard-dose protocols in patients without analysed risk factors. In the context of planned surgery, the current preferences of the tube should be carefully evaluated for different patient constitutions to minimise the risk of complications.",Excluded
2006,"Decreased asbestos-induced lung inflammation and fibrosis after radiation and bone marrow transplant The effect of lung irradiation on subsequent inflammatory or fibrotic lung injuries remains poorly understood. We postulated that irradiation and bone marrow transplantation might impact the development and progression of lung remodeling resulting from asbestos inhalation. Our objective was to determine whether irradiation and bone marrow transplantation affected inflammation and fibrosis associated with inhaled asbestos exposure. Inflammation, cytokine production, and fibrosis were assessed in lungs of naive and sex-mismatched chimeric mice exposed to asbestos for 3, 9, or 40 days. Potential engraftment of donor-derived cells in recipient lungs was examined by fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Compared with asbestos-exposed naive (nonchimeric) mice, chimeric mice exposed to asbestos for 3, 9, or 40 days demonstrated significant abrogation of acute increases in asbestos-associated inflammatory mediators and fibrosis. Donor-derived cells trafficked to lung but did not significantly engraft as phenotypic lung cells. Irradiation and bone marrow transplantation alters inflammatory and fibrotic responses to asbestos, likely through modulation of soluble inflammatory mediators.",Excluded
2113,"Radiation-related cranial nerve palsy in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma BACKGROUND: Cranial nerve palsy is a rare complication after patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) receive radiotherapy using a technique that delivers 180-200 centigrays (cGy) per day. Cranial neuropathy is of particular clinical interest in terms of making a differential diagnosis, because it is also a common presenting manifestation in patients with NPC. Cranial neuropathy may lead to distressing signs and symptoms in these patients, and their treatment has not been addressed in previous reports. This article presents the authors' experience with radiotherapy-related cranial nerve palsy in patients with NPC., METHODS: Nineteen patients were diagnosed with radiation-related neuropathy. Patients with recurrent tumors or with a suspicion of persistent or recurrent tumors were excluded. Most patients were treated using 180 cGy or 200 cGy per fraction per day. The total dose was 7000-13,000 cGy to the nasopharynx and 5000-9000 cGy to the neck. Unilateral vocal cord paralysis alone and hearing loss were not included in the analysis., RESULTS: There were 15 male patients and 4 female patients. The latency before palsy occurred was 12-240 months. Single nerve palsy developed in four patients, including two patients with hypoglossal palsy and two patients with recurrent laryngeal palsy. Two patients had three nerve palsies each. The other 13 patients presented with 2 nerve palsies each. Vagus and hypoglossal palsy appeared to be a frequent combination and occurred in 11 patients. Overall, there were 17 patients with hypoglossal palsy (7 bilateral, 8 left-sided, and 2 right-sided), 11 patients with vagus palsy (2 bilateral, 7 left-sided, and 2 right-sided), 6 patients with recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy (5 bilateral), and 2 patients with accessory palsies (all bilateral). Marked neck fibrosis was present in 12 patients. Patients who had vocal cord paralysis suffered from easy choking and hoarseness. Severe respiratory difficulty occurred in two patients who had bilateral vocal cord palsy. Surgical procedures included laryngoplasty, tracheostomy, and gastrostomy. Quality of life improved considerably after patients underwent surgery., CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy-related cranial nerve palsy may occur in patients with NPC after they receive conventional radiotherapy. Hypoglossal nerve palsy was found the most frequently in this series, followed by vagus nerve palsy and recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy. Neck fibrosis and the course of the three nerves through the neck may be important risk factors for the development of palsy. The diagnosis must be made only after the possibilities of tumor-induced palsy and idiopathic palsy are excluded. Surgery is helpful in improving the quality of life in many patients.

1467,"Intensity-modulated Radiation Therapy for Anal Cancer: Results From a Multi-Institutional Retrospective Cohort Study OBJECTIVES: To assess toxicity and efficacy of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for anal cancer., METHODS: Records of 152 patients were reviewed retrospectively from multiple institutions. Data on disease control and toxicity were collected as well as patient and treatment characteristics. Acute (<6 mo) and late (>=6 mo) severe toxicity (grade >=3) were graded. Four patients were excluded due to the presence of metastatic disease or stage TX. Late toxicity data were available for 120 patients., RESULTS: Median cumulative IMRT dose was 51.25 Gy (median, 28 fractions). All but 2 patients received chemotherapy. With median follow-up of 26.8 months, local control at 3 years was 87%, worse for patients with T3-T4 than T1-T2 disease on univariate analysis (79% vs. 90%; P=0.04). Regional control, distant control, and overall survival were 97%, 91%, and 87%, respectively, at 3 years. Nodal status was associated with regional control, distant control, and overall survival (P<0.01 for each). Most common severe acute toxicity was hematologic (41%), skin (20%), and gastrointestinal tract (11%). Two grade 5 toxicities occurred (hematologic and gastrointestinal tract). Severe late toxicity affected skin (1%) and gastrointestinal tract (3%)., CONCLUSIONS: IMRT with chemotherapy resulted in excellent local control. Although T stage predicted worse local control, most T3-T4 disease was controlled with IMRT. Nodal status predicted regional and distant control and overall survival. Severe toxicity was acceptable.",Excluded
2412,"Outcomes of Trimodal Therapy for cT2-3 Urothelial Carcinoma in a Racially Diverse Population: A Single Institution Experience in the Bronx BACKGROUND: Radical cystectomy (RC) is the historical 'gold standard' treatment for cT2-3 urothelial carcinoma (UC). However, recent evidence supports comparable outcomes of bladder preserving trimodal therapy (TMT) to RC in select patients. OBJECTIVE(S): To assess the oncologic outcomes of our institutional TMT experience. METHOD(S): We retrospectively identified all patients that received radiation therapy (RT) for cT2-3 UC from 2012 to 2018. Clinicopathologic data was then extracted from the patients' medical records. We included patients who underwent RT with or without concurrent chemotherapy for curative intent after diagnostic TURBT, with or without re-staging TURBT. Patient clinical (age, sex, race) and pathologic/disease characteristics of bladder cancer (stage, presence of hydronephrosis, concurrent carcinoma in-situ) were collected. Primary outcomes were: response to TMT (complete response [CR], partial response [PR], progression), recurrence-free, and overall survival. We also analyzed rates of salvage cystectomy and associated disease-specific outcomes. Response was based on the first surveillance imaging, cystoscopy, or TURBT after completion of TMT. RESULT(S): 24 patients underwent TMT during the study period. 29.2% of patients were black/non-hispanic, 37.5% were latino/hispanic, and 20.8% were white/non-hispanic. 58.3% of patients were female. 19 (79.2%), 3 (12.5%), and 2 (8.3%) patients experienced CR, PR and progression after TMT, respectively. At a median follow-up of 22.4 months, 19 (79.2%) patients were recurrence-free, 3 were alive with disease (12.5%), and 2 expired from other causes (8.3%; 1 with and 1 without disease present). Overall, 22 (92.7%) patients were still alive at last follow-up. No clinical variables were significant predictors of CR to TMT. CONCLUSION(S): In concordance with prior reports, TMT offers excellent tumor response rates for patients seeking definitive therapy for cT2-3 UC. Extended follow-up is needed to assess the durability of response and long-term survival after TMT.Copyright © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1733,"Phase I study of involved-field radiotherapy preceding autologous stem cell transplantation for patients with high-risk lymphoma or Hodgkin's disease PURPOSE: This Phase I study was designed to evaluate the tolerability of involved-field radiotherapy (IFRT) to areas of persistent disease in patients with high-risk Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas before autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty-one patients with primary refractory or relapsed Hodgkin's disease (n = 13) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 18) were treated with IFRT followed by high-dose chemotherapy and ASCT. All patients had bulky disease (> or =5 cm) and/or an inadequate response to salvage chemotherapy. The IFRT dose was escalated to a maximum of 36 Gy. Dose-limiting toxicity was defined as Grade 3-4 Bearman toxicity (life-threatening/fatal toxicity occurring within 28 days of ASCT). The chemotherapy regimen consisted of cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and carmustine., RESULTS: The delivered dose of IFRT was 20 Gy in 9 patients, 28-30 Gy in 20, and 32-36 Gy in 2 patients to mediastinal (n = 19) and nonmediastinal (n = 12) sites. The median interval between IFRT completion and ASCT was 19 days. One patient developed Bearman Grade 3 hepatic toxicity. No other Grade 3 or 4 Bearman toxicity was observed. An increased requirement for i.v. narcotics was observed in patients treated with mediastinal IFRT vs. nonmediastinal IFRT (p = 0.02). A trend toward increased mucositis severity was seen in patients previously treated with a larger number of chemotherapy agents (p = 0.09) and in those with a shorter interval between IFRT and ASCT (p = 0.12). Pulmonary toxicity was more common in patients treated with mediastinal IFRT than in those treated with nonmediastinal IFRT (21% vs. 0%, p = 0.13). The 2-year overall and progression-free survival rate was 70% and 49% for all patients, 84% and 50% for patients with Hodgkin's disease, and 59% and 47% for patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, respectively., CONCLUSION: The maximal tolerated dose of IFRT was not reached when Grade 3-4 Bearman toxicity was dose limiting. Increased pulmonary toxicity and mucositis severity was seen after mediastinal IFRT compared with nonmediastinal IFRT. Because local control was excellent, higher doses of IFRT are not recommended.

1551,"Ante-grade intramedullary nailing for the treatment of humeral shaft metastatic bone tumor Background: The surgical treatment of humeral fractures is controversial, and conservative therapy of pathologic fractures is not recommended. Material(s) and Method(s): We performed a retrospective study of eight patients who had pathological humeral shaft fractures. All fractures were stabilized with ante-grade intramedullary nailing and wide resection of the tumor. Bone defects were filled with polymethylmethacrylate cement augmentation. Result(s): The mean operative time for the procedure was 160 min (range, 120-190 min), and the mean duration of hospitalization was 10.5 days (range, 5-15 days). Relief of pain was rated as good to excellent. There were no wound problems, deep infections, nerve palsies, or implant failures observed. X-ray studies demonstrated the improved stability of the humerus. Conclusion(s): Interlocking intramedullary nailing for pathological humeral shaft fractures provides immediate stability and can be accomplished with wide resection of tumor and bone defect augmentation with cement. Early return of functional status and pain relief greatly improved the patient's quality of life.Copyright © 2014 JMS.",Excluded
1301,"Thermoradiotherapy of patients with locally advanced carcinoma of the rectum The effectiveness of local hyperthermia was investigated in 56 patients with locally advanced carcinoma of the rectum (T4N0M0).

Both groups of patients underwent the same surgical procedure. The total tumour dose of ionizing radiation was 40 Gy in 10 fractions, three times a week. The tumour was heated four or five times to a maximum of 42-43 degrees C by electromagnetic waves with a frequency of 905 MHz before irradiation. Each heating session lasted 60 min. Patients were selected on the principle of randomization: 16.1% of patients (n = 9; n: actual number of patients) showed complete response and 53.6% (n = 30) showed significant regression of the primary tumour compared with 1.7% (n = 1) and 33.9% (n = 20) in the control group, respectively. The differences were significant (p less than 0.05).

1928,"Neuropathology of intracranial arteriovenous malformations following conventional radiation therapy Conventional fractionated radiation therapy was used in 15 patients to treat arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the brain deemed inoperable or incompletely obliterated using endovascular or surgical techniques. The AVMs measured from 0.8 to 85 cm3 (mean 28.2 cm3; median 24 cm3). Angiography in 12 patients 1-21 years following radiation therapy demonstrated no significant change in 7, slight reduction in 2, near complete obliteration in 1, and complete obliteration in 2. Magnetic resonance imaging further demonstrated apparent obliteration in one other case. Three irradiated AVMs were available for pathological examination following fatal recurrent hemorrhage after 21 years in case 1 and following surgery after 5 years in cases 2 and 3. Doses of 20 and 45 Gy were delivered to the area of the AVM in 10 and 15 fractions with a 6-MV linear accelerator in case 1 and in cases 2 and 3, respectively. A blinded histopathological comparison was made of the latter cases and three AVMs removed at surgery that were not previously irradiated and that were comparable in size, number of arterial feeders, and location within the brain. Segmental hyalinization of some blood vessels was seen in both irradiated and nonirradiated cases. The single postmortem specimen showed extensive thrombosis but a patent nidus. The findings are in keeping with the clinical impression that conventional fractionated radiation therapy fails to alter the natural history of cerebral AVMs. The favorable outcome of radiosurgery on small- to medium-sized AVMs appears attributable to the shorter duration of therapy using relatively high-dose prescriptions to the nidus.",Excluded
2237,"Vitamin D receptor gene polymorphisms and Parkinson's disease in a population with high ultraviolet radiation exposure INTRODUCTION: A high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency has been reported in Parkinson's disease (PD). Epidemiologic studies examining variability in genes involved in vitamin D metabolism have not taken into account level of exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR). We examined whether exposure to UVR (as a surrogate for vitamin D levels) and variations in the vitamin D receptor gene (VDR) are associated with PD., METHODS: Within a geographical information system (GIS) we linked participants' geocoded residential address data to ground level UV data to estimate historical exposure to UVR. Six SNPs in VDR were genotyped in non-Hispanic Caucasian subjects., RESULTS: Average lifetime UVR exposure levels were >5000 Wh/m(2), which was higher than levels for populations in previous studies, and UVR exposure did not differ between cases and controls. Homozygotes for the rs731236 TT (major allele) genotype had a 31% lower risk of PD risk (OR=0.69; 95% CI=0.49, 0.98; p=0.04 for TT vs. TC+CC). The rs7975232 GG (minor allele) genotype was also associated with decreased risk of PD (OR=0.63; 95% CI=0.42, 0.93; p=0.02 for GG vs. TG+TT). The association between PD risk and a third locus, rs1544410 (BsmI), was not statistically significant after adjustment for covariates, although there was a trend for lower risk with the GG genotype., CONCLUSIONS: This study provides initial evidence that VDR polymorphisms may modulate risk of PD in a population highly exposed to UVR throughout lifetime.

Method(s): Twenty-six patients with LAGBC, treated with NACRT (55-57 Gy/25 fractions/5 weeks and weekly gemcitabine 300 mg/m2) within a phase II study, were included. Whenever feasible, surgery was performed after NACRT. Acute and late hepatobiliary toxicity was recorded. Treatment scans were retrieved to delineate central porto-hepatobiliary system (CPHBS), resected liver surface, segment IV B and V, and duodenum. The doses received by these structures were recorded and correlated with toxicity. Result(s): Of 26 patients, 20 (77%) had partial or complete response and 12 (46%) had R0 resection.

2076,"The lack of cytotoxic effect and radioadaptive response in splenocytes of mice exposed to low level internal beta-particle irradiation through tritiated drinking water in vivo Health effects of tritium, a beta-emitter and a by-product of the nuclear industry, is a subject of significant controversy. This mouse in vivo study was undertaken to monitor biological effects of low level tritium exposure. Mice were exposed to tritiated drinking water (HTO) at 10 KBq/L, 1 MBq/L and 20 MBq/L concentrations for one month. The treatment did not result in a significant increase of apoptosis in splenocytes. To examine if this low level tritium exposure alters radiosensitivity, the extracted splenocytes were challenged in vitro with 2 Gy gamma-radiation, and apoptotic responses at 1 and 24 h were measured. No alterations in the radiosensitivity were detected in cells from mice exposed to tritium compared to sham-treated mice. In contrast, low dose gamma-irradiation at 20 or 100 mGy, resulted in a significant increase in resistance to apoptotic cell death after 2 Gy irradiation; an indication of the radioadaptive response. Overall, our data suggest that low concentrations of tritium given to mice as HTO in drinking water do not exert cytotoxic effect in splenocytes, nor do they change cellular sensitivity to additional high dose gamma-radiation. The latter may be considered as the lack of a radioadaptive response, typically observed after low dose gamma-irradiation. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Included
2192,"Low-dose semi-coronal CT of the sacroiliac joints in the early diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis Background: Imaging modalities are essential for the diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Radiographic sacroiliitis is the requirement of 1984 modified New York (mNY) criteria for AS but with the disadvantage of low sensitivity. MRI has the advantage of detecting active inflammatory lesions but was criticized for low specificity. Computerized tomography (CT) has higher diagnostic accuracy than radiography in detecting structural changes, but its application has been limited for high radiation dose. The reduction of radiation dose can be achieved by decreasing the tube current[1] and previous study has demonstrated that effective dose (ED) of semi-coronal sacroiliac joint (SIJ) CT is at least six times lower in female or nearly four times lower in male than that of axial SIJ CT[2]. Objective(s): To evaluate the value of low-dose semi-coronal SIJ CT in the early diagnosis of AS. Method(s): Thirty-three patients diagnosed by mNY criteria who had pre-existing axial SIJ CT in past two years with visible structural damage were enrolled. These patients underwent low-dose semi-coronal SIJ CT examination which was obtained at 3-mm slices, 140 kV and 120 mAs, with the gantry tilted 20-25degree cranially. The ED of the low-dose semi-coronal CT and the pre-existing conventional axial CT were compared. Image qualities of the low-dose semicoronal CT were blind-graded separately by 2 rheumatologists into poor, fair, good or excellent. And the correlation between image quality and body mass index (BMI) was analyzed. The CT scans were read in a blinded manner by 2 rheumatologists who had been trained by radiologists. CT scans of the two groups were graded respectively by mNY criteria, the criteria established by Lee[3] and the Innsbruck criteria[4]. The kappa coefficient was used to assess the consistency of grading between the two groups. Result(s): Thirty-three patients received low-dose semi-coronal CT examination with an average ED of 3.37 mSv, which meant a 49% reduction in radiation compared to the pre-existing CT. The quality of images of male patients with BMI<25 kg/m2 and all female patients were good or excellent. Image qualities were assessed as poor or fair in 58% (7/12) male patients whose BMI>25 kg/m2. There was a significant negative correlation between image quality and BMI (r=-0.784,P=0.000). The grading of low-dose semi-coronal CT showed no differences as compared with the pre-existing CT by mNY criteria (see below). For the other two classification criteria, the consistency of grading between the two groups were satisfactory (kappa=0.897 by Lee criteria; kappa=0.814 by Innsbruck criteria; P>0.05). Conclusion(s): The radiation dose of low-dose semi-coronal SIJ CT was reduced significantly compared with the conventional axial SIJ CT with acceptable diagnostic efficacy.

1628,"Minimizing radiation exposure during ERCP by avoiding live or continuous fluoroscopy Goals: The aim of this study was to assess the cumulative radiation exposure incurred by patients when using single-frame fluoroscopy. Background(s): Single-frame fluoroscopy is a technique that can be used instead of pulsed fluoroscopy or continuous live fluoroscopy to minimize radiation exposure during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Study: We retrospectively reviewed ERCPs performed at our academic medical center. We recorded fluoroscopy time (FT, minutes), total radiation dose (mGy), dose area product (DAP, Gycm2), and effective dose (ED, mSv). ERCP degree of difficulty was graded based on procedure complexity level. Result(s): There were 400 ERCP procedures performed on 210 patients, 32 ERCPs were unsuccessful. The mean FT for all procedures was 1.57 minutes (median, 1.2 min); the mean FT for complexity score 1 procedures (0.78 min) was significantly shorter than for all other procedures (P<0.0001). The mean total radiation dose delivered for all procedures was 23.02mGy (median, 14.95 mGy). The total radiation dose for complexity score 1 procedures (13.15 mGy) was significantly lower than for all other complexity scores (P<0.0001). The mean total DAP was 3.62Gycm2 and the mean ED was 0.94 mSv. Procedure complexity score 1 DAP (2.1Gycm2) and ED (0.55 mSv) were significantly lower than for all other procedures (P<0.0001 for both). There was no statistically significant difference in these parameters when comparing successful and unsuccessful procedures. Conclusion(s): Successful ERCP can be performed using single-frame fluoroscopy only. Our results demonstrate lower radiation exposure using this technique than what is reported in the literature.Copyright © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1913,"Dynamic CT for parathyroid adenoma detection: How does radiation dose compare with nuclear medicine? OBJECTIVE. Dynamic CT is increasingly used for preoperative localization of parathyroid adenomas, but concerns remain about the radiation effective dose of CT compared with that of99mTc-sestamibi scintigraphy. The purpose of this study was to compare the radiation dose delivered by three-phase dynamic CT with that delivered by99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT performed in accordance with our current protocols and to assess the possible reduction in effective dose achieved by decreasing the scan length (i.e., z-axis) of two phases of the dynamic CT protocol. MATERIALS AND METHODS. The effective dose of a99mTc-sestamibi nuclear medicine parathyroid study performed with and without coregistration CT was calculated and compared with the effective dose of our current three-phase dynamic CT protocol as well as a proposed protocol involving CT with reduced scan length. RESULTS. The median effective dose for a99mTc-sestamibi nuclear medicine study was 5.6 mSv. This increased to 12.4 mSv with the addition of coregistration CT, which is higher than the median effective dose of 9.3 mSv associated with the dynamic CT protocol. Reducing the scan length of two phases in the dynamic CT protocol could reduce the median effective dose to 6.1 mSv, which would be similar to that of the dose from the99mTc-sestamibi study alone. CONCLUSION. Dynamic CT used for the detection of parathyroid adenoma can deliver a lower radiation dose than99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT. It may be possible to reduce the dose further by decreasing the scan length of two of the phases, although whether this has an impact on accuracy of the localization needs further investigation.Copyright © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded
2208,"Gamma knife radiosurgery for trigeminal neuralgia: Results and potentially predictive parameters - Part I: Idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia OBJECTIVE: Gamma knife radiosurgery (GKR) is an increasingly used, minimally invasive treatment option for patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN) refractory to medical therapy. This retrospective study evaluates the long-term results and side effects of GKR in the treatment of TN focusing on potentially predictive factors. METHOD(S): One hundred sixty patients with TN were included in this study (minimum follow-up, >6 mo; mean, 37.4 mo; range, 6-144 mo). In 92 patients, GKR represented the first nonmedical option (""primary GKR""). In 68 patients, invasive treatments had been previously attempted. All patients were treated using a single 4-mm collimator shot targeting the pontine trigeminal root entry zone with a maximal dose of 75 to 95 Gy. Brainstem dose exposure never exceeded 15 Gy. Treatment outcome results were classified as Grade I (pain-free with no pharmacological treatment), Grade II (pain-free with pharmacological treatment), and Grade III (no result). Data were analyzed using the log-rank test for univariate analysis and the ordered logit model for multivariate analysis. RESULT(S): In the overall series, 98 (61%) out of 160 patients reached a Grade I outcome, 45 (29%) reached a Grade II outcome, and 17 (10%) patients had no results from GKR. These results were encouraging for patients with typical facial pain features and for patients treated by a ""primary"" gamma knife. Considering the global outcome, the most effective and safest dose was found to be in the 80 to 90 Gy range. CONCLUSION(S): According to our experience, GKR represents a reliable second-line therapeutic approach for TN after pharmacological failure. Favorable prognostic factors include ""primary GKR"" and maximal GKR dose ranging between 80 and 90 Gy. Copyright © by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.",Excluded
1610,"Cone-beam computed tomography-hepatic arteriography as a diagnostic tool for small hypervascular hepatocellular carcinomas: Method and clinical implications Objective: This study proposes a novel reference standard for hypervascular hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), established by cone-beam computed tomography-hepatic arteriography (CBCT-HA) and two-year imaging follow-up, and discusses its clinical implication on tumor staging and understanding the intrahepatic distant recurrence (IDR) in relation to dynamic computed tomography (CT). Material(s) and Method(s): In this retrospective study, 99 patients were enrolled, who underwent CBCT-HA during initial chemoembolization for HCC suspected on CT. All patients underwent chemoembolization and regular clinical and imaging follow-up for two years. If IDR appeared on follow-up imaging, initial CBCT-HA images were reviewed to determine if a hypervascular focus pre-existed at the site of recurrence. Pre-existing hypervascular foci on CBCT-HA were regarded as HCCs in initial presentation. Initial HCCs were classified into three groups according to their mode of detection (Group I, detected on CT and CBCT-HA; Group II, additionally detected on CBCT-HA; Group III, confirmed by interval growth). We assessed the influence of CBCT-HA and two-year follow-up on initial tumor stage and calculated the proportion of IDR that pre-existed in initial CBCT-HA. Result(s): A total of 405 nodules were confirmed as HCCs, and 297 nodules initially pre-existed. Of the initial 297 HCCs, 149 (50.2%) lesions were in Group I, 74 (24.9%) lesions were in Group II, and the remaining 74 (24.9%) lesions were in Group III. After applying CBCT-HA findings, 11 patients upstaged in T stage, and 4 patients had a change in Milan criteria. Our reference standard for HCC indicated that 120 of 148 (81.1%) one-year IDR and 148 of 256 (57.8%) two-year IDR existed on initial CBCT-HA. Conclusion(s): The proposed method enabled the confirmation of many sub-centimeter-sized, faintly vascularized HCC nodules that pre-existed initially but clinically manifested as IDR. Our reference standard for HCC helped in understanding the nature of IDR and the early development of HCC as well as the clinical impact of tumor staging and treatment decision.Copyright © 2020 The Korean Society of Radiology.",Excluded
1259,"Cutaneous manifestations in patients with haematological malignancy: A single-centre Egyptian study Background Systemic chemotherapy or radiotherapy may produce several cutaneous manifestations. An awareness of possible associations between internal malignancies and cutaneous manifestations is therefore important in the diagnosis and management of cancer. Objective In the present work, assessment of the prevalence of cutaneous manifestations in patients with haematological malignancy was performed. Patients and methods A total of 160 patients diagnosed with haematological malignancies were subjected to full history taking, cutaneous examination and photography of positive clinical findings, routine laboratory investigations, regional body imaging and bone marrow aspiration analysis. Biopsy, pathology and immunophenotyping of cutaneous lesions were performed when needed. Results Cutaneous manifestations occurred in 73 cases (45.6%) with infections being the most common and cutaneous lymphoma/leukaemia the least common. Side effects of chemotherapy affected 43 patients, the commonest being anagen effluvium (19 patients). Mucocutaneous side effects of radiotherapy were present in five of the eight cases (62.5%) in the form of erythema, ulceration and pigmentation, and this was statistically significant (P<0.001). Conclusion Mucocutaneous manifestations were found in 45.6% of patients with haematological malignancy mainly in the form of infections. Side effects of chemotherapy were mainly in the form of anagen effluvium, whereas those due to radiotherapy were significantly more common but were mild and well tolerated.Copyright © 2015 Egyptian Women's Dermatologic Society.",Excluded
1539,"Population-based outcomes by immunosuppressed status in patients undergoing radiotherapy for oropharyngeal cancer Introduction: The incidence of immunosuppression in patients with oropharynx head & neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is not well studied. This study evaluates disease characteristics and treatment outcomes in oropharynx SCC in patients with and without immunosuppression. Method(s): A retrospective review of all patients treated with radiotherapy for oropharynx SCC at BC Cancer from 2011 to 2016 was performed. Survival outcomes were assessed using Kaplan-Meier methods and competing risk analysis. Multivariate analysis and propensity score matching were performed. Result(s): There were 1077 patients, of which 5.8% (n = 62) had an immunosuppressive medical condition or were taking long-term immunosuppressive medication at diagnosis. Median follow-up was 3.3 years. Three year OS for patients without immunosuppression was 79.5% (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 76.8-82.0%) and for those with immunosuppression was 64.6% (95% CI 50.9-75.3%) (hazard ratio [HR] 1.78, 95% CI 1.18-2.68, p = 0.0062). The three year disease recurrence for patients without immunosuppression was 24.9% (95% CI 22.2-27.7%) and 44.4% (95% CI 31.5-56.6%) for those with immunosuppression (HR 2.12, 95% CI 1.45-3.11, p = 0.0001). Multivariate analysis of disease free survival (DFS) found that active smoking, advanced TNM stage, base of tongue subsite, p16 negative and unknown, no concurrent chemotherapy, higher Charlson Comorbidity Index, and lower radiation dose were also associated with worse DFS (all p < 0.05). Immunosuppressed patients had worse DFS relative to patients without immunosuppression, p < 0.001, HR 1.97 (95% CI 1.33-2.91). Conclusion(s): Immunosuppression was an independent predictor of worse DFS in this large cohort of patients with oropharynx SCC.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the amount of tagged stool and fluid significantly affects the radiation exposure in low-dose screening CT colonography performed with an automatic tube-current modulation technique., METHODS: The study included 311 patients. The tagging agent was barium (n = 271) or iodine (n = 40). Correlation was measured between mean volume CT dose index (CTDI (vol)) and the estimated x-ray attenuation of the tagged stool and fluid (ATT). Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to determine the effect of ATT on CTDI (vol ) and the effect of ATT on image noise while adjusting for other variables including abdominal circumference., RESULTS: CTDI (vol) varied from 0.88 to 2.54 mGy. There was no significant correlation between CTDI (vol) and ATT (p = 0.61). ATT did not significantly affect CTDI (vol) (p = 0.93), while abdominal circumference was the only factor significantly affecting CTDI (vol) (p < 0.001). Image noise ranged from 59.5 to 64.1 HU. The p value for the regression model explaining the noise was 0.38., CONCLUSION: The amount of stool and fluid tagging does not significantly affect radiation exposure.",Excluded
1341,"Bone healing andweight bearingmanagement in tibial diaphysis fracture unilateral external fixation Objective: Tibial diaphysis fracture represents the commonest long bone fracture and is a major cause of professional and social absenteeism for the patient. Its management is included in the everyday practice of an Orthopaedic surgeon having various available treatment options. We wanted to evaluate the time to bone healing in tibial diaphysis fractures treated with unilateral external fixator regarding the weight bearing management. Method(s): After obtaining the hospital ethics committee approval, we retrospectively reviewed the x-rays and case notes of 54 patients who underwent an Orthofix unilateral external fixator after sustaining a tibial diaphysis closed fracture. Our primary outcome was the time to clinical and radiological bone healing and the secondary outcome of our review was the different weight bearing postoperative management. The patients were separated in 3 groups regarding the commencement of post-op weight bearing. Group 1 contained patients who started weight bearing from day 1 to day 30, in group 2 were patients who started bearing weight from day 31 until day 60 and group 3 had patients who commenced bearing weight on the affected limp after 61 days postop. Result(s): The mean time to clinical and radiological bone healing was 21 weeks after the application of the tibial diaphysis fracture unilateral external fixator. Group 1 achieved the shortest mean time to bone healing with 15 weeks. Conclusion(s): The weight bearing management regarding its early commencement could favor the time to bone healing in tibial diaphysis fracture unilateral external fixation.",Excluded

2023,"Assessment of real-world data surrogate for the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) OBJECTIVES: The 21stCentury Cures Act calls for the incorporation of real-world evidence (RWE) into the drug labeling process. Critics cite deficiencies of RWE as compared to randomized controlled trials (RCT). We aimed to assess whether subjectively reported best response to treatment differed from responses based on radiographic measurements of target lesions. METHOD(S): Electronic case report forms (eCRF) were fielded to assess clinical response to systemic therapy in a rare malignancy. A comparison of subjectively reported best response with radio-graphic measurements of target lesions was performed to assess responses. RESULT(S): Fifteen physicians with experience treating this malignancy participated in a CRF-based analysis of patterns of care. Treatment response for each line of therapy was collected for each of the 59 patients via CRF. For 9 patients (15%) with reported partial remission (PR), CRFs were augmented with bi-dimensional measurements of sentinel tumors from pre-treatment and best response radiographs (reports). Treatment response was calculated using sum of diameters according to RECIST and compared to the corresponding physician-reported response. Measurement-based response revealed 4 PR, 2 stable disease, and 3 progressive disease, and a concordance of 44.4% (95% CI: 15.3%, 77.4%) between response assessment methods. Reasons cited for variance include availability of previous scans for comparison, inconsistency in target lesions imaged, bone metastases difficult to follow, and use of diameter vs SUV (standardized uptake value) on positron emission topography (PET) scans. CONCLUSION(S): Subjective assessments of response collected via manual chart extraction, electronic medical record (EMR) review via natural language processing, or CRF may be problematic and limit the potential role of RWE in drug label expansion. The collection of target lesion measurements by CRF presents an attractive alternative to elevate the quality and accuracy of clinical response assessment in oncologic patients, but limitations exist.",Excluded
2316,"Hybrid resistance to parental bone marrow grafts in nonlethally irradiated mice Resistance to parental bone marrow (BM) grafts in F1 hybrid recipients is due to natural killer (NK) cell-mediated rejection triggered through ""missing self"" recognition. ""Hybrid resistance"" has usually been investigated in lethally irradiated F1 recipients in conjunction with pharmacological activation of NK cells. Here, we investigated BM-directed NK-cell alloreactivity in settings of reduced conditioning. Nonlethally irradiated (1-3 Gy) or nonirradiated F1 (C57BL6 x BALB/c) recipient mice received titrated doses (5-20 x 106) of unseparated parental BALB/c BM without pharmacological NK cell activation. BM successfully engrafted in all mice and multilineage donor chimerism persisted long-term (24 weeks), even in the absence of irradiation. Chimerism was associated with the rearrangement of the NK-cell receptor repertoire suggestive of reduced reactivity to BALB/c. Chimerism levels were lower after transplantation with parental BALB/c than with syngeneic F1 BM, indicating partial NK-mediated rejection of parental BM. Activation of NK cells with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid sodium salt poly(I:C), reduced parental chimerism in nonirradiated BM recipients but did not prevent hematopoietic stem cell engraftment. In contrast, equal numbers of parental lymph node cells were completely rejected. Hence, hybrid resistance leads to incomplete rejection of parental BM under reduced conditioning settings.Copyright © 2018 The Authors American Journal of Transplantation published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons",Excluded

1873,"Assessment of ocular exposure to ultraviolet-B for population studies. Salisbury Eye Evaluation Project Team We have developed an empirical model with which to estimate the ocular exposure in the UVB wavelength band. This model incorporates aspects of personal behavior, geographic location, season and wavelength that have been developed from population-based data. This model, in conjunction with job history interviews, allows the estimate of cumulative exposures from age 30 in our population-based study. We present data on average annual exposure by age, gender, race, education and reported photophobia. The exposures in the general population are considerably lower than exposures reported in previous works based on occupational groups. There is a statistically significant difference between males and females, with females having lower exposures. African-Americans have median exposures similar to whites. Exposures decrease with education and with reported photophobia. These data provide the basis for characterizing lifetime exposure for the general population. The variability of exposure is much greater than found in occupational groups and includes numbers in the lowest exposure. The model should permit determination of a dose-response relationship with eye disease, even to the lower dose ranges.",Excluded

It is unclear whether preoperative chemoradiotherapy is truly beneficial in the elderly patients. Our aim was to assess the impact of age on the treatment tolerance and clinical outcomes., METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 160 consecutive patients with clinical stage T3-4, and/or lymph node positive tumors who received preoperative chemoradiotherapy from May 2003 to December 2010 at a single hospital. Treatment tolerance and outcomes were compared between patients >=70 years (N = 56) and <70 years (N = 104)., RESULTS: There was no disparity in the achievement of prescribed radiation dose and dose reduction of chemotherapy between two groups. Pathologic complete response rate (15.6% vs. 16.0%) and sphincter preservation rate (91.1% vs. 95.0%; P = 0.459) were not significantly different. The 3-year disease-free survival of older vs. younger patients was 77.8% vs. 92.3% and 5-year disease-free survival was 60.0% vs. 78.6%, respectively (P = 0.023). In multivariable analysis, age was significantly associated with disease-free survival (P = 0.033) but comorbidities were not (P = 0.092). However, both age (hazard ratio, 2.331; P = 0.028) and comorbidities (hazard ratio, 2.772; P = 0.031) were significantly associated with overall survival as well as clinical stage. Anemia was the only adverse effect more prominent in older patients., CONCLUSIONS: Older patients showed non-inferior compliance and equivalent pathologic complete response rates without an increased incidence of treatment complications with preoperative chemoradiotherapy. More comprehensive consideration than age alone is warranted in the decision of applying preoperative chemoradiotherapy to elderly patients with rectal cancer. Copyright © The Author 2016.

2275,"Colostomy is a simple and effective procedure for severe chronic radiation proctitis AIM: To assess the efficacy and safety of diverting colostomy in treating severe hemorrhagic chronic radiation proctitis (CRP). METHOD(S): Patients with severe hemorrhagic CRP who were admitted from 2008 to 2014 were enrolled into this study. All CRP patients were diagnosed by a combination of pelvic radiation history, clinical rectal bleeding, and endoscopic findings. Inclusion criteria were CRP patients with refractory bleeding with moderate to severe anemia with a hemoglobin level < 90 g/L. The study group included patients who were treated by diverting colostomy, while the control group included patients who received conservative treatment. The remission of bleeding was defined as complete cessation or only occasional bleeding that needed no further treatment. The primary outcome was bleeding remission at 6 mo after treatment. Quality of life before treatment and at follow-up was evaluated according to EORTC QLQ C30. Severe CRP complications were recorded during follow-up. RESULT(S): Forty-seven consecutive patients were enrolled, including 22 in the colostomy group and 27 in the conservative treatment group. When compared to conservative treatment, colostomy obtained a higher rate of bleeding remission (94% vs 12%), especially in control of transfusion-dependent bleeding (100% vs 0%), and offered a better control of refractory perianal pain (100% vs 0%), and a lower score of bleeding (P < 0.001) at 6 mo after treatment. At 1 year after treatment, colostomy achieved better remission of both moderate bleeding (100% vs 21.5%, P = 0.002) and severe bleeding (100% vs 0%, P < 0.001), obtained a lower score of bleeding (0.8 vs 2.0, P < 0.001), and achieved obvious elevated hemoglobin levels (P = 0.003), when compared to the conservative treatment group. The quality of life dramatically improved after colostomy, which included global health, function, and symptoms, but it was not improved in the control group. Pathological evaluation after colostomy found diffused chronic inflammation cells, and massive fibrosis collagen depositions under the rectal wall, which revealed potential fibrosis formation. CONCLUSION(S): Diverting colostomy is a simple, effective and safe procedure for severe hemorrhagic CRP. Colostomy can improve quality of life and reduce serious complications secondary to radiotherapy.Copyright © The Author(s) 2016.",Excluded
1555,"Clinical experience in 89 consecutive cases of chronic radiation enterocolitis BACKGROUND: Pelvic irradiation has been a popular therapy modality for cervical cancer for many years, and its usage in rectal cancer and prostate cancer cases is on the rise. However, it is associated with significant side effects. In this study, we compared the different characteristics of surgical and nonsurgical patients who were treated for radiation enterocolitis, the treatment results, posttreatment quality of life (QOL), nutrition status, and predisposing factors for surgery., METHODS: From 1985 to 2009, the records of a total of 89 patients with chronic radiation enterocolitis in our hospital were retrospectively reviewed for demographic data, operative data and long-term treatment results. Posttreatment QOL and nutrition status were also recorded. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the independent predicting factors associated with surgical intervention. Characteristics of surgical and nonsurgical patients were compared., RESULTS: Radiotherapy before 1995, concomitant radiation uropathy and smoking were independent predictive factors for surgery. Surgical and nonsurgical cases had similar Kaplan-Meier curves. Although the recurrence rate of radiation enterocolitis was much higher for the surgical group (p = 0.031), both groups had similar QOL score (median: 8 vs.7; p = 0.709), serum albumin level (3.29 g/dL vs. 3.16 g/dL; p = 0.095), and body mass index (20.19 vs. 19.86; p = 0.603)., CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that as compared with recently developed innovative techniques, early primitive radiotherapy techniques were associated with more severe radiotherapy complications that required surgery. Smoking may enhance patients' vulnerability to severe radiation injury.

1405,"Incidence of breast cancer in the life span study of atomic bomb survivors: 1958-2009 The importance of reproductive history in breast tissue development and etiology of sporadic breast cancer in females is well established. However, there is limited evidence of factors, other than age, that modify risk of radiation-related breast cancer. In this study, we evaluated breast cancer incidence in the Life Span Study cohort of atomic bomb survivors, adding 11 years of follow-up and incorporating reproductive history data. We used Poisson regression models to describe radiation risks and modifying effects of age and reproductive factors. Among 62,534 females, we identified 1,470 breast cancers between 1958 and 2009. Of 397 new cases diagnosed since 1998, 75% were exposed before age 20. We found a strong linear dose response with excess relative risk (ERR) of 1.12 per Gy 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.73 to 1.59 for females at age 70 after exposure at age 30. The ERR decreased with increasing attained age (P = 0.007) while excess absolute rate (EAR) increased with attained age up to age 70 (P < 0.001). Age at menarche was a strong modifier of the radiation effect: for a given dose, both the ERR and EAR decreased with increasing age at menarche (P = 0.007 and P < 0.001). Also, independently, age-At-exposure effects on ERR and EAR differed before and after menarche (P = 0.043 and P = 0.015, respectively, relative to log-linear trends), with highest risks for exposures around menarche. Despite the small number of male breast cancers (n = 10), the data continue to suggest a dose response (ERR per Gy = 5.7; 95% CI: 0.3 to 30.8; P = 0.018). Persistently increased risk of female breast cancer after radiation exposure and its modification pattern suggests heightened breast sensitivity during puberty.Copyright © 2018 by Radiation Research Society.",Excluded
1775,"Stereotactic radiation therapy in oligometastatic colorectal cancer: outcome of 102 patients and 150 lesions To evaluate the local control (LC), progression free survival (PFS), out-field PFS, overall survival (OS), toxicity and failure predictors of SRT in a series of various sites oligometastatic CRC patients. Patients with oligometastatic CRC disease were analyzed retrospectively. The SRT prescribed dose was dependent on the lesion volume and its location. 102 consecutive oligometastatic CRC patients (150 lesions) were included. They underwent SRT between 2012 and 2015. Median prescription dose was 45 Gy (median dose/fraction was 15 Gy/3 fractions biological equivalent dose (BED10) 112.5 Gy). Median follow-up was 11.4 months. No patients experienced G3 and G4 toxicity. No progression was found in 82% (radiological response at 3 months) and 85% (best radiological response) out of 150 evaluable lesions. At 1 and 2 years: LC was 70% and 55%; OS was 90% and 90%; PFS was 37% and 27%; out-field PFS was 37% and 23% respectively. Progressive disease was correlated with BED10 (better LC when BED10 was >= 75 Gy (p < 0.0001)). In multivariate analysis, LC was higher in lesions with a Plpnning target volume (PTV) volume < 42 cm3 and BED10 >= 75 Gy. Patients with Karnofsky performance status < 90 showed higher out-field progression. SRT is an effective treatment for patients with oligometastases from CRC. Its low treatment-associated morbidity and acceptable LC make of SRT an option not only in selected cases. Further studies should be focused to clarify which patient subgroup will benefit most from this treatment modality and to define the optimal dose to improve LC while maintaining low toxicity profile.Copyright © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",Excluded
1689,"Generation of a Transcriptional Radiation Exposure Signature in Human Blood Using Long-Read Nanopore Sequencing In the event of a large-scale event leading to acute ionizing radiation exposure, high-throughput methods would be required to assess individual dose estimates for triage purposes. Blood-based gene expression is a broad source of biomarkers of radiation exposure which have great potential for providing rapid dose estimates for a large population. Time is a crucial component in radiological emergencies and the shipment of blood samples to relevant laboratories presents a concern. In this study, we performed nanopore sequencing analysis to determine if the technology can be used to detect radiation-inducible genes in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The technology offers not only long-read sequencing but also a portable device which can overcome issues involving sample shipment, and provide faster results. For this goal, blood from nine healthy volunteers was 2 Gy ex vivo X irradiated. After PBMC isolation, irradiated samples were incubated along with the controls for 24 h at 37degreeC. RNA was extracted, poly(A)+ enriched and reverse-transcribed before sequencing. The data generated was analyzed using a Snakemake pipeline modified to handle paired samples. The sequencing analysis identified a radiation signature consisting of 46 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) which included 41 protein-coding genes, a long non-coding RNA and four pseudogenes, five of which have been identified as radiation-responsive transcripts for the first time. The genes in which transcriptional expression is most significantly modified after radiation exposure were APOBEC3H and FDXR, presenting a 25-and 28-fold change on average, respectively. These levels of transcriptional response were comparable to results we obtained by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis. In vivo exposure analyses showed a transcriptional radioresponse at 24 h postirradiation for both genes together with a strong dose-dependent response in blood irradiated ex vivo. Finally, extrapolating from the data we obtained, the minimum sequencing time required to detect an irradiated sample using APOBEC3H transcripts would be less than 3 min for a total of 50,000 reads. Future improvements, in sample processing and bioinformatic pipeline for specific radiation-responsive transcript identification, will allow the provision of a portable, rapid, real-time biodosimetry platform based on this new sequencing technology. In summary, our data show that nanopore sequencing can identify radiation-responsive genes and can also be used for identification of new transcripts.Copyright © 2020 by Radiation Research Society.

2002,"Somatic (craniocervical) tinnitus and the dorsal cochlear nucleus hypothesis Purpose: Of all nonauditory sensory systems, only the somatosensory system seems to be related to tinnitus (eg, temporomandibular joint syndrome and whiplash). The purpose of this study is to describe the distinguishing characteristics of tinnitus associated with somatic events and to use these characteristics to develop a neurological model of somatic tinnitus. Material(s) and Method(s): Case series. Result(s): Some patients with tinnitus, but no other hearing complaints, share several clinical features including (1) an associated somatic disorder of the head or upper neck, (2) localization of the tinnitus to the ear ipsilateral to the somatic disorder, (3) no vestibular complaints, and (4) no abnormalities on neurological examination. Pure tone and speech audiometry of the 2 ears is always symmetric and usually within normal limits. Based on these clinical features, it is proposed that somatic (craniocervical) tinnitus, like otic tinnitus, is caused by disinhibition of the ipsilateral dorsal cochlear nucleus. Nerve fibers whose cell bodies lie in the ipsilateral medullary somatosensory nuclei mediate this effect. These neurons receive inputs from nearby spinal trigeminal tract, fasciculus cuneatus, and facial, vagal, and glossopharyngeal nerve fibers innervating the middle and external ear. Conclusion(s): Somatic (craniocervical) modulation of the dorsal cochlear nucleus may account for many previously poorly understood aspects of tinnitus and suggests novel tinnitus treatments.",Excluded
1368,"Positive impact of low-dose, high-energy radiation on bone in partial- and/or full-weightbearing mice Astronauts traveling beyond low Earth orbit will be exposed to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR); understanding how high energy ionizing radiation modifies the bone response to mechanical unloading is important to assuring crew health. To investigate this, we exposed 4-mo-old female Balb/cBYJ mice to an acute space-relevant dose of 0.5 Gy 56Fe or sham (n = ~8/group); 4 days later, half of the mice were also subjected to a ground-based analog for 1/6 g (partial weightbearing) (G/6) for 21 days. Microcomputed tomography (-CT) of the distal femur reveals that 56Fe exposure resulted in 6578% greater volume and improved microarchitecture of cancellous bone after 21 d compared to sham controls. Radiation also leads to significant increases in three measures of energy absorption at the mid-shaft femur and an increase in stiffness of the L4 vertebra. No significant effects of radiation on bone formation indices are detected; however, G/6 leads to reduced % mineralizing surface on the inner mid-tibial bone surface. In separate groups allowed 21 days of weightbearing recovery from G/6 and/or 56Fe exposure, radiation-exposed mice still exhibit greater bone mass and improved microarchitecture vs. sham control. However, femoral bone energy absorption values are no longer higher in the 56Fe-exposed WB mice vs. sham controls. We provide evidence for persistent positive impacts of high-LET radiation exposure preceding a period of full or partial weightbearing on bone mass and microarchitecture in the distal femur and, for full weightbearing mice only and more transiently, cortical bone energy absorption values. 2019, The Author(s).",Excluded
2477,"[Comparison of radiation dose reduction of prospective ECG-gated one beat scan using 320 area detector CT coronary angiography and prospective ECG-gated helical scan with high helical pitch (FlashScan) using 64 multidetector-row CT coronary angiography] A high radiation dose associated with 64 multidetector-row computed tomography (64-MDCT) is a major concern for physicians and patients alike. A new 320 row area detector computed tomography (ADCT) can obtain a view of the entire heart with one rotation (0.35 s) without requiring the helical method. As such, ADCT is expected to reduce the radiation dose. We studied image quality and radiation dose of ADCT compared to that of 64-MDCT in patients with a low heart rate (HR<=60). Three hundred eighty-five consecutive patients underwent 64-MDCT and 379 patients, ADCT. Patients with an arrhythmia were excluded. Prospective ECG-gated helical scan with high HP (FlashScan) in 64 was used for MDCT and prospective ECG-gated conventional one beat scan, for 320-ADCT. Image quality was visually evaluated by an image quality score. Radiation dose was estimated by DLP (mGycm) for 64-MDCT and DLP.e (mGycm) for 320-ADCT. Radiation dose of 320-ADCT (208+/-48 mGycm) was significantly (P<0.0001) lower than that of 64-MDCT (484+/-112 mGycm), and image quality score of 320-ADCT (3.0+/-0.2) was significantly (P=0.0011) higher than that of 64-MDCT (2.9+/-0.4). Scan time of 320-ADCT (1.4+/-0.1 s) was also significantly (P<0.0001) shorter than that of 64-MDCT (6.8+/-0.6 s). 320-ADCT can achieve not only a reduction in radiation dose but also a superior image quality and shortening of scan time compared to 64-MDCT.",Excluded
1266,"Outcome in a prospective phase II trial of medically inoperable stage I non-small-cell lung cancer patients treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy Purpose: The impact of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) on 3-year progression-free survival of medically inoperable patients with stage I non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was analyzed in a prospective phase II study. Patients and Methods: Fifty-seven patients with T1NOMO (70%) and T2N0M0 (30%) were included between August 2003 and September 2005 at seven different centers in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark and observed up to 36 months. SBRT was delivered with 15 Gy times three at the 67% isodose of the planning target volume. Result(s): Progression-free survival at 3 years was 52%. Overall- and cancer-specific survival at 1, 2, and 3 years was 86%, 65%, 60%, and 93%, 88%, 88%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in survival between patients with T1 or T2 tumors. At a median follow-up of 35 months (range, 4 to 47 months), 27 patients (47%) were deceased, seven as a result of lung cancer and 20 as a result of concurrent disease. Kaplan-Meier estimated local control at 3 years was 92%. Local relapse was observed in four patients (7%). Regional relapse was observed in three patients (5%). Nine patients (16%) developed distant metastases. The estimated risk of all failure (local, regional, or distant metastases) was increased in patients with T2 (41%) compared with those with T1 (18%) tumors (P = .027). Conclusion(s): With a 3-year local tumor control rate higher than 90% with limited toxicity, SBRT emerges as state-of-the-art treatment for medically inoperable stage I NSCLC and may even challenge surgery in operable instances. © 2009 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",Excluded
1740,"Sunscreen protection against cis-urocanic acid production in human skin Commercial sunscreens may offer some protection from immunosuppression induced by ultraviolet (UV) radiation, but agreement concerning the degree of protection is lacking. Cis-urocanic acid, formed by the photoisomerization of transurocanic acid is considered an important mediator of the cutaneous immunomodulation resulting from exposure to UV radiation. We investigated the effect of sunscreens on the isomerization of urocanic acid in 17 human subjects. Two sunscreens containing chemical filters, sun protection factor (SPF) 4 and SPF 10, and a SPF 10 sunscreen with a physical filter were applied at a thickness of 2 mg/cm2. The effect of a thin layer (0.5 mg/cm2) of the chemical SPF 10 sunscreen was also evaluated, as the amount of sunscreen applied in practice may be considerably less than recommended. All areas were irradiated with a single UV dose of 3.6 SED (standard erythema doses). In irradiated unprotected skin the median net production of cis-urocanic acid was 52% (relative amount). In the sites treated with the chemical sunscreens, the production of cis-urocanic acid was 7.4% (SPF 4) and 3.5% (SPF 10), and isomerization was thus reduced more efficiently at a higher SPF (p<0.01). The physical sunscreen reduced the formation of cis-UCA to 15%, and was significantly less effective than both the chemical SPF 10 sunscreen (p<0.01) and the SPF 4 sunscreen (p<0.01). The production of cis-urocanic acid in the area treated with the thin layer of the chemical SPF 10 sunscreen was 22%. The protection against the production of cis-urocanic acid was therefore reduced significantly (p<0.01) when the sunscreen was applied in an amount lower than recommended.",Excluded

Diagnostics, prophylaxis and correction of this condition demand new accurate and objective approaches. Here we report on an in vivo longitudinal monitoring of the oral mucosa dynamics in 25 patients during the course of radiotherapy of oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal cancer using multifunctional optical coherence tomography (OCT). A spectral domain OCT system with a specially-designed oral imaging probe was used. Microvasculature visualization was based on temporal speckle variations of the full complex signal evaluated by high-pass filtering of 3D data along the slow scan axis. Angiographic image quantification demonstrated an increase of the vascular density and total length of capillary-like-vessels before visual signs or clinical symptoms of mucositis occur. Especially significant microvascular changes compared to their initial levels occurred when grade two and three mucositis developed. Further, microvascular reaction was seen to be dose-level dependent. OCT monitoring in radiotherapy offers a non-invasive, convenient, label-free quantifiable structural and functional volumetric imaging method suitable for longitudinal human patient studies, furnishing fundamental radiobiological insights and potentially providing useful feedback data to enable adaptive radiotherapy (ART).",Excluded
1786,"Eosinophilic interleukin 5 (IL-5) transgenic mice: eosinophil activity and impaired clearance of Schistosoma mansoni Eosinophilia is a feature common to many invasive helminth infections and eosinophils are often considered to be effector cells in immunity to helminths. This study examined the possible influence of constitutive eosinophilia on the clearance of Schistosoma mansoni infections in mice. Eosinophils from interleukin-5 transgenic mice exhibit normal ultrastructure and function with regard to phagocytosis and killing of bacteria and responses to chemotactic stimuli. IL-5 transgenics and non-transgenic littermates were immunized once or four (hyperimmunization) times with irradiated cercariae of S. mansoni. Animals were challenged percutaneously with unirradiated cercariae one month after their last exposure to irradiated parasites. One month after challenge transgenic animals, whether unimmunized, vaccinated or hypervaccinated, carried significantly more liver-stage parasites than non-transgenic animals. These results suggest that although eosinophils from IL-5 transgenic mice are functional for a number of key parameters, large numbers of eosinophils and/or high levels of IL-5 may in some way impair clearance of S. mansoni. A re-evaluation of the roles of eosinophils and IL-5 in infections with this and other parasites may therefore be warranted.",Excluded

Symptoms after drug discontinuation were monitored. Ambulatory 24 h esophageal pH monitoring was performed on patients, whose symptom recurred within 8 weeks after treatment. BMI, Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) were detected., RESULTS: Among the 28 patients with GERD, 15 (53.6%) recurred symptoms after withdraw of PPIs. Compared with the asymptomatic group after withdraw of PPIs, the pretreatment duration of pH 4 (supine), 24 h total acid reflux time, number of time periods with acid reflux > 5 minutes, the maximal acid reflux time and 24 h total number of acid reflux in the symptomatic recurrence group were statistically significantly increased (11.7% vs 4.5%, 138.8 minutes vs 62.1 minutes, 6.0 vs 2.0, 27.0 minutes vs 12.4 minutes, 74.0 times vs 43.0 times, respectively, all P values < 0.05). There were no significant differences in BMI, SAS and SDS between the two groups., CONCLUSIONS: The basic level of esophageal acid exposure of patients with GERD before PPIs therapy may influence the esophageal acid exposure after PPIs therapy and then may affect the recurrence of symptoms. Although anxiety and depression is common in patients with GERD, it is not found that the recurrence of acid-related symptoms after the discontinuation of PPIs therapy is related to the anxiety and depression.",Excluded
1507,"DNA Damage Baseline Predicts Resilience to Space Radiation and Radiotherapy Deep space exploration will require real-time, minimally invasive monitoring of astronaut health to mitigate the potential health impairments caused by space radiation and microgravity. Genotoxic stress in humans can be monitored by quantifying the amount of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in immune cells from a simple finger prick. In a cohort of 674 healthy donors, we show that the endogenous level of DSBs increases with age and with latent cytomegalovirus infection. To map the range of human responses to space radiation, we then study DSB induction and repair in immune cells from 319 healthy donors after the cells are exposed to galactic cosmic ray components and lymphocytes from 30 cancer patients after radiotherapy. Individuals with low baseline DSB have fewer clinical complications, enhanced DNA damage repair responses, and a functional dose-dependent cytokine response in healthy donor cells. This supports the use of DSB monitoring for health resilience in space., Pariset et al. find that individuals with a lower baseline level of DNA damage are resilient to clinical complications after radiotherapy and present higher radiation-induced levels of DNA repair foci and inflammatory cytokines. These findings support the use of baseline DNA damage as a biomarker for radiation sensitivity.Copyright © 2020",Included
1493,"Level of supervision and radiation exposure of senior orthopedic residents during surgical treatment of proximal femur fracture The sustained use of intraoperative fluoroscopy has led to increased use of minimally invasive surgical techniques, enhanced surgeon proficiency, improved anatomic corrections, reduced patient morbidity, earlier functional recovery, and decreased length of hospital stay. As a result, orthopedic attending surgeons and residents are exposed to more radiation, increasing the risk of cancer and radiation-induced cataracts compared with the general population and those who work in other surgical specialties. The magnitude of radiation exposure depends on the susceptibility of the tissues affected, medical specialty, the position of the C-arm, distance from the radiation beam, level of difficulty of the surgical procedure, surgeon experience, level of resident training, and level of supervision by the attending surgeon. However, little information is available on the effect of supervision level on radiation exposure for orthopedic senior residents. The goal of this study was to investigate whether level of supervision by the attending surgeon affects the radiation exposure of orthopedic senior residents during surgical treatment of proximal femur fracture with cephalomedullary nail fixation. This retrospective cohort study was performed from January 2019 to March 2019. No significant relationship between supervision level and radiation exposure of senior residents was observed. Supervision level does not significantly affect radiation exposure for senior residents; therefore, the implementation of standardized training in radiation safety may be a more essential measure to decrease radiation exposure.Copyright © 2021 Slack Incorporated.

We also provided a policy basis for the prevention and control of hospital infection in the Department of Critical Care Medicine of Guizhou Province. Method(s): The data of ventilator-associated pneumonia, vascular catheter-related bloodstream infections, and urinary tract intubation-related urinary tract infections in nine tertiary A comprehensive treatment hospitals in Guizhou province from January 2014 to December 2019 were collected. The ARIMA time series model was used to evaluate the model fitting and prediction effects. Result(s): After comparison, in the Department of Critical Care Medicine of Guizhou Province, the unsurpassed model of ventilator-associated pneumonia was the ARIMA (0,1,1) model, with a residual Ljuing-Box Q test result of Q=10.832 (P=0.865), suggesting it is a white noise sequence and its simulation and prediction effects are beneficial. The best model of vascular catheter-related bloodstream infection was the ARIMA (0,0,1) model, with a residual Ljuing-Box Q test result of Q=14.914 (P=0.602). These results suggest that it is a white noise sequence, and its simulation and prediction effects are sufficient. The optimal model of urinary tract intubation-related urinary tract infection is ARIMA (1,0,0), and the residual Ljuing-Box Q test result is Q=15.042 (P=0.592), suggesting it is a white noise sequence with an accurate simulation and prediction effect.

Automated exposure control was active in all groups. Image quality was subjectively evaluated on a 5-point-likert-scale by two radiologists and interobserver agreement as well as signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) was calculated. Dose-length-product (DLP) and volume CT dose index (CTDIvol) were compared., RESULTS: Image quality was rated in favour for the tin filter protocol with excellent interobserver agreement (ICC=0.86-0.91) and the difference reached statistical significance (p<0.001). SNR was significantly higher in group 1 and 2 compared to second-generation DSCT (p<0.001). On third-generation dual-source CT, there was no significant difference in SNR between the 150kV Sn and the automated kV selection protocol (p=0.5). The DLP of group 1 was 23% and 21% (p<0.002) lower in comparison to group 2 and 3, respectively.

We have compared the clinical efficacy and tolerability of 5-MOP (1.2 mg/kg)-UVA versus 8-MOP (0.6 mg/kg)-UVA therapy in 25 patients of skin type III and IV, affected by relapsing plaque-type psoriasis of similar body involvement; indeed, the same patients were given 8-MOP during 1 year and 5-MOP during the subsequent year after relapsing. Both treatments cleared psoriatic lesions with a comparable number of exposures, but 5-MOP required significantly higher cumulative UVA doses. The difference was due to the lower phototoxicity of 5-MOP, as assessed by the determination of the minimal phototoxic dose, and to its higher tanning activity, as assessed by the weekly grading of pigmentation. Nevertheless, therapy by 5-MOP-UVA seemed particularly interesting in that it showed a higher tolerability since only 1 patient experienced nausea, whereas during therapy with 8-MOP-UVA nausea and/or vomiting occurred in 7 patients, sunburn in 6 and itching in 3. Since we have treated the same patients with the two drugs, our results were not influenced by interindividual variations of phototoxic responses, tanning ability and susceptibility to develop psoralen-induced short-term side-effects.

2393,"Is it possible to avoid hypopituitarism after the irradiation of pituitary adenomas by the Leksell gamma-knife? Radiation therapy is used in the treatment of pituitary adenomas, especially in failures of neurosurgery and pharmacotherapy to reduce the size of adenomas and normalize their hypersecretion. Conventional fractionated radiotherapy has achieved good results, but only after a long latency, with considerable postradiation morbidity and with very frequent appearance of hypopituitarism. The focal stereotactic targeting allowed by Leksell gamma-knife (LGK) was supposed to decrease the incidence of hypopituitarism, however our first patients treated by LGK developed hypopituitarism in 38.2%. Consequently, we have analyzed factors leading to this unfavorable outcome and suggested that the mean dose of irradiation on pituitary tissue is the most important cause of hypopituitarism. Result(s): Seventy-five patients (47 women and 28 men) with pituitary adenomas (39 with acromegaly, 17 prolactinomas, 8 with Cushing's disease, 1 with Nelson's syndrome and 9 functionless adenomas), where the mean dose of irradiation on pituitary tissue was measured, were followed 60-180 (mean 91.1) months. In 41 patients, the mean dose of irradiation on pituitary was more than 15 Gy. The hypopituitarism at least in one axis developed in 29 (70.7%) patients during 10-126 months after the irradiation. In 34 patients, the mean dose on pituitary was less than 15 Gy. Only one patient (1.2%) developed hypopituitarism 12 months after the irradiation. This patient had undergone two previous pituitary surgeries and had already central hypothyreosis when irradiated. Conclusion(s): To avoid hypopituitarism the radiation dose of 15 Gy is the maximum safe limit of the mean dose of radiation to the pituitary tissue surrounding the adenoma. This cut off should become a rule when irradiating pituitary adenomas - just like the dose rules of 7 Gy on the optical tract or 14 Gy on the brainstem.",Excluded
2030,"Application of CareDose 4D combined with Karl 3D technology in the low dose computed tomography for the follow-up of COVID-19 BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease caused by the new coronavirus. Previous studies have shown that the chest CT examination plays an important role in the diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19. However, some patients with COVID-19 had low white blood cell counts and reduced lymphocyte ratios. Multiple CT examinations may cause radiation damages as well as increase the apoptosis of peripheral blood lymphocytes. A new low-dose CT method should be developed because the regular CT may aggravate the disease. METHOD(S): Sixty cases were randomly divided into the study group (n=30) and control group (n=30). The lung window was reconstructed by Karl 3D iterative technique in the study group. The image quality was subjectively evaluated by two senior chest group diagnostic physicians using a 5-point double-blind method. The value of CT measurement and its standard deviation (SD) was used as an objective evaluation criteria. The volume of CT dose index (CTDIvol), dose length product (DLP) and effective dose (ED) from the two groups were compared and analyzed statistically. RESULT(S): There was no significant difference in the occurrence rates of ground glass opacities, consolidation, crazy-paving pattern, fiber cable shadow and axial interstitial thickening between the study group and control group (p >0.05). In addition, no significant difference was found for the subjective score of overall image quality and image noise level (SD) between the two groups (p > 0.05). However, significant differences was found in CTDIvol, DLP, and ED between the study group and the control group (p<0.05). The effective dose of the study group was reduced by 76% compared to the control group. CONCLUSION(S): CareDose 4D low-dose scanning combined with Karl 3D iterative reconstruction technology can not only greatly reduce the radiation dose, but also provide images that meet the diagnostic criteria of COVID-19, which can be used as a routine method for the follow-up of COVID-19 patients.",Excluded
2475,"[Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography for Patients with Atrial Fibrillation: Feasibility of Prospective Electrocardiography-gated Diastolic Acquisition with a Manual Exposure-termination Technique] Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) was performed in 283 patients with atrial fibrillation (Af) using a prospective electocardiogeaphic gated scanning with a manual exposure-termination technique. When preparatory 5-beat scanning contained at least one RR interval longer than 800 ms, 5-beat diastolic scanning (R+800 ms protocol) was selected. When no RR interval longer than 800 ms was observed, 2-beat scanning starting at end-systolic phase (R+210 ms to R protocol) was chosen. In R+800 ms protocol, we manually terminated scanning when motion free real-time reconstruction image was confirmed. R+800 ms protocol was applied in 95% of the cases and required an average of 2 cardiac cycles, providing motion-free images in 91% of the patients. The mean exposure dose was less than that with R+210 ms to R protocol. Using the protocols above, 90% of the all patients with Af provided motion free images and 99% of them were evaluable.",Excluded
1728,"Comparison of two barium suspensions for dedicated small-bowel series OBJECTIVE. The in vivo radiographic features of two commercially available formulations of barium used as contrast media in dedicated small- bowel series were compared. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Fifty-six consecutive outpatients referred for a dedicated small-bowel series were randomly administered either E-Z-Paque or Entrobar. Representative survey radiographs from each examination were randomized and reviewed by six gastrointestinal radiologists from three institutions. Each observer assigned a numeric score (1 = poor, 2 = fair, 3 = good, and 4 = excellent) that rated the quality of the radiograph with respect to these characteristics: definition of fold pattern, translucency, distention, and integrity of the barium column. Statistical analysis was performed for each characteristic using Wilcoxon's two-sample rank sum test. RESULTS. All six observers found a statistically significant difference between the two barium formulations for mean scores for definition of fold pattern and translucency. Mean scores for fold pattern were 3.3, 3.0, 3.2, 3.6, 3.3, and 3.4 for Entrobar and 2.1, 2.3, 2.4, 3.2, 2.6, and 2.7 for E-Z-Paque. Mean scores for translucency were 2.5, 2.7, 2.8, 3.1, 2.7, and 3.3 for Entrobar and 1.6, 1.7, 2.1, 2.3, 1.9, and 2.7 for E-Z- Paque. No statistically significant difference was found for mean score for distention or integrity of the barium column. CONCLUSION. On radiographs, Entrobar was found to have superior characteristics for visualization of fold pattern and translucency but offered no advantages for distention or integrity of the barium column. Improved translucency and definition of fold pattern may translate into improved sensitivity and confidence in diagnosing small-bowel abnormality.",Excluded
1352,"Timed barium swallow and its usefullness in achalasia and non-achalasia dysphagia Introduction: Timed barium swallow (TBS) was initially described by researchers at the Cleveland Clinic (AJR 1997). This test was designed to assess esophageal emptying in patients (pts) with achalasia before and after therapy, i.e. pneumatic dilation/ surgical myotomy. Over time it became part of standard workup at our Swallowing Center in all dysphagia cases. It is simple to perform, radiation exposure is minimal and it gives details on both esophageal anatomy and emptying of liquids and tablet. Our aim was to determine the usefulness of TBS in pts with non-achalasia dysphagia in comparison to achalasia pts. Method(s): Retrospective review of medical records of 150 consecutive pts who underwent TBS evaluation between 04/2014 and 09/2015 at our Institution. Pts were separated into achalasia and non-achalasia groups. Diagnosis of achalasia established by high resolution manometry. Standard protocol was used for all TBS. After drinking 6-8 oz of low density barium in the standing position, lateral film obtained followed by two-on-one spot films at 1 and 5 min. to assess liquid emptying. The esophagus was rinsed with water followed by ingestion of a 13 mm tablet. Tablet passage evaluated after 5 minutes with an abnormal test being tablet retention. TBS for liquid barium considered normal if < 1 cm of barium retention after 1 min in distal esophagus. One radiologist (JF) interpreted all TBS. Result(s): 72 pts (49% females) with achalasia/ mean age 57 years (type 1: 12 pts (17%), type 2: 35 pts (49%), type 3: 7 pts (10%), achalasia type not specified 18 pts (24%)) and 78 pts (62% females) without achalasia/ mean age of 62.25 years. Table 1 defines final diagnoses in non-achalasia pts. Achalasia pts more frequently had abnormal TBS than non-achalasia pts (96% vs. 65%, p < 0.0001). Table 2: characteristics of TBS in both groups. Non-esophageal findings identified on TBS in 10% of achalasia and in 20% of non-achalasia pts including musculoskeletal lesions (20 pts), lung nodule (5 pts), hilar prominence or calcifications (4 pts) and cardiomegaly or aortic calcifications (4 pts). Lung cancer found in 1 non-achalasia patient. Conclusion(s): 1. TBS is a simple and useful test in separation of achalasia and non-achalasia dysphagia. 2. Pts with achalasia are more likely to have abnormal TBS for barium liquid and tablet than non -achalasia dysphagia pts. 3. Pts with non-achalasia dysphagia are more likely to have abnormal TBS either for liquid barium or tablet only than achalasia pts.",Excluded
2176,"Nomogram model to predict postoperative relapse after mandibular osteoradionecrosis surgery Purpose: Osteoradionecrosis of the mandible (ORNM) is one of the most devastating complications following radiotherapy. Postoperative relapse (POR) occurs with high incidence even if a radical resection is performed. The current investigation was designed to identify prognostic factors for POR and to establish a nomogram model to estimate the risk for the onset of POR of ORNM. Material(s) and Method(s): A retrospective study was conducted in ORNM patients during the period from 2003 to 2016. Predictive factors for POR were preliminarily filtered by Kaplan-Meier analysis and were further confirmed by Cox regression model. A nomogram model was established to predict the risk for the onset of POR, and the performance was estimated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and calibration curve. POR was defined as the primary outcome variable and was measured using univariate and multivariate analyses. Result(s): A total of 213 patients were analyzed, and the total incidence of POR was 24.4% (52/213). In the Cox regression analysis, radiation doses >=80 Gy (versus80 Gy, OR = 3.528, P0.001, 95% CI: 1.759-7.076), location of ORNM (lesion only in mandibular body versus that involving mandibular body, angulus and ramus versus, OR = 2.900, P = 0.007, 95% CI: 1.345-6.253), S classification (S2 versus S0, OR = 8.926, P = 0.001, 95% CI: 2.487-32.036), and surgical treatment (sequestretomy versus ER + reconstruction, OR = 3.299, P = 0.012, 95% CI: 1.294-8.411) were significantly associated with POR. The current nomogram model can effectively evaluate the hazard risk and survival rate of POR. The discrimination capability was tested by the ROC curve with an area under the curve of 0.813, revealing highly predictive abilities. The calibration curve showed sufficient fitness. Conclusion(s): The current nomogram model was effective in predicting the risk of POR in ORNM patients.Copyright © 2018",Excluded
1982,"Perfusion MRI detects rCBF abnormalities in early stages of HIV- cognitive motor complex Objective: To evaluate patients with early HIV-cognitive motor complex (HIV-CMC) for possible regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) abnormalities on perfusion MRI (pMRI). Background(s): Nuclear medicine techniques have demonstrated global and focal cerebral perfusion abnormalities in patients with HIV dementia. Ultrafast pMRI enables the measurement of rCBF throughout the brain without the need to apply radioactive tracers or ionizing radiation. Method(s): pMRI was used to measure the rCBF in 19 patients with early stages of HIV-CMC and 15 healthy seronegative control subjects. The rCBF maps were registered to high-resolution anatomic MRI scans and transformed into Talairach space. Statistical analysis of the rCBF maps was performed with SPM96. Result(s): Compared with the control subjects, the patients with HIV had statistically significantly decreased rCBF bilaterally in the inferior lateral frontal cortices (right: -15%, p < 0.002; left: -12%, p < 0.005) and in the inferior medial parietal brain region (-15%, p < 0.0009). In contrast, rCBF was increased bilaterally in the posterior inferior parietal white matter (right: +19%, p < 0.0001; left: +17%, p < 0.001). Furthermore, rCBF abnormalities correlated significantly with clinical disease severity as measured by CD4 count, plasma viral load, Karnofsky score, and HIV dementia scale. Discussion(s): Our results are consistent with previous findings from PET and SPECT studies. Furthermore, pMRI can detect rCBF abnormalities that correlate with disease severity in HIV-CMC. Because pMRI is more cost-effective, faster, and safer than nuclear medicine techniques for monitoring rCBF changes, pMRI may be more feasible for monitoring the effects of therapy for HIV-CMC.",Excluded
2480,"Reducing intraoperative duration and ionising radiation exposure during the insertion of distal locking screws of intramedullary nails: a small-scale study comparing the current fluoroscopic method against radiation-free, electromagnetic navigation BACKGROUND: Intramedullary nailing is the standard surgical treatment for mid-diaphyseal fractures of long bones; however, it is also a high radiation dose procedure. Distal locking is regularly cited as a demanding element of the procedure, and there remains a reliance on X-ray fluoroscopy to locate the distal holes. A recently developed electromagnetic navigation (EMN) system allows radiation-free distal locking, with a virtual on-screen image., OBJECTIVE: To compare operative duration, fluoroscopy time and radiation dose when using EMN over fluoroscopy, for the distal locking of intramedullary nails., METHOD: Consecutive patients with mid-diaphyseal fractures of the tibia and femur, treatable with intramedullary nails, were prospectively enrolled during a 9-month period. The sample consisted of 29 individuals, 19 under fluoroscopic guidance and 10 utilising EMN. Participants were allocated depending on the type of intramedullary nail used and surgeon's preference. These were further divided into tibial and femoral subcategories, relative to the fracture site., RESULTS: EMN reduced fluoroscopy time by 49 (p = 0.038) and 28 s during tibial and femoral nailings, respectively. Radiation dose was reduced by 18 cGy/cm2 (p = 0.046) during tibial and 181 cGy/cm2 during femoral nailings when utilising EMN. Operative duration was 11 min slower during tibial nailings using EMN, but 38 min faster in respect of femoral nailings., CONCLUSIONS: This study has evidenced statistically significant reductions in both fluoroscopy time and radiation dose when using EMN for the distal locking of intramedullary nails. It is expected that overall operative duration would also decrease in line with similar studies, with increased usage and a larger sample.",Excluded

1955,"Fasciculation-myokymic activity and prolonged nerve conduction block. A physiopathological relationship in radiation-induced brachial plexopathy Fourteen radiation-induced brachial plexus neuropathies in 12 patients suffering from cancer were studied. Neurophysiological evaluation showed a diffuse neurogenic lesion with muscular denervation signs associated with motor and sensory nerve conduction impairment of axonal type in the distal segments of the arm. Somatosensory evoked potentials were frequently abnormal, with absence of N9 in 9 out of the 10 extremities explored. The most characteristic findings were, however, the presence of fasciculation potentials--single and grouped--and myokymic discharges in 78.5% of cases (11 out of 14 plexuses), and a motor nerve conduction block on proximal stimulation, at the supraclavicular as well as cervical spine levels, in all of the cases. Both phenomena showed a high correlation when analyzed in the same neuromuscular territory. The 5 muscles with no voluntary activity and complete--or nearly complete--motor nerve conduction block were the ones with the most intense ectopic activities. The conduction blocks were present after long periods of illness in all cases and, in 2 of the cases, they persisted in successive explorations at intervals of 9 months and 2 years respectively. These data would support a probable cause-effect relationship between a persistent and prolonged motor nerve conduction block and the presence of fasciculation-myokymic type activities. One could even postulate that the infrequent neuropathies, in which both findings have been described as relevant features, have a similar physiopathological mechanism.",Excluded
1548,"Growth hormone mitigates against lethal irradiation and enhances hematologic and immune recovery in mice and nonhuman primates Medications that can mitigate against radiation injury are limited. In this study, we investigated the ability of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) to mitigate against radiation injury in mice and nonhuman primates. BALB/c mice were irradiated with 7.5 Gy and treated post-irradiation with rhGH intravenously at a once daily dose of 20 mug/dose for 35 days. rhGH protected 17 out of 28 mice (60.7%) from lethal irradiation while only 3 out of 28 mice (10.7%) survived in the saline control group. A shorter course of 5 days of rhGH post-irradiation produced similar results. Compared with the saline control group, treatment with rhGH on irradiated BALB/c mice significantly accelerated overall hematopoietic recovery. Specifically, the recovery of total white cells, CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets, B cells, NK cells and especially platelets post radiation exposure were significantly accelerated in the rhGH-treated mice. Moreover, treatment with rhGH increased the frequency of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells as measured by flow cytometry and colony forming unit assays in bone marrow harvested at day 14 after irradiation, suggesting the effects of rhGH are at the hematopoietic stem/progenitor level. rhGH mediated the hematopoietic effects primarily through their niches. Similar data with rhGH were also observed following 2 Gy sublethal irradiation of nonhuman primates. Our data demonstrate that rhGH promotes hematopoietic engraftment and immune recovery post the exposure of ionizing radiation and mitigates against the mortality from lethal irradiation even when administered after exposure. © 2010 Chen et al.",Excluded

Radiation during the endovascular procedure would increase the risk of skin diseases. We sought to identify radiation outcomes during mechanical thrombectomy. Methodology: We prospectively collected and analyzed radiation parameters during mechanical thrombectomy in 41 patients affected with acute cerebral artery occlusion. There were 41 cases (68.73 +/- 11.05 years) in this study, with a National Institute Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 15.66 +/- 5.94. The time parameters were recorded as following: 84.45 +/- 31.66 min (operation duration), 129.71 +/- 81.14 s (angiographic run), 16.02 +/- 11.03 min (fluoroscopy) and 18.19 +/- 11.14 min (angiographic exposure). The doses produced in the procedure were: 1276.43 +/- 1647.56 mGy (shot dose), 607.26 +/- 412.34 mGy (fluoroscopy) and 1635.52 +/- 593.65 mGy (angiographic exposure). Further analysis discovered no association between NIHSS and these time and radiation parameters (P > 0.05). Conclusion(s): This study provided the description of radiation details during mechanical thrombectomy for acute cerebral artery occlusion.

We aimed to measure and compare operator exposure to radiation during implantation of PM and ICD with or without CRT. The study population comprised all PMs and ICDs implanted in a large referral centre over a six months period. The endpoint was operator radiation exposure, assessed using a personal electronic dosimeter located on operator's chest. In total, 169 PM/ICD implantations were analysed, 19 of which included CRT. Compared with 'classical' implantation, cardiologist radiation exposure was 9-fold greater during CRT procedures (p < 0.001). Physician exposure was related to dose-area product (R2 = 0.21 during 'classical' implantations and R2 = 0.57 during CRT procedures). Our study shows that cardiologists' exposure to radiation during CRT implantation was 9-fold greater than during procedures without CRT.",Excluded

Fifty-two (5%) subjects had significant (>or=50%) diameter stenosis and 21 (2%) had severe (>or=75%) stenosis. Thirteen (25%) and 30 (58%) subjects with significant stenosis were classified into National Cholesterol Education Program low-risk and mild coronary calcification (coronary artery calcium scores <100), respectively. Midterm follow-up (17 +/- 2 months) revealed 15 cardiac events only in those with CAD on CTA: 1 unstable angina requiring hospital stay and 14 revascularization procedures. Most (87%) events occurred within 90 days of index CTA., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of occult CAD in apparently healthy individuals was not negligible, although their midterm prognosis was good. CTA has a potential to provide a better insight about the occult CAD in this population.

1250,"Posterior keyhole corpectomy with percutaneous pedicle screw stabilization in the surgical management of lumbar burst fractures OBJECTIVE: The authors present a new method of minimally invasive surgical management of lumbar burst fractures through the posterior approach. The method includes minimally invasive corpectomy and interbody fusion, both of which are performed through a keyhole approach, and percutaneous pedicle screw fixation of the fracture. The technique of the posterior keyhole corpectomy presented in this report is a novel and original concept of the first author (AM). The percutaneous pedicle screw stabilization is performed with the use of a percutaneous instrumentation system (Sextant; Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, MN). The Sextant system has been dedicated and used in nontrauma degenerative cases; the novel aspect of this system is its application in spine fractures. Indications for the method include Denis classification subtype B or Magerl subtype A.3.1 burst fractures. Both subtypes represent fractures with failure and retropulsion of the upper part of the vertebral body. METHOD(S): The clinical experience of this study includes four cases of burst fractures with significant retropulsion and occlusion of the spinal canal. Long-term results were assessed at a minimum follow-up period of 1 year (maximum, 3.5 yr). The follow-up assessments included: 1) the quality of decompression and reconstruction of the spinal canal (computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging scanning); 2) the stability of the operated segment (dynamic x-rays); 3) the quality of interbody fusion (computed tomographic scanning and dynamic x-rays); and 4) correction of the fracture kyphosis and its postoperative loss (measurements of Cobb angles for the assessment of sagittal plane deformity). The minimum armamentarium requirements for this method include a typical micro lumbar discectomy retractor set; a surgical microscope; two-plane intraoperative fluoroscopy; and a system for percutaneous pedicle screw stabilization (Sextant). ""Posterior keyhole corpectomy"" indicates corpectomy of the posterior upper half of the vertebral body or removal of the retropulsed bone fragment via two keyhole skin incisions on both sides of the spinous process (each skin incision measures 2 to 3 cm long). Exposure of the retropulsed fragment (the posterior upper part of the vertebral body) is achieved by medial or complete facetectomy along with complete or medial resection of the pedicle. This has to be performed bilaterally. Percutaneous stabilization requires four additional stab skin incisions. RESULT(S): We observed no surgery-related complications (neurological, hardware, dural tears, or deep or superficial wound infections); there was perfect decompression and clearance of the spinal canal (confirmed by computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging scanning); and there was solid stability at the affected segments (confirmed by dynamic x-rays). Healed fusion was noted in all patients but one. The latter patient had no clinical symptoms of spinal instability. Kyphotic deformity was corrected and reversed into lordosis in three patients. Loss of deformity correction was noted in all patients; however, all patients retained lordotic alignment of the affected segment. CONCLUSION(S): The advantages of this method include sparing the posterior elements (lamina, spinous process, supraspinous and interspinous ligaments, and paravertebral muscles), safety of the decompression provided by the use of a surgical microscope, and perfect illumination of the operating field. The drawbacks of the method include limitation to certain types of burst fractures, the method is surgically demanding, and the method requires development of a special retractor system to eliminate the cumbersome alternate insertion and the reinsertions of the typical microdiscectomy retractor set.

2297,"Pulmonary nodules detected at lung cancer screening: Interobserver variability of semiautomated volume measurements Purpose: To retrospectively determine interobserver variability of semiautomated volume measurements of pulmonary nodules and the potential reasons for variability. Material(s) and Method(s): The Dutch-Belgian lung cancer screening trial (NELSON) is a lung cancer screening study that includes men between the ages of 50 and 75 years who are current or former heavy smokers. The NELSON project was approved by the Dutch Ministry of Health and the ethics committee of each participating hospital. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. For this study, the authors evaluated 1200 consecutive low-dose computed tomographic (CT) scans of the chest obtained during the NELSON project and identified subjects who had at least one 50-500-mm3 nodule. One local and one central observer independently evaluated the scans and measured the volume of any detected nodule by using semiautomated software. Noncalcified solid nodules with volumes of 15-500 mm3 were included in this study if they were fully surrounded by air (intraparenchymal) and were detected by both observers. The mean volume and the difference between both measurements were calculated for all nodules. Intermeasurement agreement was assessed with the Spearman correlation coefficient. Potential reasons for discrepancies were assessed. Result(s): There were 232 men (mean age, 60 years; age range, 52-73 years) with 430 eligible nodules (mean volume, 77.8 mm3; range, 15.3-499.5 mm3). Interobserver correlation was high (r = 0.99). No difference in volume was seen for 383 nodules (89.1%). Discrepant results were obtained for 47 nodules (10.9%); in 16 cases (3.7%), the discrepancy was larger than 10%. The most frequent cause of variability was incomplete segmentation due to an irregular shape or irregular margins. Conclusion(s): In a minority (approximately 11%) of small solid intraparenchymal nodules, semiautomated measurements are not completely reproducible and, thus, may cause errors in the assessment of nodule growth. For small or irregularly shaped nodules, an observer should check the segmentation shown by the program. © RSNA, 2006.",Excluded

The postoperative complications and rates of surgical revision were comparable. Conclusion(s): Our results have demonstrated that RA MI-TLIF provides perioperative outcomes comparable to those with FG MI-TLIF. A reduced radiation dose to the patient was observed with RA compared with FG MI-TLIF. No differences were noted between the RA and FG cohorts in operative times, complication rates, revision rates, or length of stay.Copyright © 2021",Excluded
1952,"Hemoglobin levels and acute radiotherapy-induced toxicity AIMS AND BACKGROUND: To analyze the possible correlation between hemoglobin concentration and the appearance of acute radiotherapy-induced toxicity., METHODS: We prospectively studied hemoglobin levels and acute radiotherapy-induced toxicity in 86 patients treated for 3 months. Both sexes were considered to have anemia if their hemoglobin level was < or = 12 g/dL. No patient received corrective treatment for hemoglobin levels. Acute toxicity was analyzed weekly during radiotherapy and 45 days after therapy ended. The possible relationship between anemia and toxicity was analyzed, as was the correlation between hemoglobin values and the degree of toxicity., RESULTS: The findings were similar for all prognostic factors in patients with and without anemia. Hemoglobin concentration was < or = 12 g/dL in 24 patients (27.9%; mean, 10.93 +/- 0.78 g/dL). At the end of radiotherapy, hemoglobin levels were < or = 12 g/dL in 18 patients (20.9%; mean, 11.26 +/- 1.06 g/dL). The correlation between pretherapy and posttherapy hemoglobin concentration was significant at r = 0.729 (P = 0.01). The correlation between absolute hemoglobin values and the degree of toxicity, and the possible relationship between hemoglobin concentration and the appearance or the degree of toxicity after radiotherapy, was not significant., CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between hemoglobin concentration and oxygenation of the tumor and healthy tissues was not linear. This may account for the influence of hemoglobin levels on control of the disease as reported in earlier studies, but it does not account for their influence on acute toxicity after radiotherapy.",Excluded

Methods Between May 2001 and July 2009, 78 patients (m: f024:54; median age, 56.8 years; range, 20.1-81 years) with 87 intracranial meningiomas (78 WHO I, seven WHO II, two WHO III) were treated with muMLC-LINAC radiosurgery at our institution, either as a primary or salvage treatment following one or more microsurgical procedures. Fifty-eight of 87 tumors (66.7%) were located in the skull base. The remaining 29 meningiomas (33.3%) were located in the convexity of the brain. The median tumor volume was 4.8 ml (range, 0.2-18.3 ml). The median tumor surface dose, maximal dose, and therapeutic isodose were 12 Gy, 16 Gy, and 75%, respectively. Results For retrospective evaluation, we included 70 patients (78 tumors) with a minimum radiological follow-up of 24 months. After a median follow-up of 79.7 months (range, 24.2-109.1 months), 24 patients (34.3%) improved in their clinical status (paresis of N. abducens 18/48, facial paresis 4/8, and hemiparesis 2/9), 41 patients remained stable (58.6%), three patients had treatment-related temporary complaints (4.3%); two patients developed vertigo, and one had a leftsided hemihypesthesia. All complaints recovered completely after steroid medication within 2 weeks. Two patients (2.8%) developed permanent trigeminal neuralgia. Follow-up MR images showed a partial remission in 21 tumors (26.9%) and a stable tumor size in 55 cases (70.5%). Two patients with high-grade meningiomas showed a tumor progression (one WHO II and oneWHO III meningioma).

All the patients underwent saccharin particle test for nasal mucociliary clearance before commencement of radiation therapy and again within 6 months of completion of radiation therapy. The difference between the saccharin perception times of nasal mucosa in the healthy non-irradiated controls and the pre-irradiated head and neck cancer patients were statistically insignificant (P> 0.05). But, the difference between the saccharin perception times of nasal mucosa in the pre- and post-irradiated head and neck cancer patients was found to be statistically significant (P=0). It is concluded that even indirect irradiation of nasal mucosa in head and neck cancer patients significantly affect its ciliary activity. Significance of total radiation dosage along with chemotherapy in some cases was also studied.",Excluded
1267,"Differential recruitment of caspase 8 to cFlip confers sensitivity or resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis in a subset of familial lymphoma patients Resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis (FMA) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of hematologic malignancies. Recently, a collaborative study showed that germline Fas mutations represent a genetic risk factor for the development of Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Here, we report that transformed B cell lines from familial lymphoma patients show a range of sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis with lymphocytes from two patients with a marked resistance to Fas-, but not p53-mediated cell death. Fas resistance in these cells was associated with reduced recruitment of the initiator caspase 8 compared to cFlip, an inhibitor of apoptosis, to the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). A decreased ratio of caspase 8 to cFlip in total cell extracts as well as in the DISC was associated with a profound disturbance of the Fas signaling cascade. We propose here that the relative reduction in caspase 8 to cFlip in the Fas DISC confers a survival advantage to lymphocytes and predisposes to the development of malignancy in some familial lymphoma patients.",Excluded
2020,"Establishing locoregional control of malignant pleural mesothelioma using high-dose radiotherapy and 18F-FDG PET/CT scan correlation Introduction: The management of malignant pleural mesothelioma represents one of the most challenging issues in oncology, as there is no proven long-term benefit from surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy alone or in combination. Locoregional progression remains the major cause of death, but radical surgical resection may produce major postoperative morbidity. While radical or postoperative radiotherapy using conventional techniques has resulted in severe toxicity with no impact on survival, recent advances in radiotherapy delivery may be more effective. Method(s): We treated patients with locally advanced mesothelioma whose tumours had been sub optimally resected with high-dose three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) or intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) to large volumes of one hemithorax, using CT and positron emission tomography (PET) scan-based treatment planning. Clinical outcomes were assessed by determining patterns of failure and metabolic changes in total glycolytic volume (TGV) between pre- and post-irradiation18F-FDG PET/CT scans and by recording acute and late toxicity grades. Result(s): Fourteen patients were analysed with 40 PET scans performed before and up to 4.5 years after radiotherapy. Eleven patients had pleurectomy/decortications, one had an extrapleural pneumonectomy and two had no surgery. Four patients who received chemotherapy had all progressed prior to radiotherapy. After radiotherapy, the in-field local control rate was 71%. No progression occurred in two patients, one was salvaged with further radiotherapy to a new site, four recurred inside the irradiated volume all with concurrent distant metastases and the other seven had distant metastases only. The TGVs were reduced by an average of 67% (range 12-100%) after doses of 45 to 60 Gy to part or all of one hemithorax. There were no serious treatment-related toxicities. Median survival was 25 months from diagnosis and 17 months after starting radiotherapy. Conclusion(s): We have established that mesothelioma can be locally controlled with high radiation doses using 3DCRT or IMRT, and that strict normal tissue dose constraints have limited radiation toxicities. Radiotherapy should be considered to prevent or delay the local manifestations of progressive disease in suitable patients after surgery including extrapleural pneumonectomy and pleurectomy/decortication. Higher radiation doses may allow more effective palliation. © 2011 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists.",Excluded
1338,"Long-Term Outcomes for Patients With Desmoid Fibromatosis Treated With Radiation Therapy: A 10-Year Update and Re-evaluation of the Role of Radiation Therapy for Younger Patients Purpose: To update our experience with long-term outcomes in patients with desmoid fibromatosis treated with radiation therapy (RT) and to characterize factors associated with increased risk of local recurrence. Methods and Materials: We reviewed the records of 209 consecutive patients with desmoid fibromatosis treated with RT, either alone or as combined-modality therapy (CMT) with surgery, at our institution from 1965 to 2015. Result(s): Median follow-up time was 98 months (range, 1-509 months). The 5- and 10-year local control (LC) was 71% and 69%, respectively. Fifty-nine patients (28%) experienced a local recurrence at a median time of 23 months (interquartile range, 15-38 months). Among all patients, on multivariable analysis, adjusting for anatomic site, size, age, treatment era (>2005 vs <=2005), treatment approach (RT alone vs CMT), and an interaction between age and treatment, we found only age <=30 years (hazard ratio [HR], 2.94; P =.005; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.38-6.27) and large tumor size >10 cm (HR, 2.51; P =.03; 95% CI, 1.09-5.78) to be correlated with poorer LC. Notably, for patients receiving RT alone, the 5-year LC was 43% for patients <=30 years old versus 75% for >30 years old (P <.001). On multivariable analyses, for patients receiving RT alone, the only factor associated with inferior LC was age <=30 years (HR, 2.87; P =.001; 95% CI, 1.51-5.47). The same was true for patients treated with CMT; age <=30 years was the only factor associated with inferior LC (HR, 5.36; P =.01; 95% CI, 1.40-20.58). Conclusion(s): Among all patients with desmoid fibromatosis, RT is an effective local therapy for tumor control. However, young patients <= 30 years have notably high rates of local recurrence regardless of treatment strategy, which requires further study. Treatment decisions should be risk-adapted by large referral centers with multidisciplinary expertise in desmoid management.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
2101,"Assessment of inflammatory back pain and axial spondyloarthritis in Brazil Background/Purpose: The concept of inflammatory back pain (IBP) was proposed in association with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), one prototype of Spondyloarthritis (SpA), more than 60 years ago. Spondyloarthritis (SpA) comprises several rheumatic diseases. Although several criteria sets have been developed, the diagnosis of SpA remains challenging. This study aims to evaluate the frequency of inflammatory back pain (IBP) among Brazilian subjects with chronic back pain (CBP), and to describe the results of rheumatologic evaluation based on the axial SpA classification criteria from the Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society (ASAS). Method(s): This was an observational study with retrospective (phase 1) and one-month prospective (phase 2) data collection. Medical records of subjects 18-60 years old, with onset of back pain at age <40 years, and with CBP (pain almost daily >=3 months), were included in phase 1. Subjects with at least one ASAS screening parameter for IBP were contacted by phone, and confirmed IBP cases were invited to phase 2. At phase 2 visit 1, HLA-B27 and C-reactive protein (CRP) were requested. At phase 2 visit 2, the fulfilment of the ASAS classification criteria for axial SpA was verified. Frequency of IBP among subjects with CBP starting before the age of 40 years was estimated. For subjects included in phase 2, the proportions of positive HLA-B27, AS and non-radiographic axial SpA (nrAxSpA) were calculated. Result(s): A total of 363 records of subjects with CBP were reviewed from five sites. Based on medical records and phone contact, 130 subjects had IBP confirmed (35.8%, 95%CI: 30.9-40.7%). From IBP population, only 52 subjects accepted to participate in phase 2. Mean age was 38.8+/-11.43 years, 64% were female, 85% professionally active, and 14% had family history of IBP related conditions. Time since CBP onset was 12.3+/-10.09 years and no subject had a prior diagnosis of SpA. Among the 50 patients that completed visit 2, 14% had positive HLA-B27, 82% had lesions of the sacroiliac joint assessed by MRI, 16% had abnormal clinically significant CRP results, and 10% had grade 3-4 lesions assessed by X-ray. The proportions of AS and nrAxSpA cases were 46% and 26%, respectively by ASAS classification criteria. Conclusion(s): More than one third of the CBP subjects with onset <40 years had IBP by ASAS criteria. Of notice, subjects with a positive HLA-B27 test did not have prior diagnosis of axial SpA. The results in this Brazilian population suggest that patients with IBP may be under diagnosed, delaying their treatment, and that women may seek more for medical care than men. An eventual selection bias cannot be excluded.",Excluded
2261,"Variation of radius of curvature around the femoral head and its associations with gender and incident radiographic hip osteoarthritis: Data from the osteoarthritis initiative Purpose: To examine whether the shape of the femoral head is associated with gender or incidence of hip osteoarthritis. Method(s): Participants from the Osteoarthritis Initiative were eligible for this study if they did not have definite radiographic hip osteoarthritis (RHOA) in at least one hip on their baseline visit pelvis x-ray. Cases of incident RHOA were hips which developed definite RHOA by 48-month follow-up. Control hips were randomly selected, frequency matched by contralateral RHOA status, from hips which had not developed RHOA by 48-month follow-up. The femoral head outline on the baseline x-ray was recorded using a semi-automated method with 60 evenly spaced points placed from the inferior point of the narrowest part of the femoral neck around the femoral head to the superior point of the narrowest part of the femoral neck. The angle of the femoral neck was defined as the angle to the horizontal of a line through the centre point of the femoral neck to the centre point of the femoral head. Over each 10 degree arc around the femoral head, the local radius of curvature was calculated using a least squares fit, and was normalized to the radius of curvature fitted to all points within 90 degrees of the neck-head axis direction, to give a relative curvature, which was plotted as a function of the angle at which the point was relative to the femoral head centre. The angular position of the inflection point on the superior side of the head neck junction at which the outline of the femoral head switched from concave to convex was also recorded (see Figure 1). This gave 19 values of relative curvature, along with the inflection point angle which described the shape of the femoral head. Gender differences in relative curvature values and inflection point angle were examined using ANOVA with correction for multiple comparisons. Associations of relative curvature values and inflection point angle with incident RHOA were examined in the following two step process (1) In a univariate analysis, each of the 19 values of relative curvature, along with the inflection point angle was examined as a predictor of incident RHOA using binary logistic regression (with GEE to allow for more than one hip per person in the analysis), with models corrected for covariates of age and body mass index and contralateral RHOA status, (2) Predictors (significant at p<0.05) were then entered into a multivariate model to determine which independently predicted RHOA. Result(s): 678 hips (452 participants) were analysed (265 women, 187 men). In women, there were 68 hips with incident RHOA and 343 control hips. In men, there were 41 hips with incident RHOA and 226 control hips. In hips with no RHOA, inflection point angle was significantly larger in men than women, relative curvature was significantly higher at the supero-lateral (+90 degree) and a more medial position (+40 degrees) in men than women (see Table 1). In the multivariate analysis of the association between femoral head shape and incident RHOA, only 2 relative curvature values (at +80 degrees - supero-medial, and +40 degrees - more medially), along with the inflection point angle were significantly associated with incident RHOA, and all three image based measurements predicted incident RHOA with similar odds ratios (see Table 2). Conclusion(s): Larger inflection angles were associated with increased odds of developing incident RHOA, and larger values existed in normal hips of men compared to women. Flattening of the femoral head superolaterally (+80 degrees) and more medially (+40 degrees) were also independently associated with increased odds of incident RHOA. These two positions were also ones in which gender differences occurred in normal hips. Increased inflection angle may be a measure of pistol grip deformity, known to be associated with RHOA, but this study showed that flattening of the supero-lateral portion of the femoral head (seen more frequently in men) and flattening of the more medial portion of the femoral head (seen more frequently in women) are both independent p edictors of incident RHOA. The mechanisms by which these are associated with gender and incident RHOA, perhaps partly related to incongruence with the acetabulum, need further investigation. (Figure Presented).",Excluded
1622,"Optimal management in optic nerve sheath meningioma - A multicentre study and pooled data analysis Optic nerve sheath meningiomas (ONSMs) are rare, benign neoplasms of the anterior visual pathway. The optimal modality of radiotherapy for treatment has not yet been established. This is the first study to show significant difference in visual outcomes between radiotherapy subtypes in the management of ONSM. We performed a retrospective analysis of visual outcomes and side effects in ONSM patients treated with radiotherapy at three centres in Sydney, Australia, between 2000 and 2016. 15 patients with ONSM were included, and visual outcomes (visual acuity, visual fields, colour vision, OCT retinal nerve fibre layer thickness and radiological tumour response) and treatment toxicities were assessed. Pooled data analysis of available studies was also performed. Statistical analysis was performed with binomial, two-tailed chi-squared tests and Fisher exact tests. In our cohort a significant majority experienced improved visual field (p = 0.046), stable or improved visual acuity (p = 0.0017) and colour vision (p = 0.015) after fractionated radiotherapy. Pooled analysis with strict inclusion criteria found 3D conformal radiotherapy to offer significantly poorer visual acuity compared to fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (p = 0.008). When all published studies were included, stereotactic radiosurgery was superior to 3D conformal methods (p = 0.035), and equivalent to other fractionated methods. 3D conformal methods also had significantly higher rates of long-term side effects. These results support the use of fractionated radiotherapy and radiosurgery for ONSM treatment, however 3D conformal methods cannot be recommended.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
1971,"Radiation dose reduction for CT-guided renal tumor cryoablation OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to retrospectively determine the image quality and degree of radiation dose reduction that is clinically acceptable for CT-guided renal tumor cryoablation., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 15 patients (17 procedures; mean age, 67 years; range, 38-85 years) undergoing clinically indicated CT-guided renal tumor cryoablation procedures were included in this retrospective study. A previously validated noise-insertion tool was used to simulate reduced-dose scans at 75%, 50%, 25%, and 10% of the original dose at four representative phases of the cryoablation procedure. Images obtained at different dose levels were randomized and reviewed by three radiologists blinded to the level of dose reduction, who scored them independently with a 5-point scale (1-5, with 5 the best). Images with a mean score of 3 or higher were considered diagnostically acceptable. The minimal acceptable dose was that at which 90% of images were considered diagnostically acceptable. Interrater agreement was assessed using the weighted kappa statistic., RESULTS: The weighted kappa value was 0.68, indicating substantial agreement among the reviewers. The averaged percentage of diagnostically acceptable images for the four series was 100% for a full dose, 98-100% for the 75% dose level, 94-98% for the 50% dose level, and less than 90% for images obtained at the 25% and 10% dose levels, which was considered unacceptable., CONCLUSION: On the basis of results from 15 patients (17 procedures), images obtained from CT acquisitions at 50% (volume CT dose index, 12.2 mGy) of the original dose level (volume CT dose index, 24.4 mGy) were acceptable for the purpose of CT monitoring of renal cryoablation procedures.",Excluded
2386,"Impact of PET/CT on precise radiotherapy planning for non-small cell lung cancer OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of PET/CT on the clinical staging, target volume delineation and precise radiotherapy (PAR) planning for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHOD(S): PET/CT scanning was performed in 58 histologically proven NSCLC patients for radical radiotherapy or surgery. The clinical staging of all patients was determined by PET/CT according to 1997 World Health Organization (WHO) staging system. The gross tumor volume (GTV) was delineated and three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) planning was established with identical parameters based on CT image and PET/CT fused image, respectively. The indexes including volume of GTV (V(GTV)), percentage of the total lung volume which received more than 20 Gy (V(20)), mean lung dose (MLD), tumor control probability (TCP), normal tissue complication probability (NTCP), and dose to spinal cord (Ds) were selected and evaluated. The quality of the two plans and the impact of PET/CT on PAR planning was compare and analyzed. RESULT(S): 1. PET/CT image results changed the clinical stages in 21 of 58 (36.2%) patients with 14 upstaged and 7 downstaged, therefore, the management decisions were modified in 16 (27.6%) patients. 2. Among 32 patients who underwent surgery, PET/CT staging result was consistent with pathologic staging in 29 with one false negative and 2 false positive in lymph node staging. The sensitivity of PET/CT was 96.9% and accuracy 90.6%. 3. The differences of indexes including V(GTV) (P = 0.004), V(20) (P = 0.000) and MLD (P = 0.004) between the two radiotherapy plannings were statistically significant, whereas, the Ds, TCP and NTCP (left lung, right lung, skin and spinal cord) was not. CONCLUSION(S): 1. The impact PET/CT on clinical staging of NSCLC and PAR planning was remarkable. 2. PET/CT is more consistent with pathology in staging than CT and, therefore, is an important compensatory staging measure. 3. Compared with CT, PET/CT can reduce the V(GTV) in patients with atelectasis and obstructive pneumonitis when contouring the target volume, so can provide better protection for normal surrounding lung tissue. On the other hand, PET/CT is more sensitive in detecting mediastinal lymph node metastasis than CT, and the V(GTV) can be more precise and guaranteed. 4. Radiopneumonitis may be more effectively prevented because of significant decrease in V(20) and MLD by more precise planning based on PET/CT results. 5. PET/CT not only can provide satisfactory Ds, TCP and NTCP within clinical demand, but also more precise delineation of the radiation target volume and precise radiotherapy planning for NSCLC.",Excluded
1776,"Hyberbaric oxygen as sole treatment for severe radiation - induced haemorrhagic cystitis PURPOSE: To examine the safety and efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen as the primary and sole treatment for severe radiation-induced haemorrhagic cystitis., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hyperbaric oxygen was prospectively applied as primary treatment in 38 patients with severe radiation cystitis. Our primary endpoint was the incidence of complete and partial response to treatment, while the secondary endpoints included the duration of response, the correlation of treatment success-rate to the interval between the onset of haematuria and initiation of therapy, blood transfusion need and total radiation dose, the number of sessions to success, the avoidance of surgery and the overall survival., RESULTS: All patients completed therapy without complications with a mean follow-up of 29.33 months. Median number of sessions needed was 33. Complete and partial response rate was 86.8% and 13.2%, respectively. All 33 patients with complete response received therapy within 6 months of the haematuria onset. One patient needed cystectomy, while 33 patients were alive at the end of follow-up., CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests the early primary use of hyperbaric oxygen for radiation-induced severe cystitis as an effective and safe treatment option.

1739,"68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT, 99mTc-HYNIC-octreotide SPECT/CT, and whole-body MR imaging in detection of neuroendocrine tumors: A prospective trial Methods: Nineteen consecutive patients (34-77 y old; mean, 54.3 +/- 10.4 y old; 10 men and 9 women) underwent SSRS SPECT/CT, 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT, and WB DWI. Images were acquired with a maximum interval of 3 mo between them and were analyzed with masking by separate teams. Planar whole-body imaging and SPECT/CT were performed from thorax to pelvis using a double-head 16-slice SPECT/CT scanner 4 h after injection of 111-185 MBq of 99mTc-HYNIC-octreotide. 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT was performed from head to feet using a 16-slice PET/CT scanner 45 min after injection of 185 MBq of tracer. WB DWI was performed in the coronal plane using a 1.5-T scanner and a body coil. The standard method of reference for evaluation of image performance was undertaken: consensus among investigators at the end of the study, clinical and imaging follow-up, and biopsy of suggestive lesions., There are different metabolic imaging methods, various tracers, and emerging anatomic modalities to stage neuroendocrine tumor (NET). We aimed to compare NET lesion detectability among 99mTc-hydrazinonicotinamide (HYNIC)-octreotide (somatostatin receptor scintigraphy [SSRS]) SPECT/CT, 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT, and whole-body diffusion-weighted MR imaging (WB DWI)., Results: McNemar testing was applied to evaluate the detectability of lesions using 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT in comparison to SSRS SPECT/CT and WB DWI: a significant difference in detectability was noted for pancreas (P = 0.0455 and P = 0.0455, respectively), gastrointestinal tract (P = 0.0455 and P = 0.0455), and bones (P = 0.0082 and P = 0.0082). Two unknown primary lesions were identified solely by 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT. 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT, SSRS SPECT/CT, and WB DWI demonstrated, respectively, sensitivities of 0.96, 0.60, and 0.72; specificities of 0.97, 0.99, and 1.00; positive predictive values of 0.94, 0.96, and 1.00; negative predictive values of 0.98, 0.83, and 0.88; and accuracies of 0.97, 0.86, and 0.91., Conclusion: 68Ga PET/CT seems to be more sensitive for detection of well-differentiated NET lesions, especially for bone and unknown primary lesions. NET can be staged with 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT. WB DWI is an efficient new method with high accuracy and without ionizing radiation exposure. SSRS SPECT/CT should be used only when 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT and WB DWI are not available.Copyright COPYRIGHT © 2014 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Inc.",Excluded
2032,"Cardiac exposure in the dynamic conformal arc therapy, intensity-modulated radiotherapy and volumetric modulated arc therapy of lung cancer Purpose: To retrospectively evaluate the cardiac exposure in three cohorts of lung cancer patients treated with dynamic conformal arc therapy (DCAT), intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), or volumetricmodulated arc therapy (VMAT) at our institution in the past seven years. Methods and Materials: A total of 140 lung cancer patients were included in this institutional review board approved study: 25 treated with DCAT, 70 with IMRT and 45 with VMAT. All plans were generated in a same commercial treatment planning system and have been clinically accepted and delivered. The dose distribution to the heart and the effects of tumor laterality, the irradiated heart volume and the beam-to-heart distance on the cardiac exposure were investigated. Result(s): The mean dose to the heart among all 140 plans was 4.5 Gy. Specifically, the heart received on average 2.3, 5.2 and 4.6 Gy in the DCAT, IMRT and VMAT plans, respectively. The mean heart doses for the left and right lung tumors were 4.1 and 4.8 Gy, respectively. No patients died with evidence of cardiac disease. Three patients (2%) with preexisting cardiac condition developed cardiac disease after treatment. Furthermore, the cardiac exposure was found to increase linearly with the irradiated heart volume while decreasing exponentially with the beam-to-heart distance. Conclusion(s): Compared to old technologies for lung cancer treatment, modern radiotherapy treatment modalities demonstrated better heart sparing. But the heart dose in lung cancer radiotherapy is still higher than that in the radiotherapy of breast cancer and Hodgkin's disease where cardiac complications have been extensively studied. With strong correlations of mean heart dose with beam-to-heart distance and irradiated heart volume, cautions should be exercised to avoid long-term cardiac toxicity in the lung cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy.Copyright © 2015 Ming et al.

1500,"Corticofugal modulation of the tactile response coherence of projecting neurons in the gracilis nucleus Precise and reproducible spike timing is one of the alternatives of the sensory stimulus encoding. We test coherence (repeatability) of the response patterns elicited in projecting gracile neurons by tactile stimulation and its modulation provoked by electrical stimulation of the corticofugal feedback from the somatosensory (SI) cortex. To gain the temporal structure we adopt the wavelet-based approach for quantification of the functional stimulus-neural response coupling. We show that the spontaneous firing patterns (when they exist) are essentially random. Tactile stimulation of the neuron receptive field strongly increases the spectral power in the stimulus and 5- to 15-Hz frequency bands. However, the functional coupling (coherence) between the sensory stimulus and the neural response exhibits ultraslow oscillation (0.07 Hz). During this oscillation the stimulus coherence can temporarily fall below the statistically significant level, i.e., the functional stimulus-response coupling may be temporarily lost for a single neuron. We further demonstrate that electrical stimulation of the SI cortex increases the stimulus coherence for about 60% of cells. We find no significant correlation between the increment of the firing rate and the stimulus coherence, but we show that there is a positive correlation with the amplitude of the peristimulus time histogram. The latter argues that the observed facilitation of the neural response by the corticofugal pathway, at least in part, may be mediated through an appropriate ordering of the stimulus-evoked firing pattern, and the coherence enhancement is more relevant in gracilis nucleus than an increase of the number of spikes elicited by the tactile stimulus.",Excluded
2304,"Lung cancer mortality associated with protracted low-dose occupational radiation exposures and smoking behaviors in U.S. radiologic technologists, 1983-2012 In the Japanese atomic bomb survivors, risk of lung cancer has been shown to increase with greater acute exposure to ionizing radiation. Although similar findings have been observed in populations exposed to low-dose, protracted radiation, such studies lack information on cigarette smoking history, a potential confounder. In a cohort of 106 068 U.S. radiologic technologists, we examined the association between estimated cumulative lung absorbed dose from occupational radiation exposure and lung cancer mortality. Poisson regression models, adjusted for attained age, sex, birth cohort, pack-years smoked and years since quitting smoking, were used to calculate linear excess relative risks (ERR) per 100 mGy, using time-dependent cumulative lung absorbed dose, lagged 10 years. Mean cumulative absorbed dose to the lung was 25 mGy (range: 0-810 mGy). During the 1983 to 2012 follow-up, 1090 participants died from lung cancer. Greater occupational radiation lung dose was not associated with lung cancer mortality overall (ERR per 100 mGy: -0.02, 95% CI: <0-0.13). However, significant dose-response relationships were observed for some subgroups, which might be false-positive results given the number of statistical tests performed. As observed in other studies of radiation and smoking, the interaction between radiation and smoking appeared to be sub-multiplicative with an ERR per 100 mGy of 0.41 (95% CI: 0.01-1.15) for those who smoked <20 pack-years and -0.03 (95% CI: <0-0.15) for those who smoked >=20 pack-years. Our study provides some evidence that greater protracted radiation exposure in the low-dose range is positively associated with lung cancer mortality.Copyright © 2020 UICC",Included
2123,"The prognostic role of hemoglobin levels in patients undergoing concurrent chemo-radiation for anal cancer Background: Concurrent chemo-radiation (CT-RT) is a standard therapy for squamous cell carcinoma of anal canal. Different clinical and biological factors may potentially affect outcome. We investigated the prognostic role of baseline hemoglobin (Hb) in a cohort of anal cancer patients submitted to CT-RT with 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin C. Method(s): Up to 161 patients with clinical stage T1-T4/N0-N3/M0 were treated. Response was assessed at 6 weeks and thereafter at 3, 6 and 12 months. Two different approaches were used:a)simultaneous integrated boost following RTOG 05-29 indications;b)first sequence of 45Gy/25 fractions to the pelvis followed by 9-14.4 Gy/5-8 fractions to the macroscopic disease. Primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Result(s): On multivariate analysis, pre-treatment Hb level had a significant correlation to OS (HR:0.53;95% CI:0.33-0.87; p = 0.001), but not to PFS (HR:0.78;95% CI:0.53-1.15; p = 0.12) Patients with pre-treatment Hb >= 12 g/dl had 5-year PFS and OS of 82.2%, compared to 29.3% and 32.8% for those below the threshold. The likelihood to achieve a complete remission increased by 5.6% for every single-unit (g/dl) increase in baseline Hb level over 11 g/dl. On multivariate analysis, response to treatment had a significant correlation to PFS (incomplete vs complete response - HR:5.43;95% CI:2.75-10.7; p < 0.0001) and OS (HR: 6.96;95% CI:2.96-16.5; p < 0.0001). Conclusion(s): We showed that baseline Hb level is a strong indicator for poor response to RT-CT in anal cancer patients. A close clinical monitoring for incomplete response to treatment should be advised in patients with low pre-treatment Hb. The hypothesis that the preservation of adequate Hb level during treatment may lead to a better outcome needs prospective evaluation.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).",Excluded

Conventionally, the endpoints for head and neck cancer patients focused on objective tumor response, local control and overall survival. These endpoints are assessed from the physician's point of view.and in view of increased number of longtime survivors, the need for understanding patients experience, their perceptions of treatment effects and their priorities have to be well recognized, Hence a prospective study was conducted to evaluate the quality of life in Indian patients of locally advanced head and neck cancer patients undergoing concurrent chemo radiation. Method(s): Single arm prospective observational study of 53 patients receiving concurrent chemo-radiation were assessed for changes in quality of life using EORTC QLQ-C30 and the EORTC -H&N35 questionnaires at baseline before treatment , 4th week during treatment,on completion of treatment,4weeks and 12 weeks after treatment.Data analysis was done using paired t test for each variable comparing each of the assessments done during treatment, on completion of treatment, 1 month post completion of treatment and 3months post completion of treatment comparing with baseline values . Result(s): Mean age of the study population was 52.48 +/- 11.6 years (Age range 28-72 years). There were 33.3% females and 66.7% males.There was a significant decrease in Global health related quality of life during treatment(P < 0.001) and on completion of treatment(p < 0.001) when compared to baseline scores but showing upward trends in scores post 1month and 3 month of treatment compared to baseline scores. Conclusion(s): There was significant deterioration in Quality of life during and after curative intent concurrent chemo-radiotherapy in Indian patients that gradually but definitely improves over time. Incorporation of quality of life assessments in daily clinical practice and with a close monitoring of acute side effects with implementation of appropriate symptomatic treatments, quality of life of Indian patients during treatment can be increased.",Excluded
1510,"Pulmonary resection after high-dose and low-dose chest irradiation BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of pulmonary resection after low and high dose neoadjuvant radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy., PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study using an electronic prospective database from January 1998 to August 2004. All patients had N2, stage IIIa, nonsmall cell lung cancer, and received neoadjuvant carboplatinum-based chemotherapy with similar doses. In addition, some patients received high-dose chest radiation (HD) equal to or greater than 60 Gy and were compared with those who received low-dose radiation (LD) less than 60 Gy. All bronchial stumps were buttressed with an intercostal muscle., RESULTS: There were 104 patients, 50 in the LD group and 54 patients in the HD group. Median dose of radiation was 45 Gy (range 35-50.4) in the LD group and 60 Gy (range 60-66.7) in the HD group. Complete pathologic response rate was 10% compared to 28% favoring the HD group (p = 0.04). Median length of stay for both groups was 4 days and the ICU was avoided in 74%. Major morbidity and mortality rates were similar: 8% compared to 9% and 2% compared to 3.7% for the low and high dose groups, respectively. Pneumonectomy was a significant risk factor for morbidity (OR = 17.0)., CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary resection after preoperative chest radiation is safe even after 60 Gy or higher. Sixty or higher may afford an increase in complete pathologic response and it does not seem to increase morbidity or mortality. However, if pneumonectomy is known to be required we prefer to avoid neoadjuvant radiotherapy and use chemotherapy alone.",Excluded
2351,"Total effective radiation dose attributable to medical imaging in patients with acute chest pain: A single-center comparison study between dual-source coronary ct angiography and usual care Introduction: Coronary CT angiography (CCTA) can safely disposition low to intermediate risk chest pain (CP); however, there is conflicting data with respect to cumulative radiation exposure when compared with usual care over short follow-up intervals. Objective(s): We report the effective radiation dose from index and downstream testing in low to intermediate risk symptomatic patients evaluated for chest pain in the ED with either CCTA or usual care to define various sources of patient radiation dose and quantify effective dose over a year and a half of follow-up. Patients and Methods: We evaluated radiation exposure from initial and downstream testing in a prospectively collected, matched cohort evaluated for CP in the emergency department (ED) with either CCTA compared with usual care over a median follow-up of 19.6 months. Effective radiation dose was calculated using published conversion factors. Result(s): Prospective, ECG-triggered acquisition using a 128-slice dual-source multidetector computed tomography (DSCT) scanner was performed in 92.9% of scans with a median effective dose from CCTA of 6.8 mSv (IQR 5.2, 9.1 mSv). CCTA cohort patients were more likely to undergo cardiac testing with exposure to radiation (P < 0.001); however, the median effective dose in patients exposed to radiation from cardiac testing was significantly lower in the CCTA cohort (7.1 mSv vs. 11.8 mSv, P < 0.001). Fewer patients in the CCTA cohort had additional non-cardiac thoracic imaging radiation exposure (40.8%) compared with usual care (92.8%). Total radiation exposure from any source was similar between the CCTA and usual care groups (100% vs 98.4%, P = 0.087), as was median total effective radiation dose (P = 0.105). Upfront CCTA was not associated with higher rates of incidental non-cardiac findings. Conclusion(s): Initial evaluation of acute chest pain in the ED with CCTA was not associated with an increase in total radiation exposure over a follow-up period of 19 months. CCTA offers a more comprehensive evaluation of multiple thoracic organ systems leading to reduced radiation exposure from non-cardiac thoracic testing and no increase in incidental imaging findings. This may represent an added benefit in this population of patients presenting acutely.Copyright © 2015, Iranian Society of Echocardiography.",Excluded
1269,"Lower regional and temporal ultraviolet exposure is associated with increased rates and severity of inflammatory bowel disease hospitalisation Background In the northern hemisphere, the incidence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) has a north-south gradient, suggesting a link between ultraviolet (UV) exposure or vitamin D status and the pathogenesis of IBD. Aim To test the association of UV exposure with the rates and severity of IBD hospitalisation. Methods We conducted a retrospective nationwide analysis of 649 932 Crohn's disease (CD), 384 267 ulcerative colitis (UC), and 288 894 297 non-IBD hospitalisations in the US between 1998 and 2010. Mean UV exposure was assigned to each hospitalisation using surface measures from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Relative rates across UV exposures were estimated for IBD hospitalisations, prolonged hospitalisations, bowel surgeries and deaths. Results Among IBD patients, lower UV exposures had increased hospitalisation rates for CD (217.8 vs. 182.5 per 100 000 overall hospitalisations with low and very high UV, respectively; P trend <0.001) and UC (123.2 vs. 113.8 per 100 000; P trend = 0.033). Low UV groups had greater relative rates of prolonged hospitalisations [CD: 1.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-1.19; UC: 1.21, 95% CI 1.13-1.30], bowel surgeries (CD: 1.24, 95% CI 1.16-1.32; UC: 1.21, 95% CI 1.09-1.33), and CD deaths (CD: 1.76, 95% CI 1.14-2.71; UC: 1.24, 95% CI 0.92-1.67). Among non-IBD patients, low UV was associated with prolonged hospitalisations (1.09; 95% CI 1.07-1.11) and deaths (1.13; 95% CI 1.09-1.17), but not bowel surgeries (1.01; 95% CI 0.99-1.03). Conclusions Lower ultraviolet exposure is associated with greater rates of hospitalisation, prolonged hospitalisation and the need for bowel surgery in IBD. This trend for bowel surgery was not seen with non-IBD encounters. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Excluded
1784,"The maximum tolerated dose of gamma radiation to the optic nerve during gamma knife radiosurgery in an animal study BACKGROUND: The safety of gamma knife radiosurgery should be considered when treating pituitary adenomas., OBJECTIVES: To determine the maximum tolerated dose of radiation delivered by gamma knife radiosurgery to optic nerves., METHODS: An animal model designed to establish prolonged balloon compression of the optic chiasm and parasellar region was developed to mimic the optic nerve compression caused by pituitary adenomas. Twenty cats underwent surgery to place a balloon for compression effect and 20 cats in a sham operation group received microsurgery without any treatment. The effects of gamma knife irradiation at 10-13 Gy on normal (sham operation group) and compressed (optic nerve compression group) optic nerves were investigated by pattern visual evoked potential examination and histopathology., RESULTS: Gamma knife radiosurgery at 10 Gy had almost no effect. At 11 Gy, P100 latency was significantly prolonged and P100 amplitude was significantly decreased in compressed optic nerves, but there was little change in the normal optic nerves. Doses of 11 Gy and higher induced significant electrophysiological variations and degeneration of the myelin sheath and axons in both normal and compressed optic nerves., CONCLUSIONS: Compressed optic nerves are more sensitive to gamma knife radiosurgery than normal optic nerves. The minimum dose of gamma knife radiosurgery that causes radiation injury in normal optic nerves is 12 Gy; however, the minimum dose is 11 Gy in compressed optic nerves. Copyright © 2013 S.

Visual acuity (VA), fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography were performed and demonstrated a RAP-like lesion in both cases. Treatment with intravitreal injections of Ranibizumab was performed with a follow-up of 19 and 10 months, respectively., RESULTS: Both the patients had a positive response to the treatment with improvement in VA and reduction of intraretinal fluid., CONCLUSION: RAP-like lesions can develop following radiation treatment for a primary tumor. In patients presenting with idiopathic RAP, a history of prior radiotherapy should be considered.",Excluded
1756,"Time-dependence of the effect of X-irradiation on the formation of glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase and other dehydrogenases in the developing rat brain X-irradiation (100-1500 r) administered to the heads of rats 8-30 days of age inhibited the development of glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase (l-glycerol 3-phosphate-NAD oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.8) in the brain stem and cerebral hemispheres. At 40 days of age and older no effect was observed. This inhibition was a delayed phenomenon, dose-dependent and with no recovery. It is proposed that the inhibition of enzyme formation is related to radiation damage caused to DNA. Actinomycin D inhibited the development of glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase in a manner similar to ionizing radiation. Four other dehydrogenases also showed age-dependent radiosensitivities. ;Malic enzyme' (EC 1.1.1.40), lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27) and malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37) ceased to be radiosensitive at about 8 days of age and isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP) (EC 1.1.1.42) at 16 days. The correlation between developmental increase in enzyme activity and radiosensitivity held closely for glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase and isocitrate dehydrogenase and to a smaller extent for the others.",Included
2349,"Development and evaluation of solid lipid nanoparticles of n-6-furfuryl adenine for prevention of photoaging N-6-furfuryl adenine (N6FA) also known as ""kinetin"" is a biologically active natural phytochemical. It belongs to the category of cytokinins, the natural plant growth hormones that promote cell division and play role in cell differentiation. Overall, N6FA aids in increasing the plant's life span. Human cells also contain small quantities of N6FA. Scientists are trying to understand its function in humans. N6FA is being investigated for its properties such as antiplatelet, antioxidant, antiproliferative and anti-aging effects on human cells. The aim of the present investigation was to prepare solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN) based topical formulations of N6FA and to evaluate its efficacy against ultraviolet (UV) radiation induced skin photodamage. SLNs were prepared by hot microemulsion technique and optimized for the type and concentration of lipid and surfactant(s). The optimized SLN formulation was characterized in terms of particle size, drug entrapment efficiency, zeta potential and pH; evaluated for stability, spreadability, ex-vivo skin permeation and photoprotective effects against UV induced skin damage. The cumulative amount of drug permeated through mice skin using SLNs was 3 folds higher than from conventional cream base. The results of biochemical and histopathological investigations of skin treated with N6FA loaded SLNs clearly demonstrated the efficacy of optimized formulation in preventing photodamage (lesions, ulcers and changes in skin integrity) due to chronic UV exposure. The effects were comparable with widely used marketed formulation, Garnier wrinkle lift anti-aging cream. Results suggested that N6FA incorporated into SLNs may provide therapeutic as well as cosmeceutical benefits.Copyright © 2015 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.",Excluded
2164,"Apolipoprotein E epsilon4 and age effects on florbetapir positron emission tomography in healthy aging and Alzheimer disease Objectives: Investigate apolipoprotein E epsilon4 (APOE4) gene and aging effects on florbetapir F18 positron emission tomography (PET) in normal aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Method(s): Florbetapir F18 PET images were analyzed from 245 participants, 18-92 years of age, from Avid Radiopharmaceutical's multicenter registered trials, including 86 younger healthy control volunteers (yHC), 61 older healthy control volunteers (oHC), 53 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, and 45 AD dementia patients (DAT). Mean florbetapir standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were used to evaluate the effects of APOE4 carrier status, older age, and their interaction in each of these groups. Result(s): In comparison with non-carriers, the APOE4 carriers in each of the oHC, MCI, and DAT groups had higher mean cortical-to-cerebellar florbetapir SUVRs, patterns of florbetapir PET elevations characteristic of DAT, and a higher proportion meeting florbetapir PET positivity criteria. Only the oHC group had a significant association between mean cortical florbetapir SUVRs and age. In cognitively normal adults, without regards to APOE4 genotype, amyloid began to increase at age 58 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 52.3-63.7), with a predicted typical age of florbetapir positivity occurring around age 71 years. Presence of the APOE4 gene reduced the age of predicted florbetapir positivity in normal aging to around age 56 years, approximately 20 years younger than non-carriers. Interpretation(s): Cerebral amyloid deposition is associated with APOE4 carrier status in older healthy control subjects and symptomatic AD patients, and increases with age in older cognitively normal individuals. Amyloid imaging positivity appears to begin near age 56 years in cognitively intact APOE4 carriers and age 76 years in APOE4 non-carriers. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1782,"Effect of radiation dose reduction and iterative reconstruction on computer-aided detection of pulmonary nodules: Intra-individual comparison OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of radiation dose reduction and iterative reconstruction (IR) on the performance of computer-aided detection (CAD) for pulmonary nodules., METHODS: In this prospective study twenty-five patients were included who were scanned for pulmonary nodule follow-up. Image acquisition was performed at routine dose and three reduced dose levels in a single session by decreasing mAs-values with 45%, 60% and 75%. Tube voltage was fixed at 120 kVp for patients >= 80 kg and 100 kVp for patients < 80 kg. Data were reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP), iDose(4) (levels 1,4,6) and IMR (levels 1-3). All noncalcified solid pulmonary nodules >= 4 mm identified by two radiologists in consensus served as the reference standard. Subsequently, nodule volume was measured with CAD software and compared to the reference consensus. The numbers of true-positives, false-positives and missed pulmonary nodules were evaluated as well as the sensitivity., RESULTS: Median effective radiation dose was 2.2 mSv at routine dose and 1.2, 0.9 and 0.6 mSv at respectively 45%, 60% and 75% reduced dose. A total of 28 pulmonary nodules were included. With FBP at routine dose, 89% (25/28) of the nodules were correctly identified by CAD. This was similar at reduced dose levels with FBP, iDose(4) and IMR. CAD resulted in a median number of false-positives findings of 11 per scan with FBP at routine dose (93% of the CAD marks) increasing to 15 per scan with iDose(4) (95% of the CAD marks) and 26 per scan (96% of the CAD marks) with IMR at the lowest dose level., CONCLUSION: CAD can identify pulmonary nodules at submillisievert dose levels with FBP, hybrid and model-based IR. However, the number of false-positive findings increased using hybrid and especially model-based IR at submillisievert dose while dose reduction did not affect the number of false-positives with FBP.

2166,"Coloproctologic disorders of the pelvic floor Purpose. The aim of this review is to describe the most frequent and important coloproctologic pelvic floor disorders. Relevant diagnostic procedures of the pelvic floor will be presented. Material and methods. A host of diagnoses and symptoms such as the descending perineum syndrome, rectocele, cystocele, enterocele, uterine and vaginal descensus, anal and rectal prolaps, outlet obstruction, anismus, inertia recti and intussusception are included under the heading 'pelvic floor disorders'. Although symptoms are often varied, problems concerning urinary and/or faecal continence commonly lead to primary consultation of a physician. Results. Quite often, apparently divergent symptoms such as constipation and incontinence are simultaneously mentioned. A clear gender disposition is observed with female patients inflicted nine-fold in comparison to male patients. The primary consultant may belong to a variety of specialities such as urology, proctology, gynaecology or dermatology, depending upon the predominant symptom. A feeling of trust is essential for the treatment of a disorder involving highly intimate regions of the body. Discussion. An exact medical history and standardized proctologic evaluation consisting of inspection, palpation, rectoscopy and proctoscopy may be augmented by investigations such as anorectal manometry or endosonography. Conventional defecography has been replaced more and more by dynamic MRI of the pelvic floor in specialized institutions, enabling additional gynaecologic and urologic investigations avoiding ionizing radiation.",Excluded
2055,"Identification of ureteral stones at reduced radiation exposure: a pilot study comparing conventional versus digital low-dosage linear slot scanning (Lodox R) radiography PURPOSE: Digital low-dosage, linear slot scanning radiography (Lodox R) is an imaging modality that can emit down to one-tenth the radiation of conventional X-ray systems. We prospectively evaluated Lodox R as a diagnostic imaging modality in patients with ureterolithiasis., METHODS: Conventional kidney-ureter-bladder (KUB) X-ray and Lodox R were performed in 41 patients presenting with acute flank pain due to unilateral ureteral stone confirmed by computed tomography. KUB X-ray and Lodox R images were then reviewed by four blinded readers (urology expert/resident, radiology expert/resident). Identification rates were compared using Pearson's Chi square test. The impact of different parameters on stone identification by Lodox R was evaluated using logistic regression and generalized linear mixed models. Inter-reader agreement was tested using Cohen's kappa coefficient., RESULTS: Median stone size was 5 mm (range 2-12), median stone density was 800 HU (range 200-1500). The identification rates of the urology expert were 68% for KUB X-ray and 90% for Lodox R (p = 0.014), and for all four readers 61% for KUB X-ray and 62% for Lodox R (p = 0.8). Radiation exposure for KUB X-ray and Lodox R was 0.45 mSv (SD +/- 0.64) and 0.027 mSv (SD +/- 0.038), respectively. Multivariable analyses showed an association between stone identification by Lodox R and stone size (p < 0.001), stone density (p = 0.005), lower body mass index (p = 0.005), and reader (p < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: The high identification rates and low radiation doses of Lodox R make it a promising imaging modality for the diagnosis of ureteral stones.

2435,"Falling back to earth: Altered splanchnic vasoreactivity may contribute to microgravity-induced orthostatic intolerance The adaptations of the human cardiovascular system to microgravity, which are well tolerated while in space, can lead to dizziness, blurred vision, and fainting upon reentry. Specifically, orthostatic hypotension, a fall in blood pressure upon standing, poses a major problem for astronauts returning to Earth, and presents a hazard should an emergency ever arise during landing. Female astronauts are affected more frequently than males, suggesting underlying gender-related differences in cardiovascular regulation. One such difference has already been demonstrated: in response to an orthostatic challenge, males experience blood pooling primarily in the legs, while females show much more blood pooling in the abdominal region. Normally, the splanchnic blood vessels should reflexively constrict, initiating mobilization of the blood to supply the brain. In order to determine whether attenuation of this reflex is responsible for post-flight orthostatic intolerance (particularly in females), we examined in vitro vascular reactivity in male and female rats subjected to simulated microgravity (hind-limb unloading; HLU). The constrictor response of third-order mesenteric blood vessels to phenylephrine was measured by wire myograph. The sensitivity of female arteries to phenylephrine was attenuated following HLU. Maximal tensile response to phenylephrine was unchanged in these vessels, while maximal tensile response to high KCI increased. In male arteries, HLU did not significantly change any of these parameters. These results indicate that, after HLU, the mesenteric arteries of females (but not males) can be expected to show reduced sensitivity to noradrenergic sympathetic outflow. This may partially underlie the gender disparity in post-flight orthostatic hypotension.",Excluded

Design and settings A population-based retrospective cohort study from Western Norway. Participants 363 patients aged 18 years or older diagnosed with glioblastoma between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2014. Primary and secondary outcome measures Overall survival and survival rates determined by Kaplan-Meier method, groups compared by log-rank test. Associations between clinical characteristics and treatment approach assessed by logistic regression. Associations between treatment approach and outcome analysed by Cox regression. Results Median overall survival was 10.2 months (95% CI 9.1 to 11.3). Resection was performed in 221 patients (60.9%), and was inversely associated with age over 70 years, higher comorbidity burden, deep-seated tumour localisation and multifocality. Median survival was 13.7 months (95% CI 12.1 to 15.4) in patients undergoing tumour resection, 8.3 months (95% CI 6.6 to 9.9) in patients undergoing biopsy and 4.5 months (95% CI 4.0 to 5.1) in patients where no surgical intervention was performed. Chemoradiotherapy according to the Stupp protocol was given to 157 patients (43%). Age over 70 years, higher comorbidity burden and cognitive impairment were associated with less intensive chemoradiotherapy. Median survival was 16.3 months (95% CI 14.1 to 18.5), 7.9 months (95% CI 6.7 to 9.0) and 2.0 months (95% CI 0.9 to 3.2) in patients treated according to the Stupp protocol, with less intensive chemoradiotherapy and with best supportive care, respectively. Surgical resection (HR 0.61 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.79)) and chemoradiotherapy according to the Stupp protocol (HR 0.09 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.15)) were strongly associated with favourable overall survival, when adjusted for clinical variables. Conclusions In a real-world setting, less than half of the patients received full-course chemoradiotherapy, with a median survival comparable to results from clinical trials. Survival was considerably worse in patients receiving less intensive treatment.

2016,"Experience with wound complications after surgery for sacral tumors Purpose: The aim of this article is to summarize our experience in treating sacral wound complications after sacrectomy. We focus, in particular, on factors associated with wound complications, including surgical site infection (SSI) and wound dehiscence. Method(s): The definition of SSI devised by Horgan et al. was applied. Wound dehiscence was defined as a wound showing breakdown in the absence of clinical signs meeting the diagnostic standard for SSI. Between September 1997 and August 2009, 387 patients with a sacral tumor underwent sacrectomy performed by the same team of surgeons and were followed up for >=12 months. Potential risk factors were evaluated for univariate associations with SSI and wound complications. Multivariable conditional logistic regression was used to identify the combined effects of several risk factors. Result(s): Of the 387 wounds studied, 274 healed uneventfully, and 113 (29.2 %) broke down because of infection or dehiscence. Fifty-one (13.2 %) patients developed a postoperative SSI, and 62 (16.0 %) patients developed wound dehiscence. Gram-negative bacteria grew in 45 cultures (91.8 %) and included 38 cases of Escherichia coli. Previous radiation, rectum rupture, longer duration of surgery, and cerebrospinal fluid leakage were significantly associated with increased likelihood of developing an SSI. Previous radiation, rectum rupture, age <40 years, history of diabetes mellitus, maximum tumor diameter >=10 cm, and instrumentation used were risk factors for wound complications. Conclusion(s): The incidence of wound complications is not so high at a musculoskeletal tumor center with surgeons experienced in treating sacral tumors. Controlling for these risk factors when possible may improve clinical outcomes. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded

Methods and Materials: From 2011 to 2013, 105 patients after esophagectomy were treated with postoperative radiotherapy. The intrathoracic stomach was outlined with the calculation of a dose-volume histogram (DVH) for the initial intended treatment of 6020 cGy or 6300 cGy. The volume of the intrathoracic stomach receiving each dose was recorded at 10-Gy intervals between 10 and 40 Gy and at 5-Gy intervals between 40 and 60 Gy. The grade of toxicities was defined by the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 4.0. Result(s): The mean and maximum doses of the intrathoracic stomach were 2449 +/- 986 cGy and 6519 +/- 406 cGy, respectively. Sixteen (15.2%) and three (2.9%) experienced Common Toxicity Criteria Grade 2 and Grade 3 acute gastric toxicity. There were no Grade 4 toxicities. Fourteen patients (13.3%) exhibited late gastric complications possibly related to radiation. The volume percent of the intrathoracic stomach receiving at least 50 Gy (V50) was strongly associated with the degree of toxicity (p = 0.024, respectively). Multivariate analysis of patient and treatmentrelated factors revealed no other significant predictors of severe toxicities. Conclusion(s): The intrathoracic stomach is well tolerated with a high-dose irradiation for patients with esophageal SCC receiving radiotherapy after esophagectomy. A strong dose-volume relationship exists for the development of Grade 2 acute intrathoracic stomach toxicity in our study.",Excluded
1691,"Capacity of primary hospitals for diabetes treatment in six Chinese provinces: A cross-sectional survey Background Establishment of a hierarchical medical system is one of the major tasks outlined in China's ambitious health reform, and the ultimate success of this system depends on the treatment capacity of primary hospitals. Among the priorities of primary hospitals is the provision of quality services for chronic diseases, including diabetes, atypical and epidemic chronic disease in China. We aimed to estimate the capacity of primary hospitals for diabetes treatment in six Chinese provinces. Methods We did a cross-sectional survey in China using qualitative and quantitative methods. First, we interviewed 24 related experts (five primary hospital principals, six general practitioner, five drug experts, five medical device experts, two clinical experts, and one health system expert) to establish the capacity standard of primary hospital for diabetes treatment in the hierarchical medical system. Next, we surveyed the treatment capacity with regards to human resources, drug supply, and medical equipment in 28 primary hospitals (17 urban and 11 rural) in six provinces in China (Shanghai, Fujian, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, and Guizhou) between May 20 and July 12, 2016. Finally, we compared the survey results against the standard. We adopted purposive sampling, and used chi2 test and rank sum test for data analyses. Ethics approval was granted by Sichuan University, and all participants provided oral informed consent. Findings The primary hospitals surveyed had a mean of 1.76 general practitioners (SD 2.03) per million residents. The mean number of general practitioners per million residents was 1.48 (1.18) for rural hospitals and 1.92 (2.41) for urban hospitals, which were lower than the standard (2-3, based on the expert interviews and policy review). 11 (65%) urban primary hospitals provided three or more types of drugs, compared with four (36%) rural primary hospitals. Urban primary hospitals had a mean of 8.35 (SD 4.44) types of diabetes drugs and rural ones had 4.45 (3.33), although expert interviews and policy reviews indicated that primary hospitals need provide seven types of drugs that are often used in the clinic. 27 (96%) primary hospitals provided metformin, 26 (93%) sulfonylureas, 18 (64%) alphaglucosidase inhibitors, 16 (57%) insulin, 15 (54%) hypoglycaemic proprietary Chinese medicine, 11 (39%) glinides, and nine (32%) thiazolidinediones; newer antidiabetic drugs such as DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, and GLP-1 receptor agonists were scarcely supplied. All 28 primary hospitals were equipped with blood glucose meters, blood pressure instruments, and electrocardiograph machines; 25 (89%) had biochemical analysers, 27 (96%) B ultrasound machines, 20 (71%) colour Doppler ultrasound machines and x-ray machines, and eight (29%) fundus mirrors, while expert interviews showed that primary hospitals should have with all of these equipment. No significant difference in availability of medical equipment was recorded between rural and urban primary hospitals (p>0.05). Interpretation Primary hospitals in China, especially those in rural areas, do not have sufficient human resources and drugs for diabetes treatment, although they generally have adequate medical equipment. Strategies to enhance the capacity of primary hospitals for diabetes treatment need to increase the number of health-care workers and drug supply.",Excluded

Diagnostic acceptability was graded using a four-point scale (1, unacceptable; 2, suboptimal; 3, acceptable; 4, fully acceptable)., RESULTS: The effective dose in the HPS mode was 1.5 +/- 0.2 mSv, which was lower than that in SAS (8.9 +/- 2.7 mSv) and LPS (21.5 +/- 4.3 mSv) modes. There were no significant differences in the image noise levels in the descending aorta and left atrium. The average per-patient diagnostic acceptability was 3.2, 3.6, and 3.7 in HPS, SAS, and LPS modes, respectively., CONCLUSION: The radiation dose is lower with HPS than with other modes, and the HPS mode-acquired images of patients with heart rates of <=65 bpm are nearly acceptable for diagnostic image interpretation.

1431,"Sex, amyloid, and APOE epsilon4 and risk of cognitive decline in preclinical Alzheimer's disease: Findings from three well-characterized cohorts INTRODUCTION: Our objective was to investigate the effect of sex on cognitive decline within the context of amyloid beta (Abeta) burden and apolipoprotein E genotype., METHODS: We analyzed sex-specific effects on Abeta-positron emission tomography, apolipoprotein, and rates of change on the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite-5 across three cohorts, such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle, and Harvard Aging Brain Study (n = 755; clinical dementia rating = 0; age (standard deviation) = 73.6 (6.5); female = 55%). Mixed-effects models of cognitive change by sex, Abeta-positron emission tomography, and apolipoprotein epsilon4 were examined with quadratic time effects over a median of 4 years of follow-up., RESULTS: Apolipoprotein epsilon4 prevalence and Abeta burden did not differ by sex. Sex did not directly influence cognitive decline. Females with higher Abeta exhibited faster decline than males. Post hoc contrasts suggested that females who were Abeta and apolipoprotein epsilon4 positive declined faster than their male counterparts., DISCUSSION: Although Abeta did not differ by sex, cognitive decline was greater in females with higher Abeta. Our findings suggest that sex may play a modifying role on risk of Alzheimer's disease-related cognitive decline. Copyright © 2018 the Alzheimer's Association. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1243,"A multicenter, prospective pilot study of gamma knife radiosurgery for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy: seizure response, adverse events, and verbal memory OBJECTIVE: The safety, efficacy, and morbidity of radiosurgery (RS) must be established before it can be offered as an alternative to open surgery for unilateral mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. We report the 3-year outcomes of a multicenter, prospective pilot study of RS., METHODS: RS was randomized to 20 or 24Gy targeting the amygdala, hippocampus, and parahippocampal gyrus. Seizure diaries evaluated the final seizure remission between months 24 and 36. Verbal memory was evaluated at baseline and 24m with the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R) and California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT). Patients were classified as having ""significant improvement,"" ""no change,"" and ""significant impairment"" based on relative change indices., RESULTS: Thirteen high-dose and 17 low-dose patients were treated. Both groups showed significant reductions in seizures by 1 year after treatment. At the 36-month follow-up evaluation, 67% of patients were free of seizures for the prior 12 months (high dose: 10/13, 76.9%; low dose: 10/17, 58.8%). Use of steroids, headaches, and visual field defects did not differ by dose or seizure remission. The prevalence of verbal memory impairment was 15% (4/26 patients); none declined on more than one measure. The prevalence of significant verbal memory improvements was 12% (3/26)., INTERPRETATION: RS for unilateral mesial temporal lobe epilepsy offers seizure remission rates comparable with those reported previously for open surgery. There were no major safety concerns with high-dose RS compared with low-dose RS. Additional research is required to determine whether RS may be a treatment option for some patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.",Excluded
1962,"Comparison of phototherapy two times and four times a week with low doses of narrow-band ultraviolet B in Asian patients with psoriasis Background/Aims: The optimum narrow-band (TL-01) ultraviolet (UV) B weekly treatment frequency for psoriasis has yet to be defined, especially in Asian patients with TL-01. Our purpose was to compare 2x weekly and 4x weekly therapy with narrow-band UVB at low doses for psoriasis vulgaris. Method(s): Sixty-nine patients with moderately severe psoriasis were recruited and allocated to the 2x weekly or 4x weekly treatment group. The patients were treated with a new protocol using low doses of narrow-band UVB with varied exposure increments. Outcomes were evaluated by means of Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) scores, time (weeks), cumulative UVB dose and number of treatments to clearance. Result(s): No significant difference was found between the two regimens in the PASI score at the end of treatment, in the proportion of patients whose skin cleared during treatment and in the time to clearance (8 weeks). Those who completed treatment achieved clearance after a median of 16 exposures with 2x weekly treatment compared with 32 exposures with 4x weekly treatment (P=0.0304), and 12.5 minimal erythema dose multiples (MEDs) compared with 39.7 MEDs (P=0.0470). Acute side effects of the treatment were similar for the two groups (P=0.8462). Conclusion(s): For skin phototype III-V populations, a greater long-term risk is expected, connected with the higher cumulative UVB dose and number of exposures required in the 4x weekly group. Therefore, 4x weekly phototherapy will no longer be used for psoriasis.",Excluded
2129,"Exogenous T3 mimics long day lengths in Siberian hamsters Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus) exhibit seasonal cycles of reproduction driven by changes in day length. Day length is encoded endogenously by the duration of nocturnal melatonin (Mel) secretion from the pineal gland. Short-duration Mel signals stimulate reproduction and long-duration signals inhibit reproduction. The mechanism by which Mel signals are decoded at the level of neural target tissues remains uncharacterized. In Siberian hamsters, exposure to short day lengths or injections of Mel in long days results in a decrease in hypothalamic expression of type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (Dio2) mRNA. Dio2 catalyzes the conversion of the thyroid hormone thyroxine to triiodothyronine (T3). Thus exposure to short and long day lengths should decrease and increase hypothalamic T3 concentrations, respectively. We tested the hypothesis that exogenous T3 administered to short-day hamsters would mimic exposure to long day lengths with respect to gonadal stimulation. Hamsters gestated and raised in short day lengths that exhibited photoinhibition of the testes were given daily subutaneous injections of T3 or saline vehicle for 4 wk beginning at week 12 of life. The results indicate that exogenous T3 induced gonadal growth in short-day hamsters and delayed spontaneous gonadal development by an interval equal to the number of weeks during which T3 was administered. T3 injections delayed gonadal regression if given coincident with the transfer of hamsters from long to short day lengths. These results suggest that T3 mimics long day exposure in Siberian hamsters and may serve as an intermediate step between the Mel rhythm and the reproductive response.",Excluded
2065,"Correlation between hallux valgus angle and hallucal sesamoid position on meary radiographic incide Background: Hallux valgus (HV) and sesamoid misalignment are usually linked. Some studies found no correlation between the stage of hallucal sesamoid subluxation and standard radiographic data usually used for quantifying the severity of the HV. Aim(s): This study evaluate the correlation between the apparent lateral deviation of the sesamoids on anteroposterior X-rays and their rotation on axial X-rays, then evaluates their relations with the severity of hallux valgus. Method(s): This monocentric retrospective study included feet of adult men and women with a HV angle (HVA) superior to 15 degrees. Two independent doctors made the measurement of the relative displacement of the sesamoids on anteroposterior radiographies by using the 7 grades Clapham-and-Hardy classification and compared it with their rotation in axial radiographies, defined by the sesamoid rotation angle and the tibia sesamoid grade on modified Meary incidence with radio-transparent heelpiece. Correlation with the HV severity was analyzed based on measure of HVA and first intermetatarsal angle. Result(s): 303 feet were included (201 patients). All parameters shown significant correlations between each other. SRA appeared to be the most reliable criteria on Me ary radiography to evaluate the relative lateral displacement of sesamoids and it was the most strongly correlated to the HVA (0.658). Conclusion(s): An anteroposterior radiographic incidence is not sufficient to evaluate sesamoids subluxation. To approach at best the triplanar deformity of the metatarso-sesamoid complex, an evaluation in frontal and axial incidence is necessary. SRA appears as reliable criteria and could be used to evaluate the quality of the corrective surgery.",Excluded

The deduced dose dependency agrees well with a previous analysis in terms of a non-parametric proportional hazards model, and confirms the temporal distribution which has been used in the Radioepidemiological Tables of NIH. However, the linear-quadratic dose-response model gives a risk estimate for low doses which is somewhat less than half that obtained under the assumption of linearity.",Excluded
1391,"Preliminary Evidence That Cortical Amyloid Burden Predicts Poor Response to Antidepressant Medication Treatment in Cognitively Intact Individuals With Late-Life Depression Objective: Amyloid accumulation, the pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, may predispose some older adults to depression and cognitive decline. Deposition of amyloid also occurs prior to the development of cognitive decline. It is unclear whether amyloid influences antidepressant outcomes in cognitively intact depressed elders. Design(s): A pharmacoimaging trial utilizing florbetapir (18F) PET scanning followed by 2 sequential 8-week antidepressant medication trials. Participant(s): Twenty-seven depressed elders who were cognitively intact on screening. Measurements and Interventions: After screening, diagnostic testing, assessment of depression severity and neuropsychological assessment, participants completed florbetapir (18F) PET scanning. They were then randomized to receive escitalopram or placebo for 8 weeks in a double-blinded two-to-one allocation rate. Individuals who did not respond to initial treatment transitioned to a second open-label trial of bupropion for another 8 weeks. Result(s): Compared with 22 amyloid-negative participants, 5 amyloid-positive participants exhibited significantly less change in depression severity and a lower likelihood of remission. In the initial blinded trial, 4 of 5 amyloid-positive participants were nonremitters (80%), while only 18% (4 of 22) of amyloid-negative participants did not remit (p = 0.017; Fisher's Exact test). In separate models adjusting for key covariates, both positive amyloid status (t = 3.07, 21 df, p = 0.003) and higher cortical amyloid binding by standard uptake value ratio (t = 2.62, 21 df, p = 0.010) were associated with less improvement in depression severity. Similar findings were observed when examining change in depression status across both antidepressant trials. Conclusion(s): In this preliminary study, amyloid status predicted poor antidepressant response to sequential antidepressant treatment. Alternative treatment approaches may be needed for amyloid-positive depressed elders.Copyright © 2020",Excluded
1532,"Comparison of ultrasound-assisted and pure fluoroscopy-guided extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy for renal stones Background: In this study, we aimed to compare the efficacy and clinical outcomes of shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) for patients with renal stones using pure fluoroscopy (FS) or ultrasound-assisted (USa) localization with two lithotripters. Method(s): We retrospectively identified 425 patients with renal calculi who underwent SWL with either a LiteMed LM-9200 ELMA lithotripter (209 cases), which combined ultrasound and fluoroscopic stone targeting or a Medispec EM-1000 lithotripter machine (216 cases), which used fluoroscopy for stone localization and tracking. The patient demographic data, stone-free rates, stone disintegration rates, retreatment rates and complication rates were analyzed. Result(s): The USa group had a significantly higher overall stone-free rate (43.6 vs. 28.2%, p < 0.001) and stone disintegration rate (85.6 vs. 64.3%, p < 0.001), as well as a significantly lower retreatment rate (14.8 vs. 35.6%, p < 0.001) and complication rate (1.9 vs. 5.5%, p = 0.031) compared with the FS group. This superiority remained significant in the stone size < 1 cm stratified group. In the stone size > 1 cm group, the stone-free rate (32.4 vs. 17.8%, p = 0.028), disintegration rate (89.2 vs. 54.8%, p = 0.031) and retreatment rate (21.6 vs. 53.4%, p < 0.001) were still significantly better in the USa group, however there was no significant difference in the complication rate. The most common complication was post-SWL-related flank pain. Conclusion(s): SWL is a safe and non-invasive way of treating renal stones. This study compared two electromagnetic shock wave machines with different stone tracking systems. LiteMed LM-9200 ELMA lithotripter, which combined ultrasound and fluoroscopic stone targeting outperformed Medispec EM-1000 lithotripter, which used fluoroscopy for stone localization and tracking, with better stone-free rates and disintegration rates, as well as lower retreatment rates and complications with possible reduced radiation exposure.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded

CTPA was performed with vendor-predefined second-generation (group A, 100-kV single-energy computed tomography (SECT); group B, 80/Sn140-kV dual-energy computed tomography (DECT)) or third-generation DSCT (group C, 100-kV SECT; group D, 90/Sn150-kV DECT) devices. Radiation metrics were assessed using a normalized scan range of 27.5 cm. For objective image quality evaluation, dose-independent figure-of-merit (FOM) contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were calculated. Subjective image analysis included ratings for overall image quality, reader confidence, and image artifacts using five-point Likert scales., RESULTS: Calculations of the effective dose (ED) of radiation for a normalized scan range of 27.5 cm showed nonsignificant differences between SECT and DECT acquisitions for each scanner generation (p >= 0.253). The mean effective radiation dose was lower for third-generation groups C (1.5 mSv +/- 0.8 mSv) and D (1.4 mSv +/- 0.7 mSv) compared to second-generation groups A (2.5 mSv +/- 0.9 mSv) and B (2.3 mSv +/- 0.6 mSv) (both p <= 0.013). FOM-CNR measurements were highest for group D. Qualitative image parameters of overall image quality, reader confidence, and image artifacts showed nonsignificant differences among the four groups (p >= 0.162)., CONCLUSIONS: Third-generation DSCT systems show lower radiation dose parameters for CTPA compared to second-generation DSCT. DECT can be performed with both scanner generations without radiation dose penalty or detrimental effects on image quality compared to SECT., KEY POINTS: * Radiation exposure showed nonsignificant differences between SECT and DECT for both DSCT scanner devices. * Dual-energy CTPA provides equivalent image quality compared to standard image acquisition. * Subjective image quality assessment was similar among the four study groups.",Excluded

Procedures: Isoflurane-anesthetized mice received tracer dose via tail vein. Organ time-integrated activity coefficients, fractional urinary and hepatobiliary excretion, and total-body clearance kinetics were derived from PET data, with allometric extrapolation to the Standard Man anatomic model and normal-organ-absorbed dose calculations using OLINDA/EXM software. Result(s): The human effective dose was 0.031 mSv/MBq. The critical organ was the upper large intestine, with a dose equivalent of 0.25 mSv/MBq. A 190-MBq administered activity of 18F-SKI-249380 is thus predicted to expose an adult human to radiation doses generally comparable to those of routinely used diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals.

1233,"Self-generated lower body negative pressure exercise Background: Exercise during spaceflight helps prevent musculoskeletal and cardiovascular deconditioning to Earth gravity. This report evaluates the aerobic and anaerobic exercise stimulus provided by self-generated lower body negative pressure. Method(s): A lower body negative pressure cylinder expands and collapses longitudinally, but not radially. As the legs push footward to expand the cylinder, the air pressure in the cylinder decreases, increasing the force required to continue expanding the cylinder. In addition, valves control air flow into and out of the cylinder, and thus workload. In seven supine subjects, knee bend exercise was performed at 19 cycles per minute for 6 min. Footward force was measured with load cells, cylinder pressure with a transducer, heart rate from ECG, and oxygen consumption with turbine volumetry and gas analysis. Result(s): Maximum footward force at the peak of the exercise cycle averaged 1120 +/- 88 N (114 +/- 9 kg), and pressure within the cylinder concomitantly decreased 26 +/- 3 mmHg below ambient. Heart rate and oxygen consumption increased 75 +/- 4 bpm and 26.3 +/- 1.4 m O2/kg . min-1 from supine resting values, respectively. Conclusion(s): With the air inlet valve nearly closed, exercise with this device approximates a resistance-type leg press. With more inflow of air, more rapid, aerobic knee bends can be performed.

Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) of IMRT plans were used to determine radiation dose to thyroid and were compared with DVHs using conventional three-dimensional radiotherapy (3D-RT) in 10 of these same patients randomly selected for replanning and with DVHs of 16 patients in whom the thyroid was intentionally avoided during IMRT. Weekly paclitaxel (30 mg/m(2)) and carboplatin area under the curve-1 were given concurrently with IMRT., RESULTS: Sixty-one of 128 evaluable patients (47.7%) developed hypothyroidism after a median of 1.08 years after IMRT (range, 2.4 months to 3.9 years). Age and volume of irradiated thyroid were associated with hypothyroidism development after IMRT. Compared with 3D-RT, IMRT with no thyroid dose constraints resulted in significantly higher minimum, maximum, and median dose (p < 0.0001) and percentage thyroid volume receiving 10, 20, and 60 Gy (p < 0.05). Compared with 3D-RT, IMRT with thyroid dose constraints resulted in lower median dose and percentage thyroid volume receiving 30, 40, and 50 Gy (p < 0.005) but higher minimum and maximum dose (p < 0.005)., CONCLUSIONS: If not protected, IMRT for LAHNC can result in higher radiation to the thyroid than with conventional 3D-RT.

The benefit of IVBT for treating ISR is well documented. However, few data exist on significant angiographic and intravascular ultrasonic in-stent lumen deterioration beyond the habitual 6-month analysis after the index radiation procedure or so-called late catch-up process in the treatment of ISR. Twenty-five consecutive patients with ISR were treated with IVBT using the Beta-Cath System (a 40 mm 90 Sr per 90 gamma source). Quantitative angiographic and IVUS analysis was performed in all of them at 6 and 12 months. IVBT was successful in all patients. Four patients (16%) developed recurrent angiographic binary restenosis at 6-month follow-up, all located within the adjacent reference segments, with 2 being associated with geographical miss.

Objective The purpose of this study was to evaluate the dose reduction and image quality of a novel X-ray technology using advanced image processing and dose reduction technology in an EP laboratory. Methods In this single-center, randomized, unblinded, parallel controlled trial, consecutive patients undergoing catheter ablation for complex arrhythmias were eligible. The Philips Allura FD20 system allows switching between the reference (Allura Xper) and the novel X-ray imaging technology (Allura Clarity). Primary end-point was overall procedural patient dose, expressed in dose area product (DAP) and air kerma (AK). Operator dose, procedural success, and necessity to switch to higher dose settings were secondary end-points. Results A total of 136 patients were randomly assigned to the novel imaging group (n = 68) or the reference group (n = 68). Baseline characteristics were similar, except patients in the novel imaging group were younger (58 vs 65 years, P <.01). Median DAP and AK were 43% and 40% lower in the novel imaging group, respectively (P <.0001). A 50% operator dose reduction was achieved in the novel imaging group (P <.001).

Purpose(s): To assess the feasibility and reproducibility of 18F-FDG PET/MRI to characterize plaque burden, composition and inflammation in subclinical atherosclerosis. Method(s): A total of 938 asymptomatic participants with extensive atherosclerosis (age 48.0+/-4.3 years, 84% men) from the PESA (Progression of Early Subclinical Atherosclerosis) study underwent 18F-FDG PET/MRI of the carotid arteries, aorta, and ilio-femoral arteries 30 min after 18F-FDG injection (FDG dose 293+/-10.5 MBq, radiation dose 5.6+/-0.2 mSv). Arterial FDG uptake was evaluated on co-registered PET/MRI images using target-to-background ratios (TBR). Atherosclerotic burden was evaluated on T1-weighted MR images (indexed wall volume) and plaque characterization on T1- and T2- weighted MR images (lipidic, fibrous, mixed). Reproducibilities of FDG uptake and atherosclerotic burden/ composition were quantified in 15 PESA participants using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), kappa and Bland & Altman analysis. Result(s): A total of 842 (89.7%) 18F-FDG PET/MRI studies were available for final analysis (5.9% of which were incomplete, mainly lacking carotid imaging). FDG circulation time was 106.0+/-14.9 min for the ilio-femoral PET and 133.0+/-19.5 min for the carotid-aortic PET. Plaque composition analysis showed a Kappa value of 0.57. ICC of multi-territorial TBR was excellent (0.98; 95% CI of 0.97-0.98). ICC of multi-territorial indexed wall volume was good (0.89; 95% CI of 0.84-0.93). Bland & Altman plots showed good agreement for all explored territories, with mostly narrow confidence intervals (Figure). Conclusion(s): Hybrid 18F-FDG PET/MRI of multi-territory subclinical atherosclerosis in a single setting is feasible and highly reproducible, as demonstrated in the largest cohort ever reported for vascular PET/MRI, allowing multiparametric characterization of plaque burden, composition and inflammation.

2397,"Tolerability of combined modality therapy for rectal cancer in elderly patients aged 75 years and older Purpose: To determine the rate of treatment deviations during combined modality therapy for rectal cancer in elderly patients aged 75 years and older. Methods and Materials: We reviewed the records of consecutively treated patients with rectal cancer aged 75 years and older treated with combined modality therapy at Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham & Women's Hospital from 2002 to 2007. The primary endpoint was the rate of treatment deviation, defined as a treatment break, dose reduction, early discontinuation of therapy, or hospitalization during combined modality therapy. Patient comorbidity was rated using the validated Adult Comorbidity Evaluation 27 Test (ACE-27) comorbidity index. Fisher's exact test and the Mantel-Haenszel trend test were used to identify predictors of treatment tolerability. Result(s): Thirty-six eligible patients had a median age of 79.0 years (range, 75-87 years); 53% (19/36) had no or mild comorbidity and 47% (17/36) had moderate or severe comorbidity.

Although 92% patients (33/36) completed the planned radiotherapy (RT) dose, 25% (9/36) required an RT-treatment break, 11% (4/36) were hospitalized, and 33% (12/36) had a dose reduction, break, or discontinuation of concurrent chemotherapy. In all, 39% of patients (14/36) completed >=4 months of adjuvant chemotherapy, and 17% (6/36) completed therapy without a treatment deviation. More patients with no to mild comorbidity completed treatment than did patients with moderate to severe comorbidity (21% vs. 12%, p = 0.66). The rate of deviation did not differ between patients who had preoperative or postoperative CRT (19% vs. 17%, p = 1.0). Conclusion(s): The majority of elderly patients with rectal cancer in this series required early termination of treatment, treatment interruptions, or dose reductions. These data suggest that further intensification of combined modality therapy for rectal cancer should be performed with caution in elderly patients, who require aggressive supportive care to complete treatment. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
2103,"Evaluation of PRRT after selective catheterization of the hepatic artery as established technique ('Aretaieion' Protocol) using 111In-DTPA-Phe1 octreotide in inoperable liver metastases due to neuroendocrine tumors Aim/Introduction: To evaluate the efficacy of Auger and Internal Conversion Electron Emission of 111In-DTPA-Phe1-Octreotide and their tumoricidal effectiveness due to their high LET, in inoperable liver metastases, positive for sst2 receptor over-expression (verified by Octreoscan and confirmed by biopsy) due to neuroendocrine tumours (NETs). Material(s) and Method(s): In 86 patients 111In-DTPA-Phe1-Octreotide was implemented after selective catheterization of the hepatic artery, in an average activity of 6.3+/-1.3 GBq per patient/ per session, consecutively, with a time interval between sessions of 6-8 weeks. Infusion repetition did not exceed the 12 sessions. Patients, being under repeated Sandostatin-LAR treatment (30 mg per 20 days) did not discontinued the dosage but they were intramuscularly injected 15-20 days prior to the radioactive session. To reduce myelotoxicity, 75 mg of DTPA in trip-trop diluted in about 200 ml normal saline water was infused 30 min before the initialization of the radiopeptide therapy, lasting for about 4 hrs. For the assessment of response, RECIST 1.1 standards were used. CT/MRI scans before, during and after the end of the whole procedure, as well as U/S images at monthly basis were performed. Absorbed doses delivered to metastases, kidneys and red marrow were calculated according to OLINDA/EXM 1.1 program. Toxicity (World Health Organization criteria) was measured using blood and urine tests of renal, hepatic and bone marrow function. Result(s): Three patients resulted in complete response (3.5%); partial response was assessed in 46 (53.5 %), disease stabilization in 21 (24.4 %) and progressive disease in 16 (18.6%). The median PFS and OS were estimated to be 32 and 47.5 months, respectively. The organ average radiation dose was estimated as follows: (a) Liver Tumor 15.2 mGy/MBq, (b) Liver 0.14 mGy/MBq, (c) Kidneys 0.41 mGy/ MBq, (d) Spleen 1.4 mGy/MBq and (f ) Bone marrow 0.0032 mGy/MBq. The average absorbed dose per session to a tumour for a spherical mass of 10 gr was estimated to be 10.8 mGy/MBq, depending on the histotype of the tumour. WHO toxicity grade 2 to 3 erythro-, leuko-and thrombocytopenia occurred in 9 (10.5%) cases observed about after the 3rd session. Conclusion(s): In unresectable metastatic liver lesions, positive for somatostatin receptors, repeated, transhepatic high doses of 111In-DTPA-Phe1-Octreotide resulted in an optimal therapeutic outcome with a disease control (CR+PR+SD) in an about 82 % of the treated patients. Thus, 111In-DTPA-Phe1-Octreotide, intra-arterially applied, can be considered as a potent candidate in the therapeutic pharetra against NETs.",Excluded
1642,"Simulated stand tests on earth, moon and mars and centrifuge parameters to prevent cardiovascular deconditioning during spaceflight Postflight Orthostatic Intolerance (POI) results from cardiovascular adaptation to spaceflight and affects a significant fraction of astronauts returning to earth after missions that are merely a couple of weeks in duration and may be even more prevalent after longer missions, such as those to the moon and Mars. To prevent cardiovascular deconditioning a centrifuge may be utilized to induce gravity-like stresses within the body. The current investigation allows insight into the mechanisms of POI by simulating stand tests on Earth, the moon, and Mars while predicting centrifuge spin rates that sufficiently mimic each constant gravity reference. It was found that the modeled nonfinishing male & female astronaut would become presyncopal in about 4&7min, 32&56min, 104&182min while losing 160&280mL, 512&896mL, 692&1211mL of blood volume (BV) at the onset of presyncope in each case for Earth, Mars, and the moon, respectively. The modeled finishing male astronaut endured the length of the stand test in every case, but lost only 100mL, 320, and 432mL BV by the end of each stand test. Centrifuge speeds for equivalent times to presyncope for female and finishing & nonfinishing male astronauts loaded the body with G loads at heart level for Earth, Mars, and the moon cases consistently less than the constant gravity reference level for both the NASA short & long arm centrifuges.Keywords-Spaceflight, Syncope, Stand test, Centrifuge.",Excluded
1757,"XPA-deficiency in hairless mice causes a shift in skin tumor types and mutational target genes after exposure to low doses of U.V.B Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) patients with a defect in the nucleotide excision repair gene XPA, develop tumors with a high frequency on sun-exposed areas of the skin. Here we describe that hairless XPA-deficient mice also develop skin tumors with a short latency time and a 100% prevalence after daily exposure to low doses of U.V.B. Surprisingly and in contrast to U.V.B.-exposed repair proficient hairless mice who mainly develop squamous cell carcinomas, the XPA-deficient mice developed papillomas with a high frequency (31%) at a U.V. dose of 32 J/m2 daily. At the highest daily dose of 80 J/m2 mainly squamous cell carcinomas (56%) and only 10% of papillomas were found in XPA-deficient hairless mice. p53 gene mutations were examined in exons 5, 7 and 8 and were detected in only 3 out of 37 of these skin tumors, whereas in tumors of control U.V.B.-irradiated wild type littermates this frequency was higher (45%) and more in line with our previous data. Strikingly, a high incidence of activating ras gene mutations were observed in U.V.B.-induced papillomas (in 11 out of 14 tumors analysed). In only two out of 14 squamous cell carcinomas we found similar ras gene mutations. The observed shift from squamous cell carcinomas in wild type hairless mice to papillomas in XPA-deficient hairless mice, and a corresponding shift in mutated cancer genes in these tumors, provide new clues on the pathogenesis of chemically- versus U.V.B.-induced skin carcinogenesis.",Excluded

Three cases of advanced disease, treated surgically, are presented. In two of these, subtotal petrosectomy with blind-sac closure of the external auditory canal was carried out via an anterior approach. The enclosed space was obliterated with pedicled temporalis muscle. Primary healing took place. One case was similarly obliterated using a prolonged posterior incision. The wound broke down, requiring a microvascular free flap for closure. Radiotherapy jeopardizes the viability of skin flaps. An anterior incision bases the flap behind on the occipital and postauricular arteries. When radiotherapy has been used, this incision has theoretical and practical advantages over a standard posterior incision.",Excluded
1535,"Reirradiation of recurrent high-grade glioma and development of prognostic scores for progression and survival Background: Optimal techniques and patient selection for salvage reirradiation of high-grade glioma (HGG) are unclear. In this study, we identify prognostic factors for freedom from progression (FFP) and overall survival (OS) after reirradiation, risk factors for high-grade toxicity, and validate clinical prognostic scores. Method(s): A total of 116 patients evaluated between 2000 and 2018 received reirradiation for HGG (99 WHO grade IV, 17 WHO grade III). Median time to first progression after initial therapy was 10.6 months. Salvage therapies before reirradiation included surgery (31%) and systemic therapy (41%). Sixty-five patients (56%) received single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) as reirradiation. The median biologically effective dose (BED) was 47.25 Gy, and the median planning target volume (PTV) was 4.8 cc for SRS and 95.0 cc for non-SRS treatments. Systemic therapy was given concurrently to 52% and adjuvantly to 74% of patients. Result(s): Median FFP was 4.9 months, and median OS was 11.0 months. Significant multivariable prognostic factors for FFP were performance status, time to initial progression, and BED; for OS they were age, time to initial progression, and PTV volume at recurrence. High-grade toxicity was correlated to PTV size at recurrence. Three-level prognostic scores were generated for FFP and OS, with cross-validated receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) of 0.640 and 0.687, respectively. Conclusion(s): Clinical variables at the time of reirradiation for HGG can be used to prognosticate FFP and OS.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.",Excluded
2218,"Could four-dimensional contrast-enhanced ultrasound replace computed tomography angiography during follow up of fenestrated endografts? Results of a preliminary experience OBJECTIVE: To evaluate four-dimensional contrast-enhanced ultrasound (4D-CEUS) as an alternative imaging method to computed tomography angiography (CTA) during follow up of fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR) for juxta- and para-renal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA)., METHODS: Between October 2011 and March 2012, all consecutive patients who underwent FEVAR follow up were included in the study and evaluated with both 4D-CEUS and CTA. The interval between the two examinations was always <= 30 days. Endpoints were the comparison of postoperative AAA diameter, AAA volume, presence of endoleaks, revascularized visceral vessel (RVV) visualization, and patency. Comparative analysis was performed using Bland-Altman plots and McNemar's Chi-square test., RESULTS: Twenty-two patients (96% male, 4% female; mean age 74 +/- 7 years; American Society of Anesthesiologists grade III/IV 82%/18%) were enrolled. Seventy-eight RVV (fenestrations: 60; scallops: 17; branches: 1) were analyzed. The mean AAA diameter evaluated by 4D-CEUS and CTA was 45 +/- 10 mm (range 30-69 mm) and 48 +/- 9 mm (range 32-70 mm), respectively. The mean difference was 3 +/- 3 mm. The mean AAA volume evaluated by 4D-CEUS and CTA was 150 +/- 7 cc (range 88-300 cc) and 159 +/- 68 cc (range 80-310 cc), respectively. The mean difference was 7 +/- 4 cc; a Bland-Altman plot revealed agreement in AAA diameter and volume evaluation (p < .01) between 4D-CEUS and CTA. The observed agreement for the detection of endoleaks was 95%. McNemar's Chi-square test confirmed that 4D-CEUS and CTA were equivalent (p > .05) at detecting endoleaks. The first segment of six (8%) RVVs (four renal and two superior mesenteric arteries) was not directly visualized by 4D-CEUS owing to obesity, but the contrast enhancement into the distal part of vessel or into the relative parenchyma gave indirect information about their patency. McNemar's Chi-square test demonstrated the superiority of CTA (p = .031) in visualizing RVVs. The patency of 77/78 RVVs was confirmed with both techniques. McNemar's Chi-square test confirmed that 4D-CEUS and CTA were equivalent in their ability to detect visceral vessel patency., CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that 4D-CEUS is as accurate as CTA in the evaluation of postoperative AAA diameter and volume, endoleak detection, and RVV patency after FEVAR. Four-dimensional CEUS could provide hemodynamic information regarding RVVs, and reduce radiation exposure and renal impairment during follow up. Obesity limits the diagnostic accuracy of 4D-CEUS.

1632,"Lung cancer detection with low-dose spiral computed tomography in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients PURPOSE: To determine whether low-dose spiral computed tomography (LDCT) can improve the lung cancer detection rate in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) subjects., MATERIAL AND METHODS: From October 1999 to December 2003, 374 COPD patients underwent LDCT for lung carcinoma screening. All subjects with an abnormal baseline CT scan were followed with serial CT scans as part of our protocol. Follow-up was continued until the demonstration of no change over a minimum of 24 months, or resolution. Sputum samples were also obtained for cytological analysis., RESULTS: On the baseline spiral CT scan, 132 of 374 patients (35.2%) had at least one non-calcified nodule that required periodic follow-up with CT scans. The median follow-up time was 21 months (range 2-48 months). Of the 374 COPD subjects, nine patients with primary lung cancer (2.4%) were detected: six were squamous cell carcinomas, two were small-cell lung carcinomas (SCLC), and one was adenosquamous carcinoma. Three of the nine tumors were in stage IA, two in stage IIB, two in stage IIIA, and two were limited SCLC. Potentially curative pulmonary resection was performed in four patients, pulmonary lobectomy in three, and wedge excision in one. One subject with stage IA squamous cell carcinoma received radiotherapy, as pulmonary function was severely impaired. In addition, four patients underwent removal of benign lesions. Sputum was collected in 205 (54.8%) of 374 patients. There were 154 (75 %) metaplasia, 14 (6%) moderate dysplasia, and one (0.4%) malignant case., CONCLUSION: LDCT increases early lung carcinoma detection rate in COPD patients, but pulmonary function impairment may reduce its benefit.",Excluded
1790,"Chemoradiation for advanced oral and (pharyngo) laryngeal carcinoma: Single institution outcome analysis Aim. Chemoradiation (CRT) is a valuable treatment option for(pharyngo)laryngeal squamous cell cancer and a palliative cure in advanced oral cancers. However, toxicity is scarcely reported. Therefore, efficacy, acute and toxic effects of chemoradiation for advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinomas were evaluated, using retrospective study. Methods. Previously untreated patients with stage III-IV head and neck squamous cell carcinomas were included. Radiotherapy consisted of 70 Gy/7 weeks/35 fractions. All patients received concurrent Cisplatin 40 mg/m2 weekly. Results. The most common acute toxic effects were dysphagia and mucositis. Dysphagia and xerostomia remained problematic during follow-up. Loco regional disease control was respectively 91% and 98% after 6 months. The median overall survival (calculating starting form the end of the treatment) was 33 months (range 0-111 months). The 5-year disease specific survival was 41%. Conclusion. The results indicated that concurrent chemoradiotherapy for advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is associated with high locoregional control and disease-specific survival. However, significant acute and long-term toxic effects occur, and organ preservation appears not necessarily equivalent to preservation of function in pharyngolaryngeal cancers.",Excluded

This study investigated the absorbed radiation dose in normal tissues for prostate cancer patients in comparison to breast cancer patients for 2 RPs using the monoclonal antibody (MAb) m170. Methods and Materials: 111In-DOTA-glycylglycylglycyl-l-p-isothiocyanatophenylalanine amide (GGGF)-m170 and 111In-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N,N'-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) 2-iminothiolane (2IT)-m170, representing the same MAb and chelate with and without a cleavable linkage, were studied in 13 breast cancer and 26 prostate cancer patients. Dosimetry for 90Y was calculated using 111In MAb pharmacokinetics from the initial imaging study for each patient, using reference man- and patient-specific masses. Result(s): The reference man-specific radiation doses (cGy/MBq) were not significantly different for the breast and the prostate cancer patients for both RPs in all but one tissue-RP combination (liver, DOTA-2IT). The patient-specific doses had differences between the groups most of which can be related to weight differences. Conclusion(s): Similar normal tissue doses were calculated for two groups of patients having different cancers and genders. This similarity combined with continued careful analysis of the imaging data might allow the use of higher starting doses in early phase RIT studies. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

1559,"Protective Effects of Magnesium Sulfate on Radiation Induced Brain Injury in Rats OBJECTIVES: The effect of magnesium sulfate on brain tissue of SD rats irradiated by 6MeV electron was investigated., METHODS: SD rats were divided into three groups: control group, irradiation (IR group) and irradiation treated with magnesium sulfate (IR+M group). After being anesthetized, the whole brains of IR group and IR+M group were exposed to 6 MeV electron radiation. IR+M group was i.p. injected with 10% magnesium sulfate (400 mg/kg) one day before radiation and three days and five days after radiation. And on the 1st, 3rd, 7th and 14th day after radiation, SD rats were euthanatized to take brain tissue for the detection of calcium, redox status and cell apoptosis, as well as the expression of NF-kappaB and ICAM-1., RESULTS: The results indicated that magnesium treatment may alleviate the elevation of calcium and enhance redox status through increasing the activities of superoxide dimutase (SOD) and myeloperodase (MPO), and decreasing the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA). Tunnel and immunohistochemistry assay suggested that treatment with magnesium decreased the apoptosis rate of brain cells and the expressions of caspase-3, respectively. Decline of the expression of NF-kappaB and ICAM-1 protein was observed after the treatment of magnesium., CONCLUSION: All the results demonstrated that magnesium may elicit protective effect against radiationinduced brain injury by reducing calcium overload, improving redox and inhibiting cell apoptosis. Moreover, magnesium significantly down-regulated the protein or mRNA levels of NF-kappaB and ICAM- 1. The findings may provide references for the application of magnesium in clinic for brain injury induced by radiation.

1666,"Stage i Lung SBRT Clinical Practice Patterns Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has become increasingly utilized over the last decade in the treatment of inoperable stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, although no standardized dosing guidelines exist. In this retrospective study, we investigated the dose prescription pattern use in the United States for patients receiving SBRT. Method(s): Patients with stage I NSCLC treated with SBRT between 2004 and 2011 were identified within the National Cancer Database (NCDB). Trends in SBRT use and dose prescriptions were analyzed. Result(s): A total of 5246 patients met criteria as receiving SBRT. The overall mean and median BED 10 were 134.5 and 132 Gy, respectively. Of these patients, 94.5% were prescribed a regimen with a BED 10 >=100 Gy. The most common prescriptions overall were 60 Gy in 3 fractions (24.1%), 48 Gy in 4 fractions (17.8%), 50 Gy in 5 fractions (13.0%), and 54 Gy in 3 fractions (12.8%). Analysis of prescription trends revealed decreased utilization of 54 to 60 Gy in 3 fractions (47.9% in 2006 to 27.9% in 2011, combined) and increased utilization of 50 Gy in 5 fractions (3.1% in 2006 to 20.4% in 2011). Conclusion(s): Our findings suggest increasing use of SBRT over the last decade with a majority of patients being treated with regimens employing a BED 10 >=100 Gy. Since 2006, there has been a decline in the use of 54 to 60 Gy in 3 fractions, with an increase in the use of 50 Gy in 5 fractions. Possible explanations include concern for increased toxicity with higher BED regimens and increasing treatment of centrally located tumors.Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",Excluded

OBJECTIVES: Pre-pectoral breast reconstruction is a less invasive technique compared to dual plane technique and shows promise in improving patient outcomes. This study compares hospital length of stay (LOS) and post-operative outcomes of pre-pectoral (PP) and dual plane (DP) techniques of breast reconstruction. METHOD(S): This single-site, retrospective cohort study included data from breast reconstruction procedures from June 2013 to March 2016. Data collected included demographics, chemotherapy/radiation exposure, surgical technique, LOS, drain usage, post-operative incision care and 90 day post-operative complications. Two-sided T-test and Chi-square or Fisher's Exact tests were performed at alpha = 0.05. RESULT(S): The study included data on 176 patients (DP=117, PP=59) and 335 breasts (DP=225, PP=110). The PP group had a higher BMI (29.5 vs. 26.3 kg/m2; p=0.0017), and a significantly higher proportion of patients with diabetes (13.6% vs. 2.6%; p=0.0073), hypertension (35.6% vs. 17.1%; p=0.0061), and prior breast surgery (36.8% vs. 22.2%; p=0.0415). A higher proportion of PP patients received ciNPT (57.6% vs. 25.6%; p< 0.0001) compared to the DP group. There were no differences in complication rates between the two groups. The PP group had a significantly lower LOS compared to DP (mean: 1.1 vs. 1.8 days, p< 0.0001). Nearly 95% of PP patients were discharged after 1 hospital day compared to only 25.6% of the DP patients (p< 0.0001). Results of multiple regression models were similar to the univariate analyses after controlling for effects of age, BMI, ciNPT use, diabetes, hypertension and prior breast surgery. CONCLUSION(S): This study demonstrated a significantly lower hospital LOS in the PP group compared to DP technique. Complication rates were similar between the two groups even though the PP group was more complex. Studies with a long-term follow up will be critical in understanding the true differences between surgical technique and clinical outcomes.",Excluded
2300,"Pulmonary emphysema: radiation dose and section thickness at multidetector CT quantification--comparison with macroscopic and microscopic morphometry PURPOSE: To prospectively investigate the effects of radiation dose and section thickness on quantitative multidetector computed tomographic (CT) indexes of pulmonary emphysema., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The institutional review board approved this protocol. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Seventy patients (49 men, 21 women; age range, 38-79 years) referred for surgical resection of a lung tumor underwent multidetector CT with 4 x 1-mm collimation, 120 kVp, and 20 and 120 effective mAs. At each radiation dose, 1.25-, 5.0-, and 10.0-mm-thick sections were reconstructed at 10-mm intervals. From scans of the lobe or whole lung to be resected, relative areas (RAs) of lung with attenuation coefficients lower than nine thresholds and eight percentiles of the distribution of attenuation coefficients were compared with the histopathologic extent of emphysema, which was measured microscopically--by using the corrected mean interwall distance (MIWD) and the corrected mean perimeter (MP)--and macroscopically. Correlations between the data obtained by using attenuation thresholds and percentiles and the parameters macroscopic extent of emphysema, MIWD, and MP were investigated by using Spearman coefficients., RESULTS: The 1st percentile (r range, -0.394 to -0.675; P < .001) and attenuation coefficients of -980, -970, and -960 HU (r range, 0.478-0.664; P < .001) yielded the strongest correlations with macroscopic extent, MIWD, and MP, regardless of radiation dose or section thickness. The effects of radiation dose and section thickness on RAs of lung with attenuation coefficients lower than -960 HU (P = .007 and P < .001, respectively) and lower than -970 HU (P = .001 and P < .001, respectively) were significant. The effect of section thickness on the 1st percentile was significant (P < .001), whereas the effect of dose was not (P = .910)., CONCLUSION: At CT quantification of pulmonary emphysema, the tube current-time product can be reduced to 20 mAs, but both tube current-time product and section thickness should be kept constant in follow-up examinations.",Excluded
1891,"The role of age, sex and steroid sex hormones in radiation cataractogenesis It is critical to identify and gain a better understanding of the factors that enhance or reduce the risk of cataractogenesis, to minimize the possibility of occurrence after deliberate (e.g., radiation therapy, interplanetary travel) or unintentional exposure to ionizing radiation. Both gender and age at the time of exposure have been established as key determinants of cataractogenesis induced by sparsely ionizing (low-LET) and densely ionizing (high-LET) radiation. However, animal data from several older studies are often conflicting and somewhat difficult to interpret, in that the experiments suffered from small group sizes, limited dose ranges or short periods of observation, and human data are sparse or statistical significance is sometimes limited. Steroid sex hormones (SSH) may underlie age and gender-based differences in the progression and prevalence of cataracts that otherwise occur spontaneously in humans and animal models, and may also underlie age and sex-related differences in radiation cataractogenesis. Here, we review data that have aided in our understanding of the role of age, sex and steroid sex hormones in radiation cataractogenesis. © 2013 by Radiation Research Society.",Excluded

This retrospective study evaluated the clinical value of simultaneously acquired (99m)Tc-sestamibi SPECT/CT versus conventional SPECT in diagnosing and locating parathyroid adenomas or hyperplasia in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. METHOD(S): Immediately and 60 minutes after intravenous administration of 740-925 MBq of (99m)Tc-sestamibi, static planar images of the neck and chest were obtained. SPECT/CT images were acquired 30 minutes after injection. Two experienced masked readers independently evaluated whether conventional SPECT images provided information beyond what was available from the planar images either by changing the diagnosis or by better locating the glands and whether the SPECT/CT images provided information beyond what was available from the planar plus conventional SPECT images. Forty-eight consecutive patients with a clinical diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism were included in the study. The 32 whose scans showed positive results underwent surgical resection and were examined histopathologically. RESULT(S): Planar and SPECT imaging, with or without CT fusion, identified 89% of the surgically confirmed diseased parathyroid glands. Use of SPECT/CT changed the diagnosis in only 1 patient (2%) from positive to negative and better located the glands in only 4 patients (8%). SPECT/CT was particularly helpful in locating the 2 ectopic parathyroid adenomas diagnosed in this cohort. Tracer retention in diseased glands did not correlate with histologic characteristics. Also, biochemical markers did not correlate with the scan findings. CONCLUSION(S): SPECT/CT has no significant clinical value additional to that of conventional SPECT for parathyroid imaging except in locating ectopic parathyroid glands.

1374,"CT follow-up in patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs): combined radiation and contrast dose reduction Background Frequent computed tomography (CT) follow-ups involve significant radiation related risks for patients with low-grade neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Contrast agent (CA) application is essential for diagnostic evidence and has additional risks especially in patients with limited renal function. Purpose To investigate if a combination of dose and contrast agent (CA) reduction affects image quality and diagnostic evidence in neuroendocrine tumor (NET) patients. Material and Methods A total of 51 NET patients were enrolled in the study and 153 CT scans were analyzed. Patients underwent a baseline CT scan (A = 120 kVp, filtered back projection [FBP]) and two follow-up CTs (B = 120 kVp, adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction [ASIR] 40%; C1 = 100 kVp, ASIR 40%; C2 = 100 kVp, ASIR 60%; the latter two protocols were applied with a 30% reduction in CA volume). We evaluated image quality and applied dose. Results In C1/2, the combination of low kV (100 kVp) with ASIR 40%/60% reduced the mean applied dose significantly by 28% compared to B and by 57% compared to A. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) of tumor to liver/muscle were significantly increased by using C1/2 compared to B and A. With respect to subjective image quality, a slight loss of diagnostic confidence in C1 could be counterbalanced by the higher ASIR blending in C2. Conclusion Combined dose reduction techniques can be used to reduce radiation dose and CA volume without sacrificing image quality and diagnostic confidence in staging CT of NET patients.",Excluded

However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that underlie these features. We investigated the hypothesis that the mechanism of wrinkle formation may involve loss of anchoring fibrils, composed mainly of collagen VII, which are important in maintaining dermal-epidermal junction integrity. Ten volunteers with moderate to severe photodamage of dorsal forearm skin were recruited to the study. Using immunohistochemistry, transmission electron microscopy and in situ hybridization, we compared collagen VII protein and mRNA content of photodamaged forearm skin with that of sun-protected hip and upper inner arm skin from the same subjects. Numbers of anchoring fibrils per linear microns of basement membrane (mean +/- SEM) were significantly lower in photodamaged skin (1.79 +/- 0.10) as compared with sun-protected hip (2.28 +/- 0.11) and upper inner arm skin (2.21 +/- 0.10) (P < 0.01), and similarly keratinocyte expression of collagen VII mRNA, quantitated as number of positively stained keratinocytes per high power field, was significantly reduced in photodamaged skin (6.3 +/- 2.5) as compared with sun-protected hip (20.0 +/- 5.6) and upper inner arm skin (17.7 +/- 4.9) (P < 0.001). Semiquantitative assessment of immunohistochemical staining for collagen VII showed a non-significant reduction in photodamaged skin as compared with sun-protected skin. We propose that reduced content of collagen VII in photodamaged skin contributes to wrinkle formation by weakening the bond between the dermis and epidermis.",Excluded
1383,"Informatics in radiology: use of a C-arm fluoroscopy simulator to support training in intraoperative radiography Mobile image intensifier systems (C-arms) are used frequently in orthopedic and reconstructive surgery, especially in trauma and emergency settings, but image quality and radiation exposure levels may vary widely, depending on the extent of the C-arm operator's knowledge and experience. Current training programs consist mainly of theoretical instruction in C-arm operation, the physical foundations of radiography, and radiation avoidance, and are largely lacking in hands-on application. A computer-based simulation program such as that tested by the authors may be one way to improve the effectiveness of C-arm training. In computer simulations of various scenarios commonly encountered in the operating room, trainees using the virtX program interact with three-dimensional models to test their knowledge base and improve their skill levels. Radiographs showing the simulated patient anatomy and surgical implants are ""reconstructed"" from data computed on the basis of the trainee's positioning of models of a C-arm, patient, and table, and are displayed in real time on the desktop monitor. Trainee performance is signaled in real time by color graphics in several control panels and, on completion of the exercise, is compared in detail with the performance of an expert operator. Testing of this computer-based training program in continuing medical education courses for operating room personnel showed an improvement in the overall understanding of underlying principles of intraoperative radiography performed with a C-arm, with resultant higher image quality, lower overall radiation exposure, and greater time efficiency.

1818,"Parotid gland function after radiotherapy: The combined Michigan and Utrecht experience Purpose: To analyze the combined and updated results from the University of Michigan and University Medical Center Utrecht on normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) of the parotid gland 1 year after radiotherapy (RT) for head-and-neck (HN) cancer. Patients and Methods: A total of 222 prospectively analyzed patients with various HN malignancies were treated with conventional and intensity-modulated RT. Stimulated individual parotid gland flow rates were measured before RT and 1 year after RT using Lashley cups at both centers. A flow ratio <25% of pretreatment was defined as a complication. The data were fitted to the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman model. Result(s): A total of 384 parotid glands (Michigan: 157; Utrecht: 227 glands) was available for analysis 1 year after RT. Combined NTCP analysis based on mean dose resulted in a TD50 (uniform dose leading to 50% complication probability) of 39.9 Gy and m (steepness of the curve) of 0.40. The resulting NTCP curve had good qualitative agreement with the combined clinical data. Mean doses of 25-30 Gy were associated with 17-26% NTCP. Conclusion(s): A definite NTCP curve for parotid gland function 1 year after RT is presented, based on mean dose. No threshold dose was observed, and TD50 was equal to 40 Gy.

1937,"Gamma irradiation. An effective procedure for bone banks, but does it make sense from an osteobiological perspective? BACKGROUND: Bone grafts promote bone healing by supplying a three-dimensional structure that supports bone ingrowth. Autologous bone therefore still remains the ""gold standard"" for grafts. Unfortunately, autologous bone grafts are associated with an increased morbidity. In order to avoid such problems, intensive research has been carried out on alternative materials such as allogeneic bone. However, its use is dependent on bone banks and its availability is limited. Gamma irradiation is now becoming established as a procedure for inactivating bacteria, fungal spores and viruses. Its effects on the biomechanical properties of bone have been analyzed in numerous studies. However, the current literature provides little information as to the effects of gamma sterilization on the osteobiology of allogeneic bone grafts., PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of gamma-sterilized bone grafts on immunocompetent cells by an in vitro model (a culture of human bone marrow cells)., METHODS: We decided to use the model of human bone marrow cells in culture for the in vitro analysis because the physiological conditions in the human body can best be simulated in this model and the observed reactions are applicable to humans., RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION: In sum, we found a maximum immune response in gamma-irradiated bone grafts, which, interpreted as a sole result, must be seen as a negative biological effect. However, in view of the good clinical results for gamma-sterilized bone grafts other influences would seem to be the determining factors in clinical outcome. Further research is needed to gain a more exact understanding of these factors.",Included
2273,"Three- Versus Five-Fraction Regimens of Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Peripheral Early-Stage Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer: A Two-Institution Propensity Score-Matched Analysis We compared the outcomes of 3- versus 5-fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy regimens for early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer. Analysis was performed on 192 eligible lesions and a propensity score-matched 94 lesion subgroup. There were no statistically significant differences in outcomes between regimens, and both regimens are reasonable treatment options. Purpose(s): To evaluate differences in outcomes of early-stage peripheral non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with either 3- or 5-fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) at 2 institutions. Patients and Methods: Patients diagnosed with peripherally located early-stage NSCLC who received either a median dose of 60 Gy (interquartile range [IQR], 60-60, biologically effective dose, 151-151) in 3 fractions or a median dose of 50 Gy (IQR, 50-50, biologically effective dose, 94-94) in 5 fractions were included in this study. All data were retrospectively collected and reviewed in an institutional review board-approved database. Result(s): A total of 192 lesions in 192 patients were identified: 94 received 3-fraction SBRT and 98 received 5-fraction SBRT. Patients in the 5-fraction cohort had significantly smaller tumors (P =.0021). Larger tumor size was associated with worse overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.40, P =.0013) for all patients. A single grade 3 toxicity was reported in each cohort. A propensity score-matched cohort of 94 patients was constructed with a median follow-up of 29.3 months (IQR, 17.3-44.6) for the 3-fraction cohort and 31.0 months (IQR, 17.0-48.5) for the 5-fraction cohort (P =.84). There were no statistically significant differences between these 2 cohorts in overall survival (P =.33), progression-free survival (P =.40), local failure (P =.86), and nodal or distant failure (P =.57) at 2 years. Conclusion(s): The 3- and 5-fraction SBRT regimens for early-stage peripheral NSCLC had comparable clinical outcomes. Both regimens were well tolerated. A large tumor size was an adverse prognostic factor for worse survival.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
2043,"Effects of dual-energy CT with non-linear blending on abdominal CT angiography Objective: To determine whether non-linear blending technique for arterial-phase dual-energy abdominal CT angiography (CTA) could improve image quality compared to the linear blending technique and conventional 120 kVp imaging. Material(s) and Method(s): This study included 118 patients who had accepted dual-energy abdominal CTA in the arterial phase. They were assigned to Sn140/80 kVp protocol (protocol A, n = 40) if body mass index (BMI) < 25 or Sn140/100 kVp protocol (protocol B, n = 41) if BMI >= 25. Non-linear blending images and linear blending images with a weighting factor of 0.5 in each protocol were generated and compared with the conventional 120 kVp images (protocol C, n = 37). The abdominal vascular enhancements, image noise, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and radiation dose were assessed. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance test, independent t test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Kruskal-Wallis test. Result(s): Mean vascular attenuation, CNR, SNR and subjective image quality score for the non-linear blending images in each protocol were all higher compared to the corresponding linear blending images and 120 kVp images (p values ranging from < 0.001 to 0.007) except for when compared to non-linear blending images for protocol B and 120 kVp images in CNR and SNR. No significant differences were found in image noise among the three kinds of images and the same kind of images in different protocols, but the lowest radiation dose was shown in protocol A. Conclusion(s): Non-linear blending technique of dual-energy CT can improve the image quality of arterial-phase abdominal CTA, especially with the Sn140/80 kVp scanning.",Excluded
2423,"Sucralfate in the prevention of treatment-induced diarrhea in patients receiving pelvic radiation therapy: A North Central Cancer Treatment Group Phase III Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trial Purpose: Randomized studies have suggested that sucralfate is effective in mitigating diarrhea during pelvic radiation therapy (RT). This North Central Cancer Treatment Group study was undertaken to confirm the antidiarrheal effect of sucralfate. Several other measures of bowel function were also assessed. Patients and Methods: Patients receiving pelvic RT to a minimum of 45 Gy at 1.7 to 2.1 Gy/d were eligible for the study. Patients were assigned randomly, in double-blind fashion, to receive sucralfate (1.5 g orally every 6 hours) or an identical looking placebo during pelvic RT. Result(s): One hundred twenty-three patients were randomly assigned and found assessable. Overall, there was no significant difference in patient characteristics between those receiving sucralfate and those receiving placebo. Moderate or worse diarrhea was observed in 53% of patients receiving sucralfate versus 41% of those receiving placebo. Compared with patients receiving placebo, more sucralfate-treated patients reported fecal incontinence (16% v 34%, respectively; P = .04) and need for protective clothing (8% v 23%, respectively; P = .04). The incidence and severity of nausea were worse among those taking sucralfate (P = .03). Analysis of patient-reported symptoms 10 to 12 months after RT showed a nonsignificant trend toward more problems in patients taking sucralfate than in those taking placebo (average, 2.3 v 1.9 problems, respectively; P = .34). Conclusion(s): Sucralfate did not decrease pelvic RT-related bowel toxicity by any of the end points measured and seems to have aggravated some gastrointestinal symptoms.

2467,"Low-dose MDCT for surveillance of patients with severe homogeneous emphysema after bronchoscopic airway bypass OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of low-dose MDCT for radiologic monitoring of patients who have undergone placement of bronchial stents for airway bypass., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In a prospective study, seven patients underwent MDCT according to a low-dose protocol (40 mAs, 120 kVp) before and after stent placement. The positions of the stents in the segmental bronchi were analyzed and compared with the bronchoscopic findings, which were reference standard. Patency versus lack of patency of stents was classified with five levels of confidence, and a definitive diagnosis was assigned to each stent. Prediction of stent dislodgment, follow-up findings, and complications occurring during the observation period were recorded. Consensus reading was performed by two radiologists. Statistical analysis was conducted by receiver operating characteristic analysis or four-field table., RESULTS: Seven patients underwent implantation of 37 stents (mean, 5 +/- 2 [SD] stents per patient; range, 2-8 stents). The area under the curve for differentiating patent from occluded stents was 0.995 with resulting sensitivity and specificity of 86.5% and 98.1%. The correct diagnosis of patency was established with MDCT for all but one stent (sensitivity, 94.7%; specificity, 100%). Sensitivity and specificity for prediction of dislodgment were 80% and 91%. Five stents were not identified during inspection bronchoscopy but were found in a regular position at MDCT. Three instances of minor bleeding and one of pneumothorax resolved spontaneously. The mean effective dose of the scan was 1.3 +/- 0.6 mSv., CONCLUSION: Low-dose MDCT is feasible for radiologic monitoring after airway bypass procedure.",Excluded
1414,"Three previously healthy persons with a stress fracture A 42-year-old man presented with a one-month history of pain in his left knee, due to a fracture of the left medial tibia plateau, following a footrace. A 24-year-old man, also a jogger, had had increasing pain in his right lower leg for 4 months, which turned out to be due to a fracture of the posteromedial border of the tibia at the insertion of the flexor digitorum longus muscle. A 35-year-old woman presented with pain in her left foot and ankle that was due to a march fracture of the second metatarsal bone after over 5 hours of intermittent use of the clutch in a traffic jam. In all 3 patients, temporary cessation of the causative activity was sufficient for complete recovery after 3 months. Stress fractures are easily missed on X-rays. Treatment is conservative and consists of the elimination of causative factors to allow adequate healing. In selected cases, a splint or brace may be indicated. Furthermore, certain high risk and displaced fractures should be considered for surgical fixation. Return to the causative activity should be gradual with attention being paid to other potential risk factors.",Excluded
1741,"Short-term Automated Quantification of Radiologic Changes in the Characterization of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Versus Nonspecific Interstitial Pneumonia and Prediction of Long-term Survival Purpose: Fibrotic interstitial lung diseases presenting with nonspecific and overlapping radiologic findings may be difficult to diagnose without surgical biopsy. We hypothesized that baseline quantifiable radiologic features and their short-term interval change may be predictive of underlying histologic diagnosis as well as long-term survival in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) presenting without honeycombing versus nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP). Material(s) and Method(s): Forty biopsy-confirmed IPF and 20 biopsy-confirmed NSIP patients with available high-resolution chest computed tomography 4 to 24 months apart were studied. CALIPER software was used for the automated characterization and quantification of radiologic findings. Result(s): IPF subjects were older (66 vs. 48; P<0.0001) with lower diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide and higher volumes of baseline reticulation (193 vs. 83 mL; P<0.0001). Over the interval period, compared with NSIP, IPF patients experienced greater functional decline (forced vital capacity, -6.3% vs. -1.7%; P=0.02) and radiologic progression, as noted by greater increase in reticulation volume (24 vs. 1.74 mL; P=0.048), and decrease in normal (-220 vs. -37.7 mL; P=0.045) and total lung volumes (-198 vs. 58.1 mL; P=0.03). Older age, male gender, higher reticulation volumes at baseline, and greater interval decrease in normal lung volumes were predictive of IPF. Both baseline and short-term changes in quantitative radiologic findings were predictive of mortality. Conclusion(s): Baseline quantitative radiologic findings and assessment of short-term disease progression may help characterize underlying IPF versus NSIP in those with difficult to differentiate clinicoradiologic presentations. Our study supports the possible utility of assessing serial quantifiable high-resolution chest computed tomographic findings for disease differentiation in these 2 entities.Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Method(s): From August 2002 to April 2005, 400 patients with stage III or stage IVa nasopharyngeal carcinoma were recruited for a randomised clinical trial of induction chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Pretreatment serum lipid concentrations were examined in 342 patients. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to investigate the association of serum lipid levels with different treatment outcomes. Result(s): The 5-year failure-free survival rate for the low- high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and high-HDL-C groups was 52.1% and 65.5%, respectively (p=0.017), and the 5-year overall survival rate was 64.7% and 72.5%, respectively (p=0.094). The pretreatment serum level of HDL-C was a favourable prognostic factor of overall survival and failure-free survival in a Cox regression model with HR 0.65 (95% CI 0.43-0.97; p=0.036) and 0.60 (95% CI 0.41-0.88; p =0.008). No significant correlation was observed between the prognosis of patients with NPC and serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).

2070,"Dysfunctional Lens Index Serves as a Novel Surgery Decision-Maker for Age-Related Nuclear Cataracts Purpose: To study the correlations between subjective and objective cataract metrics with dysfunctional lens index. To investigate the potential of the DLI as a novel surgery decision-maker. Methods: In this prospective, cross-sectional study, we measured the dysfunctional lens index (DLI), Lens Opacities Classification System III nuclear opalescence (LOCS III NO) grading, preoperative corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), objective scatter index (OSI) and Scheimpflug-based average lens density (ALD) in eyes with nuclear cataract. Eyes were classified as Surgical and Non-Surgical groups. Correlations among the DLI, OSI, ALD, LOCS III NO grading, and preoperative CDVA were analyzed. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed for DLI, OSI, and CDVA to determine optimal cut-off values to separate between surgical and non-surgical cataracts. Results: The DLI showed the strongest correlation with the OSI (r= -0.712, P< .001), followed by LOCS III NO score (r= -0.661, P< .001), ALD (r= -0.596, P< .001) and preoperative CDVA (r= 0.563, P< .001). The area under ROC curves (AUCs) of the DLI, OSI and preoperative CDVA curve were 0.972, 0.912 and 0.844 (All P< .001), respectively.

2296,"Atypical radiation toxicity in patients with classical Kaposi's sarcoma The classical (non-AIDS-related) form of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) typically affects older patients of Eastern European or Mediterranean ethnic background. Although radiotherapy is a standard part of the treatment armamentarium for KS patients, a high incidence of radiotoxicity has been reported in epidemic AIDS-related cases. In order to determine whether this radiotoxicity is observed only in patients with the epidemic form of the disease, we have conducted a retrospective chart review of 30 patients with classical KS treated with radiation for whom follow-up information was available. Seven out of 30 (23%) were found to have unexpectedly high levels of radiotoxicity after tumor doses of 22-42 Gy. This toxicity consisted either of significantly increased edema or chronic skin breakdown and severe radiodermatitis, in some cases requiring multiple surgical corrective procedures. We suggest that the abnormal lymphaticovenous development and chronic lymphokine stimulation associated with KS of both epidemic and classical forms may be responsible in part for the observed radiotoxicity.",Excluded

The main aim of treatment for majority of patients remains palliation of dysphagia, which can be effectively done by intraluminal brachytherapy with or without external radiotherapy. Between January 2006 to January 2010 a total of 35 patients with advanced/metastatic (24/35) or recurrent (11/35) oesophageal carcinoma were treated with intraluminalhigh dose rate (HDR) iridium192 source brachytherapy at Medical College Hospitals, Kolkata. Selection for palliative brachytherapy includes one or more of the following criteria: Lesion more than 5 cm long on imaging studies or upper GI endoscopy, Karnofsky performance status <50%, Locoregional recurrence. Palliative external radiotherapy (20Gy/5# or 30 Gy/10#) was given to 11 patients (31.42%) before brachytherapy. All patients treated with 2 fractions of high dose rate-intraluminal brachytherapy (HDRILRT) one week apart with 600 cGy per fraction at 1 cm off axis. Thirty-five patients were treated with palliative HDR-ILRT. Significant improvement in swallowing status was seen in 20 patients (57.14%) since just after treatment up to 7.5 months. However, 9 patients (25.71%) showed no improvement, and 6 patients (17.14%) showed no changes in dysphagia scoring. Only 3 patients developed ulceration and 2 developed fistula immediately after treatment and 5 patients developed stricture. Median dysphagiafree survival was 6 months. Median overall survival was 8 months. It is concluded that intraluminal brachytherapy is an effective method for palliation of dysphagia for reasonably prolonged period.",Excluded

Focusing on the feasibility and prognosis of radiotherapy as an adjuvant or palliative treatment for osseous CE, this study investigated the outcome of Meriones meridianus with osseous CE after radiotherapy., Methods: The study utilized a comparison control group design with three groups of gerbils, and 240 osseous CE gerbils were randomly divided into control, 40Gy/5times, and 50Gy/5times groups. Different doses of radiotherapy were given to the gerbils, and then, the effects of radiotherapy on gerbils and lesions were observed at 3 and 6 months after radiotherapy. Statistical analysis was done using chi 2 test, unpaired t-test, and one-way ANOVA., Results: Significant changes (P < 0.05) were achieved between the three groups in terms of seven parameters at 3 and 6 months, including the number of dead gerbils and lesion sites with ulceration and infection, number of dead scolices, protein content, Ca2+ concentration, the maximum diameter of lesion site, and wet weight of cysts. Except for the number of dead gerbils and lesion sites with ulceration and infection, all other parameters were observed a big difference between 3 months and 6 months in the 50Gy/5times group., Conclusion: Radiotherapy at a dose of 50 Gy has inhibitory and therapeutic effects on osseous CE in gerbils, and radiotherapy could probably be a treatment option for persistent or recurrent osseous CE.

1615,"Calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition in a cohort of 52 patients with Gitelman Syndrome Background: Gitelman syndrome (GS) is a rare recessively inherited tubulop-athy, caused by inactive mutations in SLC12A3 gene encoding the thiazide-sensi-tive-sodium-chloride transporter. It is characterized by an hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis with hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria. Calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal deposition is frequently described in GS case-reports but its prevalence and clinical phenotype are unknown. Objective(s): The aim is to describe clinical, biological and radiological features of CPP in a cohort of patients with genetically proven GS. Method(s): All patients (pts) with genetically proven GS in the French national reference center of rare diseases were proposed to have a consultation with a senior rheumatologist. Demographic data, history of joint pain and flare and biology disorders were recorded. Other causes of CPP disease were systematically ruled out. CPP crystal deposition was assessed by X-rays (all peripheral joints and cervical spine) and ultrasonography (US) (wrist, knee, ankle joints and symptomatic joints). Patients with history of cervical pain underwent computed tomography (CT) of the full cervical spine from occipital bone to C1-T1 disk, including temporomandibular joints. Result(s): Fifty-two GS pts (21 men, mean age 46.5+/- 12.2 years) have been examined by a rheumatologist. Almost all patients had an heterozygous mutation on SLC12A3 gene. Forty-four pts experienced joint pain (84.6%), 23 joint flares (44,2%) and 25 cervical pain (48.1%). X-rays were performed in 42 pts, US in 38 and CT in 23. CPP depositions were observed in 36 (85.7%), 27 (71.1%) and 15 pts (65.2%) by X-rays, US and CT, respectively. All techniques combined, chondrocalcinosis was discovered in 42 patients. Deposits occurred in knees (n=32), wrists (n=29), cervical spine (n=23), ankles and feet (n=22) and shoulders (n=16). CPP depositions were widespread involving at least 3 joints in 27 (55.1%) pts. In knees, CPP depositions involved menisci (n=24), hyaline cartilages (n=16) and ligament or joint capsule (n=15). Cervical spine CT demonstrated CPP deposition in vertebral discs (n=17), transverse ligament (n=13), other ligament (n=13), vertebral facets (n=3) and temporo-mandibular joints (n=5). Patients with CPP crystal deposition in more than 3 joints were significantly older (52.8+/-10.5 years) than patients with 2 or 3 affected joints (40.8+/-11.6 years, p=0.02) or patients without any affected joint (36.6+/-8.1 years, p=0.001). They were also more symptomatic with significantly more joint flares (p<0.0001). Mag-nesemia was inversely correlated with the number of affected joints: patients with >3 or 2-3 affected joints had a significantly lower magnesemia (0.57+/-0.1 and 0.59 +/-0.1 mM, respectively) than patients with only 1 affected joint (0.83+/-0.1 mM).

Twelve dogs were enrolled, according to stage, in two groups: group 1, TCC confined to the urinary tract; group 2, TCC with metastasis. The planning target volume dose was tailored from 36 to 42 Gy in 6 fractions. All dogs were prescribed piroxicam and radiosensitizing carboplatin, and six received chemotherapy after radiotherapy. Serial follow-ups with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were performed. Disease control and toxicity effects were evaluated according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors and Veterinary Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria. The treatment was well tolerated, and no high-grade side effects were reported. The median overall survival times for groups 1 and 2 were 1,230 and 150 days, respectively. A considerable percentage of patients in group1 (50%) were still alive at the time of writing this paper, and a longer follow-up could enable a more accurate survival analysis. This preliminary analysis shows that VMAT applied to the WPRT with MLSIB is an effective and safe option for dogs with lower urinary TCC, although the presence of metastases worsens the prognosis.Copyright © 2021 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.",Excluded
1558,"Validation of a Dose Assessment Method to be Used in 18F FDG Loose Contamination Exercises ABSTRACT: Radiological emergency response may require responders to operate in contaminated environments. To provide more realistic training to these individuals, it has been proposed to disperse low amounts of short-lived radioactive material in simulated emergency scenarios. To demonstrate the applicability and safety of such activities, a limited exercise was conducted where 18F was sprayed in a small area and survey activities were executed. A pre-job external radiation exposure dose assessment was performed in preparation for this training. The research presented here compares participant external recorded doses to assessment results in order to validate the dose estimates. Two individuals were used during the dispersion, search, and survey activities. First, a radiation worker mixed 200 MBq Fludeoxyglucose 18F with 470 mL H2O in a weed sprayer and distributed it over a 3 m x 3 m area. After evaporation, an exercise participant performed search and survey activities in the area. Actual whole-body doses measured with optically stimulated luminescence dosimeters were 10 +/- 1 muSv for both personnel. Whole-body digital dosimeters read 4.3 +/- 0.2 muSv and 3.3 +/- 0.5 muSv for the radiation worker and exercise participant, respectively. Actual extremity doses were below the dosimeters' minimum detectable limits for the radiation worker (thermoluminescence dosimeter) and exercise participant (optically stimulated luminescence dosimeter). The dose assessment-predicted whole-body doses were 2.8 +/- 0.4 muSv and 3.2 +/- 0.1 muSv for the radiation worker and exercise participant, respectively. The estimated dose to the radiation worker's hand was 21.8 +/- 3.8 muSv, and the estimated dose to the exercise participant's knee was 13.4 +/- 0.6 muSv. The study provided substantial evidence for the validity of the dose assessment method, supporting its use for a larger training exercise.Copyright © 2021 Health Physics Society.",Excluded

We assessed the presence of: mucositis, xerostomia, dysgeusia, dysphagia, pain, trismus and, in the case of late-onset complications, radiation cavities., RESULTS: Acute toxicity: in 20 patients, 18 reported mucositis, 19 xerostomia, 17, dysgeusia, 15 dysphagia, 18 had pain and 3 patients had trismus. Tardive toxicity: in 14 patients, 5 reported mucositis, 11 xerostomia, 6 dysgeusia, 2 dysphagia, 3 had pain, 4 trismus and in 4 patients were found radiation cavities., CONCLUSION: Acute complications with higher prevalence were xerostomia (19 of 20 patients), dysgeusia of 2nd grade (11 patients of 20), mucositis of 1st grade and pain of 1st grade (10 patients of 20). Among the late complications it was noted a maintenance of the high prevalence of xerostomia (11 patients of 14) and an increase in prevalence of trismus (4 patients of 14) against a reduction of all other complications. The presence of radiation cavities in 4 patients of 14 was also recorded.",Excluded
1734,"Astronaut EVA exposure estimates from CAD model spacesuit geometry Ongoing assembly and maintenance activities at the International Space Station (ISS) require much more extravehicular activity (EVA) than did the earlier U.S. Space Shuttle missions. It is thus desirable to determine and analyze, and possibly foresee, as accurately as possible what radiation exposures crew members involved in EVAs will experience in order to minimize risks and to establish exposure limits that must not to be exceeded. A detailed CAD model of the U.S. Space Shuttle EVA Spacesuit, developed at NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC), is used to represent the directional shielding of an astronaut; it has detailed helmet and backpack structures, hard upper torso, and multilayer space suit fabric material. The NASA Computerized Anatomical Male and Female (CAM and CAF) models are used in conjunction with the space suit CAD model for dose evaluation within the human body. The particle environments are taken from the orbit-averaged NASA AP8 and AE8 models at solar cycle maxima and minima. The transport of energetic particles through space suit materials and body tissue is calculated by using the NASA LaRC HZETRN code for hadrons and a recently developed deterministic transport code, ELTRN, for electrons. The doses within the CAM and CAF models are determined from energy deposition at given target points along 968 directional rays convergent on the points and are evaluated for several points on the skin and within the body. Dosimetric quantities include contributions from primary protons, light ions, and electrons, as well as from secondary brehmsstrahlung and target fragments. Directional dose patterns are displayed as rays and on spherical surfaces by the use of a color relative intensity representation.",Excluded
1799,"Technique for the administration of high-dose-rate brachytherapy to the bile duct using a nasobiliary catheter PURPOSE: Cholangiocarcinoma patients who are potential candidates for liver transplantation may be treated with high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy using a minimally invasive nasobiliary catheter in an effort to escalate the radiotherapy dose to the tumor and maximize local control rates. This work describes the equipment, procedures, and quality assurance (QA) that enables successful administration., METHODS AND MATERIALS: This work describes the nasobiliary catheter placement, simulation, treatment planning, treatment delivery, and QA. In addition, a chart review was performed of all patients who received endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography for HDR bile duct brachytherapy at our institution from 2007 to 2017. The review evaluated how many patients were treated and the number of patients who could not be treated because of anatomic and/or equipment limitations., RESULTS: From 2007 to 2017, 122 cholangiocarcinoma patients have been treated with HDR brachytherapy using a nasobiliary catheter. Three patients underwent catheter placement but did not receive brachytherapy treatment due to catheter migration between placement and treatment or because the HDR afterloader was unable to extend the source wire into the treatment site. Periodic QA is recommended for ensuring whether the HDR afterloader is capable of extending the source wire through an extensive and curved path., CONCLUSIONS: Intraluminal HDR brachytherapy with a nasobiliary catheter can be successfully administered. Procedures and QA are described for ensuring safety and overcoming technical challenges. Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

1244,"Handheld gamma probe used to detect accessory spleens during initial laparoscopic splenectomies BACKGROUND: Preoperative determination of the accessory spleen still is a major factor in the failure of both laparoscopic and conventional techniques. This study aimed to evaluate the practicability and efficacy of a handheld gamma probe in identifying accessory spleens at the initial intervention., METHODS: This study evaluated 17 patients undergoing laparoscopic splenectomy attributable to benign hematologic disorders. All the patients had preoperative ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT) scan, and nuclear scintigraphic examination of the abdominal cavity to assess the size of the spleen, and to determine the existence of the accessory spleen or spleens. For all the patients, a handheld gamma probe count was used intraoperatively as an adjuvant method to define the presence and location of the accessory splenic tissue. Control nuclear scintigraphic examinations of all the patients were performed 1 month after the surgical procedure., RESULTS: In two cases, intraoperatively accessory splenic tissue was detected by gamma probe, confirming the preoperative CT findings for the patients. One of these patients had three accessory spleens, although preoperative CT scan showed only two of them. However, by the help of the gamma probe, a third spleen located retroperitoneally was defined. For two patients, laparoscopic exploration and handheld gamma probe count did not identify any accessory splenic tissue, although preoperative CT scan indicated accessory spleens. For detecting accessory splenic tissue, the sensitivities of the studied techniques were 0% for ultrasonography, 75% for CT scan, 0% for preoperative nuclear scintigraphy, 75% for laparoscopic exploration, and 100% for perioperative gamma probe examination., CONCLUSION: Preoperative imaging methods for accessory spleen determination still have limited benefits because of their limited sensitivity. Thus, the handheld gamma probe technique may be an adjuvant method for laparoscopic exploration ensuring that no accessory splenic tissue is missed during the initial surgical treatment of benign hematologic disorders.",Excluded
1908,"A specific melon concentrate exhibits photoprotective effects from antioxidant activity in healthy adults Skin is the largest body organ and the first barrier to exogenous threats. This organ is constantly exposed to external factors such as ultraviolet radiation, which induces many adverse effects including sunburn, depigmentation, photo aging, photo immune suppression, and even skin cancer. Antioxidants seem to be good candidates in order to reduce ultraviolet-mediated damages and to prevent the health consequences of ultraviolet exposure. The present investigation aims to further characterize the potential skin photoprotective effects of a food supplementation and a topical administration of a melon concentrate alone or in combination. A clinical study assessing the Minimal Erythema Dose (MED) was first set up to evaluate photoprotection. Afterward, an independent in vitro study was performed on human skin explants from a donor to evaluate the effect of the melon concentrate at different levels including on the sunburn cells formation and on the endogenous antioxidant enzymes and its influence on melanin. Clinical study results demonstrate that melon concentrate application and/or supplementation increased MED. It also increased the endogenous antioxidant enzymes and reduced sunburn cells and melanin level on irradiated skin explants. Therefore, it is suggested that melon concentrate administration (oral and/or topical) could be a useful strategy for photoprotection due to its antioxidant properties.Copyright © 2018 by the authors.

1246,"Residential radon and lung cancer: a cohort study in Galicia, Spain Case-control studies show an association between residential radon and lung cancer. The aim of this paper is to investigate this association through a cohort study. We designed an ambispective cohort study using the Galician radon map, Spain, with controls drawn from a previous case-control study. Subjects were recruited between 2002 and 2009. The data were cross-checked to ascertain lung cancer incidence and then analysed using a Cox regression model. A total of 2,127 subjects participated; 24 lung cancer cases were identified; 76.6% of subjects were drawn from the radon map. The adjusted hazard ratio was 1.2 (95%CI: 0.5-2.8) for the category of subjects exposed to 50Bq/m3 or more. This risk rose when subjects from the case-control study were analyzed separately. In conclusion, we did not observe any statistically significant association between residential radon exposure and lung cancer; however, it appears that with a sample of greater median age (such as participants from the case-control study), the risk of lung cancer would have been higher.",Excluded
2283,"Noise reduction technology reduces radiation dose in chronic total occlusions percutaneous coronary intervention: a propensity score-matched analysis Chronic total occlusions (CTO) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is associated with high radiation dose. Our study aim was to evaluate the impact of the implementation of a noise reduction technology (NRT) on patient radiation dose during CTO PCI. A total of 187 CTO PCIs performed between February 2016 and May 2017 were analyzed according to the angiographic systems utilized: Standard (n = 60) versus NRT (n = 127). Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to control for differences in baseline characteristics. Primary endpoints were Cumulative Air Kerma at Interventional Reference Point (AK at IRP), which correlates with patient's tissue reactions; and Kerma Area Product (KAP), a surrogate measure of patient's risk of stochastic radiation effects. An Efficiency Index (defined as fluoroscopy time/AK at IRP) was calculated for each procedure. Image quality was evaluated using a 5-grade Likert-like scale. After PSM, n = 55 pairs were identified. Baseline and angiographic characteristics were well matched between groups. Compared to the Standard system, NRT was associated with lower AK at IRP [2.38 (1.80-3.66) vs. 3.24 (2.04-5.09) Gy, p = 0.035], a trend towards reduction for KAP [161 (93-244) vs. 203 (136-363) Gycm2, p = 0.069], and a better Efficiency Index [16.75 (12.73-26.27) vs. 13.58 (9.92-17.63) min/Gy, p = 0.003]. Image quality was similar between the two groups (4.39 +/- 0.53 Standard vs. 4.34 +/- 0.47 NRT, p = 0.571). In conclusion, compared with a Standard system, the use of NRT in CTO PCI is associated with lower patient radiation dose and similar image quality.",Excluded
1880,"Comparative study of planimetry for patients with 3 brain metastases treated with Cyberknife: Treatment of 3 lesions separately versus 3 simultaneous lesions Introduction. The aim of this study is to compare the irradiation of three brain lesions treated as consecutive and mono-fractionated to the Cyberknife with simultaneous treatment including the 3 lesions. Methods. We study in this work 12 patients with 3 brain lesions who each have been processed at the dose of 20 Gy in 1 fraction. These small tumors (mean 8 cc: min 0.4 cc, max 3.5 cc) were distant from each other. We realized after the fact a planimetry including the three lesions for a simultaneous treatment. To do this, we create a PTV Global volume on which we apply our dose constraints. We then compare the coverage, dosimetric indices (conformity index, homogeneity index, gradient), the processing time and doses to the brain. This study will allow us on the one hand, to assess the feasibility of the treatment, and on the other hand to propose the planimetry to the doctor according to the patient's case. To improve and secure our study, each patient received a double dosimetry performed by two different operators through the Multiplan planning console, which is dedicated to the Cyberknife. Results. The duration of the sessions for the 3 lesions treated simultaneously is acceptable for the patient with values between 45 min and 63 min (mean 55 min), which corresponds to an average increase of 71% (7-127%). This processing time is still acceptable and the simultaneous treatment is time saving for the machine since we have a discrepancy between these two treatment schemes, with an average gain of 83% (59-147%). We evaluated doses received by the healthy brain in the two schemes: V12 Gy, V10 Gy, V8 Gy, V5 Gy. Conclusions. In the context of the increase of small brain metastases treatment, the current trend is clearly towards hypofractionated treatment of the multi-localizations compared to the treatment of the whole of the brain. The comparison of the two treatment schemes allows us to propose in the future the solution of simultaneous treatment.",Excluded
2215,"Is it necessary to perform X-ray absorptiometry in young IBD patients to predict the risk of fracture? BACKGROUND:Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients have an increased risk of osteoporosis related fractures. Necessity of bone density measurement in IBD patients is not clearly defined, however, the risk of fracture increases among them. Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) score computes the 10-years probability of the major osteoporotic fractures and particularly hip fracture. Clinical FRAX (c-FRAX) does not include the bone mineral density (BMD) measurement. We aimed to compare the value the c-FRAX to FRAX enhanced with dual x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) (bmd-FRAX) in IBD patients. METHOD(S):169 consecutive IBD patients (128 Crohn's disease (CD) and 41 ulcerative colitis (UC); female/male: 88/81) were included into the study. Mean age of the patients was 35.9+/-11.7 years, 7.6% of them was postmenopausal women. FRAX-scores were calculated with the online tool using a Hungarian algorithm. Bone mineral density measurements were performed by DEXA. Calculations were performed using SPSS statistics 15.0 software. RESULT(S):In patients under 40 the c-FRAX score regarding major osteoporotic fracture risk was significantly higher compared to bmd-FRAX (1,9+/-1,1 vs. 1,4+/-0,8, p<0,01). The same difference was observed computing the probability of hip fractures (c-FRAX: 0,4+/-0,7 vs. bmd-FRAX: 0,3+/-0,5; p <0,05). In a subgroup analysis the fracture risks have not differed in CD vs. UC patients. Major fracture risk c-FRAX and bmd-FRAX were 3,0+/-3,4% es 2,4+/-2,7% in CD and 3.4+/-3.4% and 2.5+/-2.4% in UC patients (non-significant (NS)). Clinical FRAX and bmd-FRAX showing hip fracture risk were 0.8+/-1.5% and 0.6+/-1.4% in CD and 0.8+/-1.3% and 0.4+/-0.7% in UC, respectively (NS). We did not observe any correlation between FRAX scores and calcium intake, physical activity, severity, extent- and duration of the disease. Subgroup analysis regarding steroid use and body mass index has not been performed due to the FRAX system included in these parameters. CONCLUSION(S):Guidelines regarding IBD associated osteoporosis advise to perform the DEXA measurements in patients with some special risk factors for bone loss. In our study the fracture risk according to FRAX scores completed with DEXA were lower than clinical FRAX - especially in patients younger than 40 years. Our results suggest that DEXA enhanced FRAX may have an advantageous role in preventing over medicating young IBD patients.",Excluded
1661,"Radiotherapy for Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors Purpose: Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNTs) are rare malignant neoplasms considered to be resistant to radiotherapy (RT), although data on efficacy are scarce. We reviewed our institutional experience to further delineate the role of RT for patients with PNTs. Methods and Materials: Between 1986 and 2006, 36 patients with PNTs were treated with RT to 49 sites. Of these 36 patients, 23 had radiographic follow-up data, which were used to determine the tumor response rate and freedom from local progression. Long-term toxicity was graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Result(s): The overall response rate to RT was 39% (13% complete response, 26% partial response, 56% stable disease, and 4% progressive disease). A significant difference in the freedom from local progression between the groups receiving either greater than or less than the median 2 Gy/fraction biologically equivalent dose of 49.6 Gy was found, with all radiographic progression occurring in patients who had received <=32 Gy. The actuarial 3-year local freedom from progression rate was 49%. Palliation was achieved in 90% of patients, with either improvement or resolution of symptoms after RT. Of 35 patients, 33 had metastatic disease at their referral for RT, and the median overall survival for this patient population was 2 years. Three long-term Grade 3 or greater toxicities were recorded. Conclusion(s): RT is an effective modality for achieving local control in patients with PNTs. RT produces high rates of symptomatic palliation and freedom from local progression. Prospective trials of radiotherapy for PNTs are warranted. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

1402,"Endonasal phototherapy significantly alleviates symptoms of allergic rhinitis, but has a limited impact on the nasal mucosal immune cells The literature documents the fact that UV irradiation of cutaneous Langerhans cells (LC) in vivo prevents the development of contact allergy and produces long-lasting immunosuppression. However, not much is known about the effect of UV irradiation on the LC of the nasal mucosa and their connection with clinical scores. Local antigen presentation may be necessary for both primary and recall T cell responses to birch pollen in patients with hay fever. Endonasal phototherapy combination of UVB (5%), UVA (25%) and visible light (70%) utilises the immunosuppressive effects of UV irradiation. The aim of this study was to correlate clinical symptom scores with possible changes in the LC of the nasal mucosa induced by UV radiation. The clinical effectiveness of this form of treatment is discussed. Nasal biopsies were obtained from ten birch pollen-sensitive patients with seasonal rhinitis before and after endonasal phototherapy. All patients showed a significant clinical benefit post-treatment as assessed by standardised instruments, including total nasal symptom score, nasal congestion score, nasal itching score, sneezing score, nasal secretion score and impairment-to-health score. However, we found no significant morphological changes, to, or quantitative differences in, the CD1a+, CD4, CD8 or CD31 cells before and 14 days after treatment. Despite the positive clinical effect, the study revealed no effect of UV irradiation on the LC and other analysed cells of the nasal mucosa immune system.

1286,"The Value of Computed Tomography Imaging of the Head After Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt Surgery in Adults Background: Patients with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt for hydrocephalus often undergo multiple follow-up computed tomography (CT) scans of the head, increasing the risk for long-term effects of ionizing radiation. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the necessity as a routine diagnostic procedure and cost analysis of routine postoperative CT scan of the head after ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery. Method(s): In this study, we comprised adults with ventriculoperitoneal shunt operations who underwent early CT scans within 48 hours postoperatively. We reviewed the correlation between revision surgery rate and the experience of surgeons who performed surgery and provided a cost analysis. Result(s): In total, 479 surgeries were performed in 439 patients. Early revision surgery was performed in 11 (2.3%) patients. Reason for revision surgery was malposition in 9 cases and intracerebral hemorrhage in 2 patients. There was no significant correlation between the surgeon's experience and the rate of revision surgery. Placement of the ventricular catheter via an approach other than a standard right or left frontal burr hole resulted in risk of need for surgical shunt revision (P >= 0.002, odds ratio 54, confidence interval 13.5-223). A total of 468 CT scans of the head revealed a normal finding; thus, ~$562,000 could be saved by omitting postoperative head CT scans. Conclusion(s): Routine postoperative head CT scans after fentriculoperitoneal shunting are not necessary in all cases. The reduction of exposure to ionization radiation and the beneficial economic factor are main advantages.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

1639,"Needle placement for piriformis injection using 3-D imaging Piriformis syndrome is a pain syndrome originating in the buttock and is attributed to 6% - 8% of patients referred for the treatment of back and leg pain. The treatment for piriformis syndrome using fluoroscopy, computed tomography (CT), electromyography (EMG), and ultrasound (US) has become standard practice. The treatment of Piriformis Syndrome has evolved to include fluoroscopy and EMG with CT guidance. We present a case study of 5 successful piriformis injections using 3-D computer-assisted electromagnet needle tracking coupled with ultrasound. A 6-degree of freedom electromagnetic position tracker was attached to the ultrasound probe that allowed the system to detect the position and orientation of the probe in the magnetic field. The tracked ultrasound probe was used to find the posterior superior iliac spine. Subsequently, 3 points were captured to register the ultrasound image with the CT or magnetic resonance image scan. Moreover, after the registration was obtained, the navigation system visualized the tracked needle relative to the CT scan in real-time using 2 orthogonal multi-planar reconstructions centered at the tracked needle tip. Conversely, a recent study revealed that fluoroscopically guided injections had 30% accuracy compared to ultrasound guided injections, which tripled the accuracy percentage. This novel technique exhibited an accurate needle guidance injection precision of 98% while advancing to the piriformis muscle and avoiding the sciatic nerve. The mean (+/- SD) procedure time was 19.08 (+/- 4.9) minutes. This technique allows for electromagnetic instrument tip tracking with realtime 3-D guidance to the selected target.

In all subjects the heart rate (HR) was <65 bpm and all CT scans were acquired using a prospective ECG gating and AEC strategy. Mean effective radiation dose and subjective and objective (Noise or N, signal to noise ratio or SNR, contrast to noise ratio or CNR) image quality, were evaluated. Subjective quality was assessed by two experienced radiologists using a 5-point scale (0: non diagnostic-4: excellent) using the 15-segment American Heart Association (AHA) coronary artery classification., RESULTS: Mean effective dose and noise were non significantly different between the two groups: mean effective dose was 2.89 +/- 0.7 mSv in the 100 kV group and 2.80 +/- 0.57 mSv in the 120 kV group (p = 0.25) while noise was 28.9 +/- 3.3 in the 120 kV group and 29.05 +/- 3.6 in the 100 kV group (p = 0.72). Both SNR and CNR were significantly higher in the 100 kV group than in the 120 kV group. This data agrees with the evidence that subjective quality was significantly higher in the 100 kV group in the middle and distal segmental classes., CONCLUSION: Our study shows that, in using a 320 row CCTA with AEC strategy it is better to employ a 100 kV tube voltage protocol because compared to 120 kV tube voltage setting, it appears to significantly improve both subjective and objective image quality without decreasing the mean effective radiation dose.",Excluded

All patients were treated in a prone position on a bellyboard by 3DRT. The inferior border of the RT fields was at least 3-5 cm inferior to the gross tumorous volume (GTV) or at the inferior border of the obturator foramen (IBOF), whichever was more inferior. The EAS was contoured and dose distributions were determined using dose-volume histograms., RESULTS: In 53 out of 64 cases (82.8%), the EAS was completely inferior to the IBOF. In the remaining 11 cases, the EAS was either overlapping the IBOF (10 cases; 15.6%) or completely superior to the IBOF (1 case; 1.7%). The average mean dose delivered to the EAS was 2795 cGy. Lower mean doses were delivered to the EAS when the center of the EAS was located more distant from the GTV., CONCLUSIONS: Meticulous planning to define the inferior border of the RT field is recommended to avoid irradiating the EAS.",Excluded

In this study the authors report the outcomes of clival epidural-osseous DAVFs treated using Gamma Knife surgery (GKS). METHODS Thirteen patients with 13 clival epidural-osseous DAVFs were treated with GKS at the authors' institution between 1993 and 2015. Patient age at the time of GKS ranged from 38 to 76 years (median 55 years). Eight DAVFs were classified as Cognard Type I, 4 as Type IIa, and 1 as Type IIa+b. The median treatment volume was 17.6 cm3 (range 6.2-40.3 cm3). The median prescribed margin dose was 16.5 Gy (range 15-18 Gy). Clinical and radiological follow-ups were performed at 6-month intervals. Patient outcomes after GKS were categorized as 1) complete improvement, 2) partial improvement, 3) stationary, and 4) progression. RESULTS All 13 patients demonstrated symptomatic improvement, and on catheter angiography 12 of the 13 patients had complete obliteration and 1 patient had partial obliteration. The median follow-up period was 26 months (range 14-186 months). The median latency period from GKS to obliteration was 21 months (range 8-186 months). There was no intracranial hemorrhage during the follow-up period, and no deaths occurred. Two adverse events were observed following treatment, and 2 patients required repeat GKS treatment with eventual complete obliteration. CONCLUSIONS Gamma Knife surgery offers a safe and effective primary or adjuvant treatment modality for complex clival epidural-osseous DAVFs. All patients in this case series demonstrated symptomatic improvement, and almost all patients attained complete obliteration.Copyright © AANS, 2018.",Excluded
2137,"Different patterns of allelic imbalance in sporadic tumors and tumors associated with long-term exposure to gamma-radiation The study aimed to reveal cancer related mutations in DNA repair and cell cycle genes associated with chronic occupational exposure to gamma-radiation in personnel of the Siberian Group of Chemical Enterprises (SGCE). Mutations were analyzed by comparing genotypes of malignant tumors and matched normal tissues of 255 cancer patients including 98 exposed to external gamma-radiation (mean dose 128.1+/-150.5mSv). Also a genetic association analysis was carried out in a sample of 149 cancer patients and 908 healthy controls occupationally exposed to gamma-radiation (153.2+/-204.6mSv and 150.5+/-211.2mSv, respectively). Eight SNPs of genes of DNA excision repair were genotyped (rs13181, rs1052133, rs1042522, rs2305427, rs4244285, rs1045642, rs1805419 and rs1801133). The mutation profiles in heterozygous loci for selected SNP were different between sporadic tumors and tumors in patients exposed to radiation. In sporadic tumors, heterozygous genotype Arg/Pro of the rs1042522 SNP mutated into Arg/0 in 15 cases (9.6%) and 0/Pro in 14 cases (8.9%). The genotype Lys/Gln of the rs13181 SNP mutated into Lys/0 and 0/Gln in 9 and 4 cases, respectively. In tumors of patients exposed to low-level radiation, the rs1042522 Arg/0 mutated genotype was found in 12 cases (12.1%), while in 2 cases (2%) 0/Pro mutation was observed. Finally, the rs13181 0/Gln mutated genotype was observed in 15 cases (16,5%) . Thus, our study showed the difference in patterns of allelic imbalance in tumors appeared under low-level radiation exposure and spontaneous tumors for selected SNPs. This suggests different mechanisms of inactivation of heterozygous genotypes in sporadic and radiation-induced tumors. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Included

Most were married(62%)and 30% non-Caucasians.48% had ECOG PS 0-1,whereas it was 2, 3 and 4 in 24%,9% and 3%.Primary cancer diagnoses were lung (28%),breast(13%),prostate(10%),melanoma(10%),sarcoma(7%) and other diagnoses in 32%.Pain was predominant reason for consult(57%)followed by brain metastases(29%),spinal cord/cauda compression (13%),dyspnea (10%),bleeding (8%),bone fracture(4%)and dysphagia(2%).Clinicians managed pain (69%),neurologic symptoms(51%),fatigue (49%),intestinal(21%),respiratory (19%) symptoms,bleeding (14%),insomnia (13%),nausea/vomiting(12%)and dysphagia(6%).Patients presented at all stages 79% at the time of their diagnosis of metastatic cancer,63% with an established (> 1 month) metastatic cancer diagnosis and continuing to further cancer therapies and 17% proceeding to hospice care without further anti-cancer therapy after PRT. Conclusion(s): Radiation oncologists care for patients across time course of metastatic cancer diagnosis managing variety of urgent oncologic issues,most commonly metastases causing pain followed by brain metastases and cord compression.They also manage cancer-related symptoms,mostly pain,neurological symptoms and fatigue.These findings point to need for palliative care to be well integrated into radiation oncology practice including education and systems of care.",Excluded
2161,"Application of Digital Tomosynthesis in the Diagnosis of Urolithiasis: Comparison with MDCT Objective: To investigate the diagnostic value of digital tomosynthesis in urolithiasis compared with multidetector computed tomography (MDCT). Subjects and Methods: This study received the approval of institutional review board and obtained the informed consents of all subjects. Fifty patients with acute renal colic and hematuria from February 2014 to February 2015 were enrolled. They underwent both MDCT and digital tomosynthesis. Images were interpreted by two experienced radiologists, and inter-reader agreement was assessed. The diagnostic performance of urinary stones with digital tomosynthesis and MDCT was compared. The entrance surface dose (ESD) in MDCT and digital tomosynthesis for patients was measured and compared. Result(s): No significant difference was found between digital tomosynthesis and MDCT in the diagnosis of urinary stones (X2 = 1.357, p > 0.05). The ESD in digital tomosynthesis was lower than that in both routine-dose and low-dose MDCT for patients (p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Digital tomosynthesis has great diagnostic value in urolithiasis. Compared with MDCT, digital tomosynthesis can significantly decrease ESD for patients and financial loan with a similar detection rate.Copyright © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.",Excluded
2429,"Protection of radiation-induced damage to the hematopoietic system, small intestine and salivary glands in rats by JNJ7777120 compound, a histamine H4 ligand Based on previous data on the histamine radioprotective effect on highly radiosensitive tissues, in the present work we aimed at investigating the radioprotective potential of the H4R ligand, JNJ7777120, on ionizing radiation-induced injury and genotoxic damage in small intestine, salivary glands and hematopoietic tissue. For that purpose, rats were divided into 4 groups. JNJ7777120 and JNJ7777120-irradiated groups received a daily subcutaneous JNJ7777120 injection (10 mg/kg) starting 24 h before irradiation. Irradiated groups received a single dose of 5 Gy on whole-body using Cesium-137 source and were sacrificed 3 or 30 days after irradiation. Tissues were removed, fixed, stained with hematoxylin and eosin or PAS staining and histological characteristics were evaluated. Proliferative and apoptotic markers were studied by immunohistochemistry, while micronucleus assay was performed to evaluate DNA damage. Submandibular gland (SMG) function was evaluated by methacholine-induced salivation. Results indicate that JNJ7777120 treatment diminished mucosal atrophy and preserved villi and the number of crypts after radiation exposure (240+/-8 vs. 165+/-10, P<0.01). This effect was associated to a reduced apoptosis and DNA damage in intestinal crypts. JNJ7777120 reduced radiation-induced aplasia, preserving medullar components and reducing formation of micronucleus and also it accelerated bone marrow repopulation. Furthermore, it reduced micronucleus frequency in peripheral blood (27+/-8 vs. 149+/-22, in 1,000 erythrocytes, P<0.01). JNJ7777120 completely reversed radiation-induced reduced salivation, conserving glandular mass with normal histological appearance and reducing apoptosis and atrophy of SMG. JNJ7777120 exhibits radioprotective effects against radiation-induced cytotoxic and genotoxic damages in small intestine, SMG and hematopoietic tissues and, thus, could be of clinical value for patients undergoing radiotherapy.",Included
1719,"[Possibilities of prognostication of individual radiation sensitivity] Proceeding from the concept of individual radiosensitivity as a sign of total reactivity 3 directions in a study of its possible prediction were considered: establishing correlation between separate indices characterizing the initial state and total radiosensitivity; correlation between body reactions to non-radiation exposures and subsequent irradiation; comparison of total radiosensitivity to irradiation at a small dose and subsequent irradiation at LD50. The following indices were used for the evaluation of the basal status of the body: oxygen consumption level, body mass increase rate, the level of water and basal metabolism, peripheral blood indices, body temperature, basal indices of the functional adrenocortical activity, the state of the cardiovascular system. The following non-radiation stress-exposures were used: physical exercise, constant magnetic field, starvation, hypoxia, and adrenaline administration. A V-type dependency was established for most investigated indices of the basal status and reaction of the body to non-radiation exposures. The utmost radioresistance was shown by animals in whom the basal indices or their reaction to non-radiation exposure approximated the average group level. The third direction: comparison of radiosensitivity and radiation damage--was analyzed by comparing the reaction of cerebral biocurrents to radiation exposure at a small dose with subsequent damage of the body following irradiation at a lethal dose. The accuracy of predicting the outcome of radiation injury by some of the indices varied from 65 to 80%. In some indices of the basal status and reactivity evaluation it reached 85-90%.",Excluded
2472,"Demonstration of Human Fetal Bone Morphology with MR Imaging: A Preliminary Study PURPOSE: CT is a useful modality for the evaluation of fetal skeletal dysplasia but radiation exposure is unavoidable. The purpose of this study is to compare the usefulness of MRI and CT for evaluating the fetal skeletal shape., METHODS: This study was approved by our Institutional Review Board. Fetal specimens (n = 14) were scanned on a 3T MRI scanner using our newly-developed sequence. It is based on T2*-weighted imaging (TR, 12 ms; TE for opposed-phase imaging, 6.1 ms, for in-phase imaging, 7.3 ms; flip angle, 40degree). The specimens were also scanned on a 320 detector-row CT scanner. Four radiologists visually graded and compared the visibility of the bone shape of eight regions on MRI- and CT-scans using a 5-point grading system., RESULTS: The diagnostic ability of MRI with respect to the 5th metacarpals, femur, fibula, and pelvis was superior to CT (all, P < 0.050); there was no significant difference in the evaluation results of observers with respect to the cervical and lumbar spine, and the 5th metatarsal (0.058 <= P <= 1.000). However, the diagnostic ability of MRI was significantly inferior to CT for the assessment of the bone shape of the thoracic spine (observers A and C: P = 0.002, observers B and D: P = 0.001)., CONCLUSION: The MRI method we developed represents a potential alternative to CT imaging for the evaluation of the fetal bone structure.",Excluded
2246,"Review: Mucosal melanoma of the head and neck Head and neck mucosal melanoma (MM) is a rare and aggressive neoplasm, with high rates of local, regional, and distant failure. Owing to the small size of most reported series and their retrospective nature, and the lack of uniform comprehensive staging system, the effect of various treatment strategies on disease control and survival has been difficult to assess. The optimal management of head and neck MM is not well defined. Surgical treatment has being advocated as the primary treatment modality, with growing consideration for postoperative radiotherapy, as wide surgical resection in the head and neck region is often difficult. Radiotherapy is recently reported as a beneficial management modality, regardless of the fact that MM has been considered to be radioresistant. As significant morbidity is expected in high doses of radiotherapy to the head and neck region, new radiographic modalities with better precision are required. Furthermore, high-energy radiotherapy was suggested as a better therapy to mucosal MM due to the suggested biology of the tumor. The high rates of locoregional recurrence and distant metastasis also suggest that a systemic treatment is needed. Currently, there is no role for adjuvant systemic therapy for patients who have been successfully resected, but recent developments in the understanding of the biology of melanoma and, in particular, specific growth pathways holds promise for the future. We strongly recommend further evaluation of the role of chemotherapy and immunotherapy to decrease the rates of distant metastasis and improve survival. © 2011 Wolters Kluwer Health Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Excluded
2322,"Evaluation and management of pericardial effusion in patients with neoplastic disease The incidence and extent of pericardial involvement in neoplastic disease varies. In a considerable number of patients with breast or lung cancer or with mediastinal lymphoma, in addition to direct involvement by the tumor, radiation therapy as well as systemic tumor treatment can also lead to pericardial effusion. In addition, in immunosuppressed tumor patients, pericardial effusion can also arise from viral, bacterial, and autoimmune causes. To distinguish between these 3 different conditions leading to pericardial effusion, the diagnosis should be based on pericardiocentesis followed by fluid analysis for cytology and biomarkers, on epicardial and pericardial biopsy facilitated by flexible pericardioscopy with analysis of specimens by conventional histology and molecular biology techniques for viral and microbial aetiology. We collected prospectively but analyzed retrospectively 357 patients undergoing pericardiocentesis from 1988 to 2008 and identified 68 patients who had cancer-related pericardial effusion. With these methods, 42 patients demonstrated malignant effusion, 15 patients had radiation-induced pericardial, effusion, and in 11 patients without radiation therapy, the effusion could be attributed to either viral infection in 5 cases or to an autoimmune process in the remaining 6 patients. Consequently, intrapericardial treatment could be tailored for each cohort: neoplastic effusion was treated with intrapericardial cisplatin (single instillation of 30 mg/m(2) per 24 hours); in addition to the tumor-specific systemic chemotherapy, intrapericardial triamcinolone acetate (Volon A) was given in a dose of 500 mg/m(2) in the patients with autoimmune and radiation-induced effusion. Saline rinsing and intrapericardial sclerosing treatment were the treatment of choice in viral pericardial effusion. Oral colchicine treatment (2-3 x 0.5 mg) was given in all patients for at least 3 months. Recurrence of pericardial effusion was prevented for at least 3 months in more than 85% of patients. This differential diagnostic approach and the results of treatment were compared with published series. Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2329,"Combined use of TUR and laser ablation in the treatment of bladder cancer Introduction: Superficial bladder cancer (SBC) tends to recur (30 80%) after transurethral resection (TUR) of the bladder wall. The aim of the study was a comparative analysis of efficacy of standard TUR and combined use of TUR and laser ablation in the treatment of patients with SBC. Material(s) and Method(s): 60 patients (male 41, female 19) with SBC were treated in the urological clinic of Saratov State Medical University. The age of the patients varied between 43 and 80 years (mean 60.7+/-0.5). The primary bladder tumor was registered in 47 patients, 13 patients were hospitalized due to relapse of a disease. In clinical and morphological investigations transitional cell carcinoma in the stage Ta T1N0M0G1 2 was diagnosed. All patients were divided into two groups. In 23 patients of the first group, standard TUR was applied with use of KARL STORZ Endoscope. In the second group, TUR was combined with consecutive noncontact irradiation of the tumor bed and adjacent area (1 cm2) by the light of Nd:YAG laser (""Sharplan"", lambda 1,064 nm, power 65W, total energy 20-40 kJ). Result(s): In the first group, 6 patients had relapse of the bladder cancer during the first year, and total number of patients with relapse was 7 (30.4% cases). Accordingly three years recurrence free survival rate was 69.6% in the first group. In the second group, relapse rate was only 10.8% and three years recurrence free period was 89.2%. Difference between the groups was statistically significant (p < 0.05).

Materials and methods Data from 37 patients with cervical lymph node involvement were used. All patients originally received chemotherapy followed by 3DCRT-INRT (30.6 Gy). A VMAT-INRT, PT-INRT (both 30.6 Gy), and a MF plan (36 Gy) were simulated. Doses to head and neck OARs were compared with cumulative DVHs and repeated measures ANOVA. Results The estimated median mean doses were 15.3, 19.3, 15.4, and 37.3 Gy (thyroid), 10.9, 12.0, 7.9, and 34.5 Gy (neck muscles), 2.3, 11.1, 1.8, and 37.1 Gy (larynx), 1.7, 5.1, 1.3, and 23.8 Gy (pharynx), 0.5, 0.8, 0.01, and 32.3 Gy (ipsilateral parotid), and 2.4, 3.8, 0.7, and 34.7 Gy (ipsilateral submandibular) with 3DCRT, VMAT, PT, and MF (all p < 0.0001), respectively. Conclusion The use of INRT significantly lowered the estimated radiation dose to the head and neck OARs. VMAT appeared suboptimal compared to 3DCRT and PT, and for some patients, PT offered an additional gain. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2122,"Malignant angioglioma: Clinical, radiologic, and histopathologic features Background Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most frequent malignant neoplasm in the adult brain. In contrast, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are presumably congenital lesions, usually presenting with hemorrhage. Hypervascular low-grade gliomas associated with AVMs were previously called angioglioma. An association of AVMs and GBM was also described. Study Aims We discuss the data of the largest series of locally coincident GBM with AVM in a single institution so far. All analyses were explorative only. Patients We report a series of four patients presenting at our department from 2006 to 2014. All patients underwent surgery. The cases were analyzed regarding initial presentation, clinical findings, tumor localization, and histopathologic results. Conclusions A local coincidence of cerebral AVM and GBM is rare. Only a few reports can be found in the literature. The radiologic as well as the clinical presentations are individual. Proangiogenic factors are discussed as involved in the appearance of both entities in the same location. However, the presence of pathologic vessels within malignant gliomas is well known to all neurosurgeons and proangiogenic activity has been proven. Therefore, it seems possible that tumor activity itself contributes to the pathogenesis of a vascular malformation.Copyright © 2020 Georg Thieme Verlag. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1956,"Electrical isolation of pulmonary veins in patients with atrial fibrillation: Reduction of fluoroscopy exposure and procedure duration by the use of a non-fluoroscopic navigation system (NavX) Aims: The aim of the study was to investigate the feasibility of performing segmental pulmonary vein (PV) isolation guided by the NavX (Endocardial Solutions, St Jude Medical, Inc., St Paul, MN, USA) system without the three-dimensional (3D) geometric reconstruction option and whether the use of NavX system will reduce the radiation exposure and procedure duration. Methods and Results: The study included 64 patients with symptomatic paroxysmal or permanent atrial fibrillation, in whom PV isolation was performed using fluoroscopic guidance (n=32) or the NavX system (n=32). Pulmonary vein mapping with a circular mapping catheter allowed the identification and localization of myocardial connections between the PV and the left atrium. PV isolation was performed by radiofrequency ablation of these connections at the atrial aspect of the PV ostium. Primary success rate for isolated PVs did not differ significantly in patients ablated under fluoroscopic guidance vs. those ablated under guidance of NavX system [100/107 PVs (93.5%) vs. 120/124 PV (96.8%; P=n.s.)]. Compared with fluoroscopy guided procedures, NavX-guided procedures showed a significant reduction in the fluoroscopy time (75.8+/-24.5 vs. 38.9+/-19.3 min, P<0.05), total X-ray exposure (93.2+/-51.6 vs. 56.6+/-37.9 Gy cm2, P=0.03), and total procedural time (237.7+/-65.4 vs. 188.6+/-62.7, P=0.01). The mean follow-up was 9.5+/-3.0 months. One patient in each group was lost to follow-up. Seven-day Holter monitoring showed that 23 of 31 patients (74.2%) in the NavX-guided group and 21 of 31 patients (67.7%) in the fluoroscopy-guided group were in sinus rhythm (P=0.57). Conclusion(s): The 3D visualization of the catheters by NavX system allows a rapid and precise visualization of the mapping and ablation catheters at the PV ostia and markedly reduces fluoroscopy time, total X-ray exposure, and procedural duration during PV isolation compared with ablation performed under fluoroscopy guidance. © 2006 Oxford University Press.",Excluded
2288,"Patient doses from X-ray computed tomography examinations by a single-array detector unit: Axial versus spiral mode Background: X-ray computed tomography (CT) examinations deliver a significant amount of radiation doses to patients comparing to conventional radiography examinations. The objective of the current study was to analyze and investigate the average patient received dose from axial and spiral CT exams in a medical imaging center. Material(s) and Method(s): In this study, the patient imaging technique, weight and height were recorded. The patients' doses provided by CT unit in terms of CTDIw were also recorded. Then, other dosimetric quantities including dose-length product (DLP) and effective dose were calculated for each patient using the recorded data. The average values were obtained for all the studied dosimetric quantities. Also, their distribution in terms of examined regions and imaging mode; ie, axial and spiral CT were analyzed by SPSS software. Result(s): For all patients, the mean effective dose of 4.4 mGy with the standard deviation of 9.2 was found. The CTDIw for axial group was two times higher than spiral ones. Conversely, the effective dose of axial group was less than spiral group. Additionally, the effective doses of 2.3 and 5.2 mSv were found for axial and spiral, receptively. For both quantities of CTDIw and effective dose, the observed difference between axial and spiral modes were significant (P<0.001).

Dogs exposed repeatedly received a total alveolar deposition of 5.3 +/- 0.9 kBq/kg body mass during 7 to 10 semiannual exposures and accumulated doses of 22 +/- 5 Gy to the lung before death at 4.9 +/- 0.7 years after first exposure. Clearance of the plutonium from the lung in the dogs exposed repeatedly was slower than in the dogs exposed once. All dogs in the repeated-exposure study and all but one dog in the single-exposure study died from radiation effects. Pulmonary fibrosis accounted for 72% of the radiation-related deaths in the single-exposure study and 87% in the repeated-exposure study. The remaining dogs died with pulmonary cancer. Based on total cumulative radiation dose, the times after exposure to death from radiation pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis were not significantly different for single and repeated exposures.

1826,"Inter- and Intraobserver Agreement in Measuring Urolithiasis Density on Nonenhanced Computed Tomography Introduction: Treatment choice for urolithiasis is partially based on measuring stone density in HU on nonenhanced computed tomography (NECT). Interobserver variability in these measurements could have treatment consequences. This study aims to assess the observer agreement of measuring HU and whether the use of a protocol leads to a better agreement. Material(s) and Method(s): We retrospectively included 155 consecutive NECTs of patients with stones >=4 mm. Five observers (two radiologists, one urologist, one urology resident, and one radiology resident) assessed all anonymized NECTs four times in randomized order. HU was measured without instruction (rounds 1 and 2) and subsequently using two protocols (A and B, rounds 3 and 4). Protocols comprised using bone setting, zoom, and measuring HU without the penumbra, in either three (A) or one (B) axial plane. The inter- and intraobserver agreement was evaluated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Result(s): Interobserver agreement on HU measurement without protocol was as follows: ICC = 0.84 (confidence interval [CI]: 0.79-0.87). Agreement diminished with protocol A, ICC = 0.62 (CI: 0.37-0.76), and improved with protocol B, ICC = 0.90 (CI: 0.86-0.92). Intraobserver agreement without protocol was ICC = 0.87, with protocol A, ICC = 0.87, and with protocol B, ICC = 0.93. The biggest improvement was seen for urologists' agreement from no protocol to protocol B, where ICC improved from 0.81 (CI: 0.70-0.87) to 0.91 (CI: 0.84-0.94). Conclusion(s): Observer agreement of HU measurement of urolithiasis without protocol is already good but using zoom, bone setting, and measuring in a representative plane is recommended. This protocol results in higher agreement, especially among urologists. Measuring in three axial planes does not increase agreement.Copyright © 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.",Excluded

We examined the efficacy and safety of SABR in this group of patients. Method(s): From January 2008 to December 2014, 15 patients with 17 lesions were included in this study. The lesions included 14 intrahepatic, 1 hilar, and 2 distal bile duct tumors. Three patients were classified as medically inoperable because of old age or multiple comorbidities. Tumors measured 0.8-13 cm (median, 3.6 cm). The median prescribed dose was 45 Gy delivered in 5 fractions over 5 consecutive days. Result(s): The median follow-up period for surviving patients was 29.9 months. Objective responses were observed for 10 of 17 tumors (58.8%), including 3 complete responses (17.6%). The median survival duration was 12.6 months, and the 1- and 2-year overall survival rates were 50.3% and 14.4%, respectively. The 1- and 2-year in-field failure-free rates were 61.5% and 30.8%, respectively. For patients with biologically effective doses (BEDs) exceeding 75 Gy10, the 1- and 2-year overall survival rates were 58.3% and 33.3%, respectively, compared to 20.0% and 0%, respectively for those with BEDs lower than 75 Gy10. Radiation-induced liver disease did not develop in any patient. Acute toxicities were generally mild and tolerable.

1737,"Skeletal muscle mass and sarcopenia can be determined with 1.5-T and 3-T neck MRI scans, in the event that no neck CT scan is performed Objectives: Cross-sectional area (CSA) measurements of the neck musculature at the level of third cervical vertebra (C3) on CT scans are used to diagnose radiological sarcopenia, which is related to multiple adverse outcomes in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. Alternatively, these assessments are performed with neck MRI, which has not been validated so far. For that, the objective was to evaluate whether skeletal muscle mass and sarcopenia can be assessed on neck MRI scans. Method(s): HNC patients were included between November 2014 and November 2018 from a prospective data-biobank. CSAs of the neck musculature at the C3 level were measured on CT (n = 125) and MRI neck scans (n = 92 on 1.5-T, n = 33 on 3-T). Measurements were converted into skeletal muscle index (SMI), and sarcopenia was defined (SMI < 43.2 cm2/m2). Pearson correlation coefficients, Bland-Altman plots, McNemar test, Cohen's kappa coefficients, and interclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were estimated. Result(s): CT and MRI correlated highly on CSA and SMI (r = 0.958-0.998, p < 0.001). The Bland-Altman plots showed a nihil mean DELTASMI (- 0.13-0.44 cm2/m2). There was no significant difference between CT and MRI in diagnosing sarcopenia (McNemar, p = 0.5-1.0). Agreement on sarcopenia diagnosis was good with kappa = 0.956-0.978 and kappa = 0.870-0.933, for 1.5-T and 3-T respectively. Observer ICCs in MRI were excellent. In general, T2-weighted images had the best correlation and agreement with CT. Conclusion(s): Skeletal muscle mass and sarcopenia can interchangeably be assessed on CT and 1.5-T and 3-T MRI neck scans. This allows future clinical outcome assessment during treatment irrespective of used modality. Key Points: * Screening for low amount of skeletal muscle mass is usually measured on neck CT scans and is highly clinical relevant as it is related to multiple adverse outcomes in head and neck cancer patients. * We found that skeletal muscle mass and sarcopenia determined on CT and 1.5-T and 3-T MRI neck scans at the C3 level can be used interchangeably. * When CT imaging of the neck is missing for skeletal muscle mass analysis, patients can be assessed with 1.5-T or 3-T neck MRIs.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded

2312,"Prevention of in vitro fertilization of canine oocytes by anti-ovary antisera: a potential approach to fertility control in the bitch Antisera raised against canine ovaries were found to induce light scattering of the surface of the egg zona pellucida even when diluted 10,000 times, and to delay digestion of the zona by pronase. High concentrations of antiserum were required, however, to inhibit in vitro fertilization of the oocytes. Absorption of the antisera with canine ovaries removed these effects, whereas absorption with liver, uterus and serum did not. These results demonstrate the antigenicity of the canine ovary and suggest the plausibility of an anti-zona pellucida vaccine for bith control in the bitch.",Excluded
1991,"Plasminogen is a master regulator and a potential drug candidate for the healing of radiation wounds Around 95% of cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy experience cutaneous side effects, and some develop radiation wounds or fibrosis. Currently, there is no effective treatment for these indications. We show here that plasminogen administration enhanced the healing of radiation wounds via pleiotropic effects on gene expression. Using RNA sequencing, we found that plasminogen downregulated the expression of genes in the TLR, TNF, WNT, MAPK, and TGF-beta signaling pathways, and enhanced the anti-inflammatory effect of arachidonic acid, leading to significantly decreased inflammation and improved remodeling of granulation tissue compared with placebo treatment. In addition, plasminogen induced metabolic changes, including decreased glycolysis. Importantly, many of the factors downregulated by plasminogen are pro-fibrotic. Therefore, in radiation wounds with excessive inflammation, plasminogen is able to enhance and redirect the healing process, such that it more closely resembles physiological healing with significantly reduced risk for developing fibrosis. This makes plasminogen an attractive drug candidate for the treatment of radiation wounds in cancer patients.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded

1858,"Cohort study of occupational cosmic radiation dose and cancer mortality in German aircrew, 1960-2014 Objectives To determine cancer mortality compared with the general population and to examine dose-response relationships between cumulative occupational radiation dose and specific cancer outcomes in the German aircrew cohort. Methods For a cohort of 26 846 aircrew personnel, standardised mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated. Dose-response analyses were carried out using Poisson regression to assess dose-related cancer risks for the period 1960-2014. Exposure assessment comprises recently available dose register data for all cohort members and newly estimated retrospective cabin crew doses for 1960-2003. Results SMR for all-cause, specific cancer groups and most individual cancers were reduced in all aircrew groups. The only increases were seen for brain cancer in pilots (n=23, SMR 2.01, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.28) and for malignant melanoma (n=10, SMR 1.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 3.85). Breast cancer mortality among female cabin crew was similar to the general population (n=71, SMR 1.06, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.44). Overall median cumulative effective dose was 34.2 mSv (max: 116 mSv) for 1960-2014. No dose-response associations were seen in any of the models. For brain cancer, relative risks were elevated across dose categories. An indicative negative trend with increasing dose category was seen for large intestine cancer in female cabin crew (n=23). Conclusions There was no evidence for significant dose-response patterns for the considered cancer types. Interpretation of results remains difficult as cumulative dose is closely related to age. Future work should focus on investigating radiation jointly with other risk factors that may contribute to risks for specific cancers among aircrew.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

2001,"Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery and Radiotherapy to Large Resection Cavity of Metastatic Brain Tumors Objective To evaluate the efficacy of postoperative fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery (FSRS) and hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) to large surgical cavities after gross total resection of brain metastases. Methods A retrospective analysis of 41 patients who had received tumor-bed FSRS (5 fractions) or SRT (10 fractions) after resection of brain metastasis between 2005 and 2015 was performed. All resection cavities were treated with a frameless linear accelerator-based system. Patients who underwent subtotal resection, single-dose SRS to the resection cavity, or were treated with a fractionation schedule other than 5 or 10 fractions, were excluded. Results Twenty-six patients were treated with 5 fractions and 15 patients with 10 fractions. The median planning target volume was 19.78 cm3 (12.3-28 cm3) to the 5-fraction group and 29.79 cm3 (26.3-47.6 cm3) to the 10-fraction group (P = 0.020). The 1-year and 2-year local control rates for all patients were 89.4% and 77.1%, respectively, and 89.6% and 78.6% were free from distant intracranial progression, respectively. No difference was observed in local control or freedom from distant intracranial progression between the 5-fraction or 10-fraction groups. The median overall survival was 28.27 months (95% confidence interval, 19.42-37.12) for all patients. No patient developed necrosis at the resection cavity. Conclusions Fractionation offers the potential to exploit the different biological responses between neoplastic and normal tissues to ionizing radiation. The use of 5 daily doses of 5-6 Gy or 10 daily doses of 3 Gy is a good strategy to have a reasonable local control and avoid neurotoxicity.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1384,"Photocontact dermatitis from ketoprofen and tiaprofenic acid: Cross-reactivity study in 12 consecutive patients The arylpropionic acid derivatives (APADs) ketoprofen and tiaprofenic acid can provoke photoallergic dermatitis. Possible cross-reactivity between APADs is of importance in patients using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Because of the similarities in chemical structures, we investigated patients with photoallergy to ketoprofen or tiaprofenic acid, in order to study cross-reactivity between APADs and a possible pattern of cross-reactivity between benzophenone-containing molecules, so as to determine the molecular basis of photoallergy to ketoprofen or tiaprofenic acid. 10 patients with photoallergy to topical ketoprofen, 2 with photoallergy to oral tiaprofenic acid, and 15 control subjects with no history of contact dermatitis from APADs, nor from benzophenone-containing molecules, were photopatch tested in triplicate with ketoprofen, tiaprofenic acid, other APADs (alminoprofen, fenoprofen, flurbiprofen, ibuprofen and naproxen), benzophenone-containing molecules (fenofibrate, oxybenzone, sulisobenzone), and unsubstituted benzophenone. 1 set was irradiated with UVA light, 1 with solar-simulated irradiation and 1 dark control. Tests were read at 2, 3 and 4 days. Patients reacted to both ketoprofen and tiaprofenic acid (12/12), fenofibrate (8/12), oxybenzone (3/12) and unsubstituted benzophenone (11/12), but not to other APADs, nor to sulisobenzone. Tests remained negative in control patients. Photoallergy is due to the benzophenone moiety of ketoprofen, or to the very similar thiophene-phenylketone of tiaprofenic acid, but not to their arylpropionic function. This induces cross-reactivity to fenofibrate and oxybenzone but not to APADs without a benzophenone moiety, which may therefore probably be used in such patients. Unsubstituted benzophenone should be added to standard phototesting series.",Excluded
1727,"Suppression of voluntary motor activity revealed using transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex in man 1. Suppression of voluntary muscle activity of hand and arm muscles in response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex has been investigated in man. 2. Suppression could be elicited by low levels of TMS without any prior excitatory response. The latency of the suppression was 3-8 ms longer than the excitation observed at a higher stimulus intensity. The duration of the suppression ranged from 8 to 26 ms. 3. A circular stimulating coil was used to determine threshold intensity for excitation and suppression of contraction of thenar muscles in response to TMS at different locations over the motor cortex. The locations for lowest threshold excitation coincided with those for lowest threshold suppression. Suppression was elicited at a lower threshold than excitation at all locations. 4. A figure-of-eight stimulating coil was positioned over the left motor cortex at the lowest threshold point for excitation of the right thenar muscles. The orientation for the lowest threshold excitatory and inhibitory responses was the same for all subjects. That orientation induced a stimulating current travelling in an antero-medial direction. Suppression was invariably elicited at lower thresholds than excitation. 5. When antagonistic muscles (second and third dorsal interosseus) were co-contracted, TMS evoked coincident suppression of voluntary EMG in the two muscles without prior excitation of either muscle. This suggests that the suppression is not mediated via corticospinal activation of spinal interneurones. 6. Test responses to electrical stimulation of the cervical spinal cord were evoked in both relaxed and activated thenar muscles. In the relaxed muscle, prior TMS at an intensity that would suppress voluntary activity failed to influence the test responses, suggesting absence of inhibition at a spinal level. However, in the activated muscle, prior TMS could reduce the test response. This may be explained by disfacilitation of motoneurones due to inhibition of corticospinal output. 7. We propose that suppression of voluntary muscle activity by TMS is due in large part to activation of a mechanism within the motor cortex that reduces the corticospinal output to the muscle. It is concluded that TMS evokes excitation and inhibition via neuronal structures lying close to one another and having similar orientations.",Excluded

1429,"Does the effectiveness of recanalisation of chronic occlusion depend on the location of the obstruction? Aims: Reports concerning the efficacy of recanalisation of chronic coronary total occlusion (CTO) depending on occlusion site are inconsistent. Some of them indicate a lower effectiveness of recanalisation of the circumflex artery (Cx). Methods and Results: Between January 2011 and February 2015, 252 CTO procedures in 242 patients were performed. Characteristics of the occlusions, the procedures performed and the effectiveness of revascularisation among various coronary arteries were compared. In the study group, most of the patients were men - 201 (83.1%) - and 41 (16.9%) were women. The average age was 62.4+/-9.3 years. The incidence of the risk factors was: hypertension - 86.8% (n=211), hypercholesterolaemia - 99.1% (n=241), diabetes - 29.2% (n=71), smoking - 20.6% (n=50) and history of smoking - 58.0% (n=141). The artery most often opened was the right coronary artery (RCA) - 49.0% (n=125), followed by the left anterior descending (LAD) 32.9% (n=84) and the circumflex branch 18.1% (n=46). There were no differences in the duration of the occlusions among subsequent arteries. There was a difference in length of occlusion (mm): RCA - 30.5+/-13.5, LAD - 25.5+/-9.9, Cx - 20.2+/-8.3 (p<0.05 for all changes). J-CTO score for each coronary artery was as follows: 0 - 10.9% LAD (n=9) 23.9% Cx (n=11), 11.0% RCA (n=14); 1 - 31.7% LAD (n=26), 45.6% Cx (n=21), 22.8% RCA (n=29); 2 - LAD 37.8% (n=31), 19.6% Cx (n=9), 38.5% RCA (n=49); >=3 - LAD 19.5% (n=16), 10.9% Cx (n=5), 27.5% RCA (n=34). Mean J-CTO score for LAD was 2.19+/-0.95, for Cx 2.13+/-1.14, and for RCA 2.29+/-1.07 (p=NS between arteries). The longest procedure time of the revascularisation was PCI of the RCA (77.1+/-34.9 min, p<0.05 relative to the remaining vessels). Procedure time between the LAD (65.9+/-28.8 min) and the Cx (56.6+/-26 8 min) did not differ significantly. Fluoroscopy time was also the longest during PCI of the RCA (31.0+/-19.2 min, p<0.005 relative to other arteries), and did not differ between Cx (20.0+/-12.2 min) and LAD (25.3+/-16.8 min). There was no difference in the radiation dose (Gy): 2.5+/-1.7 vs. 2.2+/-1.3 vs. 2.5+/-1.3 (RCA, Cx and LAD, respectively) among vessels. The volume of contrast was similar during PCI of the RCA and LAD (365.8+/-161.6 vs. 371.3+/-149.4 mL, p=NS) and was significantly higher in comparison to PCI of the Cx (279.6+/-150.9 mL). The reverse technique (retrograde) was used most frequently during PCI of the RCA (30.4%, n=38), then LAD (19.1%, n=16) and significantly less during PCI of the Cx (4.4%, n=2). The number of implanted stents was significantly higher in PCI of the RCA (1.9+/-0.8) and did not differ between the LAD (1.3+/-0.6) and Cx (1.1+/-0.4). There was no difference in the incidence of complications depending on the artery opened: there was 1 stroke and 1 myocardial infarction during PCI of the RCA and 2 smaller perforations during PCI of the LAD and Cx. One tamponade was observed during PCI of the RCA. Efficacy of recanalisation was similar for all of the arteries: 82.4% for the RCA (n=103), 84.5% for the LAD (n=71), and 91.3% for the Cx (n=46). Conclusion(s): The most common artery we revascularised was the right coronary artery. It was characterised by the longest length of occlusion and required the longest procedure time and fluoroscopy time. Furthermore, it required the highest amount of contrast medium and number of implanted stents. Nevertheless, the efficacy was similar for all vessels.",Excluded
2448,"Extensive experience in the management of macroprolactinomas Objectives Macroprolactinomas are pituitary tumours that can be managed with dopamine agonists (DA), surgery and radiotherapy. We aimed to assess the outcomes of these treatment modalities. Design Retrospective case-note study of patients managed in a single tertiary referral centre. Patients One hundred patients (68 male) diagnosed with macroprolactinoma between 1971 and 2009. Measurements We assessed the response to first-line treatment in terms of reduction in serum prolactin, endocrine status, symptomatic improvement and tumour shrinkage. Patients were divided into a group that received only DA therapy and a group that received surgery, radiotherapy or both, with or without a DA. We compared pituitary function at baseline and at last clinic visit between the two groups. Results In total, there were 1170 patient years of follow-up. Pituitary surgery was performed in 29/100 patients. Fourteen patients received pituitary radiotherapy (8/14 surgery also). At last clinic visit, the nonmedical therapy group had a higher risk of gonadotrophin deficiency (77.4% vs 44.8%, P = 0.0037), TSH deficiency (54.8% vs 25.4%, P = 0.0009) and ACTH deficiency (56.2% vs 17.2%, P = 0.0001). When last reviewed, 23/29 (79.3%) patients who underwent surgery and 10/14 (71.4%) patients who received radiotherapy were taking a DA. Conclusions Treatment with a DA alone is associated with better outcomes in terms of pituitary function and as such represents the optimal first-line therapy for macroprolactinomas. Surgery and radiotherapy should be reserved for patients who are either intolerant of or resistant to DAs. Following surgery and/or radiotherapy, the majority of patients still require a DA for control of prolactin hypersecretion. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Excluded

2382,"Incidence of pain flare following palliative radiation therapy for symptomatic bone metastases: Multicenter prospective observational study Purpose/Objective(s): Palliative radiation therapy (RT) is a wellestablished treatment option for symptomatic bone metastases, with few treatment-related side effects. However, pain flare, a temporary worsening of bone pain in the irradiated metastatic site, has been recognized following RT. The aim of this study is to determine the incidence of pain flare following RT for painful bone metastases. Materials/Methods: Patients with bone metastases treated with RT were eligible. Worst pain scores and analgesic consumption were collected before, daily during, and for 10 days after treatment. Pain flare was defined as a 2-point increase in the worst pain score (0-10) compared to baseline with no decrease in analgesic intake, or a 25% increase in analgesic intake with no decrease in worst pain score. The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) was administered to measure the ""sensory"" dimension of pain (intensity, or severity) and its ""reactive"" dimension (interference with daily function) before the RT treatment and at the 4-weeks follow-up evaluation. Descriptive statistics were reported. Response rate and 95% confidence intervals were calculated at 4 weeks after RT. A comparison of patients with pain flare vs those without was performed. The relationships between the occurrence of pain flare and collected demographic variables were investigated. Result(s): From June 2010 to December 2013, 160 patients were enrolled in this study. From this cohort, 94 patients with complete data were evaluable for pain flare. There were 61 (65%) men and 33 (35%) women. Median age was 66 years. The majority of patients had primary breast (12%), lung (31%), or prostate (22%) carcinoma and were treated with 8 Gy in a single fraction (28%) or 20 Gy in five fractions (65%). The overall pain flare incidence across all centers was 42/94 (44.7%). The majority of pain flares occurred on Days 1-5 (88%) as opposed to Days 6-10 (12%). The median duration of the pain flare was 2 days. There was no significant difference between patients who experienced a pain flare vs those who did not in terms of sex, age, primary cancer site, radiation dose, previous systemic therapy, location or area of RT, or on any of the BPI items (p > 0.05). BPI scores showed a significant improvement at 4 weeks on all functional interference items (p < 0.05). The main differences were seen in the ""worst pain"" and ""sleep"" domains, both decreased from 7/10 at baseline to 4/10 at the 4-week follow-up. Conclusion(s): Pain flare is a common event, occurring in nearly half of the patients that receive palliative RT for symptomatic bone metastases. Furthermore, RT for symptomatic bone metastases is a very effective palliative treatment, in terms of both pain control and functional interference.",Excluded

Patients and Methods: In all, 74 patients were treated with IMRT and concurrent standard dose capecitabine. The dose of the planning target volume (PTV) encompassing the tumor, mesorectum, and pelvic lymph nodes was 46 Gy in 23 fractions; the boost PTV, at a dose of 57.5 Gy in 23 fractions, included the macroscopic primary tumor and pathological lymph nodes. The patients underwent surgery 6-8 weeks after chemoradiation. Result(s): The complete treatment data of 72 patients were analyzed. Tumor downstaging was achieved in 55 patients (76.38%) and node downstaging in 34 (47.2%). In 22 patients (30.6%), there was complete pathological response (ypCR). The circumferential resection margin was free of tumor in 70 patients (97.2%). The 3-year estimated overall survival and disease-free survival rates were 95.4 and 85.9% respectively, and no local relapse was found; however, ten patients (13.8%) developed distant metastases. High pathologic tumor (pT) downstaging was shown as a favorable prognostic factor for disease-free survival. No grade 4 acute radiotherapy-related toxicity was found. Conclusion(s): The IMRT and integrated-boost chemoradiation scheme offered higher rates of ypCR and pT downstaging, without a significant increase in toxicity. The circumferential margins were free of tumors in the majority of patients.

Final dose computation was also performed with a dedicated IMRT Monte Carlo dose engine (MCDE)., RESULTS: CS plans showed higher D(95%) (Gy) for the GTV (68.13 vs 67.36, p=0.004) and CTV (67.23 vs 66.87, p=0.028) with 18 than with 6 MV photons. MCDE computations demonstrated higher doses with 6 MV than 18 MV in D(95%) for the PTV (64.62 vs 63.64, p=0.009), PTV(optim) (65.48 vs 64.83, p=0.014) and CTV (66.22 vs 65.64, p=0.027). Dose inhomogeneity was lower with 18 than with 6 MV photons for GTV (0.08 vs 0.09, p=0.007) and CTV (0.10 vs 0.11, p=0.045) in CS but not MCDE plans. 6 MV photons significantly (D(33%); p=0.045) spared the esophagus in MCDE plans. Observed dose differences between lower and higher energy IMRT plans were dependent on the individual patient., CONCLUSIONS: Selection of photon energy depends on priority ranking of endpoints and individual patients. In the absence of highly accurate dose computation algorithms such as CS and MCDE, 6 MV photons may be the prudent choice.",Excluded

All patients underwent pulmonary CT angiography and CTV of the abdomen, pelvis, and lower extremities using 64-MDCT with automatic tube current modulation: 50 patients underwent CT at 120 kVp, the standard kVp setting, and 50 patients were scanned at 100 kVp; we refer to these groups as the ""standard-kVp group"" and the ""low-kVp group,"" respectively. Vessel enhancement and image noise were assessed in the inferior vena cava (IVC), femoral vein, and popliteal vein. Two radiologists who were blinded to the kVp setting placed the regions of interest on vessels by consensus and assessed image quality using a 5-point visual scale. Effective dose was estimated using the dose-length product. The Wilcoxon rank test was used to evaluate differences between the two groups using statistics software (JMP, version 5.1). A p value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance., RESULTS: Mean vascular enhancement was significantly higher in the low-kVp group than in the standard-kVp group: IVC, 138.4 +/- 12.2 (SD) HU versus 164.5 +/- 17.4 HU, respectively; femoral vein, 130.2 +/- 18.0 HU versus 152.0 +/- 24.5 HU; and popliteal vein, 136.7 +/- 17.5 HU versus 158.3 +/- 26.0 HU.

Result(s): A total of 33 patients started treatment with bevacizumab at our institution during the first 6 months after its approval in Germany. Three patients (9%) presented with severe bowel complications: two with acute ischemic colitis and one with gastrointestinal perforation with a fatal outcome. All 3 patients had undergone radiotherapy directed to the pelvis before treatment with bevacizumab. None of the 30 patients without bowel complications had been pretreated with infradiaphragmatic irradiation. Histologic evaluation of bowel biopsies and resection specimens revealed severe ischemic bowel damage as the pathophysiologic background of the clinical findings.

Nine patients required hospitalization, and 1 patient died., METHODS: To investigate the outbreak, pneumonia case patients were matched to control participants on the basis of age, sex, and community of residence. Participants in the investigation and their household contacts were interviewed, and serum samples and respiratory tract specimens were collected. Risk factors were evaluated by means of conditional logistic regression., RESULTS: Among 32 pneumonia case patients, 21 (65%) had confirmed or probable HAdV-14 infection. None of 32 matched control participants had evidence of HAdV-14 infection (P<.001 for the difference). Factors independently associated with pneumonia included contact with a known HAdV-14-infected case patient (odds ratio [OR], 18.3 [95% confidence interval {CI}, >or=2.0]), current smoking (OR, 6.7 [95% CI, >or=0.9]), and having neither traveled off the island nor attended a large public gathering (OR, 14.7 [95% CI, >or=2.0]). Fourteen (67%) of 21 HAdV-14-positive case patients belonged to a single network of people who socialized and often smoked together and infrequently traveled off the island. HAdV-14 infection occurred in 43% of case-patient household contacts, compared with 5% of control-participant household contacts (P = .005)., CONCLUSIONS: During a community outbreak in Alaska, HAdV-14 appeared to have spread mostly among close contacts and not widely in the community. Demographic characteristics and illness patterns among the case patients were similar to those observed in other recent outbreaks of HAdV-14 infection in the United States.",Excluded

All patients gave written informed consent for acquisition of additional image series at reduced radiation dose on a dual-source MDCT (80/140 kV) within 10 s after the standard of care acquisition. Dose reduction was achieved by reducing the quality reference milliampere-second, with combined angular exposure control. Four readers, blinded to all clinical data, evaluated the image sets. Image noise, signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratio were assessed. Volumetric CT dose index (CTDIvol), doselength product (DLP), size specific dose estimate, and effective dose were also recorded., RESULTS: The mean age and body mass index of the patients were 71 years +/- 9 and 24 kg m-2 +/- 3, respectively. Although images became noisier, overall image quality and image sharpness on blended images were considered good or excellent in all cases (20/20). All findings made on the reduced dose images presented with good demarcation. The intraobserver and interobserver agreements were kappa = 0.83 and 0.73, respectively.

1919,"Exposure to Radiation During Work Shifts and Working at Night Act as Occupational Stressors Alter Redox and Inflammatory Markers Background: Studies of breast cancer etiology suggest evidence that night shift working and occupational exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) are defined risk factors for breast cancer development. There are few studies to clarify neuroendocrine and inflammatory status and the possible consequences particularly in occupational exposure. Aim of the study. Our aim was to associate the redox and inflammatory biomarkers with either nightshift working or occupational radiation exposure, and to compare their levels between the two groups at Alexandria University Hospitals, Alexandria, Egypt. Method(s): We included 150 female nurses at Alexandria University Hospitals: 50 nightshift workers, 50 radiation workers, and 50 dayshift workers as a control group (neither work nightly nor radiation workers). In morning serum sample (7 am), we measured the concentrations of serum melatonin, Cortisol, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) by ELISA; malondialdehyde (MDA) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) levels colorimetrically, and C-reactive protein (C-RP) levels by turbidimetric method. Result(s): Nightshift workers had significantly lower levels of melatonin and TAC, and higher levels of serum inflammatory markers and cortisol, than day shift control group of workers.

1723,"The effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on cortical inhibition in healthy human subjects It has been suggested that the therapeutic effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) are mediated through changes in cortical inhibition (CI). However, in healthy human subjects the effects of rTMS on CI have been inconsistent. Therefore, this study sought to improve on the methodological limitations of previous studies by exploring several different rTMS-stimulus conditions on inhibition in the human motor cortex. In the first experiment, 12 healthy control subjects were randomly assigned to receive regular 1, 10 or 20 Hz rTMS in a counterbalanced order with sessions separated by at least 1 week. In the second experiment, 10 of these 12 subjects received priming rTMS (600 stimuli at 6 Hz followed by 600 stimuli at 1 Hz). Cortical inhibition was indexed using short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and cortical silent period (CSP). Corticospinal excitability was indexed using motor threshold and MEP amplitude. We found no significant overall change in SICI, although there was a significant correlation between changes in SICI with baseline SICI. Subjects with greater SICI at baseline tended to have reduction in SICI post-rTMS, whereas subjects with less SICI tended to have increase in SICI post-rTMS. There was also a significant lengthening of the CSP with higher stimulation frequencies compared to lower stimulation frequencies. These findings suggest that rTMS increases CI, particularly in subjects with reduced baseline inhibition, a finding consistent with the concept of homeostatic plasticity. Baseline physiological characteristics may be further explored as a method to select patients who may benefit from rTMS treatment.",Excluded
1742,"Diagnostic accuracy of 320-row multidetector computed tomography coronary angiography in the non-invasive evaluation of significant coronary artery disease Aims Multidetector computed tomography coronary angiography (CTA) has emerged as a feasible imaging modality for non-invasive assessment of coronary artery disease (CAD). Recently, 320-row CTA systems were introduced, with 16 cm anatomical coverage, allowing image acquisition of the entire heart within a single heart beat. The aim of the present study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of 320-row CTA in patients with known or suspected CAD. Methods and resultsA total of 64 patients (34 male, mean age 61 +/- 16 years) underwent CTA and invasive coronary angiography. All CTA scans were evaluated for the presence of obstructive coronary stenosis by a blinded expert, and results were compared with quantitative coronary angiography. Four patients were excluded from initial analysis due to non-diagnostic image quality. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values to detect >=50 luminal narrowing on a patient basis were 100, 88, 92, and 100, respectively. Moreover, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values to detect >=70 luminal narrowing on a patient basis were 94, 95, 88, and 98, respectively. With inclusion of non-diagnostic imaging studies, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values to detect >=50 luminal narrowing on a patient basis were 100, 81, 88, and 100, respectively. Conclusion The current study shows that 320-row CTA allows accurate non-invasive assessment of significant CAD. © 2010 The Author.",Excluded
2136,"[Comparative research of moxibustion and infrared method in testing heat-sensitive state at Xiaguan (ST 7) in primary trigeminal neuralgia] To explore the possibility of the infrared objective displaying of heat-sensitive state of acupoint. Fifty-four qualified subjects were enrolled. In the natural state, thermal tomography (TTM) was adopted to shoot the thermograms on the face. After the thermograms collection, the thermo-sensitive detection with moxibustion was applied. The suspending moxibustion with moxa stick was used at Xiaguan (ST 7, affected side) for 10 mm. The cases with heat extension and transmission at the acupoint were recorded at the end of moxibustion. In following, the second infrared radiation detection was done so as to record the changes in the infrared images on the face before and after moxibustion and compare the difference in the heat-sensitive state at Xiaguan (ST 7, affected side) in the subjects between two detection methods. Before moxibustion, the infrared radiation intensity at Xiaguan (ST 7, affected side) in the patients displayed mostly low temperature feature and its sensibility (true positive rate) was 65.6%, the specificity (true negative rate) was 68.2% and the accuracy was 66.7%. After moxibustion at Xiaguan (ST 7, affected side), there was an obvious block-diffused increment area of infrared radation along the cheek and its sensitivity (true positive rate) was 81.8%, the specificity (true negative rate) was 81.0% and the accuracy was 81.5% as compared with the moxibustion detection. (1) The heat-sensitive state at Xiaguan (ST 7, affected side) in the patients of primary trigeminal neuralgia can be objectively displayed by infrared imaging to a certain extent.

2026,"[Clinical significance of low-dose CT performed for three consecutive years in diagnosis of lung nodules in coal mine workers with 20 working years] Objective: To investigate the clinical significance of low-dose CT (LDCT) in coal mine workers with relatively long working years. Methods: A total of 907 coal mine workers with >=20 working years were enrolled, among whom there were 863 male and 44 female workers with a mean age of 49.5 years. Digital radiography (DR) was performed for these workers in 2013, and LDCT was performed for three consecutive years from 2014 to 2016. Results: A total of 32 workers were found to have lung nodules by DR in 2013, while in 2014, 269 workers were found to have non-calcified lung nodules by LDCT, and there was a significant difference in the number of workers with lung nodules (chi(2)=233.73, P<0.005) . There was also a significant difference in the detection rate of nodules between the workers with different working years of dust exposure (chi(2)=6.648, P=0.00) . The male workers had a significantly higher detection rate of nodules than the female workers (chi(2)=5.690, P=0.017) . There was no significant difference in the number of nodules between workers with different types of work (chi(2)=16.985, P=0.05) . There were 443 lung nodules in total, among which 71.56% were solid nodules and 55.75% had a size of <=4mm; malignant nodules were confirmed by surgery in 6 (0.66%) of the 907 workers after baseline LDCT. LDCT reexamination in 2015 and 2016 found new nodules in 8 workers and enlarged nodules in 3 workers, and there was no significant change in the number of nodules with a size of <=4 mm. Conclusions: It is necessary to perform high-risk population screening for coal mine workers by LDCT. The follow-up strategies for nodules with a size of <=4mm are the same as those for negative results; annual reexamination is recommended for nodules with a size of >4-8 mm, and clinical treatment should be considered for nodules with a size of >8 mm.",Excluded
1413,"A Comparative Evaluation of 3 Different Free-Form Deformable Image Registration and Contour Propagation Methods for Head and Neck MRI: The Case of Parotid Changes During Radiotherapy Purpose: To validate and compare the deformable image registration and parotid contour propagation process for head and neck magnetic resonance imaging in patients treated with radiotherapy using 3 different approaches-the commercial MIM, the open-source Elastix software, and an optimized version of it. Material(s) and Method(s): Twelve patients with head and neck cancer previously treated with radiotherapy were considered. Deformable image registration and parotid contour propagation were evaluated by considering the magnetic resonance images acquired before and after the end of the treatment. Deformable image registration, based on free-form deformation method, and contour propagation available on MIM were compared to Elastix. Two different contour propagation approaches were implemented for Elastix software, a conventional one (DIR_Trx) and an optimized homemade version, based on mesh deformation (DIR_Mesh). The accuracy of these 3 approaches was estimated by comparing propagated to manual contours in terms of average symmetric distance, maximum symmetric distance, Dice similarity coefficient, sensitivity, and inclusiveness. Result(s): A good agreement was generally found between the manual contours and the propagated ones, without differences among the 3 methods; in few critical cases with complex deformations, DIR_Mesh proved to be more accurate, having the lowest values of average symmetric distance and maximum symmetric distance and the highest value of Dice similarity coefficient, although nonsignificant. The average propagation errors with respect to the reference contours are lower than the voxel diagonal (2 mm), and Dice similarity coefficient is around 0.8 for all 3 methods. Conclusion(s): The 3 free-form deformation approaches were not significantly different in terms of deformable image registration accuracy and can be safely adopted for the registration and parotid contour propagation during radiotherapy on magnetic resonance imaging. More optimized approaches (as DIR_Mesh) could be preferable for critical deformations.Copyright © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",Excluded
1525,"Breast conservation in early and locally advanced breast cancer: Regional cancer centre, JIPMER experience Introduction and Objectives: Breast preservation is the standard care for early breast cancer. The therapeutic challenges of locally advanced stage are well recognized, especially increased risk of local recurrence. However, with introduction of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), significant tumour regression is achieved, thereby permitting breast conservation, hence a non-randomized single arm study was conducted. Material(s) and Method(s): From 2007 to 2014 one hundred & ten patients were recruited. 59 out of 110 underwent NACT. All underwent lumpectomy and axillary dissection & intraoperatively template guided rigid/flexible needle with 2 or 3 plane. After 2D/3D based CT - planning, HDR dose of 15-16 Gy/2 - 2.5 Gy/# BD given for 3-5 days. Whole breast irradiation (46-50 Gy) was delivered after a 2-3 weeks' gap. CTV & DHI parameters were studied. Acute skin toxicity assessed at end of treatment. Cosmetic assessment done at 3 months according to Harvard scale. Unpaired t and Chi-square tests were used for analysis of parameters. Result(s): The ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence rate was (5) 4.5% with median follow up 5.4 years. Mean D90 (91.5%) and V90 (90.7%). Mean V100 was 84.20%. DHI range 0.7-0.8. The ipsilateral breast except the CTV (Breast-CTV) received a mean dose of 33.2%. Mean dose received by heart was 7.2%. Mean dose received by contralateral breast was (V5%) 1.6% & (V10%) 0.08%. Mean dose received by ipsilateral lung was (V5%) 46% & 18% (V10%). Mean dose to skin is significantly 24.9% brachytherapy. Excellent/good overall cosmesis is observed in 69 patients and fair/poor cosmesis observed in 32 patients. Poor cosmesis was observed in 9 patients. Conclusion(s): Breast conservation treatment options show comparable local control with acceptable dosimetric parameters & cosmetic outcomes even in LABC. With careful patient selection, optimal treatment planning, and careful attention to excision margins & radiation doses, breast conservation can be performed in these patients without sacrificing local control of disease.",Excluded
2062,"Increased evidence for the prognostic value of FDG uptake on late-treatment PET in non-tumour-affected oesophagus in irradiated patients with oesophageal carcinoma PURPOSE: 18F-FDG uptake in irradiated non-tumour-affected oesophagus (NTO) on restaging PET is a potential surrogate for the measurement of radiation-induced inflammation. Radiation-induced inflammation itself has been shown to be of high prognostic relevance in patients undergoing preoperative radiochemotherapy (RCT) for locally advanced oesophageal cancer. We assessed the prognostic relevance of FDG uptake in the NTO in an independent cohort of patients treated with definitive RCT., METHODS: This retrospective evaluation included 72 patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated with definitive RCT with curative intent. All patients underwent pretreatment and restaging FDG PET after receiving a radiation dose of 40-50 Gy. Standardized uptake values (SUVmax/SUVmean), metabolic tumour volume (MTV) and relative changes from pretreatment to restaging PET (SUVmax/SUVmean) were determined within the tumour and NTO. Univariate Cox regression with respect to overall survival (OS), local control (LC), distant metastases (DM) and treatment failure (TF) was performed. Independence of parameters was tested by multivariate Cox regression., RESULTS: SUVmax NTO and MTV were prognostic factors for all investigated clinical endpoints (OS, LC, DM, TF). Inclusion of clinical and PET tumour parameters in multivariate analysis showed that SUVmax NTO was an independent prognostic factor. Furthermore, multivariate analysis of SUVmax NTO using previously published cut-off values from preoperatively treated patients revealed that SUVmax NTO was independent prognostic factor for OS (HR = 1.88, p = 0.038), TF (HR = 2.11, p = 0.048) and DM (HR = 3.02, p = 0.047)., CONCLUSION: NTO-related tracer uptake during the course of treatment in patients with oesophageal carcinoma was shown to be of high prognostic relevance. Thus, metabolically activity of NTO measured in terms of SUVmax NTO is a potential candidate for future treatment individualization (i.e. organ preservation).",Excluded
1867,"Long-haul flights, edema, and thrombotic events: Prevention with stockings and Pycnogenol supplementation (LONFLIT Registry Study) BACKGROUND: This registry study evaluated the effects of Pycnogenol on edema and thrombotic complications in long-haul flights; jet lag was also evaluated. METHOD(S): Four hundred and fifty subjects at different risk levels for thrombosis, flying in economy class twice in less than a week for more than 8 hours, were included; 295 completed the registry study and were subdivided in 3 groups according to their risk level - low, moderate, or high. The high-risk group also received Aspirin. Astandard management (SM) was used in all groups. In each risk category, three groups were made according to patient management: A Pycnogenol group, a SM group (control), and a stockings group. The groups were comparable at inclusion. No side effects were observed. RESULT(S): In the low risk group edema were reduced more (P<0.05) with Pycnogenol and stockings compared to control. Ankle circumference was smaller with Pycnogenol (P<0.05). No thrombosis was detected. D-dimer was negative in Pycnogenol subjects; one subject in the control group had increased values, as did two of the 36 subjects in the stockings group. In the group with moderate risk, edema and ankle circumference were lower in the Pycnogenol group (P<0.05). One deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and one minimal superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) was seen in controls. D-dimer was normal in the Pycnogenol group. In high-risk subjects, edema, and ankle circumference were significantly reduced in the Pycnogenol group (P<0.05). There were no SVT or DVT in the Pycnogenol group. One minimal DVT and one SVT were observed in controls. D-dimer was negative in all Pycnogenol subjects (P<0.05); three post-flight values increased in controls and in four of the 32 subjects in the stockings group. The jet lag score was lower in low-, medium-, and high-risk Pycnogenol subjects (P<0.05). CONCLUSION(S): This registry study indicates that Pycnogenol supplementation reduces edema and may control some thrombotic events.Copyright © 2017 Edizioni Minerva Medica.",Excluded
2345,"Derivation and validation of the Asian ureteral stent length guide Background and objectives Choice of stent length remains subjective despite the maturity of the procedure and incorrect stent length adversely affects quality of life. We aim to determine the ureteral length of the Malaysian population using CT measurement and to derive an ideal stent length guide based on body height. Materials and methods Phase-1 enrolled 118 patients. Bilateral ureteral lengths were measured by CT scan from the level of the renal vein to VUJ. They were grouped according to body height and median length for each were obtained. Phase-2 was a prospective randomisedtrial involving 60 patients undergoing ureteral stenting. 6F Double-J stents were used and choice of length in Group A was based on the devised guide; and using intraoperative ureteral length measurement with 5F catheter in Group B. Fluoroscopy time was recorded. Intravesical position of stent was determined by postoperative X-ray. USSQ score, were analysed two-weeks postoperatively. Results The median right and left ureteral length for male patients were 20.9 cm (18-27) and 21.3 cm (17-27); for female patients they were 20.7 cm (16-24) and 22.0 (17-25) respectively. Phase one concluded that double-J stents of 22 cm in length were suitable for all but men >=170 cm and women >=160 cm where a 24 cm stent is more appropriate. In Phase-2, median age was 49 (17-71) and median height of male and female patients were 165 cm (152-175) and 149 cm (140- 172) respectively. Fluoroscopy time is significantly shorter in Group A (3.03 vs 6.43 s, P = 0.001) and incidence of the distal loop crossing the midline was lower (0 vs 11, P < 0.001). Total USSQ score was better in Group A (60 vs 83, P = 0.001) particularly in urinary symptoms (P = 0.004) and pain (P < 0.001) subdomains. Stent migration was not encountered in both groups. Conclusion The devised ideal ureteral stent length guide for Malaysian adults is reliable, reduces procedural fluoroscopy time and curtails the incidence of post-procedural stent-related symptoms.",Excluded

2438,"Treatment of stage III non-small cell lung cancer patients with concurrent chemotherapy and radiation (70 Gy): Equivalent or superior to 60 or 74 Gy of RTOG 0617? Purpose/Objective(s): RTOG 0617 demonstrated inferior outcomes with 74 Gy of concurrent radiation (RT) and chemotherapy (CT) compared to 60 Gy, though the findings are controversial. We hypothesized that an intermediate RT dose might reach equipoise and improve outcomes versus 60 Gy or 74 Gy. This retrospective single institution analysis analyzed patients treated uniformly with 70 Gy/concurrent CT. Materials/Methods: Records from 216 consecutive patients with Stage III NSCLC treated from 2000 to 2015 with concurrent CTand RT (70 Gy) were reviewed. Patient demographics, tumor/treatment details and outcomes were abstracted. Local failure (LF), regional failure (RF), distant failure (DF), disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier univariate (UVA) and Cox-regression multivariate (MVA) analyses. Predictors of toxicity were evaluated by Pearson Chi-Square. Result(s): Median follow-up was 18 months. Median age was 63 years; 53% were female. Histology: adenocarcinoma (49%), squamous cell carcinoma (32%), other (19%). Patients were mostly stage IIIB (50.4%), T3/T4 (53.7%), N2 (64%) and N3 (28%), and were ECOG 0 (33%), 1 (56%), and 2 (11%) at diagnosis. CT included platinum doublets (94%), weekly (52%), induction (12%) and consolidative (22%) therapy. Median OS was 26 months and 2-yr survival was 58.1%. The 2-yr OS for IIIA and IIIB patients was 61.8% and 42.4%, respectively. The overall 2-yr LF, RF, and DF rates were 30.4%, 32.9% and 54.9%, respectively. 2-yr DFS was 28.8%. In UVA, ECOG predicted for LF (PZ0.004) and RF (PZ0.006). DF was associated with N stage (N0/1/2 vs. N3; P = 0.013), ECOG (P = 0.03) and IIIA vs. IIIB (P = 0.011). N stage (P = 0.041), ECOG (PZ0.0001) and overall stage (PZ0.007) were predictive of DFS. Stage (P = 0.003) and ECOG (P = 0.002) predicted for improved OS. ECOG was significant on MVA for LF, RF, DF, DFS and OS, while N stage was predictive for RF, DF, DFS and OS. Toxicity was manageable: 10.6% had Grade 3 esophagitis and 15.7% and 1.9% had Grade 2 or 3 pneumonitis with no Grade 4/5 events. Esophageal ulceration and dilation rates were 16.2% and 10.6%, respectively. Esophagitis grade was predictive of ulceration (P = 0.0001) or dilation (P = 0.0001). N stage (P = 0.008) and overall stage (P = 0.022) were predictive of pneumonitis grade. Conclusion(s): Patients in our cohort were frailer and had more advanced disease than the 0617 patients. Despite this, we demonstrate that CT with an intermediate RT dose of 70 Gy leads to better outcomes than the 74 Gy arm in RTOG 0617 with less esophageal toxicity. Preliminary analysis suggests that omission of ECOG-2 patients leads to superior outcomes for 70 Gy compared with the 60 Gy patients in 0617; analysis is ongoing. ECOG was a major determinant of survival outcomes.",Excluded
1354,"Tolerance of centrifuge-simulated suborbital spaceflight by medical condition Introduction: We examined responses of volunteers with known medical disease to G forces in a centrifuge to evaluate how potential commercial spaceflight participants (SFPs) might tolerate the forces of spaceflight despite significant medical history. Method(s): Volunteers were recruited based upon suitability for each of five disease categories (hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, lung disease, back or neck problems) or a control group. Subjects underwent seven centrifuge runs over 2 d. Day 1 consisted of two +Gz runs (peak 5 +3.5 Gz, Run 2) and two +Gx runs (peak = +6.0 Gx, Run 4). Day 2 consisted of three runs approximating suborbital spaceflight profiles (combined +Gx and +Gz, peak = +6.0 Gx/+4.0 Gz). Data collected included blood pressure, electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry, neurovestibular exams, and post-run questionnaires regarding motion sickness, disorientation, grayout, and other symptoms. Result(s): A total of 335 subjects registered for participation, of which 86 (63 men, 23 women, age 20-78 yr) participated in centrifuge trials. The most common causes for disqualification were weight and severe and uncontrolled medical or psychiatric disease. Five subjects voluntarily withdrew from the second day of testing: three for anxiety reasons, one for back strain, and one for time constraints. Maximum hemodynamic values recorded included HR of 192 bpm, systolic BP of 217 mmHg, and diastolic BP of 144 mmHg. Common subjective complaints included grayout (69%), nausea (20%), and chest discomfort (6%). Despite their medical history, no subject experienced significant adverse physiological responses to centrifuge profiles.

1853,"Cytoplasmic chromatin triggers inflammation in senescence and cancer Chromatin is traditionally viewed as a nuclear entity that regulates gene expression and silencing. However, we recently discovered the presence of cytoplasmic chromatin fragments that pinch off from intact nuclei of primary cells during senescence, a form of terminal cell-cycle arrest associated with pro-inflammatory responses. The functional significance of chromatin in the cytoplasm is unclear. Here we show that cytoplasmic chromatin activates the innate immunity cytosolic DNA-sensing cGAS-STING (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase linked to stimulator of interferon genes) pathway, leading both to short-term inflammation to restrain activated oncogenes and to chronic inflammation that associates with tissue destruction and cancer. The cytoplasmic chromatin-cGAS-STING pathway promotes the senescence-associated secretory phenotype in primary human cells and in mice. Mice deficient in STING show impaired immuno-surveillance of oncogenic RAS and reduced tissue inflammation upon ionizing radiation. Furthermore, this pathway is activated in cancer cells, and correlates with pro-inflammatory gene expression in human cancers. Overall, our findings indicate that genomic DNA serves as a reservoir to initiate a pro-inflammatory pathway in the cytoplasm in senescence and cancer. Targeting the cytoplasmic chromatin-mediated pathway may hold promise in treating inflammation-related disorders.Copyright © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

1420,"IMRT/VMAT for malignancies in the head-and-neck region : Outcome in patients aged 80 OBJECTIVE: Elderly patients with malignant head-and-neck tumors (HNT) often pose a therapeutic challenge. They frequently have significant comorbidities which may influence their ability to tolerate tumor-specific therapies. Our aim was to investigate the outcome of patients aged 80+ years undergoing curative intent intensity- or volume-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT/VMAT)., METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed our HNT patients aged 80+ treated with curative IMRT/VMAT from December 2003 to November 2015. Overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), local control (LC), and treatment tolerance were assessed. Outcome results were compared with that of a younger HNT patient cohort from our hospital., RESULTS: A total of 140 consecutive patients were included (65 postoperative, 75 definitive). Mean/median age at treatment start was 84.8/84.1 years (range 80-96 years). Mean/median follow-up time was 25/16 months (range 2-92 months). Of the 140 patients, 80 were alive with no evidence of disease when last seen, 28 had died due to the cancer, 12 remained alive with disease, the remaining 20 died intercurrently. Systemic concomitant therapy was administered in 7 %. Late grade 3-4 toxicity was observed in 2 %. All patients completed treatment. Hospitalization and feeding tube rates were 26 % and 11 %, respectively. The 2-/3-year LC, DFS, and OS rates for the entire cohort were 81/80 %, 69/63 %, and 68/66 %, respectively. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) patients showed an inferior 3-year OS rate as compared to non-SCC patients (62 % vs 77 %, p = 0.0002), while LC and DFS did not differ. Patients undergoing postoperative radiation attained a higher OS compared to the definitively irradiated subgroup with 74 vs. 60 % at 3 years (p = 0.01); however, DFS rates were similar for both groups (68 vs. 61 %, p = 0.15). Corresponding rates for >1400 HNT patients <80 years treated during the same time interval were 81/80 %, 69/67 %, and 77/72 %, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Treatment tolerance in our patients aged 80+ was high. These results suggest that elderly HNT patients should not be denied potentially curative treatment strategies.",Excluded
1966,"Should hospitals protect from geopathogenic zones? The belief that geopathogenic zones exist and could cause morbidity is widespread. It is increasing even among physicians. Presently, in health care it is going to even gain an economical dimension by causing investment costs for claimed protective means and by influencing hospital planning, design and management. Therefore, this issue is no longer just a private borderline issue but has become publicly relevant. In view of the fact that relevant studies are lacking, it deserves scientific clarification. In a double-blind study this hypothesis was tested by two different approaches: First, it was investigated whether location-bound biologic effects could be identified at all. To remain independent from dowsers, an investigation area of 35 m(2) was chosen which was large enough to ensure the presence of at least one postulated adverse zone. This area was scanned in 0.5 m intervals by monitoring bioparameters such as skin resistance, reaction time and heart rate variability in 43 volunteers. Skeptics were excluded. Location-dependent changes were investigated by point-by point analysis of local data distributions and by analysing the two-dimensional spatial distributions of the measured bioparameters by cross-correlation analysis. In a second approach, 5 independent experienced dowsers were asked to locate geopathogenic zones within the area both to verify the adequate choice of the area and to correlate the pattern of dowser's scorings with the patterns of biosignal distributions. Neither of these approaches showed statistical significant differences. The investigation did not confirm the hypothesis that local geopathogenic zones existed and, hence, would need protective actions.",Excluded
2181,"Weight-adapted iodinated contrast media administration in abdomino-pelvic CT: Can image quality be maintained? Introduction In many centres, a fixed method of contrast-media administration is used for CT regardless of patient body habitus. The aim of this trial was to assess contrast enhancement of the aorta, portal vein, liver and spleen during abdomino-pelvic CT imaging using a weight-adapted contrast media protocol compared to the current fixed dose method. Methods Thirty-nine oncology patients, who had previously undergone CT abdomino-pelvic imaging at the institution using a fixed contrast media dose, were prospectively imaged using a weight-adapted contrast media dose (1.4 ml/kg). The two sets of images were assessed for contrast enhancement levels (HU) at locations in the liver, aorta, portal vein and spleen during portal-venous enhancement phase. The t-test was used to compare the difference in results using a non-inferiority margin of 10 HU. Results When the contrast dose was tailored to patient weight, contrast enhancement levels were shown to be non-inferior to the fixed dose method (liver p < 0.001; portal vein p = 0.003; aorta p = 0.001; spleen p = 0.001). As a group, patients received a total contrast dose reduction of 165 ml using the weight-adapted method compared to the fixed dose method, with a mean cost per patient of 6.81 and 7.19 respectively. Conclusion Using a weight-adapted method of contrast media administration was shown to be non-inferior to a fixed dose method of contrast media administration. Patients weighing 76 kg, or less, received a lower contrast dose which may have associated cost savings. A weight-adapted contrast media protocol should be implemented for portal-venous phase abdomino-pelvic CT for oncology patients with adequate renal function (>70 ml/min/1.73 m2).Copyright © 2017",Excluded
2410,"Radiation exposure to the surgeon during open lumbar microdiscectomy and minimally invasive microdiscectomy: A prospective, controlled trial Study Design.: This is a prospective in vivo study comparing radiation exposure to the surgeon during 10 minimally invasive lumbar microdiscectomy cases with 10 traditional open discectomy cases as a control. Objective.: Radiation exposure to the eye, chest, and hand of the operating surgeon during minimally invasive surgery (MIS) and open lumbar microdiscectomy were measured. The Occupational Exposure Guidelines were used to calculate the allowable number of cases per year from the mean values at each of the 3 sites. Summary of Background Data.: Fluoroscopy is a source of ionizing radiation and as such, is a potential health hazard with continued exposure during surgery. Presently, radiation exposure to the surgeon during MIS lumbar microdiscectomy is unknown. Methods.: Radiation exposure to the surgeon (millirads [mR]) per case was measured by digital dosimeters placed at the level of the thyroid/eye, chest, and dominant forearm. Other data collected included operative side and level, side of the surgeon, side of the x-ray source, total fluoroscopy time, and energy output. Results.: The average radiation exposure to the surgeon during open cases was thyroid/eye 0.16 +/- 0.22 mR, chest 0.21 +/- 0.23 mR, and hand 0.20 +/- 0.14 mR. During minimally invasive cases exposure to the thyroid/eye was 1.72 +/- 1.52 mR, the chest was 3.08 +/- 2.93 mR, and the hand was 4.45 +/- 3.75 mR. The difference between thyroid/ eye, chest, and hand exposure during open and minimally invasive cases was statistically significant (P = 0.010, P = 0.013, and P = 0.006, respectively). Surgeons standing in an adjacent substerile room during open cases were exposed to 0.2 mR per case. Conclusion.: MIS lumbar microdiscectomy cases expose the surgeon to significantly more radiation than open microdiscectomy. One would need to perform 1623 MIS microdiscectomies to exceed the exposure limit for whole-body radiation, 8720 cases for the lens of the eye, and 11,235 cases for the hand. Standing in a substerile room during x-ray localization in open cases is not fully protective. Copyright © 2011 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

2366,"Risk Factor Assessment for the Development of Osteoradionecrosis Purpose: Osteoradionecrosis (ORN) of the jaws has been extensively studied. However, controversy still exists regarding its etiology, risk factors, and the underlying mechanism of disease. The purpose of this study was to identify and evaluate significant risk factors for the development of ORN. Patients and Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of 82 Massachusetts General Hospital patients radiated for head and neck cancer between 1984 and 2005. Patient records were reviewed to collect demographic information, medical and dental history (including dental intervention or trauma), tumor specific data, treatment details, and follow-up. Biologic variables (ie, age and gender) of potential significance were also evaluated. The major outcome variable was the development of ORN or lack of development of ORN. The time from radiation to ORN, or for non-ORN patients, time to last follow-up visit, was computed. Univariate analyses identified candidate variables associated with ORN (P < .15). Cox proportional hazards regression was used to evaluate these candidate variables as well as biologically relevant variables. Significant prognostic factors for the development of ORN (P < .05) were identified. Result(s): Multivariate regression identified the following variables as significantly associated with decreased ORN risk: higher body mass index (P = .02) and use of steroids (P = .02). Radiation dose greater than 66 Gray (P = .03) was associated with an increased ORN risk. Conclusion(s): Optimization of nutritional status, use of steroids, and limitation of total radiation dose may minimize the risk of ORN. © 2007 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.",Excluded
1773,"Occurrence of Phosphenes in Patients Undergoing Proton Beam Therapy for Ocular Tumor Purpose: Phosphenes are frequently reported by patients irradiated in the head and neck area. The aim of the present study was to characterize and investigate potential mechanisms of proton beam therapy (PBT)-induced phosphenes in a large population of patients undergoing PBT for ocular tumors. Design(s): Prospective cohort study. Method(s): Consecutive patients who underwent PBT in a single center were included. Immediately after the first session, all patients completed a questionnaire collecting information about the presence of phosphenes as well as their color, shape, and duration. Patient, tumor and treatment characteristics (dose volume histograms) were also collected. Result(s): Among the 474 patients included, 62.8% reported phosphenes during the first session of PBT. Reported colors were mainly blue-violet (70.5%) and white (14.1%). The prevalence of phosphenes was higher in younger patients (P =.003); other patient or ocular characteristics were not associated with the occurrence of phosphenes. Irradiation of the macula (P <.001) and/or optic disc (P <.001) were significantly associated with the presence of phosphenes, whereas blue-violet color was only associated with young age and irradiation of macular area (P =.04). Pupillary constriction was reported for 57.1% of patients with phosphenes vs 18.5% of patients without (P <.001). Blue-violet phosphenes (P <.001) and irradiation of macula (P =.001) were statistically associated with pupillary constriction. Conclusion(s): The present study reported a high rate of phosphenes in patients irradiated by PBT for ocular tumor. Their blue-violet color and their association with a pupillary constriction probably indicates the stimulation of S-cones and retinal ganglion cells that reflects the activation of the afferent visual pathway.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1672,"Intravascular radiation accelerates atherosclerotic lesion formation of hypercholesteremic rabbits OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the effect of intravascular radiation (IR) on the arterial wall of uninjured vessels in the hypercholesteremic rabbit model., METHODS: Aortas of 24 New Zealand white rabbits were treated with either intravascular 192-Ir gamma-radiation (15 Gy at 2 mm from the center of the source) or were exposed to the source catheter without radiation (sham controls). Following the radiation treatment, the animals were fed a 2% cholesterol diet until euthanasia at 2 (n=8) or 6 (n=16) weeks. Arteries were analyzed using light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM); transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) 1, a promoter of connective tissue deposition, was also monitored., RESULTS: At 2 weeks, SEM analysis showed well-aligned endothelial cells in nonradiated segments, whereas irradiated arteries consistently contained adherent and subendothelial macrophages with focal areas of endothelial disruption. Further radiated segments at 2 weeks showed a 7-fold increase in active TGF beta-1 over nonradiated segments. At 6 weeks, there was a significant increase in plaque and vessel wall area relative to control arteries, however, no differences were noted in the density of actin-positive smooth muscle cells (SMCs) or macrophages. Similarly, no differences were noted in cell proliferation between groups as evidenced by the marker bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). In contrast, nonirradiated segments frequently contained cellular areas with extracellular lipid., CONCLUSION: Exposure of previously uninjured vessels to IR and hypercholesterolemia is associated with increased plaque burden and leads to more advanced plaque types. Special care should be taken to minimize radiation exposure in normal vascular segments in hypercholesterolemic patients undergoing radiation therapy.",Included
2332,"Clinical factors increasing radiation doses to patients undergoing long-lasting procedures: Abdominal stent-graft implantation Background: An important negative factor of EVAR is the radiation acquired during long-lasting procedures. The aim of the study was to document the radiation doses of EVAR and to discuss potential reasons for prolongation of radiological procedures. Material/Methods: Dose-area product (DAP) (Gy cm2) and air kerma (AK) (Gy) obtained during EVAR from 92 patients were analyzed retrospectively in regards to body mass index (BMI), angulations of aneurysm neck, length of aneurysm neck and occurrence of tortuosity of iliac arteries. Result(s): Total AK for fuoroscopy differed signifcantly between normal BMI (373 mGy) and BMI 25-29.9 (1125 mGy) or BMI >30 (1085 mGy). Iliac artery tortuosities >45degree and short aneurysm necks caused higher doses of total AK (1097 mGy and 1228 mGy, respectively) than iliac artery tortuosities <45degree and long aneurysm necks (605 mGy and 720 mGy, respectively). Conclusion(s): The main factors contributing to a high radiation dose being acquired by patients during EVAR are: BMI >25, tortuosity of iliac arteries >45degree and short aneurysm necks. © Med Sci Monit, 2011.",Excluded
1631,"Transfusion of irradiated red blood cell units with a potassium adsorption filter: A randomized controlled trial BACKGROUND: The irradiation of red blood cells (RBCs) causes damage of the RBC membrane with increased potassium (K) leak during storage compared with nonirradiated RBC units of similar age. A previous in vitro study showed a mean reduction of K of 94 +/- 5% with a potassium adsorption filter (PAF)., STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A prospective, single-center, nonblinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of transfusing irradiated RBC units with the PAF. Patients 18 years of age or older who received irradiated RBC units due to chemotherapy-induced anemia were randomly assigned to receive irradiated RBC units with the PAF (PAF group) or with the standard blood infusion set (control group). Primary outcome measures were safety and efficacy of the PAF (absolute change in hemoglobin [Hb] and K, respectively, in patient's blood values after transfusing the irradiated RBC units with or without the PAF)., RESULTS: A total of 63 irradiated RBC units were transfused to 17 patients in the control group, and a total of 56 irradiated RBC units were transfused to 13 patients in the PAF group. The absolute change of Hb (9.3 +/- 6.3 g/L vs. 8.1 +/- 5.8 g/L; p = 0.3) and the absolute change of K (-0.01 +/- 0.4 mmol/L vs. -0.01 +/- 0.3 mmol/L; p = 0.2) were comparable between the two groups of the trial., CONCLUSION: The transfusion of 1 irradiated RBC unit with the PAF was as safe and efficacious as the transfusion of 1 irradiated RBC unit with the standard blood infusion set in patients with chemotherapy-induced anemia.

1788,"Extracranial radiosurgery with volumetric modulated arc therapy: Feasibility evaluation of a phase I trial The aim of this study was to report early clinical experience in stereotactic body radiosurgery (SBRS) delivered using volumetric intensity modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in patients with primary or metastatic tumors in various extra-cranial body sites. Each enrolled subject was included in a different phase I study arm, depending on the tumor site and the disease stage (lung, liver, bone, metastatic), and sequentially assigned to a particular dose level. Technical feasibility and dosimetric results were investigated. The acute toxicity, tumor response and early local control were also studied. In total, 25 lesions in 20 consecutive patients (male/female, 11/9; median age, 67 years; age range, 47-86 years) were treated. Of these 25 lesions, 4 were primary or metastatic lung tumors, 6 were liver metastases, 8 were bone metastases and 7 were nodal metastases. The dose-volume constraints for organs at risk (OARs) were observed in 19 patients using a single-arc technique. Only in one patient were two arcs required. The treatment was performed without interruption or any other technical issues. The prescribed dose ranged from 12-26 Gy to the planning target volume (PTV). Delivery time ranged from 4 min to 9 min and 13 sec (median, 6 min and 6 sec). No incidence of grade 2-4 acute toxicity was recorded. The overall response rate was 48% (95% confidence interval (CI), 24.2-70.2) based on computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 89% (95% CI, 58.6-98.7) based on the positron emission tomography (PET) scan.

1653,"CyberKnife radiosurgery for breast cancer spine metastases: A matched-pair analysis BACKGROUND. There are few options for breast cancer patients with spinal metastases recurrent within a previous radiation treatment field. CyberKnife radiosurgery has been used in our institution to treat such patients. To evaluate their outcomes, as there are no comparable radiation treatment options, the outcomes were compared between 18 patients with spinal metastases from breast cancer treated with CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery, 17 of which had prior radiotherapy to the involved spinal region and were progressing, and 18 matched patients who received conventional external beam radiotherapy (CRT) up-front for spinal metastases. METHODS. Radiosurgery was delivered in 3 to 5 fractions to doses ranging from 2100 to 2800 cGy. Women were matched to patients in a CRT group with respect to time from original diagnosis to diagnosis of metastases, estrogen receptor / progesterone receptor (ER/PR) status, presence or absence of visceral metastases, prior radiotherapy, and prior chemotherapy. Survival and complications were compared between treatment groups. Surviving patients were followed out to 24 months. RESULTS. The CyberKnife and CRT groups were comparable along all matching dimensions and in performance status before treatment. Outcomes of treatment were similar for patients in both groups; ambulation, performance status, and pain worsened similarly across groups posttreatment. Survival and the number of complications appeared to favor the CyberKnife group, but the differences did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS. The statistical comparability of the CyberKnife and CRT groups reflects the small sample size and stringent requirements for significance of the matched-pair analysis. Nevertheless, comparability in these difficult cases shows that salvage CyberKnife treatment is as efficacious as initial CRT without added toxicity. © 2007 American Cancer Society.",Excluded
1334,"ID: 3522009 NON-RADIATION EUS-BASED ERCP FOR CHOLEDOCHOLITHIASIS Background: ERCP inherently involves ionizing radiation exposure to the patient and operating staff. Non-radiation EUS-based ERCP was developed and previously reported by our group. We assessed the feasibility, safety, and outcomes of non-radiation ERCP in consecutive patients with choledocholithiasis. Method(s): Retrospective review of a prospectively collected database of consecutive patients treated by non-radiation -ERCP over a 33-month period (February 2018 to November 2020). Exclusion criteria: Surgically altered anatomy. Prior to ERCP, EUS with a standard echoendoscope was performed to document the presence, number, and size of stones. The echoendoscope was exchanged for a duodenoscope. Free-hand deep cannulation with an ultra-tapered tip sphincterotome was performed without fluoroscopy. Bile duct access was verified by visible bile aspiration. Aspiration of clear fluid indicated pancreatic duct (PD) cannulation. Precut was performed if the PD was cannulated 3 times. For stone extraction, a sphincterotomy length tailored to stone size was performed using pure cutting current. Stone(s) were removed using a 22mm Dormia basket. Clearance was confirmed by water irrigation method (water ""gush"") with optional cholangioscopy. The number of stones extracted was matched to the number seen on EUS. Result(s): Non-radiation ERCP was performed in 55 consecutive patients (69.10+17.56yrs, 20M:35F) by a single operator (KFB). Bile duct cannulation was successful in all (100%). Precut was performed in 9 patients. Complete stone removal was achieved in all. Procedural time was 24+23 min with 100% technical success. Follow up was 39 + 24 weeks in 35 patients: 35 had no adverse events and remained asymptomatic (1 patient deceased at 8 weeks post procedure). Follow-up incomplete in 20 patients.

1547,"Functional and quality-of-life outcomes after reirradiation for head and neck cancer Objectives/Hypothesis To examine functional and quality-of-life outcomes for patients treated by reirradiation to the head and neck for recurrent or new primary cancers. Study Design Retrospective review. Methods The University of Washington Quality of Life Instrument (UW-QOL) scores were reviewed with swallow evaluations for 17 patients with biopsy-proven recurrent or new primary squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck treated with reirradiation who were clinically without evidence of disease at a minimum follow-up of 1 year. All patients had received their initial radiation therapy to a median dose of 66 Gy (range, 60-72 Gy). The median interval between radiation courses was 30 months (range, 6-132 months). The median reirradiation dose was 60 Gy (range, 54-70 Gy). Results At 1 year after reirradiation, the mean UW-QOL composite score was 67.0 (range, 22.1-83.5), which did not differ significantly from baseline (P=.57). The proportion of patients who rated their global quality of life as ""very good"" or ""outstanding"" at 1 year after reirradiation was 35%. The percentage of patients who reported their global quality of life as ""good/fair"" and ""poor/very poor"" were 59% and 6%, respectively. Conclusions The majority of survivors in this highly selected series were devoid of new impairment after reirradiation and were satisfied with their functional status. Although nearly all patients had side effects from their prior radiation course prior to reirradiation, no patient reported a decline in global quality of life from before reirradiation to 1 year post-treatment. © 2013 The American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc.",Excluded

1994,"Outcomes and toxicities of definitive radiotherapy and reirradiation using 3-dimensional conformal or intensity-modulated (pencil beam) proton therapy for patients with nasal cavity and paranasal sinus malignancies BACKGROUND: Proton therapy (PT) improves outcomes in patients with nasal cavity (NC) and paranasal sinus (PNS) cancers. Herein, the authors have reported to their knowledge the largest series to date using intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) in the treatment of these patients., METHODS: Between 2013 and 2018, a total of 86 consecutive patients (68 of whom were radiation-naive and 18 of whom were reirradiated) received PT to median doses of 70 grays and 67 grays relative biological effectiveness, respectively. Approximately 53% received IMPT., RESULTS: The median follow-up was 23.4 months (range, 1.7-69.3 months) for all patients and 28.1 months (range, 2.3-69.3 months) for surviving patients. The 2-year local control (LC), distant control, disease-free survival, and overall survival rates were 83%, 84%, 74%, and 81%, respectively, for radiation-naive patients and 77%, 80%, 54%, and 66%, respectively for reirradiated patients. Among radiation-naive patients, when compared with 3-dimensional conformal proton technique, IMPT significantly improved LC (91% vs 72%; P < .01) and independently predicted LC (hazard ratio, 0.14; P = .01). Sixteen radiation-naive patients (24%) experienced acute grade 3 toxicities; 4 (6%) experienced late grade 3 toxicities (osteoradionecrosis, vision loss, soft-tissue necrosis, and soft tissue fibrosis) (grading was performed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [version 5.0]). Slightly inferior LC was noted for patients undergoing reirradiation with higher complications: 11% experienced late grade 3 toxicities (facial pain and brain necrosis). Patients treated with reirradiation had more grade 1 to 2 radionecrosis than radiation-naive patients (brain: 33% vs 7% and osteoradionecrosis: 17% vs 3%)., CONCLUSIONS: PT achieved remarkable LC for patients with nasal cavity and paranasal sinus cancers with lower grade 3 toxicities relative to historical reports. IMPT has the potential to improve the therapeutic ratio in these malignancies and is worthy of further investigation. Copyright © 2020 American Cancer Society.",Excluded

1625,"Clinical efficacy of open-irrigated electrode cooled with half-normal saline for initially failed radiofrequency ablation of idiopathic outflow tract ventricular arrhythmias BACKGROUND: Acute failure of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) occur in 10%-20% of patients and is partly attributed to inadequate lesion depth acquired with standard ablation protocols. Half-normal saline (HNS)-irrigation is a promising strategy to improve the success rate of VA ablation., OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the efficacy of HNS-irrigated ablation after a failed standard plain normal saline solution (PNSS)-irrigated ablation on idiopathic outflow tract ventricular arrhythmia (OT-VA)., METHOD: This is a prospective observational study of consecutive patients undergoing RFA of idiopathic OT-VA comparing the efficacy of additional HNS-irrigated ablation for failed standard PNSS-irrigated ablation. Acute failure was defined as persistence of spontaneous VA or persistent inducibility of the clinical VA., RESULTS: Out of 160 OT-VA cases (51 +/- 15-year-old, 62 males), 31 underwent HNS irrigation after a failed standard PNSS-irrigated ablation. The HNS group had a significantly longer procedure time (60.06 +/- 43.83 vs 37.51 +/- 33.40 minutes; P = .013) and higher radiation exposure (31.45 +/- 20.24 vs 17.22 +/- 15.25 minutes; P = .001) than the PNSS group but provided an additional acute success in 21 of 31 (67.7%) patients. Over a follow-up duration of 7.8 +/- 4.6 months, 24 recurrences were identified, including 8 (25.8%) in the HNS and 16 (12.4%) in the PNSS group, with lower freedom from recurrence in the HNS group (log rank P = .009). No major complication was observed., CONCLUSION: HNS-irrigated ablation after failed standard PNSS-irrigated ablation is safe and additionally improves acute ablation success by 67.7% for idiopathic OT-VA but with a higher rate of recurrence on follow-up. Whether the application of HNS as initial irrigant could result in better outcome requires further investigation. Copyright © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
1995,"Risk of cancer associated with low-dose radiation exposure: comparison of results between the INWORKS nuclear workers study and the A-bomb survivors study The Life Span Study (LSS) of Japanese atomic bomb survivors has served as the primary basis for estimates of radiation-related disease risks that inform radiation protection standards. The long-term follow-up of radiation-monitored nuclear workers provides estimates of radiation-cancer associations that complement findings from the LSS. Here, a comparison of radiation-cancer mortality risk estimates derived from the LSS and INWORKS, a large international nuclear worker study, is presented. Restrictions were made, so that the two study populations were similar with respect to ages and periods of exposure, leading to selection of 45,625 A-bomb survivors and 259,350 nuclear workers. For solid cancer, excess relative rates (ERR) per gray (Gy) were 0.28 (90% CI 0.18; 0.38) in the LSS, and 0.29 (90% CI 0.07; 0.53) in INWORKS. A joint analysis of the data allowed for a formal assessment of heterogeneity of the ERR per Gy across the two studies (P=0.909), with minimal evidence of curvature or of a modifying effect of attained age, age at exposure, or sex in either study. There was evidence in both cohorts of modification of the excess absolute risk (EAR) of solid cancer by attained age, with a trend of increasing EAR per Gy with attained age. For leukemia, under a simple linear model, the ERR per Gy was 2.75 (90% CI 1.73; 4.21) in the LSS and 3.15 (90% CI 1.12; 5.72) in INWORKS, with evidence of curvature in the association across the range of dose observed in the LSS but not in INWORKS; the EAR per Gy was 3.54 (90% CI 2.30; 5.05) in the LSS and 2.03 (90% CI 0.36; 4.07) in INWORKS. These findings from different study populations may help understanding of radiation risks, with INWORKS contributing information derived from cohorts of workers with protracted low dose-rate exposures.",Included
1749,"Radiation exposure in coronary procedures using the radial and femoral approaches Background: Although the transradial approach had significantly reduced vascular complications, studies have demonstrated that it may be related to higher radiation exposure. The objective of this study is to compare radiation exposure in invasive cardiologic procedures using the transradial and transfemoral approaches. Method(s): Prospective cohort study including patients undergoing diagnostic cardiac catheterization or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) between August 2010 and December 2011. Clinical, angiographic and radiation exposure characteristics were recorded in a dedicated database. Patients were analyzed according to the access route: femoral or radial. Result(s): Of the 1,197 patients included in the study, 782 were submitted to procedures using the femoral access and 415 using the radial access. There was a lower prevalence of females (36.2% vs. 45.6%; P < 0.01), previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery (4% vs. 12.7%; P < 0.01) and severe valvular heart disease (0.3% vs. 1.4%; P = 0.07) in the radial group.

1417,"Factors influencing patient reported cosmetic outcome: Results of the Young Boost Trial Purpose or Objective: The Young Boost trial (YBT), a multicenter RCT (NCT00212121), investigates whether a higher boost dose leads to a lower recurrence rate in young patients treated with breast conserving therapy. Cosmetic outcome is the secondary objective. The aim of the current analysis is to investigate the factors influencing the patients' opinion about cosmesis. Material(s) and Method(s): From 2004-2011, 2421 breast cancer patients <= 50 y rs w ere i ncluded i n T he Netherlands, France, and Germany. All patients were treated with lumpectomy, followed by 50 Gy whole breast irradiation. Patients were randomized to receive a standard 16 Gy (n=1211) or a high 26 Gy boost (n=1210) to the tumour bed. Cosmetic outcome data at 4 years of 807 patients were used for the current analysis according to the following two scoring systems: 1. BCCT.core: Digital photographs were analyzed using a software program to extract an overall cosmetic score: excellent, good, fair or poor. This score is based on symmetry, skin color and scar visibility. The 7 features of symmetry in the BCCT.core program are: nipple position (pBRA), level of lower breast contour (pLBC), level of nipple (pUNR), distance from nipple to inframammary fold (pBCE), length of breast contour (pBCD), area of the breast (pBAD) and non-overlapping area between left and right breast (pBOD). 2. Patients' score using a validated patient's questionnaire about the breast appearance, including an overall score: very satisfied, satisfied, not dissatisfied, dissatisfied or very dissatisfied. First, we analyzed the 7 features of BCCT.core in a proportional odds model, to investigate which parameters were related to the patients' opinion about cosmesis. In addition, we analyzed whether firmness, presence of rib pain or quality of life (QoL) aspects (EORTC QLQ C-30 questionnaire) at 4 years were related to the patients' opinion on cosmetic outcome. Result(s): Of the 7 BCCT.core parameters, pBCE and pBCD were significantly related to patients' score at 4 years. Patients with any difference in firmness rated their cosmesis worse than patients without any difference, even when the objective score (i.e. BCCT.core) was similar. This effect was larger by increasing difference. Worse perception of cosmetic outcome was also independently related to lower global QoL, lower emotional functioning and higher scores in the depression scale. The presence of rib pain had no influence. Conclusion(s): The patients' opinion on cosmetic outcome was significantly related to objective parameters like distance from nipple to inframammary fold (pBCE) and length of breast contour (pBCD), but also to subjective factors, i.e. severity of firmness, depressive feelings, global QoL and emotional functioning.",Excluded
2464,"Comparison of distal interphalangeal fusion with and without joint preparation in cases of stage IV chondropathy The main complications in distal interphalangeal (DIP) fusion are non-union and hardware-related symptoms. The primary aim of this study was to show that joint preparation for DIP fusion is not necessary in cases of stage IV chondropathy. The secondary aim was to show that use of buried compression screws decreases the complication rate. This continuous retrospective study included two groups of DIP percutaneous arthrodesis procedures carried out with 1.8. mm break-away compression screws: group 1 underwent joint preparation through a dorsal approach and group 2 underwent a percutaneous procedure without joint preparation. Group 1 included 15 patients (18 fingers) with a mean age of 65.3 years, representing nine cases of osteoarthritis, four cases of open trauma, one of gout, and one of rheumatoid arthritis. Group 2 included 18 patients (21 fingers) with a mean age of 58.9 years, representing 16 cases of osteoarthritis, one of rheumatoid arthritis and one of swan-neck deformity. Tourniquet time was longer in group 1 (61. min) than in group 2 (24. min). The amount of emitted ionizing radiation was not different between groups. Pain and QuickDASH scores were not improved in group 1 but they were in group 2. There was no difference in the fusion time. One non-union was observed in group 1. Our results show that joint preparation for DIP arthrodesis is unnecessary in stage IV chondropathy. No hardware-related complications were observed.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.",Excluded
1398,"Dynamic CTA in Native Kidneys Using a Multiphase CT Protocol-Potential of Significant Reduction of Contrast Medium RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess an optimized renal multiphase computed tomography angiography (MP-CTA) protocol regarding reduction of contrast volume., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients underwent MP-CTA (12 phases, every 3.5 seconds, 80 kV/120 mAs) using 30 mL of contrast medium. The quality of MP-CTA was assessed quantitatively measuring vessel attenuation, image noise, and contrast-to-noise ratio. MP-CTA was evaluated qualitatively regarding depiction of vessels, cortex differentiation, and motion artifacts (grades 1-4, 1 = best). Mean effective radiation dose was registered. Results were compared to standard renal computed tomography angiography (CTA) (80 mL). Student t test was applied, if variables followed normal distribution. For other variables, nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test was used., RESULTS: All acquisitions were successfully performed, and no patient had to be excluded from the study. MP-CTA enabled high attenuation (aorta: 503 +/- 91 HU, renal arteries: 450 +/- 73 HU/456 +/- 72 HU) at adequate image noise (13.7 +/- 1.5) and good contrast-to-noise ratio (34.2 +/- 10.2). Good attenuation of renal veins was observed (286 +/- 43 HU/282 +/- 42 HU). Arterial enhancement was significantly higher compared to renal CTA (aorta: 396 +/- 90 HU, renal arteries: 331 +/- 74 HU/333 +/- 80 HU; P < .001). MP-CTA protocol enabled good image quality of renal arteries (1.5 +/- 0.6) and veins (1.7 +/- 0.6). Cortex differentiation and motion artifacts were ranked 1.8 +/- 0.8 and 1.6 +/- 0.8. The mean effective radiation dose was 9 mSv (MP-CTA)., CONCLUSIONS: Compared to standard renal CTA, the renal MP-CTA enabled the significant reduction of contrast volume and simultaneously provided a significantly higher arterial attenuation.

1382,"Combining cisplatin and mitomycin with radiotherapy in anal carcinoma PURPOSE: The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) phase II study No. 22953 demonstrated the feasibility of reducing the overall treatment time of chemoradiation, delivering mitomycin C twice rather than once and fluorouracil during the whole treatment. We tested the feasibility of chemoradiation in anal carcinoma with mitomycin and cisplatin in a phase II study. METHOD(S): Twenty-one patients with locally advanced anal carcinoma (15 women, 6 men) were treated. The first sequence of radiotherapy consisted of 36 Gy over four weeks. After a gap interval of 16 days, a second sequence of radiotherapy was given, delivering 23.4 Gy over 2.5 weeks. Mitomycin C was delivered at 10 mg/m2 day 1 of each sequence and cisplatin was delivered at 25 mg/m2/week of each sequence. RESULT(S): The compliance rates for the first sequence with radiation, mitomycinm, and cispaltin (dose and timing) were 100 percent. The median duration gap was 16 days (14-30 days). The compliance rates for the second sequence with radiation, mitomycin, and cisplatin (dose and timing) were 100, 76.2, and 85.7 percent, respectively. Grade>=2 acute toxicities of 62, 29, 25, and 5 percent were observed for skin, diarrhea, hematologic, and renal toxicities, respectively. Nineteen patients were in complete response (90.5 percent). CONCLUSION(S): Combining radiation with mitomycin and cisplatin in patients with locally advanced anal cancer is feasible. The results are promising.

2354,"Accuracy and reliability of a novel web based analysis software in preoperative planning of patients with lower extremity trauma Introduction: Preoperative Planning is an important part of surgical treatment in patients with lower extremity. The aim of the study is to assess recently released web based software, ""Click2correct"" during preoperative planning of patients with lower extremity trauma. The angular deformity and length measurements of fractured bones is highly dependent to taken reference points. The new proposed system offer easy tools for standardization in determination of reference points, which were aimed to tested in the present study. Material(s) and Method(s): Twentyfour patients (eight females and sixteen males) with lower extremity fracture were admitted sequentially to orthopaedics and traumatology department of the same university. All patients were examined with direct x rays. The from fracture distorted and deformed bones were assessed with measurement tools of the PACS system of the Hospital. The radiographs were also uploaded to the click2correct web site. The angular deormity and leg length changes were also assessed by two researchers. The accuracy, and reliability were tested statistically between researchers and their measurements. Result(s): There were found positive correlations interobservers and intraoberver measurements in terms of assesment of angular deformity and shortening of fractured bones. Before decision of treatment modality the positional analysis of fractured bone parts of tibia and femurs has to be evaluated. The preoperative planning softwares aims to ease these procedure. The recently released software announced web based working solution as an advantage. Also new tools were offered during determination of reference points during measurement for standardization. The present study has found consistency between measurements. Furthermore virtual fracture reduction facility, which also guides in proper implant selection and placement was found useful. Conclusion(s): The rising frequency and penetrance of digital technology allows surgeons precise preoperative measurments and planning.

2291,"How light dosimetry influences the efficacy of photodynamic therapy with 5-aminolaevulinic acid for ablation of high-grade dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) is a novel treatment for high-grade dysplasia (HGD) in Barrett's esophagus (BE). Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of differing light doses. Patients with HGD in BE received oral ALA (60 mg/kg) activated by low (500 J/cm), medium (750 J/cm), high (1,000 J/cm), or highest (1,000 J/cm x2) light dose at 635 nm. Follow-up was by regular endoscopy with quadrantic biopsies. Twenty-four patients were treated. Successful eradication of HGD was significantly correlated with light dose (log rank, p < 0.01). Six of eight patients (75%) treated with the highest light dose, one of two treated with high dose (50%), two of nine (22%) receiving medium light dose, and zero of five receiving low light dose had successful eradication of HGD (median follow-up 45 months, range 1-78 months). No skin photosensitivity or esophageal strictures occurred. The efficacy of ALA-PDT for eradication of HGD in BE is closely related to the light dose used. With a drug dose of 60 mg/kg and light at 635 nm, we recommend a minimum light dose of 1,000 J/cm of esophagus. This dose appears safe.",Excluded
1603,"Treatment of psoriasis with calcipotriol-PUVA Background: PUVA photochemotherapy has been accepted as an effective treatment modality in the treatment of psoriasis. Many combination therapies have been tried to reduce the long-term side effects of UV radiation. Objective(s): We performed conventional PUVA and calcipotriol-PUVA combination therapy to compare the effectiveness between two treatment modalities. Method(s): We treated 38 Korean patients with conventional PUVA and 54 with D-PUVA. We compared the total number, duration and total UVA dose of PUVA therapy to reach grade 4 between two groups. We categorized each patient into clearing, improvement, or failure groups based on the therapeutic efficacy, and evaluated PASI score at patient's visits. Result(s): The irradiation number and total cumulative dose of D-PUVA phototherapy to achieve grade 4 were significantly smaller than PUVA phototherapy. Conclusion(s): Combining PUVA with a vitamin D analogue, calcipotriol, in the treatment of psoriasis may lead to lowering the risk of long-term exposure to UV radiation with higher efficacy.",Excluded
2067,"Neurosurgery and prognosis in patients with radiation-induced brain injury after nasopharyngeal carcinoma radiotherapy: A follow-up study Background: Radiotherapy is the standard radical treatment for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and may cause radiation-induced brain injury (RI). Treatment for RI remains a challenge. We conducted this study to investigate the indications of neurosurgery, operation time and prognosis of patients with RI after NPC radiotherapy who underwent neurosurgical management. Method(s): This was a follow-up study between January 2005 and July 2011. Fifteen NPC cases of RI who underwent neurosurgery were collected. Brain Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), surgery and histology were studied. The outcome was assessed by LENT/SOMA scales and modified Rankin scale. Result(s): Brain lesion resection (86.7%) was more common than decompressive craniotomy (13.3%). According to LENT/SOMA scale before and six months after surgery, 13 of 15, 12 of 15, 14 of 15, and 14 of 15 cases showed improvement at subjective, objective, management and analytic domains, respectively. 12 of 15 patients showed improvement of modified Rankin scale after surgery. Three patients who underwent emergency surgery showed significant improvement (average score increment of 2, 2.7, 2.7, 3 and 2 at LENT/SOMA scale subjective, objective, management, analytic, and modified Rankin scale, respectively), as compared with 12 cases underwent elective surgery (average score increment of 1, 1, 1.4, 1.8 and 1 at LENT SOMA scale subjective, objective, management, analytic, and modified Rankin scale, respectively). Conclusion(s): Neurosurgery, including brain necrotic tissue resection and decompressive craniotomy, improves the prognosis for RI patients, especially for those with indications of emergency surgery. © 2013 Li et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
1866,"Phase I trial of concurrent hyperfractionated split course radiotherapy (HFx RT), cisplatin (cDDP), and paclitaxel in patients with recurrent, previously irradiated, or treatment-naive locally advanced upper aerodigestive malignancy Purpose: Phase I study to determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of cisplatin (cDDP), paclitaxel (P), and concurrent split course hyperfractionated (BID) RT in advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and other upper aerodigestive tumors. Material(s) and Method(s): Eligibility stipulated ECOG performance status 0-2 and either Tx-naive, locally advanced, or locally recurrent, previously radiated, surgically unresectable upper aerodigestive cancer. Metastases were permitted if disease was predominantly locoregional. RT-naive patients received 150 cGy bid x 5 d Q 2 wks x 4. Previously radiated patients received 150 cGy bid x 5, wk 1; then 120 cGy bid x 5 Q 2 wk x 3 (later increased to 150 cGy BID for the entire treatment). Treatment fields included recurrent tumor only with 2 cm margins. Whenever possible, conventional and 3-D conformal techniques were used. Elective nodal radiation was not administered. Starting doses of cDDP and P were 12 mg/m 2/d x 5 and 15 mg/m2/d x 5, respectively, Q 2 wk x 4, each given on RT days only. At dose level 2, cDDP was increased to 15 mg/m 2/d x 5. At dose level 3, P was increased to 20 mg/m2/d x 5. Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) days 6-12 (off treatment week) was added if cumulative neutropenia precipitated treatment delays. Result(s): Thirty-one patients (21 men, 10 women) were treated. Eight had received prior chemotherapy, 27 prior RT. At dose level three, regular treatment delays of >=1 week due to slow neutrophil recovery occurred. Addition of G-CSF (dose level 3b) reduced treatment delays from 100 percent to 28 percent and decreased the incidence of Grade >=2 neutropenia and mucositis. Six of 7 patients at this dose level completed all 4 cycles of treatment and all received full dose RT (60 Gy). No other dose-limiting toxicities occurred. Of 22 assessable patients with locally recurrent SCCHN, 12 (55 percent) responded. Median time to progression in this group was 6 months, with median and one-year survival of 9.5 mos and 41 percent, respectively. Conclusion(s): Concurrent daily cisplatin/paclitaxel and split course hyperfractionated RT (60 Gy) is feasible in previously radiated patients. G-CSF, administered between each cycle, reduces the incidence of treatment delays. Activity is promising and toxicity acceptable. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Excluded
2049,"Geometrical changes of parotid, submandibular, and thyroid glands during intensity modulated radiation therapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma Purpose/Objective(s): Both the tumor and organs at risk (OARs) occurred considerable changes during the intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) course for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). This study aims to analyze quantitatively the geometrical variations of the parotid, submandibular gland (SMG) and thyroid as three independent OARs throughout IMRT course. Materials/Methods: Twenty NPC patients received the definitive chemo-IMRT in 33 fractions within 6.5 week-long course. Each patient had a planning CT (pCT) and six weekly repeat CT (rCT) without enhanced contrast. Each rCT was rigidly registered to its pCT. The parotid, SMG and thyroid were manually delineated in the axial pCT and rCT imaging by a single radiation oncologist. When compared a contour in pCT with rCT, it was calculated the volume of each contour (V-pCT, V-rCT), the common volume (V-com) and the shortest perpendicular distance (SPD) between two contours. Each surface voxel of a contour in rCT has a SPD and the standard deviation (SD) of all the SPDs was calculated. Both the SPD and Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) calculated as 2*V-com / (V-pCT + V-rCT) were used as the surrogate of the shape variations. The displacement of center of mass as the positional shift was calculated and the mean displacement, system and random error were statistically calculated. The difference of geometrical changes among six week, the left- and right- sided OAR was compared using one-way analysis of variance or Mann-Whitney U test. Result(s): The mean radiation dose of the parotid, SMG, thyroid gland were 32.12 >= 11.2 Gy, 25.46 >= 8.62 Gy, 18.89 >= 10.24 Gy, (mean >= standard deviation) respectively. And their mean and maximal volume reduction were 28.6% >= 14.6%, 26.6% >= 17.1%, 12.3% >= 11.3% and 40.6% >= 12.4%, 38.9%>=14.9%, 16.3%>=14.3%, respectively. For the parotid and SMG, the volume loss per treatment day decreased from 1.7%, 1.6% in the first week to 0.5%, 0.6% in the last week, and that of thyroid was of 0.4% - 0.5% after the 2nd week. The center of mass displacement of parotid gland shifted medially 2.0 mm - 2.6 mm, SMG and thyroid did medially 0.1 mm - 0.5 mm. In addition, the displacement in anterior-posterior and cranial-caudal direction were < 0.6 mm. The 3-demensional vector displacements of the parotid and SMG were 2.2mme 2.9mmand that of thyroid were 4.0mm- 4.3 mm. The DSCs of parotid, SMGand thyroid showed the decreased time-trend. For the parotid, SMG, thyroid, the SD of SPDs increased from 1.5 mm e 1.8 mm in the first week to 2.1mme2.5 mm. The variations among the different weeks were statistically different (P < 0.05) and there was no difference between the left- and right-sided OARs (P> 0.05). Conclusion(s): For NPC, the volume, position and shape of parotid, SMG, thyroid occurred in quantifiable variations and these geometrical changes have their time-trend, which suggests the necessity of re-planning for the further sparing of OAR further during IMRT.",Excluded
1990,"Survival and prognostic factors in patients treated with stereotactic radiotherapy for brain metastases Background. Stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT) of brain metastases is used with good effect around the world, but no consensus exists regarding which prognostic factors that are related to favourable or unfavourable prognosis after the treatment. A better definition of these factors will ensure a more precise application of the treatment. Material and methods. A consecutive cohort of the 198 patients treated for brain metastases with SRT without concurrent whole-brain radiation therapy at our department from 2001 to 2012 was retrospectively analysed. Results. Median survival was seven months and median time to clinical cerebral progression was eight months. The multivariate analysis revealed age >= 65 years, Performance Status >= 2, extracranial metastases and size of metastasis > 20 mm as independent prognostic factors related to shorter survival. No factors were independently related to clinical cerebral progression. Conclusion. We identified four prognostic factors related to survival after SRT for brain metastases. The grouping of patients by these factors is useful to determine the level of treatment. We discourage the delivery of SRT to patients with 3-4 unfavourable prognostic factors because of the very short median survival of two months.Copyright © 2015 Informa Healthcare.",Excluded

1644,"Non-invasive diffuse reflectance measurements of cutaneous melanin content can predict human sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation The diversity of human skin phenotypes and the ubiquitous exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) underscore the need for a non-invasive tool to predict an individual's UVR sensitivity. We analysed correlations between UVR sensitivity, melanin content, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DR) and UVR-induced DNA damage in the skin of subjects from three racial/ethnic groups: Asian, Black or African American and White. UVR sensitivity was determined by evaluating each subject's response to one minimal erythemal dose (MED) of UVR one day after the exposure. Melanin content was measured using DR and by densitometric analysis of Fontana-Masson staining (FM) in skin biopsies taken from unexposed areas. An individual's UVR sensitivity based on MED was highly correlated with melanin content measured by DR and by FM. Therefore, a predictive model for the non-invasive determination of UVR sensitivity using DR was developed. The MED precision was further improved when we took race/ethnicity into consideration. The use of DR serves as a tool for predicting UVR sensitivity in humans that should be invaluable for determining appropriate UVR doses for therapeutic, diagnostic and/or cosmetic devices. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.",Excluded
1745,"Radiological evolution of coral substitute implanted into lower limb cancellous bone madreporic coral versus coralline hydroxyapatite Purpose: The study aimed to compare two successive series of procedure using first pieces of natural madreporic coral, then coralline hydroxyapatite in traumatology. The goal of this work was to evaluate long term radiological features of absorption and influencing factors. Material: Within six years, 65 pieces were used; only impaction articular fracture on the lateral tibial plateau (31) and calcaneum fractures (23) were included 21 cases completed inclusion criteria. As there were 3 secondary infections, 18 had therefore, an aseptic evolution and were included in this series. Method(s): Absorption was evaluated in five degrees according to the volume of the remaining piece on X-rays. We also took into consideration the position of the pieces and the amount of surfaces in contact with cancellous bone. Result(s): Among the 18 pieces followed up for more than 19 months (average 40), there were 4 sequestrations (1 tibia, 3 calcaneum), all were natural madreporic coral, the others presented osteointegration. Only natural madreporic coral pieces were absorbed, but never completely and the absorption was slow (3 to 7 years) and never complete. A radiolucent line was present in 7 out of 10 pieces of madreporic coral and none around coralline hydroxyapatite. Three developed favorably. Four were sequestered. Number of surfaces in contact with cancellous bone was correlated with osteointegration. Discussion(s): The calcium carbonate which makes up the natural madreporic coral pieces is the Site of destruction by osteoclasts. The radiolucent line is the specific witness of this biochemical activity. The radiolucent line preceeds sequestrations. No substitute of coralline hydroxyapatite has presented the same sign of peripheral absorption or sequestration. Coralline hydroxyapatite could be the correct coralline material to fill cancellous defect after elevation of an articular depression. In every case, the piece of coral must be fitted in contact with the cancellous bone in the depth of the bone. Conditions of osteoconduction of madreporic coral must be reconsidered. The degree and speed of peripheral absorption must be controlled before weight bearing is allowed.",Excluded
2018,"Identification of a novel three-column classification for double-column die-punch fractures of the distal radius The present study aimed to classify double-column die-punch fractures of the distal radius according to imaging data, and to evaluate their clinical features. A retrospective analysis of imaging data derived from 498 patients diagnosed with a double-column die-punch fracture of the distal radius was performed. The fractures were divided into those with middle-column avulsion with fracture of the radial-column articular surface (type I), those with middle-column collapse with fracture of the radial-column articular surface (type II), those with middle-column collapse with fracture of epiphysis of the radial column (type III) or mixed-type fractures (type IV). The intra- and inter-observer consistency between assessors was analyzed with kappa statistics. The patients with double-column die-punch fractures of the distal radius were followed up. There were 21 cases of type I fracture, 135 cases of type II fracture, 130 cases of type III fracture and 212 cases of type IV fracture. The intra-observer kappa coefficient ranged from 0.810-0.861, whereas the inter-observer kappa coefficient range was 0.830-0.876, with high consistency. Following 13 months of follow-up, the patients were assessed for functional recovery of the wrist and hand using the Gartland-Werley scoring system. The analysis indicated that in 95.78% of the patients, wrist function was rated as excellent or good (n=477), while in 4.22% of patients it was rated as fair (n=21), mainly due to the development of post-traumatic arthritis of the wrist following inappropriate therapy. All of the cases were type IV and type III fractures. These data demonstrated the application of a novel classification system named the Three-Column Classification, used to classify double-column die-punch fractures of the distal radius. This method reflected the mechanisms and severity of the fractures, conforming to the principle of AO fracture classification. Furthermore, it exhibited high consistency and may provide reference values for clinical diagnosis, treatment and prognostic evaluation.Copyright © 2020 Spandidos Publications.

2068,"Cognitive function and social attainment in adult survivors of retinoblastoma: A report from the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study BACKGROUND: Retinoblastoma has a 5-year survival rate exceeding 95%, yet little is known about long-term functional outcomes for these patients. METHOD(S): Sixty-nine adult survivors of retinoblastoma (mean age, 33 years; mean years post-diagnosis, 31) who had enrolled in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study completed clinical cognitive evaluations and questionnaires assessing adult social attainment. Scores on all cognitive measures were converted to z-scores (M = 0, SD = 1) using age-adjusted normative data. Multivariable linear regression analyses, adjusted for age at diagnosis and disease laterality, were used to examine associations between disease and treatment exposures and cognitive outcomes. RESULT(S): Retinoblastoma survivors performed within normative expectations across most cognitive domains. In multivariable models, adjusted for disease laterality, survivors diagnosed at <1 year of age performed significantly better on measures of short-term verbal memory (beta=0.87, P<.01), long-term verbal memory (beta=0.66, P=.02), verbal learning (beta = 0.67, P=.02), and verbal reasoning abilities (beta = 0.79, P<.01) compared with survivors diagnosed at <=1 year of age. In multivariable models, restricted to bilateral survivors and adjusted for age at diagnosis, whole brain radiation exposure was significantly associated with poorer performance on tasks of short-term verbal memory (beta=-0.003, P = .03) and long-term verbal memory (beta = 20.003, P = .01). Reported social attainment was consistent with adult developmental expectations. CONCLUSION(S): Adult survivors of retinoblastoma demonstrate few cognitive or social attainment deficits decades following diagnosis and treatment. Findings suggest the potential for neural reorganization following early insult to the visual system as well as vulnerability of the developing brain to low dose radiation exposure. Early intervention and rehabilitation will be important for these patients.Copyright © 2014 American Cancer Society.",Excluded

1327,"Racial disparities in receipt of standard chemoradiation in anal squamous cell carcinoma, an analysis of the National Cancer Database Background: Standard treatment for locally advanced anal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) consists of concurrent chemoradiation. We evaluated whether racial differences exist in the receipt of standard treatment and its association with survival. Method(s): From the National Cancer Database, we identified patients diagnosed with anal SCC (Stages 2-3) between 2004 and 2015. Using logistic regression, we evaluated racial differences in the probability of receiving standard chemoradiation. We used Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate associations between race, receipt of standard therapy and survival. Result(s): Our analysis included 19,835 patients. Patients receiving standard chemoradiation had better survival than patients receiving nonstandard therapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.61-0.68; p < 0.001). Compared to White patients, Black patients were less likely to receive standard therapy (odds ratio [OR] 0.85; 95% CI 0.76-0.96; p < 0.008). We observed no statistical difference in mortality between Black and White patients overall (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.97-1.15; p = 0.24). However, for the subgroup of patients receiving nonstandard therapy, Black patients had an increased mortality risk compared to White patients (HR 1.17, CI 1.01-1.35; p = 0.034). We observed no survival differences in the subgroup of patients receiving standard treatment (HR 1.00, CI 0.90-1.11, p = 0.99). Conclusion(s): Standard treatment in anal SCC is associated with better survival, but Black patients are less likely to receive standard treatment than White patients. Although Black patients had higher mortality than White patients in the subgroup of patients receiving nonstandard therapy, this difference was ameliorated in the subset receiving standard therapy.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

The aim of this study was to estimate the risk of cancer in NM technologists in relation to work history, procedures performed and radioprotection practices. Methods From the US Radiologic Technologists cohort study, 72 755 radiologic technologists who completed a 2003-2005 questionnaire were followed for cancer mortality through 31 December 2012 and for cancer incidence through completion of a questionnaire in 2012-2013. Multivariable-adjusted models were used to estimate HRs for total cancer incidence and mortality by history of ever performing NM procedures and frequency of performing specific diagnostic or therapeutic NM procedures and associated radiation protection measures by decade. Results During follow-up (mean=7.5 years), 960 incident cancers and 425 cancer deaths were reported among the 22 360 technologists who worked with NM procedures. We observed no increased risk of cancer incidence (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.04) or death (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.19) among workers who ever performed NM procedures. HRs for cancer incidence but not mortality were higher for technologists who began performing therapeutic procedures in 1960 and later compared with the 1950s. Frequency of performing diagnostic or therapeutic NM procedures and use of radioprotection measures were not consistently associated with cancer risk. No clear associations were observed for specific cancers, but results were based on small numbers. Conclusion Cancer incidence and mortality were not associated with NM work history practices, including greater frequency of procedures performed.Copyright © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

1703,"The evaluation of a modified technique of Total body irradiation in respect of treatment results and toxicity Introduction. Total body irradiation (TBI) is a well established part of the conditioning regimen prior to bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Numerous different techniques are used and every center elaborates own solutions. The aim of our study to present the method of TBI developed in our department, and to discuss the results of treatment with respect of early and late toxicity. Material and methods. Between 11.2000 and 08.2004 23 patients were treated with fractionated TBI at the Department od Radiotherapy of the M. Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Center and Institute of Oncology in Warsawa (MSCMCC). Conditioning chemotherapy and BMT were performed in different hematological departments. All patients were irradiated with a total midline dose of 12 Gy in 6 fractions over 3 consecutive days. Doses to the lung did not exceed 11 Gy. The TBI method used in our department was evaluated over a few years. The following modifications have been introduced to the previously applied technique: change of photon energy from 6 MV to 15 MV; increase of lung dose from 9 Gy to 11 Gy; the use of an individual bolus as a lung compensator in lateral fields; more frequent boost irradiation of the mediastinum and legs with small fields; calculations of Monitor Units based on dosimetric data. Boost irradiation of the chest wall with electrons has been abandoned. Results. Median follow up was 12 months. Up till now, 17/23 patients are alive, of these 16 with no relapse. Immediate toxicity was low. Early complications were observed during the first 6 months after BMT in 11 patients. In the case of 4 patients these complications were fatal. Late complications were observed in 10 patients, including chronic GVHD and hormone disturbancy. Only one patient had developed the first symptoms of cataract. In one case Lhermitte's syndrome was observed. One patient died due to liver insufficiency. Conclusions. The results of treatment and the complications rates in patients treated with TBI at our department are consistent with those published in literature. We conclud that our method of TBI is safe and well tolerated.",Excluded
1851,"Increased carotid wall thickening after radiotherapy on the neck Patients treated for head and neck tumours with local radiotherapy (RT) on the neck harbour an increased risk of stroke. This may be due to accelerated atherosclerotic changes within the RT-field; however, the real impact of local RT on the carotid artery remains debatable. The aim of the present study was to assess the difference in carotid wall thickness (intima-media thickness) in 42 unilaterally irradiated parotid tumour patients by performing B-mode ultrasonography. A mean difference in intima-media thickness (IMT) of the irradiated compared with the non-irradiated carotid artery of 0.30 mm (P=0.031) was found. A significant correlation was established with a longer post-RT interval (P=0.008). RT on the neck is associated with increased thickening of carotid IMT. Screening and treatment of additional cerebrovascular risk factors which contribute to further IMT thickening and stroke development is recommended, especially in radiotherapy patients with a favourable prognosis.",Excluded

2289,"Lower body negative pressure counters posture induced increases of intraocular pressure and intracranial pressure Purpose: Recent ophthalmic evaluations of seven astronauts after six-month missions to International Space Station show unexpected vision impairment. In addition, lumbar punctures in four astronauts with optic disc edema showed moderate elevations of cerebral spinal fluid pressure after returning to Earth. This Visual Impairment Intracranial Pressure (VIIP) syndrome is likely related to a headward body fluid shift that elevates intracranial pressure (ICP). We hypothesized that a moderate level of lower body negative pressure (LBNP) would counteract head down, body-tilt, induced elevations in IOP and ICP. Method(s): Twenty-five normal healthy non-smoking volunteers participated in this study (mean age: 31 years). Right and left IOP, ICP (non-invasive ultrasound pulsed phase locked loop), arm blood pressure, and heart rate were measured during the last minute of each testing condition. Subjects were positioned supine (5 mins), sitting (5 mins), 15-degrees head-down tilt (HDT) (5 mins) and ten minutes of HDT with LBNP (25 mmHg). The order of HDT and HDT+LBNP tests were balanced. The right and left IOP values were averaged and used for statistical analysis (significance accepted at p<0.05). Data are presented as mean +/- standard deviation. The change from supine was calculated for IOP values. Result(s): IOP significantly decreased from supine to sitting posture by 3.2 +/- 1.4 mmHg, and increased by 0.9 +/- 1.3 mmHg from supine to the HDT position. LBNP during head-down-tilt significantly lowered IOP to supine levels (difference from supine, 0.3 +/- 1.1 mmHg). In addition, added LBNP during HDT significantly decreased ICP-related pulse amplitudes of transcranial ultrasound waveforms by 2.1+/-3.4 microns (n=9). Mean blood pressure and heart rate did not change significantly across all conditions. Conclusion(s): These data demonstrate that short duration exposures to HDT increase IOP and ICP significantly and further, that LBNP counteracts these elevations of IOP and ICP. Therefore, spaceflight countermeasures that shift fluid to lower body may mitigate vision problems.",Excluded

2380,"Prolonged Steroid Dependence in Adult Patients With Glioma BACKGROUND/AIM: Prolonged use of glucocorticoids (GC) in glioma treatment can lead to adrenal insufficiency (AI) and subsequent steroid dependence due to suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. This is challenging to diagnose due to its nonspecific clinical symptoms erroneously ascribed to treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the risk factors predisposing patients with gliomas to develop AI., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Charts in the neuro-oncology clinic from July 2018 to March 2019 were reviewed. Inclusion criteria included >18 y/o with WHO Grade II-IV gliomas, and secondary AI. Demographic profile, tumor characteristics, and treatment profile were compared., RESULTS: The majority of patients were started on high dose dexamethasone at >8 mg daily, and were on dexamethasone for 4-8 months. The minimum dose needed to prevent symptoms was 0.5 mg to 2 mg daily. The majority received standard radiation doses ranging from 54-60 Gy. Most patients had radiation exposure to the HPA axis within the prescription isodose levels., CONCLUSION: Prolonged steroid dependency can result from chronic GC use in patients with glioma. Dose and duration of GC are risk factors for its development. Radiation exposure to the HPA axis may also be a contributing factor.

2271,"Cytogenetic status of interventional radiology unit workers occupationally exposed to low-dose ionising radiation: A pilot study Interventional radiology unit workers represent one of the occupationally most exposed populations to low-dose ionizing radiation. Since there are many uncertainties in research of doses below 100 mSv, this study attempted to evaluate DNA damage levels in chronically exposed personnel. The study group consisted of 24 subjects matched with a control population by the number of participants, age, gender ratio, active smoking status, the period of blood sampling, and residence. Based on regular dosimetry using thermoluminiscent dosimeters, our study group occupationally received a dose of 1.82 +/- 3.60 mSv over the last year. The results of the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay and the comet assay showed a higher nuclear buds frequency (4.09 +/- 1.88) and tail length (15.46 +/- 1.47 mum) than in the control group (2.96 +/- 1.67, 14.05 +/- 1.36 mum, respectively). Differences in other descriptors from both tests did not reach statistical significance. Further investigations are needed to develop algorithms for improving personal dosimetry and those that would engage larger biomonitoring study groups. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

1597,"Cephalad dislocation of PICCs under different upper limb positions: influence of age, gender, BMI, number of lumens Purpose: To evaluate parameters that influence the amount of movement of peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) tips regarding upper limb movement. Method(s): In a prospective 12-month observational study, 200 PICCs were implanted in 162 patients (mean age 56.8 +/- 15.2 years) by interventional radiologists into the basilic vein of the mid-aspect of the upper arm. Three PICC tip positions were documented with a chest x-ray: patient supine with an abducted (90degree), an adducted arm, and in an upright position with an adducted arm. Multivariable analyses were performed, based on the three positions: body mass index (BMI), number of lumens, age, gender, side of the implantation, and brand. Result(s): Up to 88% of the PICCs dislocated in a mean of 19 mm cephalad when the patient was positioned from a supine in an upright position. The greatest influence upon dislocation was the position change from supine to upright. The side of the implanted PICC (left vs. right) had no influence. Conclusion(s): Cephalad dislocations of mean 19 mm regularly occur in the upright position induced by gravity. This needs to be taken in account and the PICC should be safely positioned one vertebra lower in the superior vena cava superior with a last confirmation of the PICC placement in an upright position.Copyright © The Author(s) 2017.",Excluded
1505,"Correlation between radiation dose and p53 protein expression levels in human lymphocytes The aim of this research was to evaluate the relationship between p53 protein levels and absorbed doses from in vitro irradiated human lymphocytes. For this, samples of blood from 23 donors were irradiated with 0.5; 1; 2; and 4 Gy from a Cobalt-60 source, and the percentages of lymphocytes expressing p53 were scored using Flow Cytometry. The subjects were divided into 3 groups, in accordance with the p53 levels expressed per radiation dose: low (Group I), high (Group II), and excessive levels (Group III). For all groups, the analyses showed that the p53 expression levels increase with the absorbed dose. Particularly for groups I and II, the correlation between this protein expression and the dose follows the linear-quadratic model, such as for radioinduced chromosomal aberrations. In conclusion, our findings indicate possible applications of this approach in evaluating individual radiosensitivity prior to radiotherapeutical procedures as well as in medical surveillance of occupationally exposed workers. Furthermore, due to the rapidity of flow-cytometric analyses, the methodology here employed would play an important role in emergency responses to a large-scale radiation incident where many people may have been exposed.",Included
2333,"Dose-dependent influence of genetic polymorphisms on DNA damage induced by styrene oxide, ethylene oxide and gamma-radiation Styrene oxide (SO), ethylene oxide (EO) and gamma-radiation (G) are agents with a well-described metabolism and genotoxicity. EPHX1 and GSTs play an important role in the detoxification of electrophiles and oxidative stress. Enzymes involved in base excision repair (hOGG1, XRCC1), in rejoining single strand breaks (XRCC1) and in repair of cross-links and chromosomal double strand breaks (XRCC3) might have an impact on genotoxicity as well. In this study we assessed the dose-dependent effect of genetic polymorphisms in biotransforming (EPHX (Tyr113/His113 and His139/Arg139), GSTP1 (Ile105/Val105), GSTM1 and GSTT1) and DNA repair enzymes (hOGG1 (Ser326/Cys326), XRCC1 (Arg194/Trp194, Arg280/His280, Arg399/Gln399), XRCC3 (Thr241/Met241)) on the induced genotoxicity. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 20 individuals were exposed to 3 doses per agent (+control). Genotoxicity was evaluated by measuring comet tail length (TL) and micronucleus frequencies in binucleated cells (MNCB). Dose-dependent DNA damage was found for all agents and end-points, with the exception of MNCB induced by EO. Repeated measure ANOVA revealed a significant contribution of hOGG1 and XRCC3 genotypes to the inter-individual variability of TL and MNCB in cells exposed to EO and G. Homozygous hOGG1326 wild cells showed significantly lower EO-induced TL than the heterozygous cells. Significantly higher TL and MNCB were found in EO-exposed cells carrying the XRCC3(241)Met variant and the influence on TL was more pronounced at higher dose. In G-irradiated cells, TL was significantly higher in the hOGG1326 homozygous wild types compared with mutated genotypes. The influence of hOGG1326 on TL was borderline dose-dependent. We conclude that the influence of genetic polymorphisms of enzymes involved in DNA repair on induced genotoxicity depends on exposure dose.",Excluded
1412,"Predicting urban outdoor thermal comfort by the Universal Thermal Climate Index UTCI-a case study in Southern Brazil Recognising that modifications to the physical attributes of urban space are able to promote improved thermal outdoor conditions and thus positively influence the use of open spaces, a survey to define optimal thermal comfort ranges for passers-by in pedestrian streets was conducted in Curitiba, Brazil. We applied general additive models to study the impact of temperature, humidity, and wind, as well as long-wave and short-wave radiant heat fluxes as summarised by the recently developed Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) on the choice of clothing insulation by fitting LOESS smoothers to observations from 944 males and 710 females aged from 13 to 91 years. We further analysed votes of thermal sensation compared to predictions of UTCI. The results showed that females chose less insulating clothing in warm conditions compared to males and that observed values of clothing insulation depended on temperature, but also on season and potentially on solar radiation. The overall pattern of clothing choice was well reflected by UTCI, which also provided for good predictions of thermal sensation votes depending on the meteorological conditions. Analysing subgroups indicated that the goodness-of-fit of the UTCI was independent of gender and age, and with only limited influence of season and body composition as assessed by body mass index. This suggests that UTCI can serve as a suitable planning tool for urban thermal comfort in sub-tropical regions. © 2011 ISB.",Excluded
1479,"Assessment of aortic annulus dimensions for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with high-pitch dual-source CT: Comparison of systolic high-pitch vs. multiphasic data acquisition Objectives: To evaluate a systolic ECG-gated high-pitch aortoiliac computed tomography (CT) angiography for planning transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Method(s): Patients referred for TAVI underwent a combined CT imaging with retrospective, multiphasic ECG-gating of the heart and systolic ECG-gated high-pitch aortoiliac CT angiography. Consecutive patients were retrospectively included in this study group. Heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) were assessed during the high-pitch ECG prediction phase. Aortic annulus area (AAA) was planimetrically quantified on both datasets. While only one moment of cardiac cycle was available for measurements in the high-pitch CT, the point of time in the multiphasic CT was chosen, where AAA yielded maximum size. Hypothetical prosthesis sizing was compared between multiphasic vs. high-pitch CT. Result(s): Among 61 patients (44.2 % men, mean age: 83.3 +/- 5.5 years) average heart rate and HRV were 71.0 +/- 13.4 bpm and 7.3 +/- 8.5 bpm. 20 patients (32.7 %) had atrial fibrillation at the time of image acquisition. There was a strong correlation of AAA as derived from multiphasic vs. the high-pitch CT (r = 0.98). The difference in AAA was 10.5 +/- 17.1mm2 (455.1 +/- 83.0 mm2 for multiphasic vs. 444.5 +/- 87.2 mm2 for high-pitch CT) and did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.08). Hypothetical prosthesis sizing showed an agreement in 55 of 61 patients (90.2 %). A sizing based on the high-pitch CT resulted in smaller prosthesis choice in 6 patients, all of them suffering from atrial fibrillation. Mean effective radiation dose was 10.9 +/- 6.1 mSv for cardiac CTA and 4.1 +/- 1.0 mSv for high-pitch CTA. Conclusion(s): For patients with sinus rhythm, systolic high-pitch aortoiliac CTA provides adequate prosthesis size selection as compared with multiphasic ECG-gated cardiac CTA and may result in significantly reduced radiation exposition.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
1729,"Medical diagnostic radiation exposures and risk of gliomas High-dose ionizing radiation is an established risk factor for glioma, but it remains unknown whether moderate- and low-dose radiation increase glioma risk. In this analysis, we assessed the evidence that self-reported exposures to diagnostic ionizing radiation, including computerized tomography (CT) scans, is associated with increased risk of adult glioma. While no independent association was observed for CT scans alone (3+ scans compared to none P = 0.08 and 1-2 scans compared to none P = 0.68), our findings suggest an increased risk of adult gliomas with cumulative exposure to three or more CT scans to the head and neck region (OR = 1.97, 95% CI: 0.92-4.23) limited to those who reported a family history of cancer: the P value for the interaction between having three or more CT scans and family history of cancer was 0.08. The stratum-specific adjusted OR for those with family history of cancer was more than three times that for the sub-group without family history of cancer. While there is some potential for symptom-related bias, one might expect this to be present for all diagnostic procedures rather than specific to one procedure. The interaction between CT scans and glioma with family history of cancer supports the biological plausibility of our findings, because similar results have been found for breast cancer and radiation. This observational data will increase awareness about potential risks associated with CT scans and the need to minimize the use of unnecessary examinations.",Excluded

Patients and Methods: Patients with locally advanced rectal cancer received continous infusion 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) 200 mg/m2/day in combination with weekly oxaliplatin at a dose of 50 mg/m2. Doses of radiotherapy were 45 Gy to the whole pelvis plus 5.4-9 Gy to the tumour mass. The primary end-points of the study were evaluation of toxicity, compliance with radiotherapy and chemotherapy, downstaging, pathological complete response (pCR) and the rate of sphincter preservation for distal cancers. Secondary end-points were relapse-free and overall survival. Result(s): From November 2006 to June 2009, 51 patients were enrolled into the study. Compliance with chemotherapy was 80%. The incidence of G3 diarrhoea and proctitis were 17.6% and 21.5%, respectively. Surgery was performed in 48 patients with 100% R0 resection. 76.4% of low-lying tumours underwent conservative treatment. Seventy-nine percent of patients were downstaged: T and N downstaging were observed in 71% and 75% of patients, respectively. A pCR was obtained in 11 (22.9%) patients.

All patients received either preoperative or postoperative radiation therapy., SETTING: Academic tertiary care referral center., INTERVENTIONS: Fourteen patients had mandibular continuity restored by using the titanium hollow screw reconstruction plate system, and 1 patient received a stainless steel mandibular reconstruction plate. Associated soft-tissue defects were repaired by using radial forearm (n = 11), rectus abdominis (n = 2), scapular and parascapular (n = 1), or lateral arm (n = 1) free flaps., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Early and delayed complications., RESULTS: All 15 microvascular free tissue transfers were successful. Early complications were minor and occurred in 5 (33%) of 15 patients. One patient in whom the titanium hollow screw reconstruction plate system had been used experienced a fracture at 15 months after reconstruction. Three patients experienced delayed external plate exposure between 7 and 15 months after primary oromandibular reconstruction. Patients who experienced delayed external plate exposure required secondary reconstruction with a vascularized bone-containing free flap. The overall rate of delayed reconstructive failure was 40% in patients who were followed up for a minimum of 1 year., CONCLUSIONS: For patients who are undergoing free flap reconstruction of lateral mandibulectomy defects, the technique that used soft-tissue free flaps combined with mandibular reconstruction plates has been abandoned in favor of using vascularized bone-containing free flaps or a combination of free flaps to achieve optimal long-term results.",Excluded

1778,"Demonstrating Compliance With Proposed Reduced Lens of Eye Dose Limits in Nuclear Medicine Settings Based on ongoing research on ionizing radiation thresholds for cataracts, the International Commission on Radiological Protection has proposed new guidelines lowering the annual occupational lens of eye dose limit from 150 mSv to 20 mSv. The International Atomic Energy Agency has operationalized these new guidelines. Subsequently, national/regional radiation protection regulators are reviewing their lens of eye dose limits with an aim of moving towards the proposed new limits, resulting in licensees having to demonstrate compliance. In health care settings, fluoroscopic interventional practices generally have higher lens of eye doses and nuclear medicine settings generally have lower doses. A prospective cohort (n = 19) of nuclear medicine technologists wore dedicated lens of eye dosimeters for a 3 mo period synchronized with their body dosimeter schedules. The lens of eye dosimeters were validated to have a linear response in the anticipated dose ranges. The participants worked in a relatively high-volume nuclear medicine practice, which included general and cardiac, positron emission tomography/computed tomography, radiopharmacy, and cyclotron operations. The annualized dose ranges were 0.0-3.68 mSv (lens of eye) and 0.48-4.72 mSv (whole body). There was a good correlation between lens of eye and body dosimeter readings (R = 0.67). There were no significant differences in lens of eye dose by work type, worker sex, or side on which the dosimeter was worn. The findings should be generalizable to other similar practices, especially in North America, and should be sufficient to demonstrate regulatory compliance in nuclear medicine settings with the proposed new lens of eye dose limits.",Excluded

Uranium mining took place from early in the 1950s to 1990, and the Grants Uranium Mill operated from 1958-1990. The present study evaluates cancer mortality during 1950-2004 and cancer incidence during 1982-2004 among county residents. Standardized mortality (SMR) and incidence (SIR) ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed, with observed numbers of cancer deaths and cases compared to expected values based on New Mexico cancer rates. The total numbers of cancer deaths and incident cancers were close to that expected (SMR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.07; SIR 0.97, 95% CI 0.92-1.02). Lung cancer mortality and incidence were significantly increased among men (SMR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02-1.21; SIR 1.40, 95% CI 1.18-1.64) but not women (SMR 0.97, 95% CI 0.85-1.10; SIR 1.01, 95% CI 0.78-1.29). Similarly, among the population of the three census tracts near the Grants Uranium Mill, lung cancer mortality was significantly elevated among men (SMR 1.57; 95% CI 1.21-1.99) but not women (SMR 1.12; 95% CI 0.75-1.61). Except for an elevation in mortality for stomach cancer among women (SMR 1.30; 95% CI 1.03-1.63), which declined over the 55-year observation period, no significant increases in SMRs or SIRs for 22 other cancers were found. Although etiological inferences cannot be drawn from these ecological data, the excesses of lung cancer among men seem likely to be due to previously reported risks among underground miners from exposure to radon gas and its decay products. Smoking, socioeconomic factors or ethnicity may also have contributed to the lung cancer excesses observed in our study. The stomach cancer increase was highest before the uranium mill began operation and then decreased to normal levels. With the exception of male lung cancer, this study provides no clear or consistent evidence that the operation of uranium mills and mines adversely affected cancer incidence or mortality of county residents.",Excluded

2127,"Abnormal bone mineralization after fluoride treatment in osteoporosis: a small-angle x-ray-scattering study Sodium fluoride treatment of osteoporosis is known to stimulate bone formation and to increase bone mass, but recent clinical trials failed to prove its antifracture effectiveness. The formation of bone with abnormal structure and, therefore, increased fragility is discussed as a possible explanation. Until now, however, exact information on the mineral structure of osteoporotic bone after fluoride treatment has been lacking. Bone biopsies were taken from three patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis before and after fluoride treatment (60 mg NaF/day for 1-2 years), from one patient with iatrogenic fluorosis, as well as from three normal controls. The mineral in these samples was investigated by a combination of backscattered electron imaging and small-angle x-ray scattering. Depending on the total dose of fluoride, an increasing amount of new bone is laid down on the surface of preexisting trabeculae. Its mineral structure is identical to that of heavy fluorosis and is characterized by the presence of additional large crystals, presumably located outside the collagen fibrils. These large crystals, which are not present in the controls or in osteoporotic bone before fluoride treatment, contribute to increase the mineral density without significantly improving the biomechanical properties of the bone. The possible success of fluoride treatment depends not only on the amount of newly formed bone but also on the rate of bone turnover. Indeed, as soon as significant amounts of fluoride are present, bone turnover leads to the replacement of old (normal) bone by new (pathologically mineralized) bone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Excluded

BACKGROUND:: Conflicting data have emerged over the last decade regarding the effect of preoperative CRT on AL. METHOD(S):: We reviewed 1437 consecutive patients with rectal cancer who underwent low anterior resection (LAR) at our institution between 2005 and 2012. AL evaluated as grade C was the primary endpoint, as proposed by the International Study Group of Rectal Cancer in 2010. The patients were treated with (n = 360) or without (n = 1077) preoperative CRT. The total radiation dose was 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions. Multivariate and propensity score matching analyses were used to compensate for the differences in some baseline characteristics. RESULT(S):: The preoperative CRT group contained more patients with the following characteristics, older age, male sex, smoker, advanced stage tumor, lower/mid rectal tumor location, ultra-LAR, and diverting stoma, than the non-preoperative CRT group (all Ps < 0.05). Postoperative AL occurred in 91 patients (6.3%). Before propensity score matching, the incidence of AL in patients with or without preoperative CRT was 7.5% and 5.9%, respectively (P = 0.293). After propensity score matching, the 2 groups were nearly balanced except for the initial stage and the length of the surgeonE's career, and the incidence of AL in patients with or without preoperative CRT was 7.5% and 8.1%, respectively (P = 0.781).

No large and long-term follow-up study has been done about Cedior prosthesis. The study hypothesis was that 15-year survival for the CediorTM prosthesis is at least as good as rates reported for other models. A continuous retrospective single-center study included patients managed by CediorTM TKA with at least 15-year follow-up. The main endpoint was prosthesis survival; secondary objectives were to identify factors for implant revision and to assess functional scores at 15 years. In the present series, 15-year all-cause survival for the Cedior knee prosthesis was 93.03%; comparable to rates in the literature, posterior-stabilized implants showed higher revision rates. No other factors for revision emerged. These findings are comparable with those of the literature.Copyright © 2019, Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
1791,"[Can angiography system with large-area flat digital panel induce higher irradiation in a patient during coronary angiography] BACKGROUND: Nowadays, angiography systems with flat digital panel are used in cardiology and invasive radiology as the detector of irradiation. The so called universal systems with a magnified panel are becoming more common. In this study we tried to find out whether in practice the increased surface area of detectors may increase the absorption dose in a patient., MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 486 patients who underwent coronary angiography carried out by the same physicians. In 268 subjects the procedure was performed in cathlab A equipped with a cardiac angiography system, whereas in 218 subjects in cathlab B using universal angiography system. In the study the absorbed dose of irradiation by the patient was determined and its ratio to body mass, body mass index (BMI) and body surface area (BSA) was evaluated., RESULTS: The mean dose absorbed by the person under study did not differ between both catheterization laboratories. Similarly, there were no differences in the ratio of the absorbed dose and BMI. But the comparison of the ratio of the absorbed dose and the body mass showed significantly higher values in cathlab A, where. higher values of the ratio of the absorbed dose and BSA were also found (p < 0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: In the present study it was found that the use of universal angiography systems with a larger surface area of the detecting panel is not connected with the increase in the irradiation dose absorbed by the patent during coronary angiography as compared with classical cardiac angiography systems.",Excluded
1785,"Factors influencing the degree of erythematous skin reactions in humans Dose-response relationships have been studied using an ordinal visual scale and reflectance spectrophotometry data from 123 treatment sites on 110 patients treated with 10 dose fractions over 12-14 days. Dose rates varied between 3 and 240 Gy/h and total doses of between 25 and 41 Gy were given using teletherapy apparatus. We found qualitative scoring of erythematous skin reactions to be subject to considerable inter- and intra-observer variation. Reflectance spectrophotometry provided more reproducible information, some of which was undetectable by naked eye. Baseline erythema readings were significantly higher in male patients and at anatomical sites of previous heavy UV exposure. In addition, a pronounced decline in erythema readings during the second week of therapy and 'reciprocal vicinity' (abscopal) effects adjacent to the field, undetected by the eye, were observed in a subset of patients. Meaningful dose-response relationships could be derived only from reflectance data with peak change from the pretreatment baseline measure providing the best discrimination. Peak erythema measures following treatment were found to depend on the age and gender of the patient as well as the treatment site and its baseline erythema measurement. This was independent of the total dose administered or the instantaneous dose rate at which it was delivered. The rate of erythema development was also dose rate dependent but only weakly dependent on the biological dose intensity (Gy equiv./day) of the treatment course. The data raise the question of whether irradiation-induced erythema is exclusively a secondary phenomenon occurring as a result of basal cell killing. The short repair half time value of 0.06 h obtained by direct analysis is perplexing and may reflect a dose rate-dependent physiological vasodilatory response to irradiation and/or a multi-component cellular repair process.",Excluded
2038,"Gemcitabine, dexamethasone, and cisplatin (GDP) chemotherapy with sandwiched radiotherapy in the treatment of newly diagnosed stage IE/IIE extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (ENKL), nasal-type is a rare but highly aggressive disease with poor prognosis. Optimal treatment strategies for newly diagnosed localized ENKL have not been fully defined. Here we retrospectively analyzed 72 patients with newly diagnosed stage IE/IIE ENKL treated with gemcitabine, dexamethasone, and cisplatin (GDP) regimen chemotherapy with sandwiched radiotherapy in our department between May 2012 and September 2014. After 2 cycles of GDP induction chemotherapy, the complete response rate (CRR) and overall response rate (ORR) were 30.6% (22/72) and 91.7% (66/72). After whole treatment completion, the CRR and ORR were 81.9% (59/72) and 91.7% (66/72), respectively. With a median follow-up of 57.8 months (Interquartile Range 54.0-64.5 months), the 5-year progression-free survival rate was 70.9% (95% CI, 60.1% to 81.7%), and the 5-year overall survival rate was 72.0% (95% CI, 61.6% to 82.4%), respectively. Patients with CRR after treatment had better prognosis than their counterparts. The major adverse events were myelosuppression, liver dysfunction, gemcitabine-related skin rash, and digestive tract toxicities. Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were 18.0% (13/72) and 15.3% (11/72), respectively. No treatment related deaths were observed. It is concluded that the GDP regimen with sandwiched radiotherapy was an effective and well-tolerated treatment for newly diagnosed stage IE/IIE ENKL, nasal-type.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

2405,"Acute Erythemal Ultraviolet Radiation Causes Systemic Immunosuppression in the Absence of Increased 25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 Levels in Male Mice Vitamin D is synthesised by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation of skin and is hypothesized to be a direct mediator of the immunosuppression that occurs following UV radiation (UVR) exposure. Both UVR and vitamin D drive immune responses towards tolerance by ultimately increasing the suppressive activities of regulatory T cells. To examine a role for UVR-induced vitamin D, vitamin D3-deficient mice were established by dietary vitamin D3 restriction. In comparison to vitamin D3-replete mice, vitamin D3-deficient mice had significantly reduced serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3, <20 nmol.L-1) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3, <20 pmol.L-1). Following either acute erythemal UVR, or chronic sub-erythemal UVR (8 exposures over 4 weeks) treatment, serum 25(OH)D3 levels significantly increased in vitamin D3-deficient female but not male mice. To determine if UVR-induced vitamin D was a mediator of UVR-induced systemic immunosuppression, responses were measured in mice that were able (female) or unable (male) to increase systemic levels of 25(OH)D3 after UVR. Erythemal UVR (>=4 kJ/m2) suppressed contact hypersensitivity responses (T helper type-1 or -17), aspects of allergic airway disease (T helper type-2) and also the in vivo priming capacity of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells to a similar degree in female and male vitamin D3-deficient mice. Thus, in male mice, UVR-induced 25(OH)D3 is not essential for mediating the immunosuppressive effects of erythemal UVR. © 2012 Gorman et al.",Excluded
2347,"Estimation of long-term salivary gland damage induced by radiotherapy A classification is proposed for estimating salivary gland damage induced by radiotherapy to the head and neck. The volume of salivary glands irradiated was evaluated, and their relative proportions of whole saliva output were calculated. Stimulated salivary flow rate was measured in 61 patients treated with radiotherapy for head and neck malignancies. A highly significant negative correlation was found between the classification of salivary gland damage and stimulated salivary flow rate. The volume of the major salivary glands irradiated seems to be the most important factor affecting the postirradiation salivary flow after a curative dose of radiotherapy. If possible, partial sparing of the salivary glands may help to keep the patient's salivary secretion at an acceptable level and promote protection against dental caries. Most patients irradiated to the head and neck, however, need an effective prophylactic programme for the rest of their lives in order to preserve their teeth.",Excluded
2334,"Utility whole body PET/CT scan in malignant melanoma. Can the location of the primary tumor guide image planning? Aim/Introduction: To determine the value of systematically performing whole-body (head-to-toe) PET/CT images (WBPET) in the evaluation of patients with malignant melanoma and propose a criteria of when standard imaging can be performed. Material(s) and Method(s): Retrospective study of all WB-PET scans performed in patients with malignant melanoma in our hospital, either for staging, restaging, recurrence or post-treatment follow-up, between January 2011 and January 2020. We looked for any FDG avid foci in the lower extremities. The findings were considered as true positives if histopathological findings were confirmed, if the lesion was treated as melanoma because of other complementary findings (physical exploration, ultrasound, etc) or if during follow-up it was determined as malignant in nature. We also analyzed if the true positive findings had any change in patients management. Result(s): We analyzed 367 WB-PET studies belonging to 169 patients, 93 male (55%) and 76 female (45%), with a mean age of 56.4 years (range 19-90 years). Of the 367 studies performed 170 (46,3%) where for staging (all at least stage IIIB), and 197 (53,7%) for suspected recurrence or post treatment follow-up. From all the WB-PET scans we observed that 19 (5 %) had positive findings in the lower extremities, 11 (3%) of which were true-positive findings (all with histopathological confirmation), 8 (2%) scans were false positive (5 inflammatory foci demonstrated by clinical follow-up and 3 benign lesions (dermatophibroma, nevus and encondroma). From the 11 true-positive findings, 8 (2%) had the primary lesion in an infra-umbilical location; 1 (0.2%) was an extracutaneous melanoma (paranasal) but the finding could be included on a standard study, and the other 2(0,4%), had disseminated disease so the findings did not change clinical management. Also, none of these findings generated a change in management. Conclusion(s): In our cohort, we found that WB-PET in patients with melanoma had no additional value to standard (head-tomid-thigh) PET/CT images. We propose to perform WB-PET only in patients with the primary melanoma lesion located below the umbilical line. PET/CT acquisition of the lower extremities results in increased scan time and unnecessary radiation dose without generated therapeutic impact.",Excluded
2285,"Does exposure to static magnetic fields generated by magnetic resonance imaging scanners raise safety problems for personnel? MRI workers are occupationally exposed to static and time-varying gradient magnetic fields. While the 24-hour time-averaged exposure to static magnetic fields is about a few mT, the maximum static field strength can be as high as 500 mT during patient setup. Over the past several years, our laboratory has performed extensive experiments on the health effects of exposure of animal models and humans to different sources of electromagnetic fields such as cellular phones, mobile base stations, mobile phone jammers, laptop computers, radars, dentistry cavitrons and MRI. This study is to investigate the adverse health effects in MRI workers and also to assess the effect of exposure of MRI workers to static magnetic fields on their cognitive functions. In the first phase of this study a questionnaire was designed to collect information from 120 MRI personnel. The collection of data about the adverse health effects was based on self-reporting by the participants. In the second phase, 47 volunteer university students were asked to continuously move around a 1.5 T MRI scanner. Visual reaction time and working memory tests were performed on all participants before and after the experiment. Forward digit span and backward digit span were used for assessing the working memory. Furthermore, participants were asked to report the symptoms they had experienced during the movement. The first phase of our study showed increased frequencies of adverse health effects in MRI workers. In this study the rates of self-reported symptoms such as a headache, sleep problems, myalgia, palpitation, fatigue, concentration problems, attention problems, nervousness and backpain were possibly affected by static magnetic field. Furthermore we found that reaction time and working memory could be influenced by the movements of the body around a MRI scanner. It can be concluded that movement through a high magnetic field can also lead to some adverse cognitive effects in MRI staff.Copyright © 2018, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.

2298,"Cumulative radiation dose incurred during the management of complex pleural space infection Background: Complex pleural space infections are commonly managed with antibiotics, pleural drainage, intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy, and surgery. These strategies often utilize radiographic imaging during management, however little data is available on cumulative radiation exposure received during inpatient management. We aimed to identify the type and quantity of radiographic studies along with the resultant radiation exposure during the management of complex pleural space infections. Method(s): Retrospective review of community network healthcare system from January 2015 to July 2018. Patients were identified through billing databases as receiving intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy and/or surgical intervention. Patient demographics, clinical outcomes, and inpatient radiographic imaging was collected to calculate cumulative effective dose. Result(s): A total of 566 patients were identified with 7275 total radiographic studies performed and a median cumulative effective dose of 16.9 (IQR 9.9-26.3) mSv. Multivariable linear regression analysis revealed computed tomography use was associated with increased cumulative dose, whereas increased age was associated with lower cumulative dose. Over 74% of patients received more than 10 mSv, with 7.4% receiving more than 40 mSv. Conclusion(s): The number of radiographic studies and overall cumulative effective dose in patients hospitalized for complex pleural space infection was high with the median cumulative effective dose > 5 times normal yearly exposure. Ionizing radiation and modern radiology techniques have revolutionized medical care, but are likely not without risk. Additional study is warranted to identify the frequency and imaging type needed during complex pleural space infection management, attempting to keep ionizing radiation exposure as low as reasonably possible.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).",Excluded
2257,"Combined Use of Automatic Tube Voltage Selection and Current Modulation with Iterative Reconstruction for CT Evaluation of Small Hypervascular Hepatocellular Carcinomas: Effect on Lesion Conspicuity and Image Quality OBJECTIVE: To assess the lesion conspicuity and image quality in CT evaluation of small (<= 3 cm) hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) using automatic tube voltage selection (ATVS) and automatic tube current modulation (ATCM) with or without iterative reconstruction., MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and five patients with 123 HCC lesions were included. Fifty-seven patients were scanned using both ATVS and ATCM and images were reconstructed using either filtered back-projection (FBP) (group A1) or sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction (SAFIRE) (group A2). Forty-eight patients were imaged using only ATCM, with a fixed tube potential of 120 kVp and FBP reconstruction (group B). Quantitative parameters (image noise in Hounsfield unit and contrast-to-noise ratio of the aorta, the liver, and the hepatic tumors) and qualitative visual parameters (image noise, overall image quality, and lesion conspicuity as graded on a 5-point scale) were compared among the groups., RESULTS: Group A2 scanned with the automatically chosen 80 kVp and 100 kVp tube voltages ranked the best in lesion conspicuity and subjective and objective image quality (p values ranging from < 0.001 to 0.004) among the three groups, except for overall image quality between group A2 and group B (p = 0.022). Group A1 showed higher image noise (p = 0.005) but similar lesion conspicuity and overall image quality as compared with group B. The radiation dose in group A was 19% lower than that in group B (p = 0.022)., CONCLUSION: CT scanning with combined use of ATVS and ATCM and image reconstruction with SAFIRE algorithm provides higher lesion conspicuity and better image quality for evaluating small hepatic HCCs with radiation dose reduction.",Excluded
1941,"Epidemiology of lung cancer in women: A hospital-based descriptive study Objective: Lung cancer required much greater attention as it is the most common cause of death. According to statistics in 2010, 85% of lung cancer in men and 57% in women are attributed to tobacco smoking. The aim of the study was to describe the clinical and pathologic characteristics of the female patients who visited the Department of Medical Oncology of Acibadem Maslak Hospital between 2009 and 2017. Material(s) and Method(s): Clinicopathologic data collected for analyses included age at diagnosis, history of cigarette use, comorbid conditions, family history, tumor-node-metastasis stage, pathologic subtypes of lung carcinoma, and the given therapy. From July 2017 to February 2018, we collected data of 540 female patients with lung cancer at the Department of Medical Oncology of Acibadem Maslak Hospital. Result(s): Among 540 patients, 185 patients (34.3%) were nonsmokers, 106 (19.6%) were current smokers, and 210 (38.9%) were former smokers. Data on common comorbid conditions such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease were collected, and the conditions were classified according to the smoking status of the patients. Among current and former smokers, 36.7% were diagnosed with hypertension, 18.3% with diabetes mellitus, and 11% with coronary artery diseases. Moreover, 75% of all patients were diagnosed with nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), whereas 16% were diagnosed with small-cell lung cancer. Adenocarcinoma is the most common histological type of cancer seen in patients with NSCLC (77%), followed by patients with squamous cell carcinoma (15%). Conclusion(s): Factors other than tobacco use, such as radon exposure, air pollution, radiation exposure, and an unbalanced diet are responsible for the increasing incidence of lung cancer. However, further studies are warranted to investigate the cause of the epidemic differences in women, particularly the gender bias in nonsmoker patients with lung cancer.Copyright © 2020 by Turkish Society of Medical Oncology.",Excluded
1462,"Increased Postoperative Use of Computed Tomography following Emergency Surgery for Ileocaecal Crohn Disease Multiple imaging modalities are often required for the relapsing nature of Crohn disease (CD). Computed tomography (CT) offers a rapid acquisition of images and shows high specificity and sensitivity.

The aim of this study was to compare the use of preoperative and postoperative CT scan in patients undergoing emergency and elective surgery for CD. Method(s):All patients undergoing emergency and elective surgery for ileocaecal CD January 2014 to December 2018 were included in this prospective observational study. The study objective was to evaluate the frequency of use of CT scan perioperatively with the number and findings of preoperative and postoperative CT being the primary outcomes. The secondary outcomes were operating time, length of hospital stay, reoperations, and rehospitalization. Result(s):A total of 75 patients were included, 33 in the emergency group (43%) and 44 in the elective group (57%). There was a higher use of preoperative CT scan in the emergency surgery group, with 14 patients (42%) having a CT scan before surgery compared with 2 (5%) in the elective group (P=0.14). Thirteen patients (39.4%) had a postoperative CT scan in the emergency surgery group, compared with 10 patients (23.8%) in the elective surgery group. Conclusion(s):Patients undergoing emergency surgery for CD are at increased risk of exposure to ionizing radiations due to high perioperative use of CT scan.Copyright © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

2108,"Propensity score-based comparison of long-term outcomes with 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy vs intensity-modulated radiotherapy for esophageal cancer PURPOSE: Although 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) is the worldwide standard for the treatment of esophageal cancer, intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) improves dose conformality and reduces the radiation exposure to normal tissues. We hypothesized that the dosimetric advantages of IMRT should translate to substantive benefits in clinical outcomes compared with 3D-CRT., METHODS AND MATERIALS: An analysis was performed of 676 nonrandomized patients (3D-CRT, n=413; IMRT, n=263) with stage Ib-IVa (American Joint Committee on Cancer 2002) esophageal cancers treated with chemoradiotherapy at a single institution from 1998-2008. An inverse probability of treatment weighting and inclusion of propensity score (treatment probability) as a covariate were used to compare overall survival time, interval to local failure, and interval to distant metastasis, while accounting for the effects of other clinically relevant covariates. The propensity scores were estimated using logistic regression analysis., RESULTS: A fitted multivariate inverse probability weighted-adjusted Cox model showed that the overall survival time was significantly associated with several well-known prognostic factors, along with the treatment modality (IMRT vs 3D-CRT, hazard ratio 0.72, P<.001). Compared with IMRT, 3D-CRT patients had a significantly greater risk of dying (72.6% vs 52.9%, inverse probability of treatment weighting, log-rank test, P<.0001) and of locoregional recurrence (P=.0038). No difference was seen in cancer-specific mortality (Gray's test, P=.86) or distant metastasis (P=.99) between the 2 groups. An increased cumulative incidence of cardiac death was seen in the 3D-CRT group (P=.049), but most deaths were undocumented (5-year estimate, 11.7% in 3D-CRT vs 5.4% in IMRT group, Gray's test, P=.0029)., CONCLUSIONS: Overall survival, locoregional control, and noncancer-related death were significantly better after IMRT than after 3D-CRT. Although these results need confirmation, IMRT should be considered for the treatment of esophageal cancer. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

A three-dimensional model of thoracolumbar spine and simulative PVP models (via double transpedicular approach) were built in the Mimics software. With the help of a preoperative transparent marker located at the back midline skin and preoperative digital design by Mimics software, the needle insert point and needle direction in every patient were established. The surgical time, the number of intraoperative radiation perspective, bone cement filling condition in fracture vertebra, intraoperative complications and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores before and after surgery were recorded to evaluate the preliminary clinical results after modified PVP., RESULTS: The puncture process during PVP was in high accordance with the preoperative digital design by Mimics software in seven cases of single OVCF with the average age of 78 years old. The operation time was only 16.57+/-2.07 minutes and the intraoperative radiation perspective numbers were less than ten (7.86+/-1.68) times. The bone cement filling in all fracture vertebras were good and no surgical complications such as spine cord injury and cement leakage were founded.

Due to the relatively young age of these subjects, osteoporosis was not taken into consideration and bone mineral density was not assessed. We report three type 1 diabetes cases in young patients with durations of 2, 4, and 19 years. These patients had severe hypoglycemic attacks during night sleep with subsequent compression thoracic vertebrae fractures. Laboratory parameters for diabetes control, calcium, phosphate metabolismand celiac-specific antibodies were assessed. Moreover, kidney, thyroid, and parathyroid gland functions were also measured. Bone mineral density was assessed by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Lumbar spine x-ray absorptiometry revealed very low bone mineral density in all three patients. In all subjects, metabolic control was good, no chronic diabetes complications were found and other laboratory parameters were within a normal range. For the first time, itwas demonstrated that lowbone mineral density in young type 1 diabetes patients may contribute to an increased compression fracture risk of the dorsal spine during severe nocturnal hypoglycemia courses. The possibility of osteoporosis in young patients with short diabetes durations suggests it might be advisable to perform bone mineral density testing during diabetes diagnoses. Spinal pain occurrences in young patients after severe nocturnal hypoglycemia should be investigated using procedures for the diagnosis of vertebral compression fracture, even if there is no evident trauma. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Identifying and localising digits appear to be different process mediated predominantly by the left and right hemisphere, respectively.

1520,"Gamma knife radiosurgery in the treatment of tumor-related facial pain Background: Intracranial neoplasms can cause pain similar to trigeminal neuralgia. Literature regarding radiosurgery for this is limited. We present a retrospective review of patients with tumor-related facial pain from benign lesions treated with gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) at Wake Forest University. Objective(s): The primary objectives were to determine long-term pain relief and predictive factors for pain alleviation. Method(s): We reviewed 515 patients treated with GKRS for benign meningioma, vestibular schwannoma or trigeminal schwannoma between August 1999 and August 2010. Twenty-one eligible patients had tumor-related facial pain prior to GKRS. The median marginal tumor dose was 12 Gy. Long-term pain relief data were obtained by chart review and telephone interview. Result(s): The median follow-up for symptom evaluation was 3.8 years. Seventeen of 21 patients (81%) experienced a Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) score of I-III at 6 months following GKRS. Kaplan-Meier estimates of freedom from BNI IV-V relapse were 66% at 1 year and 53% at 2 years. No pain relapses occurred after 2 years.

PEM synergizes with ionizing radiation and CIS in preclinical models. PEM+CIS doublets showed efficacy and favourable toxicity profiles in Phase I/II studies of NS-NSCLC. This singlearm multicenter Phase II study investigated efficacy and safety of PEM+CIS induction followed by full-dose PEM+CIS plus concurrent RT in pts with LA NS-NSCLC. Material(s) and Method(s): Pts with unresectable Stage IIIA/IIIB NS-NSCLC, ECOG performance status (PS) 0-1 and forced expiratory volume (FEV) >50% of predicted normal FEV received two 21-day cycles of PEM 500 mg/m2 + CIS 75 mg/m2 on Day 1. Pts who had not progressed, had no residual neurological toxicity >Grade(G) 2, PS 0-1 and lung V20 <35% then received 2 cycles of the same full-dose PEM+CIS regimen plus concurrent thoracic RT of 2 Gy/fraction, 5d/wk for 7wks (66 Gy total). All pts received vitamin supplementation/dexamethasone prophylaxis as per PEM-label. Primary endpoint was the 1 yr progression-free survival (PFS) rate. A minimum of 53 events was required to provide 90% power to demonstrate an improvement of the 1 yr PFS rate from 45% (historical data) to 60% at a 2-sided alpha level of 5%, resulting in a sample size of 88 pts assuming 10% dropouts. Secondary data presented include tumor response and toxicity. Result(s): 90 pts were enrolled in 4 countries: median age 61 yrs, male/ female 57%/43%, ECOG PS 0/1 66%/34%, mean (SD) FEV 2.3 (0.62)L, adenocarcinoma 90%, Stage IIIA/IIIB 36%/62% (2 pts had Stage IV and discontinued before starting RT). 75 pts (83.3%) completed induction CT and started concurrent CT+RT. 63 of the 75 pts (84.0%) received all 4 CT cycles and full RT of 66 Gy. Median PEM+CIS dose intensities were >97% during concurrent CT+RT, median RT dose was 66 Gy (range 18-66 Gy). The 1 yr PFS rate was 51.3% (95% CI 42.0-60.5). After a median follow-up of 24 months, median PFS was 10.6 months (95% CI 8.6-17.3). Response data are shown as table. One pt died from study-drug related toxicity (enteritis) during Cycle 4. Four pts discontinued due to non-fatal drug- or radiation related adverse events, 1 on induction CT (renal failure), 3 on concurrent CT+RT (hypoacusis, 2x radiation esophagitis). During induction CT, 18.9% of pts reported G3/4 CTCAEs, only neutropenia (2.2%) and syncope (2.2%) were reported by >1 pt.

1886,"The use of spectrophotometry to estimate melanin density in Caucasians The density of cutaneous melanin may be the property of the skin that protects it from damage by solar radiation, but there is not an accepted, noninvasive method of measuring it. To determine whether the density of cutaneous melanin can be estimated from reflectance of visible light by the skin, reflectance of 15-nm wavebands of light by the skin of the inner upper arm of each of 82 volunteers was measured at 20-nm intervals with a Minolta 508 spectrophotometer. A 3-mm skin biopsy was then taken from the same site, and four nonserial sections of it were stained with Masson Fontana for melanin. The melanin content of the basal area was calculated using the NIH Image analysis system. We show that cutaneous melanin in Caucasians can be estimated by the difference between two measurements of reflectance of visible light by the skin: those at wavelengths 400 and 420 nm. This new spectrophotometric measurement was more highly correlated (r = 0.68) with the histological measurements of cutaneous melanin than was skin reflectance of light of wavelength 680 nm (r = 0.33). Reflectances in the range of 650-700 nm have been used previously in skin cancer research.

2224,"Optimizing the flattening filter free beam selection in RapidArc R-based stereotactic body radiotherapy for Stage I lung cancer OBJECTIVE: To optimize the flattening filter-free (FFF) beam selection in stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) treatment for Stage I lung cancer in different fraction schemes., METHODS: Treatment plans from 12 patients suffering from Stage I lung cancer were designed using the 6XFFF and 10XFFF beams in different fraction schemes of 4 x 12, 3 x 18 and 1 x 34 Gy. Plans were evaluated mainly in terms of organs at risk (OARs) sparing, normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) estimation and treatment efficiency., RESULTS: Compared with the 10XFFF beam, 6XFFF beam showed statistically significant lower dose to all the OARs investigated. The percentage of NTCP reduction for both lung and chest wall was about 10% in the fraction schemes of 4 x 12 and 3 x 18 Gy, whereas only 7.4% and 2.6% was obtained in the 1 x 34 Gy scheme. For oesophagus, heart and spinal cord, the reduction was greater with the 6XFFF beam, but their absolute estimates were <10(-6)%. The mean beam-on time for 6XFFF and 10XFFF beams at 4 x 12, 3 x 18 and 1 x 34 Gy schemes were 2.2 +/- 0.2 vs 1.5 +/- 0.1, 3.3 +/- 0.9 vs 2.0 +/- 0.5 and 6.3 +/- 0.9 vs 3.5 +/- 0.4 min, respectively., CONCLUSION: The 6XFFF beam obtains better OARs sparing and lower incidence of NTCP in SBRT treatment of Stage I lung cancer, whereas the 10XFFF beam improves the treatment efficiency. To balance the OARs sparing and intrafractional variation owing to the prolonged treatment time, the authors recommend using the 6XFFF beam in the 4 x 12 and 3 x 18 Gy schemes but the 10XFFF beam in the 1 x 34 Gy scheme., ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: This study optimizes the FFF beam selection in different fraction schemes in SBRT treatment of Stage I lung cancer.",Excluded
1829,"Reirradiation with robotic stereotactic body radiotherapy for recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma BACKGROUND: Recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) after previous radiotherapy is challenging. There is no standard approach for salvage treatment. Here we present toxicity and treatment results for recurrent NFC patients who underwent fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT) as second line radiotherapy (RT)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between April 2009 and July 2012, 24 patients, with a male to female ratio of 3:1, were treated with CykerKnife R FSRT for recurrent NFC in our institution. Seven out of 24 patients had metastatic recurrent disease. Median age was 53 years (range, 20-70 years). Initial RT dose was 70Gy. The time period between initial RT and FSRT was a median of 33.2 months. The median prescription dose for FSRT was 30Gy (range, 24-30 Gy) in a median of 5 fractions (range, 4-6)., RESULTS: The median follow-up for all patients was 19.5 months (IQR: 12.2. -29.2 months). The locoregional control; progression free survival and overall survival (OS) rates for 1-, 2- and 3-year were 64%, 38%, 21%; 60%, 30%, 17% and 83%, 43%, 31%, respectively. Median OS for the entire cohort was 22 months (95% CI: 16.5-27.5). On multivariate analysis recurrent tumor stage was the only prognostic factor for OS (p=0.004). One patient exhibited grade III temporal lobe necrosis. One died because of grade IV mucositis and overlapping infection., CONCLUSIONS: The treatment of recurrent NPC is controversial. Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy is promising. However, the published trials are heterogeneous with respect to the selection criteria and treatment details. Prospective studies with long term follow-up data are warranted.",Excluded
1710,"Towards improved prognostic scores predicting survival in patients with brain metastases: A pilot study of serum lactate dehydrogenase levels Accurate prognostic information is desirable when counselling patients with brain metastases regarding their therapeutic options and life expectancy. Based on previous studies, we selected serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as a promising factor on which we perform a pilot study investigating methodological aspects of biomarker studies in patients with brain metastases, before embarking on large-scale studies that will look at a larger number of candidate markers in an expanded patient cohort. For this retrospective analysis, 100 patients with available information on LDH treated with palliative whole-brain radiotherapy were selected. A comprehensive evaluation of different LDH-based variables was performed in uni- and multivariate tests. Probably, the most intriguing finding was that LDH kinetics might be more important, or at least complement, information obtained from a single measurement immediately before radiotherapy. LDH and performance status outperformed several other variables that are part of prognostic models such as recursive partitioning analyses classes and graded prognostic assessment score. LDH kinetics might reflect disease behaviour in extracranial metastatic and primary sites without need for comprehensive imaging studies and is a quite inexpensive diagnostic test. Based on these encouraging results, confirmatory studies in a larger cohort of patients are warranted. Copyright 2012 Carsten Nieder et al.",Excluded
1464,"Kennedy Space Center Cardiovascular Disease Risk Reduction Program evaluation This program evaluation examined the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Risk Reduction Program which aims to identify CVD risk factors and reduce these risk factors through health education phone counseling. High risk participants (those having two or more elevated lipid values) are identified from monthly voluntary CVD screenings and counseled. Phone counseling consists of reviewing lab values with the participant, discussing dietary fat intake frequency using an intake questionnaire, and promoting the increase in exercise frequency. The participants are followed-up at two-months and five-months for relevant metrics including blood pressure, weight, body mass index (BMI), total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, dietary fat intake, and exercise frequency. Data for three years of the KSC CVD Program included 366 participants, average age of 49 years, 75% male, and 25% female. For those with complete two and five month follow-up data, significant baseline to two-month follow-up comparisons included decreases in systolic blood pressure (p = 0.03); diastolic blood pressure (p = 0.002); total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and dietary fat intake (all three at p < 0.0001) as well as a significant increase in exercise frequency (p = 0.04). Significant baseline to five-month follow-up comparisons included decreases in triglycerides (p = 0.05); and total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and dietary intake (all three at p < 0.0001).

Patients with locally advanced rectal cancer enrolled between 1997 and 2008 in an observational study of preoperative SC-RT were analysed. The treatment algorithm was neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (CT) administered for four cycles, followed by preoperative SC-RT administered 1 week after chemotherapy completion, delivering 20 Gy in five fractions over 1 week. Immediately in the following week surgery was performed. The adjuvant 5-FU-based CT was planned for pathological stage UICC>=II. LC, overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), early and late complications (RTOG scale) were analysed. All patients completed the EORTC QoL (C-30 and C-38), Faecal Incontinence QoL, and International Index of Erectile Function questionnaires (IIEF). A total of 67 patients were analysed. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy were well tolerated. At the pathological analysis, stable disease was obtained in 24 patients (36%), reduction of disease stage in 34 patients (50.7%), and progression in nine cases (13.3%). Adjuvant chemotherapy was indicated in 21 patients. Two locoregional recurrences, both within the radiotherapy volume, were observed, resulting in a 5-year LC of 97%. The 5-year DFS was 84%, with mean time to systemic progression of 24 months. After a mean follow-up of 114 months, the 5-year OS rate was 67%. Late toxicity >grade II was observed in 9% of patients. High anterior resection (AR) patients had significantly better scores than low AR or abdomino-perineal resection (APR). A total of 89% of the patients treated with conservative surgery had regular anal sphincter function. In male patients undergoing AR or APR, erectile dysfunction was found in 47% and 75% of the cases, respectively.

As sson as 24 to 48 hours after excision of the keloid by mostly atraumatic surgical technique, and closing the wound as tension-free as possible, radiation therapy is begun. This takes place under the conditions of surface therapy in single doses of 1.5 Gray two or three times per week up to a total dose of 9 to 12 Gray. Good cosmetic and functional results can be achieved with this technique. The rate of recurrences is extremely low. The radiation load to the patient is so small that it seems justifiable to recommend the combined treatment as the routine method for therapy of keloids. In cases of a known disposition for developing keloids or cicatricial hypertrophies, postoperative radiation therapy is indicated as a prophylactic measure, especially after surgery in the facial region.",Excluded

With an increasing incidence of MC, it is important to explore the association between exposure to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, statins, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and MC in a larger setting., METHODS: Case-control study based on nationwide Danish registries. The study included all patients with MC diagnosis during the period 2005 to 2011. One hundred sex- and age-matched controls per case were randomly selected among the Danish population. Prescriptions were recorded in a Prescription Register in the year before the first recorded MC diagnosis. Effect measure is the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of collagenous colitis (CC) and lymphocytic colitis (LC) according to prescriptions of PPIs, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, statins, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Within the control group, we identified a subgroup with MC-free colonic biopsies., RESULTS: We identified 3474 patients with CC and 2277 with LC and found a positive association between redemption of prescriptions for PPIs and both CC (OR = 7.04; 95% confidence interval, 6.55-7.56) and LC (OR = 3.37; 95% confidence interval, 3.08-3.69). Among patients with MC-free colon biopsies in the control group, the association between PPIs and CC was strongly positive (OR = 3.47; 95% confidence interval, 3.08-3.89). Adding this parameter to the model attenuated all of the associations, but they remained positive for PPIs versus CC and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors versus LC., CONCLUSIONS: We found positive associations between exposure to all 4 medication classes and MC.

The aim is to study the sun-protective behavior of Danish outdoor workers at work, at leisure, and on sun holiday and compare it to that of indoor workers. Method(s): This is a cross-sectional study, based on a 53-item survey completed by Danish outdoor (n = 380) and indoor workers (n = 119) in 2016-2017. Status as outdoor or indoor worker was decided based on self-report and behavioral differences were tested using (paired) t tests and multiple regression adjusted for age, sex, educational level, history of smoking, and skin type. Result(s): Danish outdoor workers at work use sun protection less than they do at leisure and on sun holiday (alpha <.05) where their sun protection behavior is similar to that of indoor workers. The proportion of Danish outdoor workers that always/often use sun protection at work is for shade seeking around noon 4.2%, sunscreen 34.5%, wide-brimmed hat 25.3%, and long trousers and shirt with sleeves 42.4%. Of Danish outdoor workers, 49.5% do not think about the risk of occupational skin cancer and 11.8% think the risk is insignificant, 32.4% think that the use of sun protection is of low or no importance, 84.2% consider sunburn important as skin cancer risk factor still 88.9% have a history of sunburn at work, > 80.0% agree that risk of skin cancer is reduced by the use of sun protection, and only 4.0% dismiss the possibility of sun protection use at work. Conclusion(s): Skin cancer risk and use of sun protection at work are largely neglected in Danish outdoor workers, more so than at leisure and on sun holiday where their risk behavior resembles that of indoor workers.

However, EVL is associated with complications such as hemorrhage, chest pain, dysphagia, and odynophagia due to post-EVL ulcers in the esophageal mucosa. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of proton pump inhibitor (PPI), pantoprazole on the healing of post-EVL ulcers., METHODS: Forty seven patients were randomly allocated into PPI group and control group. Patients in PPI group received 40 mg of pantoprazole intravenously for 3 days after EVL, then 40 mg of oral pantoprazole for 11 days consecutively. Control patients received intravenous and oral placebo. Endoscopic examinations were performed twice at 7+/-2 days and 14+/-2 days after EVL respectively. Clinical outcomes include the size of ulcers, symptoms reported by patients; chest pain, dysphagia, and odynophagia., RESULTS: Forty seven patients completed the 7 days protocol (PPI/control; 25/22), and twenty six patients completed the 14 days protocol (PPI/control; 16/10). Post-EVL ulcers in PPI group were significantly smaller than those in control group (7 days; 98.7 mm2/119.4 m2, 14 days; 32.3 m2/43.8 m2, p<0.01). No difference was observed between two the groups with respect to summations of symptom scores (p> 0.05). Nineteen patients (PPI/control; 9/10) did not complete the 14 days protocol due to patients' refusal and adverse outcomes, such as hepatic failure and sepsis with bleeding from post-EVL ulcer occurred in two patients of control group., CONCLUSIONS: PPI treatment following EVL may be effective in healing post-EVL ulcer.",Excluded

We present a retrospective study of a series of patients who are diagnosed with Dt-GCT about the ankle joint, there clinical outcome is evaluated in this study. Material(s) and Method(s): Fifteen patients with radiologically and histologically confirmed Dt-GCT about the ankle joint were identified in our foot and ankle department. Patients were managed with open synovectomy for the tumor tissue and bone grafting for bony erosions. X-rays and MRI scans were used for evaluation of the tumor and bony erosions pre- and post-operatively. Pre- and post-operative ankle function was assessed using the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society -Ankle and Hindfoot (AOFAS-AH) score and the Muscularskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) score. Result(s): The mean follow-up duration was 37.4 months (range 25 to 50 months). There were 6 males and 9 females, with a mean age of 35 years old (range 18 to 65 years).

1813,"Phase 2 study of preoperative image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy to reduce wound and combined modality morbidities in lower extremity soft tissue sarcoma BACKGROUND: This study sought to determine if preoperative image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IG-IMRT) can reduce morbidity, including wound complications, by minimizing dose to uninvolved tissues in adults with lower extremity soft tissue sarcoma. METHOD(S): The primary endpoint was the development of an acute wound complication (WC). IG-IMRT was used to conform volumes to avoid normal tissues (skin flaps for wound closure, bone, or other uninvolved soft tissues). From July 2005 to June 2009, 70 adults were enrolled; 59 were evaluable for the primary endpoint. Median tumor size was 9.5 cm; 55 tumors (93%) were high-grade and 58 (98%) were deep to fascia. RESULT(S): Eighteen (30.5%) patients developed WCs. This was not statistically significantly different from the result of the National Cancer Institute of Canada SR2 trial (P =.2); however, primary closure technique was possible more often (55 of 59 patients [93.2%] versus 50 of 70 patients [71.4%]; P =.002), and secondary operations for WCs were somewhat reduced (6 of 18 patients [33%] versus 13 of 30 patients [43%]; P =.55). Moderate edema, skin, subcutaneous, and joint toxicity was present in 6 (11.1%), 1 (1.9%), 5 (9.3%), and 3 (5.6%) patients, respectively, but there were no bone fractures. Four local recurrences (6.8%, none near the flaps) occurred with median follow-up of 49 months. CONCLUSION(S): The 30.5% incidence of WCs was numerically lower than the 43% risk derived from the National Cancer Institute of Canada SR2 trial, but did not reach statistical significance. Preoperative IG-IMRT significantly diminished the need for tissue transfer. RT chronic morbidities and the need for subsequent secondary operations for WCs were lowered, although not significantly, whereas good limb function was maintained.

2259,"FANCD2 depletion sensitizes cancer cells repopulation ability in vitro Inactivation of Fanconi anemia/BRCA pathway in some cancers causes increased sensitivity to various drugs used for chemo-therapy. Several approaches have been suggested to artificially disrupt this pathway for better treatment. In our study, we have utilized RNA interference technique to knock-down the expression of FANCD2 and sensitize cancer cells undergoing treatment with DNA damaging agents. For this purpose, we transiently depleted FANCD2 by siRNA in a number of breast, bladder, or liver cancer cell lines and screened for mitomycin C or gamma-irradiation sensitivity changes. We could show that knocking-down FANCD2 gene expression increases sensitivity of cancer cells to mitomycin C and to less extent to gamma-rays. Importantly, this effect strongly correlates to repopulation ability of cancer cells and those cell lines with significant FANCD2 depletion revealed decreased recurrence capacity. In summary, the results we presented show proof of principle that opens new possibilities for further preclinical trials.",Excluded

The patients' kerma area product (KAP) values were recorded, and the entrance surface air kerma (ESAK) was calculated based on the X-ray tube output, exposure parameters and technical data. The 75th percentiles of the distribution of ESAK and KAP values were also estimated. The dose values were compared with the corresponding values for normal patients obtained from a previous survey in our hospital, as well as with the national and UK diagnostic reference levels (DRLs). The correlation of dose values with patient size metrics (mass, height, BMI) was also investigated. A statistically significant difference was found in KAP and the ESAK values between low BMI and normal patients (Mann-Whitney test, p < 0.05), for all examinations studied. The percentage difference for chest PA, chest LAT, abdomen PA, lumbar spine AP, lumbar spine LAT, pelvis AP and KUB AP examinations was 40, 36, 48, 68, 57, 46 and 67% for median KAP and 26, 43, 52, 48, 19, 44 and 51% for median ESAK, respectively. The corresponding 75th percentiles for low BMI patients were 0.065, 0.349, 0.683, 1.54, 3.92, 1.11, 0.67 mGy and 0.042, 0.218, 0.450, 0.280, 0.598, 0.597, 0.267 Gycm2 in terms of ESAK and KAP values, respectively. They were 74-90% lower compared to the national diagnostic reference levels (DRLs), 35-84% and 58-82% compared to the UK DRLs, for ESAK and KAP values, respectively. Regarding the gender of the patients, no statistically significant difference was found in the dose values between female and male patients (Mann-Whitney test, p > 0.05), for all examinations studied. A statistically significant correlation was found between ESAK and KAP values with BMI for KUB AP, pelvis AP, lumbar spine AP, lumbar spine LAT and chest PA, while for chest LAT examinations, only the ESAK were significantly correlated with BMI. They also significantly correlated with the mass for KUB AP, lumbar spine LAT, abdomen PA and chest PA examinations, while no significant correlation was found between the dose values and patients' height. It can be concluded that the low BMI patients received a significantly reduced radiation dose compared to normal patients. Additional studies need to be conducted for these patient groups, which could contribute to the further development of a radiation protection culture in diagnostic radiography.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

1411,"An investigation of different types of eyewear and face shields in protecting patients and operators from the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation BACKGROUND: Phototherapy and photochemotherapy are commonly used treatment modalities for a range of chronic skin conditions. Whilst undergoing ultraviolet radiation exposure, patients can wear personal protective equipment. Face shields in combination with other forms of skin cover may be worn to provide both skin and eye protection. There are a number of different types of eyewear and face shields available for purchase. Some of these have clear identifications that show the levels of protection provided whilst others may not have any., METHODS: A series of similar experiments has been undertaken independently at two phototherapy treatment centres-Chapel Allerton Hospital, Leeds and Ninewells Hospital, Dundee-to investigate the effectiveness of different face shields and eye protection that are available for purchase in the United Kingdom (UK). Two similar examples of one face shield were tested at both centres, and another was transferred between the units., RESULTS: Not all examples of the face shields and protective eyewear provided the wearer full protection between 300 nanometres and 400 nanometres (nm). Cost and conformance to different standards was not always a good indicator. Some inexpensive examples tested also met British Association of Dermatology protective sunglasses guidelines., CONCLUSIONS: It is incumbent on all centres to check the properties of protective face shields and eyewear provided to patients and operators to guard against the effects from ultraviolet radiation. There is no correlation between price of the protective equipment and level of protection offered, and there may be opportunity for cost savings. Copyright © 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The aim of this study was to determine if application of these QUANTEC criteria also protected against moderate-to-severe patient-rated xerostomia., MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 307 head and neck cancer patients treated with primary (chemo)radiotherapy, either with 3D-CRT (56%) or with IMRT (44%). All patients participated in a standard follow-up program in which radiation-induced toxicity and quality of life were prospectively assessed. Patients who met the QUANTEC criteria were classified as low risk and otherwise as high risk., RESULTS: In total, 41% of the patients (treated with 3D-CRT and IMRT) were classified as low risk patients. In the group treated with 3D-CRT and IMRT, it was possible to meet the QUANTEC criteria in 47% and 32% of the patients, respectively. Sparing the parotid glands with IMRT was considerably more difficult in patients with lymph node metastases and in patients with nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal tumours. Low risk patients reported significantly less moderate-to-severe xerostomia than high risk patients. However, the predicted risk of elderly patients and patients with pre-existing minor patient-rated xerostomia at baseline was > 20%, even when the QUANTEC criteria were met., CONCLUSIONS: Significantly lower rates of radiation-induced patient-rated xerostomia were found among low risk patients treated according to the QUANTEC criteria, but these criteria do not completely protect against xerostomia. Particularly in elderly patients and patients already suffering from minor xerostomia at baseline, the QUANTEC criteria do not sufficiently protect against persistent, moderate-to-severe patient-rated xerostomia.",Excluded
2174,"Cell cycle radiosensitivity of progeny of irradiated primary cultured human hepatocarcinoma cells Aim: To evaluate the change of growth characteristics and radiosensitivity of irradiated primary cultured human hepatocarcinoma cells. Method(s): All tumor tissue samples were obtained from 39 hepatocarcinoma patients with a mean age of 49.6 years (range 22-76 years). We divided the samples into irradiated group and non-irradiated group and measured their plating efficiency (PE), population doubling time (PDT), radiosensitivity index SF2 and cell cycle. Result(s): The PDT of primary culture of hepatocarcinoma cells was 91.0+/-6.6 h, PE was 12.0+/-1.4%, SF2 was 0.41+/-0.05%. The PDT of their irradiated progeny was 124.8+/-5.8 h, PE was 5.0+/-0.7%, SF2 was 0.65+/-0.09%. The primary cultured human hepatocarcinoma cells showed significant S reduction and G2 arrest in a dose-dependent manner. The progeny of irradiated primary cultured hepatocarcinoma cells grew more slowly and its radiosensitivity increased. Conclusion(s): The progeny of irradiated primary cultured human hepatocarcinoma cells grows more slowly and its radiosensitivity increases. ©2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier Inc.

1835,"Right ventricular function in patients with acute pulmonary embolism: Analysis with electrocardiography-synchronized multi-detector row CT Purpose: To prospectively assess electrocardiography (ECG)-synchronized multi-detector row computed tomography (CT) for the evaluation of right ventricular (RV) function in patients suspected of having pulmonary embolism (PE). Material(s) and Method(s): All patients gave informed consent after the study details, including radiation exposure, were explained; institutional ethical committee approval was obtained. Nonsynchronized multi-detector row CT of the chest was performed in 66 consecutive patients (29 men, 37 women; mean age, 58 years +/- 15 [standard deviation]) who were suspected of having PE. ECG-synchronized cardiac multi-detector row CT was performed to assess cardiac function. Dimension ratios for the RV and left ventricle (LV) were measured on nonsynchronized transverse and angulated four-chamber views. Furthermore, the RV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes were measured on ECG-synchronized multi-detector row CT scans. An independent samples t test was performed to compare the mean value of different groups. An analysis of variance post hoc test was performed to investigate whether the values of the variables varied between groups. Result(s): PE was detected in 29 of 66 patients. The location of PE was categorized as central (n = 17) or peripheral (n = 12). The RV/LV dimension ratio was larger on the four-chamber view (P = .002), and RV end-systolic volume was larger (P = .01) and ejection fraction was lower (P = .01) in patients with PE. The RV end-systolic volumes and RV/LV volume ratios, as assessed by using ECG-synchronized multi-detector row CT, showed significant differences (P < .005) between patients with central PE and those with peripheral PE. However, the RV/LV dimensions on nonsynchronized images revealed no significant differences. Conclusion(s): Retrospective ECG-synchronized multi-detector row CT facilitates detection of RV dysfunction, depending on pulmonary embolus location. © RSNA, 2006.",Excluded
1833,"Association of pretreatment serum albumin with reduction in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma tumor volume during curative external beam radiation therapy Purpose/Objective(s): Patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) have been shown to lose more weight compared to patients with tumors at other sub-sites during external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). Furthermore, severe malnutrition before EBRT initiation may affect treatment outcome. This study investigated the association of factors, including nutritional status before treatment initiation, with gross tumor volume shrinkage rates (GTVSRs) during EBRT in OSCC patients. Materials/Methods: This retrospective study included 65 consecutive OSCC patients [55 males, 10 females, median age 65 years (38e82)] with no prior OSCC surgery. They were treated with definitive EBRT between November 2006 and December 2014. Tumors were staged as T1 (n = 7, 11%), T2 (n = 21, 32%), T3 (n = 18, 28%), T4a (n = 15, 23%), or T4b (n=4, 6%); N0 (n=9, 14%), N1 (n=3, 5%), N2a (n=3, 5%), N2b (n Z 26, 40%), N2c (n = 18, 27%), or N3 (n = 6, 9%); and as M0 (n = 64, 98%) or M1 (n = 1, 2%). Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) was performed in 48 patients (74%) before EBRT initiation. Total radiation doses were as follows: 70 Gy, n = 62 (94%) and 71, 66, and 64 Gy, n = 1 each (2%). Computed tomography (CT) images were acquired prior to EBRT initiation and at 3e5 weeks after EBRT initiation for re-planning. Cervical body volume (CBV) was evaluated before EBRT initiation using initial CT images. GTVSRs were calculated based on initial and re-planning CT images. Four patients (6%) received induction chemotherapy (IC). Fifty-seven patients (88%) received concurrent chemotherapy (CC) using following regimen: TPF [docetaxel (DTX), cisplatin (CDDP), and 5-fluorouracil] (n = 29, 44%); another CDDP-based menu (n = 22, 34%); the other DTX-based menu (n = 3, 5%); and cetuximab (n = 3, 5%). Univariate analyses (UA) and multivariate analyses (MA) were performed to identify baseline factors related to the GTVSR. Potential variables include age, gender, T and N stage, use of IC, use of CC, CC menu, use of PEG, serum albumin (Alb), Alb globulin ratio (AGR), C-reactive protein (CRP), CBV, body weight (BW), and body mass index (BMI) before treatment initiation. Variables with UAvalues of P < 0.10 were included in MAs. Result(s): The median GTVSR was 51.1% (range, -9.8e86.8%). The median pretreatment Alb, AGR, CRP, CBV, BWand BMI were as follows: 3.7 g/dl (range, 2.5e4.7 g/dl), 1.2 (range, 0.5e1.7), 0.5 mg/dl (range, 0.1e10.4 mg/dl), 1552.3 cc (range, 962.8e2229.5 cc), 58.3 kg (range, 35.0e80.9 kg), and 20.7 kg/m2 (range, 12.9e28.8 kg/m2). In UAs, N0 stage (P = 0.032), N1>= stage (P = 0.036), Alb (P = 0.006), CBV (P = 0.007), and BW (PZ0.041) were significant. N2a>= stage (PZ0.05), use of PEG (PZ 0.052), DTX-based menu (P = 0.058), and BMI (P =0.05) were marginally significant. MAs revealed an association of higher pretreatment Alb with GTVSR (P = 0.02; 95% confidence interval, 2.94e32.47). Conclusion(s): Higher pretreatment Alb was associated with greater GTVSR during curative EBRT. Assessing pretreatment Alb may be crucial for selecting optimal OSCC treatment strategy.",Excluded

1633,"Optimization of stereotactic radiotherapy treatment delivery technique for base-of-skull meningiomas This study compares static conformal field (CF), intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), and dynamic arcs (DA) for the stereotactic radiotherapy of base-of-skull meningiomas. Twenty-one cases of base-of-skull meningioma (median planning target volume [PTV] = 21.3 cm3) previously treated with stereotactic radiotherapy were replanned with each technique. The plans were compared for Radiation Therapy Oncology Group conformity index (CI) and homogeneity index (HI), and doses to normal structures at 6 dose values from 50.4 Gy to 5.6 Gy. The mean CI was 1.75 (CF), 1.75 (DA), and 1.66 (IMRT) (p < 0.05 when comparing IMRT to either CF or DA plans). The CI (IMRT) was inversely proportional to the size of the PTV (Spearman's rho = -0.53, p = 0.01) and at PTV sizes above 25 cm3, the CI (IMRT) was always superior to CI (DA) and CI (CF). At PTV sizes below 25 cm3, there was no significant difference in CI between each technique. There was no significant difference in HI between plans. The total volume of normal tissue receiving 50.4, 44.8, and 5.6 Gy was significantly lower when comparing IMRT to CF and DA plans (p < 0.05). There was significantly improved dose sparing for the brain stem and ipsilateral temporal lobe with IMRT but no significant difference for the optic chiasm or pituitary gland. These results demonstrate that stereotactic IMRT should be considered to treat base-of-skull meningiomas with a PTV larger than 25 cm3, due to improved conformity and normal tissue sparing, in particular for the brain stem and ipsilateral temporal lobe.",Excluded

2358,"Creating percutaneous radiocephalic arteriovenous fistulas at the wrist Background: The first arteriovenous fistulas were created at the wrist more than 60 years ago. Basic surgical construction techniques remain unchanged with mobilization and repositioning of the vessels followed by a sutured anastomosis. We used the Ellipsys device to construct percutaneous radiocephalic-arteriovenous fistulas at the wrist and report the results. Method(s): Data were reviewed retrospectively for all patients who had a percutaneous radiocephalic-arteriovenous fistula created during a 6-month period. Each individual underwent ultrasound vessel mapping in addition to physical examination. When a radiocephalic-arteriovenous fistula was feasible and a communicating vein 2 mm in diameter was noted in the distal forearm along with a radial artery 2 mm, a percutaneous radiocephalic-arteriovenous fistula was considered and reviewed with the patient. Result(s): Four individuals met the criteria to consider a percutaneous radiocephalic-arteriovenous fistula and all elected to have the procedure performed. Ages were 54-85 years. Three were diabetic and one was female. All percutaneous radiocephalic-arteriovenous fistulas were technically successful. Two individuals had not yet started dialysis therapy. Successful and repetitive cannulation for the two individuals with catheters was initiated at 4 and 8 weeks post procedure. The two pre-dialysis patients had physiologic arteriovenous fistula maturation (6 mm vein diameter and >500 mL/min flow) at 4 and 12 weeks. There were no procedural or late complications and none required intervention. Follow-up was 8-23 months (mean 16 months). Conclusion(s): The success of these percutaneous radiocephalic-arteriovenous fistulas suggests that use of the Ellipsys device will be applicable at the wrist in selected patients where appropriate vessel sizes and configurations are found.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.",Excluded
2379,"Prognostic value of positron emission tomography/computed tomography findings in limited-stage small cell lung cancer before chemoradiation therapy Objectives: Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is increasingly used for disease staging and evaluation of treatment effectiveness in limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC). However, the prognostic value of PET/CT metrics in LS-SCLC is not clear. Method(s): Subjects in this retrospective study were 50 patients with LS-SCLC who had had PET/CT before definitive chemoradiation therapy in January 2003 to August 2009; 15 (29%) had also had induction chemotherapy. Median radiation dose was 45 Gy (range, 40.5 to 61.8 Gy). All scans were read and scored by 1 radiologist. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate survival outcomes, and Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the prognostic value of pretreatment standardized uptake values (SUVs) with regard to locoregional control (LRC) and overall survival (OS). Result(s): At a median follow-up time of 18.2 months (range, 2.1 to 78 mo), LRC rates were 64% at 2 and 3 years; OS rates were 81% at 2 years and 61% at 3 years. None of the metrics assessed (receipt of induction chemotherapy, pretreatment SUV primary, SUVnodal, meanSUVmax) was associated with LRC or OS, but patients with residual SUV<=5.5 after treatment had a 3-year OS rate of 69% versus 34% for those with SUV>5.5. Conclusion(s): Pretreatment PET/CT metrics had no prognostic significance for patients with LS-SCLC, perhaps because of the rapid proliferation of SCLC or other confounding factors affecting survival.

2305,"Radiation-associated changes in the length of telomeres in peripheral leukocytes from inpatients with cancer Purpose: The telomere length of somatic cells shortens with age and with other endogenous and exogenous pathogenic factors. However, the effects of radiation therapy on telomere DNA of non-cancer tissue have not been thoroughly investigated. This study analyzed the telomere length of inpatients with cancer treated with radiation therapy to see whether the telomere lengths change in response to therapeutic radiation. Material(s) and Method(s): Twenty-five patients were enrolled in the study. The patients had lung cancer, prostate cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatoma, or rectal cancer. They received radiation therapy with a dose range of 15-74 Gy. The telomere lengths and telomere length distribution in peripheral leukocytes were analyzed by using a Southern blot-based method. Result(s): The telomere length and the telomere length distribution of the peripheral leukocytes did not change after radiation therapy. However, there was a significant proportional decrease in the short telomere fraction (< 4.4 kb) per day and per Gy. Conclusion(s): This observation suggested that the telomere length distribution of peripheral leukocytes could be affected by radiation therapy, and that the effect of radiation tends to appear in cells with short telomeres. Radiation therapy-associated somatic telomere length change within a short range of time, about three months or shorter, can be detected by analyzing the mean telomere length and telomere length distribution. © 2013 Informa UK, Ltd.",Excluded
2099,"Pooled bayesian analysis of twenty-eight studies on radon induced lung cancers The influence of ionizing radiation of Rn and its progeny on lung cancer risks that were published in 28 papers was re-analyzed using seven alternative dose-response models. The risks of incidence and mortality were studied in two ranges of low annual radiation dose: 0-70 mSv per year (391 Bq m) and 0-150 mSv per year (838 Bq m). Assumption-free Bayesian statistical methods were used. The analytical results demonstrate that the published incidence and mortality data do not show that radiation dose is associated with increased risk in this range of doses. This conclusion is based on the observation that the model assuming no dependence of the lung cancer induction on the radiation doses is at least ~90 times more likely to be true than the other models tested, including the linear no-threshold (LNT) model.

An effective therapy in need of a clinical trial Sixty patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the rectum have been treated with preoperative high-dose pelvic irradiation in an attempt to improve operability and increase local control. Fifty-six patients showed no evidence of distant metastases at surgery and their records have been analyzed with respect to recurrence patterns, survival, and complications. The results have been compared with those of a similar analysis of 106 patients treated with curative surgery alone. There was a statistically significant improvement in local control between groups, with 16% of patients in the radiotherapy group having a component of local failure compared with 40% in the surgery group. A dose response was observed, with 67% local control at 4000 rad (4000 cGy) and 91% local control at 5000 rad (5000 cGy). Despite the more advanced clinical stage of the irradiated patients, no significant difference in survival was seen between groups, with a five-year survival rate of 52% in the irradiated patients and 48% in patients treated by surgery alone.

1309,"Intraoperative Gamma Probe Localization of the Ureters: A Novel Concept Background: Ureteral stent placement to localize the ureters during operations is an invasive procedure. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using the gamma probe to intraoperatively identify the ureters after intravenous injection of a radiopharmaceutical agent. Study Design: Ten patients undergoing elective abdominal operations were prospectively enrolled in this study. An average dose of 4.5 mCi (range 2.8 to 5.3 mCi) of technetium Tc 99m-labeled diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (99mTc-DTPA) was administered intravenously before localization of the ureters. The gamma probe was used to localize the ureters. Correct identification of the ureters was confirmed when gentle manipulation induced a typical ureteral peristaltic pattern. Result(s): Gamma counts were significantly elevated in all ureters examined. Compared with background counts, gamma counts were increased over the ureter in all patients, with an average increase of 465%. The technique was modified after use in the first 3 patients and standardized for patients 4 through 10. Data from those seven patients were analyzed. Both ureters were correctly identified using the gamma probe at a mean of 15 minutes (median, 10 minutes) after a single 99mTc-DTPA injection (range 4 to 41 minutes). The mean background count was 80 counts per second (cps, range 50 to 130 cps). The mean ureter count was 393 cps (range 128 to 700 cps). The average percent increase of each ureter count compared with its specific background count was 465% (range 256% to 1,077%). The difference was statistically significant for all values (p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): This novel technique of gamma probe localization of the ureters may offer a noninvasive approach for ureteral identification. © 2007 American College of Surgeons.",Excluded
2374,"Radiation-induced malignancies after intensity-modulated versus conventional mediastinal radiotherapy in a small animal model A long-standing hypothesis in radiotherapy is that intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) increases the risk of second cancer due to low-dose exposure of large volumes of normal tissue. Therefore, young patients are still treated with conventional techniques rather than with modern IMRT. We challenged this hypothesis in first-of-its-kind experiments using an animal model. Cancer-prone Tp53+/C273X knockout rats received mediastinal irradiation with 3x5 or 3x8Gy using volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT, an advanced IMRT) or conventional anterior-posterior/posterior-anterior (AP/PA) beams using non-irradiated rats as controls (n=15/group, ntotal=90). Tumors were assigned to volumes receiving 90-107%, 50-90%, 5-50%, and <5% of the target dose and characterized by histology and loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH). Irradiated rats predominantly developed lymphomas and sarcomas in areas receiving 50-107% (n=26) rather than 5-50% (n=7) of the target dose. Latency was significantly shortened only after 3x8Gy vs. controls (p<0.0001). The frequency (14/28 vs. 19/29; p=0.29) and latency (218 vs. 189 days; p=0.17) of radiation-associated tumors were similar after VMAT vs. AP/PA. LOH was strongly associated with sarcoma but not with treatment. The results do not support the hypothesis that IMRT increases the risk of second cancer. Thus the current practice of withholding dose-sparing IMRT from young patients may need to be re-evaluated.",Included

2240,"A novel ultrafast-low-dose computed tomography protocol allows concomitant coronary artery evaluation and lung cancer screening Background: Cardiac computed tomography (CT) is often performed in patients who are at high risk for lung cancer in whom screening is currently recommended. We tested diagnostic ability and radiation exposure of a novel ultra-low-dose CT protocol that allows concomitant coronary artery evaluation and lung screening. Method(s): We studied 30 current or former heavy smoker subjects with suspected or known coronary artery disease who underwent CT assessment of both coronary arteries and thoracic area (Revolution CT, General Electric). A new ultrafast-low-dose single protocol was used for ECG-gated helical acquisition of the heart and the whole chest. A single IV iodine bolus (70-90 ml) was used. All patients with CT evidence of coronary stenosis underwent also invasive coronary angiography. Result(s): All the coronary segments were assessable in 28/30 (93%) patients. Only 8 coronary segments were not assessable in 2 patients due to motion artefacts (assessability: 98%; 477/485 segments). In the assessable segments, 20/21 significant stenoses (> 70% reduction of vessel diameter) were correctly diagnosed. Pulmonary nodules were detected in 5 patients, thus requiring to schedule follow-up surveillance CT thorax. Effective dose was 1.3 +/- 0.9 mSv (range: 0.8-3.2 mSv). Noteworthy, no contrast or radiation dose increment was required with the new protocol as compared to conventional coronary CT protocol.

1367,"Neoadjuvant proton beam irradiation vs. adjuvant ruthenium brachytherapy in transscleral resection of uveal melanoma Background: Uveal melanoma is the most common primary ocular malignancy in adults in the USA and Europe. The optimal treatment of large uveal melanoma is still under debate. Radiation therapy has its limitation due its eye-threatening secondary complications and is therefore often combined with surgical excision of the tumor. Method(s): In a retrospective interventional review, we evaluated in total 242 patients with uveal melanoma that underwent transscleral tumor resection with a predefined protocol, either with adjuvant ruthenium brachytherapy (Ru-106 group, n 136,), or with neoadjuvant proton beam therapy (PBT group, n 106). Kaplan-Meier estimates with log-rank test were used to show survival curves and a multivariable Cox regression model was used to calculate adjusted rate ratios. Result(s): Local tumor recurrence rates after 3 and 5 years were 4% (95% CI 1.2-17.8%) and 9.1% (95% CI 2.9-27.3%), respectively, in the PBT group and 24.6% (95% CI 15.8-37.1%) and 27.5 (95% CI 17.8-41.1%), respectively, in the Ru-106 group. This leads to an overall recurrence rate almost 4 times higher in the Ru-106 group compared to the PBT group. After adjusting for the a priori confounders and the tumor distance to optic disc and ciliary body infiltration, the adjusted risk of tumor recurrence was 8 times (RR 7.69 (2.22-26.06), p < 0.001) higher in the Ru-106 group as compared to the PBT group. Three- and 5-year metastatic rates were 23.2% (95% CI 5.6-37.1%) and 31.8% (95% CI 20.7-46.8%), respectively, in the PBT group and 13.2% (95% CI 6.8-24.9%) and 30.3% (95% CI 18.3-47.5%), respectively, in the Ru-106 group. There was no statistically significant difference in the overall metastasis rate between the two groups even after adjusting for possible confounders. Conclusion(s): Transscleral resection of large uveal melanomas combined with neoadjuvant proton beam therapy leads to a lower local tumor recurrence rate compared to transscleral tumor resection with adjuvant ruthenium brachytherapy. There was no statistically significant difference in the occurrence of rubeosis iridis, neovascular glaucoma, and in the need for enucleation later on.Copyright © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded

1963,"Optimisation of imaging technique used in direct digital radiography The purpose of the study was to optimise the technique employed for AP shoulder and lateral cervical spine examinations following an investigation into image quality, based on clinical assessment, and effective dose, calculated from patient entrance surface dose measurements. A study was therefore conducted in an attempt to determine whether the increased radiation dose to the patient following the introduction of an anti-scatter grid was justified by the level of improvement in image quality. The study, involving 100 patients, was able to demonstrate that the increase in radiation dose to the patient when using an anti-scatter grid for AP shoulder examinations is not justified by the improved image quality. A poor level of inter-rater reliability between the consultants scoring the lateral cervical spine images prevented a firm conclusion from being reached. The fact that all images were of diagnostic quality, however, suggested that the use of the anti-scatter grid was unnecessary.

Doselimiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as grade 3 or worse gastrointestinal/ genitourinary toxicity by Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events (version 4). Postoperative complications were graded according to the modified Clavien classifications, respectively. Results A total of 6 patients (4 men and 2 women) were treated on protocol. After 7-14 days, 3 patients underwent open radical nephrectomy and inferior vena cava thrombectomy and 3 patients underwent pure laparoscopic surgery. All 6 patients tolerated SABR well without possibly treatment-related acute toxicities. The average surgery time was (383.3 +/-88.7) min. The average blood loss volume was (1475.0 +/- 1515.8) mL. 2 cases underwent inferior vena cava wall resection because of tumor invasion. The average postoperative hospitalization of was (5.8 +/-1.2) d. Early postoperative complications occurred in 4 case of Clavien I according to modified Clavien classifications. Median (range) follow-up was 8 months (1-22 months). There was no postoperative recurrence or tumor specific death. Conclusion Our initial clinical results show that dose of 30 Gy in 6 fraction has been achieved successfully without treatment-related acute toxicities. preoperative SABR combined with surgical treatment was relatively safe.",Excluded
2024,"New recommendation and coverage of low-dose computed tomography for lung cancer screening: uptake has increased but is still low BACKGROUND: In 2013, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) issued recommendations for low-dose computed tomography for lung cancer screening (LDCT-LCS), but there continues to be a dearth of information on the adoption of LDCT-LCS in healthcare systems. Using a multilevel perspective, our study aims to assess referrals for LDCT-LCS and identify facilitators and barriers to adoption following recent policy changes. METHOD(S): A retrospective analysis of electronic medical record data from patients aged 55-80 years with no history of lung cancer who visited a primary care provider in a large healthcare system in California during 2010-2016 (1,572,538 patient years). Trends in documentation of smoking history, number of eligible patients, and lung cancer screening orders were assessed. Using Hierarchical Generalized Linear Models, we also evaluated provider-level and patient-level factors associated with lung cancer screening orders among 970 primary care providers and 12,801 eligible patients according to USPSTF guidelines between January 1st, 2014 and December 31st, 2016. RESULT(S): Documentation of smoking history to determine eligibility (59.2% in 2010 to 77.8% in 2016) and LDCT-LCS orders (0% in 2010 to 7.3% in 2016) have increased since USPSTF guidelines. Patient factors associated with increased likelihood of lung cancer screening orders include: younger patient age (78-80 vs. 55-64 years old: OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.3-0.7), Asian race (vs. Non-Hispanic White: OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.4), reported current smoking (vs. former smoker: OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.4-2.0), no severe comorbidity (severe vs. no major comorbidity: OR=0.2, 95% CI=0.1-0.3; moderate vs. no major comorbidity: OR=0.5; 95% CI=0.4-0.7), and making a visit to own primary care provider (vs. other primary care providers: OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.7-3.4). Appropriate referral for lung cancer screening varies considerably across primary care providers. Provider factors include being a female physician (vs. male: OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.3) and receiving medical training in the US (foreign vs. US medical school graduates: OR=0.4, 95% CI=0.3-0.7). CONCLUSION(S): Future interventions to improve lung cancer screening may be more effective if they focus on accurate documentation of smoking history and target former smokers who do not regularly see their own primary care providers.",Excluded
2396,"Cortical Bone Trajectory Screws in Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion: Minimally Invasive Surgery for Maximal Muscle Sparing - A Prospective Comparative Study with the Traditional Open Technique Introduction. A prospective comparative study between classical posterior interbody fusion with peduncular screws and the new technique with divergent cortical screws was conducted. Material and Methods. Only patients with monosegmental degenerative disease were recruited into this study. We analyzed a cohort of 40 patients treated from January 2015 to March 2016 divided into 2 groups (20 patients went to traditional open surgery and 20 patients under mini-invasive strategy). Primary endpoints of this study are fusion rate and muscular damage; secondary endpoints analyzed were three different clinical scores (ODI, VAS, and EQ) and the morbidity rate of both techniques. Results. There was no significant difference in fusion rate between the two techniques. In addition, a significant difference in muscular damage was found according to the MRI evaluation. Clinical outcomes, based on pain intensity, Oswestry Disability Index status, and Euroquality-5D score, were found to be also statistically different, even one year after surgery. This study also demonstrated a correlation between patients' muscular damage and their clinical outcome. Conclusions. Cortical bone trajectory screws would provide similar outcomes compared to pedicle screws in posterior lumbar interbody fusion at one year after surgery, and this technique represents a reasonable alternative to pedicle screws.Copyright © 2018 Nicola Marengo et al.",Excluded
2226,"Randomized phase II trial of non-platinum induction or consolidation chemotherapy plus concomitant chemoradiation in stage III NSCLC patients: Mature results of the Spanish Lung Cancer Group 0008 study The optimal schedule and regimen of chemotherapy (CT) in association with chemoradiation has not been established in stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We have compared three schedules of non-platinum-based CT plus either radiotherapy or chemoradiation. From May 2001 to June 2006, 158 patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC were enrolled in a randomized phase II trial with overall response rate (ORR) as the primary endpoint. The initial design included three arms: sequential CT followed by thoracic radiation (TRT); concurrent CT/TRT followed by consolidation CT; and induction CT followed by concurrent CT/TRT. However, based on the preliminary results of the RTOG 9410 trial, the sequential arm was closed when 19 patients had been enrolled. All patients received two cycles of docetaxel 40mg/m2 days 1 and 8 plus gemcitabine 1200mg/m2 days 1 and 8, as either induction or consolidation therapy. Concurrent CT/TRT consisted of docetaxel 20mg/m2 and carboplatin AUC 2 weekly plus 60Gy TRT. No differences were found in ORR between the two arms (56% and 57%). Hematological toxicity was mild but significantly superior with consolidation CT; the esophagitis rate was similar in both arms (16% and 15%). With a median follow-up of 57 months, no differences were found in median survival (13.07 and 13.8 months) or 5-year survival (16.4% and 22%). This regimen cannot be recommended as an alternative to platinum-based CT/TRT although it has an acceptable toxicity profile and encouraging long-term survival data (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01652820). © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Excluded
1939,"Mixed effect modelling of dose and Linear Energy Transfer correlations with brain image changes after intensity modulated proton therapy for skull base head and neck cancer PURPOSE: Intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) could yield high Linear Energy Transfer (LET) in critical structures and increased biological effect. For head and neck cancers at the skull base this could potentially result in radiation associated brain image change (RAIC). The purpose of the current study was to investigate voxel-wise dose and LET correlations with RAIC after IMPT. MATERIAL AND METHODS: For 15 patients with RAIC after IMPT, contrast enhancement observed on T1 weighted MRIs were contoured and co-registered to the planning CT. Monte Carlo calculated dose- and dose averaged LET (LETd) distributions were extracted at voxel level and associations with RAIC were modelled using uni- and multivariate mixed effect logistic regression. Model performance was evaluated using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) and Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC). RESULT(S): An overall statistically significant RAIC association with dose and LETd was found in both the uni- and multivariate analysis. Patient heterogeneity were considerable with SD of the random effects of 1.81 (1.30 - 2.72) for dose and 2.68 (1.93 - 4.93) for LETd, respectively. AUROC was 0.93 and 0.95 for the univariate dose-response model and multivariate model, respectively. Analysis of the LETd effect demonstrated increased risk of RAIC with increasing LETd for the majority of patients. Estimated probability of RAIC with LETd=1 keV/microm was 4% (95% CI: 0%, 0.44%) and 29% (95% CI: 0.01, 0.92%) for 60 Gy and 70 Gy, respectively. The TD15 were estimated to be 63.6 Gy and 50.1 Gy with LETd equal to 2 keV/microm and 5 keV/microm, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): Our results suggest that the LETd effect could be of clinical significance for some patients; LETd assessment in clinical treatment plans should therefore be taken into consideration.Copyright © 2021.

2052,"Resource use in intensive care unit: A cost analysis in surgical intensive care medicine Background: Since 2004 surgical procedures done in German hospitals have been paid for by a flat-rate reimbursement scheme based on diagnosis-related groups (DRGs). The aim of the present detailed cost analysis study was to identify the major factors that determine the costs of intensive care medicine. Method(s): In a patient-based investigation lasting 6 months, 104 patients (mean age 64.6 years) on an interdisciplinary surgical intensive care unit were analyzed over 309 hospital occupancy days. Demographic data, drugs administered, infusions, nutrition, blood and coagulation products, invasive measures and monitoring, artificial respiration parameters, other measures and diagnostic services (laboratory, microbiology, x-ray, etc.), as well as four intensive scores (SAPS II, APACHE II, SOFA, TISS 28) were recorded daily. Result(s): The overall cost of 309 occupancy days (n=104) amounted to 457,564.11 euros, the average cost per day being 1,480.78 euros, and the mean case-specific cost 4,747.48 euros. 49 % of the overall cost was generated by medical staff, with medication and material each accounting for 18 %. Of the personnel costs, 70 % were caused by the nursing staff, 22 % by the medical staff and 8 % by cleaning and other personnel. During the course of hospitalisation, an non-significant increase in the costs generated by personnel was observed. A linear correlation was found between cumulated TISS 28 and the mean case costs. While there was no significant relationship between patient-specific score levels and individual case cost, the correlation between length of stay (LOS) and case cost was highly significant. Conclusion(s): The determining factor in the cost calculation of intensive care medicine are personnel costs. Overall cost is determined largely by the LOS, with such additional factors as age, diagnosis, comorbidity, etc. playing only an insignificant role. © Anasth Intensivmed 2010.",Excluded

1731,"Targeted use of endoscopic CO2 laser cricopharyngeal myotomy for improving swallowing function following head and neck cancer treatment BACKGROUND: Cricopharyngeal dysfunction following head and neck cancer treatment may lead to a significant reduction in oral intake. Carbon dioxide laser is an established procedure for the treatment of non-malignant cricopharyngeal disorders. We report our experience of laser cricopharyngeal myotomy with objective swallowing outcome measures, before and after treatment., METHODS: We identified 11 patients who had undergone carbon dioxide laser cricopharyngeal myotomy for dysphagia following radiotherapy, with or without chemotheraphy between January 2006 and July 2011. We analysed the swallowing outcomes following carbon dioxide laser cricopharyngeal myotomy by retrospective grading of pre- and post-procedure videofluoroscopic swallowing study of liquids, using the validated Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Profile., RESULTS: The median Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Profile score was 13 pre-myotomy and 10 post-myotomy. This difference between scores was non-significant (p = 0.41). The median, cricopharyngeal-specific Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Profile variables (14 and 17) improved from 3 to 2, but were similarly non-significant (p = 0.16). We observed the improved Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Profile scores post-procedure in the majority of patients., CONCLUSION: Endoscopic carbon dioxide laser cricopharyngeal myotomy remains a viable option in treatment-related cricopharyngeal dysfunction; its targeted role requires further prospective study. Objective analysis of the technique can be reported using the validated Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Profile.",Excluded
1275,"Visualization of subsurface structures in cells and tissues by backscattered electron imaging A fraction of the beam electrons which interact with a specimen scatter back. The number of backscattered electrons (BE's) increases with the atomic number of the elements encountered. Cell and tissue structures lacking a heavy metal content yield few BE's compared to structures affixed with heavy metals, either vitally or by means of staining methods applied after fixation. The BE imaging mode of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) provides an intensity map of the BE yield from the specimen. BE imaging of selectively stained structures in cells and tissues renders these structures visible in contrast to the unstained surround. Since BE's can emerge from a significant depth within the material, BE imaging can be used to view such heavy metal stained structures beneath intact cell surfaces. The microcontours of the overlying surface can be viewed concurrently by using the surface scanning (i.e., the secondary electron imaging; SEI) mode of the microscope. Methods for selectively contrasting subsurface structures can be adapted from existing light microscope (LM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) methods. Staining methods have been devised for subsurface viewing of cell organelles, including nuclei, mitochondria, peroxisomes, lysosomes, and phagosomes. A physical model is presented which describes these observations and suggests future possible trends in this subject. Specifically the image contrast and resolution are described in terms of the physical properties of the stain and specimen and of the SEM operating conditions of energy and current. Finally a summary of instrumentation considerations describes present and potential BE detectors, their ancillary electronics, and image processing.",Excluded
1980,"Diagnostic medical imaging radiation exposure and risk of development of solid and hematologic malignancy Limiting patients' exposure to ionizing radiation during diagnostic imaging is of concern to patients and clinicians. Large single-dose exposures and cumulative exposures to ionizing radiation have been associated with solid tumors and hematologic malignancy. Although these associations have been a driving force in minimizing patients' exposure, significant risks are found when diagnoses are missed and subsequent treatment is withheld. Therefore, based on epidemiologic data obtained after nuclear and occupational exposures, dose exposure limits have been estimated. A recent collaborative effort between the US Food and Drug Administration and the American College of Radiology has provided information and tools that patients and imaging professionals can use to avoid unnecessary ionizing radiation scans and ensure use of the lowest feasible radiation dose necessary for studies. Further collaboration, research, and development should focus on producing technological advances that minimize individual study exposures and duplicate studies. This article outlines the research used to govern safe radiation doses, defines recent initiatives in decreasing radiation exposure, and provides orthopedic surgeons with techniques that may help decrease radiation exposure in their daily practice.

These patients are often referred to Interventional Radiology for alternative percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement options. Purpose: To report our experience with CT fluoroscopy-guided percutaneous gastrostomy with a novel loop gastropexy and peel-away sheath trocar technique in ALS patients as an alternative to endoscopic techniques. Material and Methods: A consecutive series of 31 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients in whom endoscopic gastrostomy was considered too dangerous or impossible to perform underwent CT-guided percutaneous gastropexy and gastrostomy and prospective follow-up. All procedures were performed with a 15 FR Frekaw Pexact gastrostomy kit, a 16-row CT scanner (Aquilion 16) and single shot CT fluoroscopy mode. Results: The procedure was performed successfully in 30 of 31 patients (20 men, 11 women; median age 60 years, range 38-80 years). In the remaining case the stomach was punctured under CT fluoroscopy and CO2 insufflation was initiated thereafter, leading to successful gastrostomy without prior gastropexy and without further adverse events during follow-up. Two patients reported unproblematic exchange of a balloon tube due to skin irritations with no further adverse events. One patient reported accidental displacement of an exchanged new balloon tube in domestic environment due to balloon leakage: A new balloon tube was easily re-inserted in a hospital the same day. No serious adverse events such as peritonitis, persistent local bleeding, systemic blood loss, or any local infection requiring surgical intervention were observed. Until August 11, 2011 follow-up resulted in 7473 cumulative gastrostomy-days from the date of first placement. Conclusion: Initial results suggest that the described technique under CT guidance is feasible and safe and may especially be advantageous in cases where endoscopic gastrostomy and sedation are contraindicated.",Excluded

We aimed to access the impact of CT protocol optimization and technological evolution on the contrast and radiation dose as well as on image quality previous to atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation., METHODS: From a prospective registry of consecutive patients who underwent cardiac CT in a single center, we selected 270 patients in whom the CT was done for evaluation prior to AF ablation and they were distributed in 3 groups: Group1: the first 150 patients included; Group2: the last 60 patients performed with the same CT scanner; Group3: the first 60 exams performed with the new CT scanner. Quality of the protocol was access based on radiation dose, contrast volume used, the use of a second (delayed) acquisition, and on quantitative image quality analisis (signal to noise and contrast to noise ratios; density homogeneity racio between LA and LAA)., RESULTS: We found a significant radiation dose as well as contrast dose reduction between the first and last subgroups (G1: 5,6mSv and 100ml; G2: 1,3mSv and 90ml; G3: 0,6mSv and 65ml). Even though group 3 had less radiation and contrast used it still had better quantitative image quality (signal/noise of 13,5; contrast/noise 14,8; density homogeneity racio of 0,92)., CONCLUSION: Protocol optimization and technology both contributed to significant lower radiation dose and contrast volume used on cardiac CTs prior to AF ablation, without compromising image quality.

The aim of this study was to assess the long-term outcome and toxicity of treatment with 11.1 GBq (300 mCi) of (131)I-MIBG per cycle., METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 31 patients with advanced metastatic neuroendocrine tumors (20 with carcinoid tumors and 11 with other tumors) treated with (131)I-MIBG. Treatment outcome was analyzed for patients with carcinoid tumors (the most common tumors in this study), and toxicity was analyzed for the entire patient cohort (n = 31). Treatment comprised 11.1 GBq (300 mCi) per course and minimum intervals of 3 mo. The radiographic response was classified according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Toxicity was determined according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0) for all laboratory data at regular follow-up visits and during outpatient care, including complete blood counts and hepatic and renal function tests. Survival analysis was performed with the Kaplan-Meier curve method (log rank test; P < 0.05)., RESULTS: The radiographic responses in patients with carcinoid tumors comprised a minor response in 2 patients (10%), stable disease in 16 patients (80%; median time to progression, 34 mo), and progressive disease in 2 patients (10%). The symptomatic responses in patients with functioning carcinoid tumors comprised complete resolution in 3 of the 11 evaluable symptomatic patients (27%), partial resolution in 6 patients (55%), and no significant change in 11 patients. The median overall survival in patients with carcinoid tumors was 47 mo (95% confidence interval, 32-62), and the median progression-free survival was 34 mo (95% confidence interval, 13-55). Relevant treatment toxicities were confined to transient myelosuppression of grade 3 or 4 in 15.3% (leukopenia) and 7.6% (thrombocytopenia) of applied cycles and a suspected late adverse event (3% of patients), myelodysplastic syndrome, after a cumulative administered activity of 66.6 GBq. The most frequent nonhematologic side effect was mild nausea (grade 1 or 2), which was observed in 28% of administered cycles. No hepatic or renal toxicities were noted., CONCLUSION: Dose-intensified treatment with (131)I-MIBG at a fixed dose of 11.1 GBq (300 mCi) per cycle is safe and offers effective palliation of symptoms and disease stabilization in patients with advanced carcinoid tumors. The favorable survival and limited toxicity suggest that high cycle activities are suitable and that this modality may be used for targeted carcinoid treatment--either as an alternative or as an adjunct to other existing therapeutic options.",Excluded
1794,"Anatomy versus physiology-guided ablation for persistent atrial fibrillation Background: Pulmonary vein isolation remains the cornerstone of atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation. However, due to high recurrence rates, especially in patients with persistent AF, PV antral isolation, complemented by linear ablation, autonomic modulation, and ablation of complex fractionated electrograms, have been attempted to increase the odds of success. However, the optimum approach for a complementary strategy in addition to PVI for persistent AF is unknown. Method(s): We performed a prospective randomized trial by assigning 92 patients with persistent AF in 1:1 ratio to pulmonary-vein isolation plus ablation of electrograms showing complex fractionated activity (45 patients), or pulmonary-vein isolation plus additional linear ablation across the left atrial roof and mitral valve isthmus (47 patients). The duration of follow-up was five years. The primary endpoint was freedom from any documented recurrence of atrial fibrillation after a single ablation procedure. Result(s): At a 12-month follow-up, 9 (23%) patients had AF recurrence in the linear ablation and 8 (21%) patients in the CFAE groups. At a mean follow-up duration of 59+/-36 months, 48.3% of patients in the linear ablation group and 44.6% of patients in the CFAE group were free from AF (p=0.403). There were no significant differences between the two groups for independent predictors of freedom from AF. The overall procedure time and radiation exposure were higher in the PVI+linear ablation group. There were five adverse events noted, two in the linear group (pericardial effusion not requiring drain) and 3 in the CFAE group (1 pseudoaneurysm, one effusion requiring pericardiocentesis and one effusion nor requiring drain). Conclusion(s): Among patients with persistent atrial fibrillation, we found no difference in maintenance of sinus rhythm in either linear ablation or ablation of complex fractionated electrograms was performed in addition to pulmonary vein isolation in short- and long-term follow-up.Copyright © 2020 CardioFront LLC.

1540,"Idiopathic pulmonary artery aneurysm: A case report of a rare disease INTRODUCTION: Pulmonary artery aneurysm (PAA) is defined as dilation of the proximal pulmonary artery or one of its branches. It is difficult to diagnose and often is an autopsy finding. It is classified as central, which arises from the main pulmonary artery, or peripheral, which arises from segmental or sub-segmental arteries. Pulmonary hypertension is an important risk factor for development and rupture of PAA. We present a case of idiopathic PAA which has remained stable for past 10 years. CASE PRESENTATION: A 32 year old male with a history of PAA presented to the ER with complaints of atypical chest pain. Physical exam findings and laboratory studies were unremarkable. Contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest revealed aneurysmal dilation of the right pulmonary artery with a clot in it. This was compared to multiple previous CT scans and did not show any changes. Review of past records revealed that 10 years ago, the patient was admitted for similar complaints, found to have a right hilar mass on X-ray and chest CT suspicious for neoplasm. Thoracotomy was done for biopsy and patient was found to have a 4x3 cm right PAA. Echocardiography showed normal pulmonary artery pressure. On this visit VQ scan was done which was negative for pulmonary embolism. Patient was discharged after 2 days with outpatient follow-up. DISCUSSION: PAA is a rare condition with an incidence of 1 in 14,000 autopsies. Unlike aortic aneurysm it has equal prevalence in both genders and occurs in younger patients. The likely pathology seems to be increased hemodynamic stresses combined with underlying vessel wall weakness. It is commonly associated with congenital heart defects (shunts, PDA or VSD), pulmonary artery hypertension and connective tissue disorders such as Marfan's syndrome and infections like syphilis and TB. It typically presents with hemoptysis, chest pain, cough and/or dyspnea but is also not infrequently discovered as an incidental finding. The advent of contrast-enhanced CT, MRI and echocardiograms have assumed a primary role in diagnosis. Complications may include pulmonary hypertension, thrombus formation, bronchial compression or aneurysmal rupture. Management is surgical coupled with treatment of the underlying disorders. CONCLUSION(S): Controversy still exists regarding indications for surgical management, with some pursuing conservative approach while others in favor of surgical intervention even in asymptomatic patients. One third of the patients die from rupture of the aneurysm emphasizing the need for follow up and prompt intervention if it enlarges or become symptomatic. Therefore, close follow-up is required.",Excluded
2356,"Prediction of restenosis based on hemodynamical markers in revascularized femoro-popliteal arteries during leg flexion Endovascular therapy in patients suffering from peripheral arterial disease shows high rates of restenosis. The poor clinical outcomes are commonly explained by the demanding mechanical environment due to leg movements, but the mechanisms responsible for restenosis remain unknown. In this study, we hypothesized that restenosis following revascularization is associated with hemodynamical markers derived from blood flow during leg flexion. Therefore, we performed personalized computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses of 20 patients, who underwent routine endovascular femoro-popliteal interventions. The CFD analyses were conducted using 3D models of the arterial geometry in straight and flexed positions, which were reconstructed from 2D angiographic images. Based on restenosis rates reported at 6-month follow-up, logistic regression analyses were performed to predict restenosis from hemodynamical parameters. Results showed that severe arterial deformations, such as kinking, induced by leg flexion in stented arteries led to adverse hemodynamic conditions that may trigger restenosis. A logistic regression analysis based solely on hemodynamical markers had an accuracy of 75%, which showed that flow parameters are sufficient to predict restenosis (p = 0.031). However, better predictions were achieved by adding the treatment method in the model. This suggests that a more accurate image acquisition technique is required to capture the localized modifications of blood flow following intervention, especially around the stented artery. This approach, based on the immediate postoperative configuration of the artery, has the potential to identify patients at increased risk of restenosis. Based on this information, clinicians could take preventive measures and more closely follow these patients to avoid complications.Copyright © 2019, The Author(s).",Excluded
1764,"Evaluation and definitive management of medically inoperable early stage non-small-cell lung cancer. Part 2: newer treatment modalities Lung cancer is estimated to be the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in both men and women in 2006, and the leading causes of cancer mortality. Non-small-cell lung cancer represents the majority of such cases. Most of these patients have locally advanced disease at presentation and are not eligible for curative resection. For the minority of patients who are technically resectable at presentation, lobectomy or pneumonectomy and pathologic mediastinal nodal staging offer the best overall survival. The high rate of comorbid medical illness and poor baseline pulmonary function in this population, however, make many such early-stage patients medically inoperable. For these patients, conventional single-modality radiotherapy has been the primary definitive treatment option, as discussed in part 1 of this article, which appeared in last month's issue. Numerous retrospective reports demonstrate long-term disease-free and overall survival data that are modestly superior to that expected after observation, but both local and distant failure continue to be significant risks. Investigation of radiotherapy dose escalation is ongoing, in an effort to improve local control while maintaining minimal toxicity. Additionally, emerging evidence suggests that new modalities, such as stereotactic radiosurgery and radiofrequency ablation, may also be potentially curative treatment alternatives.

1619,"Radiation-induced hypoglossal nerve palsy after definitive radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma: Clinical predictors and dose-toxicity relationship BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Radiation-induced hypoglossal nerve palsy is a debilitating and irreversible late complication after definitive radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and other skull base tumors. This study sets to evaluate its incidence and clinical predictive factors, and to propose relevant dosimetric constraints for this structure to guide radiotherapy planning., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We undertook a retrospective review of 797 NPC patients who underwent definitive intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) between 2003 and 2011. Cumulative incidence and clinical predictors for radiation-induced hypoglossal nerve palsy were evaluated. Archived radiotherapy plans were retrieved and 330 independent hypoglossal nerves were retrospectively contoured following standardized atlas. Optimal threshold analyses of dosimetric parameters (Dmax, D0.5cc, D1cc, D2cc, Dmean) were conducted using receiver operating characteristic curves. Normal tissue complication probability was generated with logistic regression modeling., RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 8.1years, sixty-nine (8.7%) patients developed radiation-induced hypoglossal nerve palsy. High radiotherapy dose, premorbid diabetes, advanced T-stage and radiological hypoglossal canal involvement were independent clinical risk factors. Maximum dose received by 1cc volume (D1cc) was the best predictor for the development of radiation-induced nerve palsy (AUC=0.826) at 8years after IMRT. Hypoglossal nerves with D1cc of 74Gy EQD2 had an estimated palsy risk of 4.7%. Nerves with D1cc <74Gy EQD2 had significantly lower risk of palsy than those >=74Gy EQD2 (2.4% vs 20.8%, p <0.001)., CONCLUSION: Incidence of radiation-induced hypoglossal nerve palsy was high after definitive IMRT for NPC. D1cc <74Gy EQD2 can serve as a useful dose constraint to adopt during radiotherapy planning to limit palsy risk to <5% at 8years after IMRT. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

2025,"Swimming kinematics and respiratory behaviour of Xenopus laevis larvae raised in altered gravity We examined the respiratory behaviours and swimming kinematics of Xenopus laevis tadpoles hatched in microgravity (Space Shuttle), simulated microgravity (clinostat) and hypergravity (3 g centrifuge). All observations were made in the normal 1 g environment. Previous research has shown that X. laevis raised in microgravity exhibit abnormalities in their lungs and vestibular system upon return to 1 g. The tadpoles raised in true microgravity exhibited a significantly lower tailbeat frequency than onboard 1 g centrifuge controls on the day of landing (day0), but this behaviour normalized within 9 days. The two groups did not differ significantly in buccal pumping rates. Altered buoyancy in the space-flight microgravity tadpoles was indicated by an increased swimming angle on the day after landing (day1). Tadpoles raised in simulated microgravity differed to a greater extent in swimming behaviours from their 1 g controls. The tadpoles raised in hypergravity showed no substantive effects on the development of swimming or respiratory behaviours, except swimming angle. Together, these results show that microgravity has a transient effect on the development of locomotion in X. laevis tadpoles, most notably on swimming angle, indicative of stunted lung development. On the basis of the behaviours we studied, there is no indication of neuromuscular retardation in amphibians associated with embryogenesis in microgravity.",Excluded

We retrospectively identified 28 patients with stage I-II PMBCL in our lymphoma database, re-reviewed pathology slides and scored interim or post-chemotherapy PET/CTs using the Deauville scale. Fourteen patients received RT (36-45 Gy) preceded by either six cycles of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) or 12 weeks of rituximab, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone and bleomycin (R-VACOP-B) with median follow-up of 94 months. Fourteen patients received 4-8 cycles of dose-adjusted etoposide, vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (DA-EPOCH-R) with median follow-up of 38 months; one of these received RT (36 Gy) due to post-chemotherapy PET/CT Deauville score 4.

Limited recovery of T-cell responses from mouse bone marrow in tissue culture The limited differentiation of mature T cell function from mouse bone marrow in tissue culture is described and compared with similar differentiation occuring in vivo in irradiated bone marrow protected mice. Data are presented to show that a pool of precursors, similar in size to that able to produce early (transient?) regeneration in thymectomized recipients, is responsible for the development of mitogen responsive T cells active in MLC (proliferation) and CML (development of cytotoxic cells) assays. In contrast, a helper cell population which augments antibody formation from T-depleted normal spleen cells derives from a pool of similar precursors yet does not seem to be theta positive. Similarly, larger cells (perhaps typical of those giving rise to suppressor T cells in vivo) give rise to a suppressor cell pool after 4 days of culture, though again only a fraction of this suppressor activity could be attributed to theta positive cells. It is suggested that much of the data for regenration of T lymphocytes in vitro from T-depleted sources needs to be re-interpreted in terms of this evidence for a pool of post-thymic precursors of T cells in such T-deficient cell populations.",Excluded

A finite element analysis of simulated eccentric forces using bone density data derived from CT Background and purpose: Radiotherapy is known to produce long-term skeletal complications. We aim to evaluate the biomechanical effect on femoral neck bone from hypothetical eccentric loads on pre- and post-radiotherapy CT-images for patients treated for rectal cancer. Material(s) and Method(s): Pre- and post-radiotherapy CT-images of rectal cancer from 10 patients were selected randomly. The cortical and trabecular bone was segmented by hand. The biomechanical simulations of 4 eccentric loads and one load aligned with the femoral neck axis were completed using finite element analysis (FEA) in both pre- and post-patient models. Result(s): A comparative statistical study was completed of pre- and post-radiotherapy patient models of stress and displacement factors. Significant differences were found in eccentric loads in both factors. Natural load has a significant difference in stress, but no differences were found for displacements. The absolute difference in eccentric load applied to the anterior area location on the same patient implies from 5.3% to 40.5% of the stress yield values reported in previous studies. Conclusion(s): Loads applied to the anterior area of the femoral head must be considered in fracture simulations because the percentage of yield stress of pre- and post-irradiated bones shows a significant biomechanical change.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2: Discuss the management of Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. CASE: In 2019, an 87-year-old Caucasian male with a history of chronic back pain presented to his primary care doctor's office with a chief complaint of low back pain. In 2004, an X-ray of the lumbosacral spine revealed mild lumbar spondylosis. His back pain began after bending over to pick up his wife. He denied recent trauma, fevers, chills, intravenous drug use, unexplained weight loss, history of malignancy, saddle anesthesia, bowel or bladder incontinence or progressive weakness. He was referred to pain medicine for consideration of steroid injection. MRI lumbar spine was ordered which showed a pathologic compression fracture of L4 with abnormal bone marrow involvement of the left iliac wing. MRI cervical, thoracic spine and CT chest, abdomen and pelvis were ordered to work up malignancy. CT was without metastatic disease. Repeat MRI showed diffuse heterogeneous bone marrow signal concerning for an infiltrating process. The patient was referred to oncology clinic. His father passed away from lymphoma. Physical exam revealed a well appearing male without adenopathy or midline spinal tenderness. Labs showed WBC 7.2, Hb 15.1, platelet count 250, monocytes elevated to 1.0. IgM was elevated to 1,694 while IgG and IgA levels were decreased. 24-hour urine protein collection was negative. Bone marrow biopsy showed CD5 negative/CD10 negative B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder involving approximately 35% of the marrow cellularity. The differential included marrow involvement by a B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma such as lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (favored by the presence of IgM monoclonal gammopathy) and marginal zone lymphoma. The MYD88 L265P mutation was negative. IMPACT/DISCUSSION: Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia is a rare clinicopathologic entity demonstrating bone marrow infiltration by lymphoplasmacytic cells and a serum IgM gammopathy. Elderly, white males are more commonly affected with an annual incidence of 3-4 persons per million. Symptoms are due to the infiltration of lymphoplasmacytic cells in the bone marrow and IgM gammopathy of the blood. Milder symptoms can be secondary to anemia and organomegaly, while more severe symptoms can be due to CNS involvement and hyperviscosity syndrome. Diagnosis is made by monoclonal IgM gammopathy and a bone marrow biopsy demonstrating greater than 10% infiltration by small lymphocytes with a typical immunophenotype. The differential diagnosis includes IgM MGUS, CLL, marginal zone lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma. Asymptomatic patients are managed by observation alone while symptomatic patients are treated with chemotherapy. CONCLUSION(S): * Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia is a rare clinicopathologic entity demonstrating bone marrow infiltration by lymphoplasmacytic cells and a serum IgM gammopathy. * Asymptomatic patients can be managed by observation alone while symptomatic patients are treated with chemotherapy.",Excluded
1694,"Trend dynamics of thyroid cancer incidence among China and the U.S. adult population from 1990 to 2017: a joinpoint and age-period-cohort analysis BACKGROUND: Thyroid cancer (TC) is the most common malignant disease of the endocrine system. Based on the previously published reports, the incidence of TC has been increasing in the past 25 years, and the reason for the increase is not yet clear. The present study aims to reveal the long-term trends and age-period-cohort effects for the incidence of TC in China and the U.S. from 1990 to 2017., METHODS: We examined the trends of TC incidence and the average annual percentage change (AAPC) of rate using the Joinpoint regression analysis in the two countries, for the different genders (men/women) in the Global Burden of Disease (GBD 2017). We further used an age-period-cohort model to analyze age-period-cohort effects on TC incidence., RESULTS: The ASIR of China increased markedly with AAPC of 4.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): 4.0, 5.0%) and 1.8% (1.6, 2.0%) for men and women during 1990-2017. The ASIR of the U. S increased by 1.4% (1.0, 1.8%) and 1.3% (0.9, 1.7%) for men and women from 1990 to 2017.TC increased with the age and period. Aging was one of the most influential factors of TC in China. The age effect increased markedly in the U.S. compared with China. The period effect showed an increase in China while that tended to grow steadily during 1990-2017 in the U.S. The cohort effect peaked in 1963-1967 birth cohorts for men and women in China and declined consistently in the birth cohort in the U.S., CONCLUSION: From 1990 to 2017, due to ionizing radiation and over-diagnosis, age-standardized TC incidence rates in both genders rose in China and the U.S. The standardized incidence rate of women is higher than that of men. It is necessary to provide women with reasonable prevention and protection measures for TC. We need to apply for health services and screening to reduce ionizing radiation.",Excluded
1498,"Radiation therapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the subglottic larynx Objective: This study aims to summarize our institution's experience in treating patients with primary subglottic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with radiotherapy (RT) and to define the optimal treatment plan for these patients. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 18 patients with subglottic SCC curatively treated with RT between 1977 and 2009. T1 and T2 cancers were considered early disease; T3 and T4 lesions were considered advanced disease. Patients were stratified according to whether they received RT alone or RT and surgery. Patients treated surgically tended to have more advanced disease and required a total laryngectomy. Patients were excluded if they had distant metastasis at diagnosis or if their tumor was glottic in origin and extended inferiorly into the subglottis. Result(s): Twelve patients (67 %) had advanced disease, and six patients (33 %) had early disease. Local control was achieved in 100 % of the patients with early disease, regardless of treatment group. Of the patients with advanced disease, local control was achieved in five of the seven patients (71 %) treated with RT alone and in four of the five (80 %) treated with surgery and RT. Ultimate local control was achieved in six of the seven patients (86 %) with advanced disease treated with RT alone. Overall local control was 83 % at 5 years, with a 5-year cause-specific survival of 66 % and a 5-year overall survival of 44 %. Local-regional control mirrored that of local control, with an overall local-regional control rate of 83 %. No patient suffered a severe acute or late complication or acute toxicity during the treatment process. Conclusion(s): Patients with SCC of the subglottic larynx have a high likelihood of local-regional control after undergoing RT along or combined with surgery. Those with T1-T2 and low volume T3-T4 cancers have high probability of local control with voice preservation after definitive RT. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Excluded

Concerns exist regarding the risk of contralateral nodal failure, particularly in patients with ipsilateral nodal involvement at presentation. In this study, we retrospectively reviewed the clinical outcomes of patients treated with ipsilateral radiotherapy aiming to identify factors that predispose to a higher risk of contralateral nodal recurrence. Method(s): Retrospective case note review of all patients with tonsillar cancer who were treated using ipsilateral radiotherapy between September 1995 and September 2011 was performed. Demographics, T and N stage, involvement of soft palate and/or tongue base, presence of extra-capsular spread (ECS) and treatment details were recorded. Kaplan-Meier curves for treatment outcomes were generated. Result(s): A total of 136 patients were identified. Median follow-up was 4.2 years. Twelve (9%) patients had loco-regional recurrence. Eight patients (6%) had contralateral recurrence. N2b disease, ECS and number of pack-years of smoking were associated with contralateral nodal recurrence. Five-year overall survival was 89%, loco-regional disease-free survival 90%, disease-free survival 86% and distal recurrence-free survival 96%.

1668,"Probability of mediastinal involvement in non-small-cell lung cancer: A statistical definition of the clinical target volume for 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy? Purpose: Conformal irradiation (3D-CRT) of non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is largely based on precise definition of the nodal clinical target volume (CTVn). A reduction of the number of nodal stations to be irradiated would facilitate tumor dose escalation. The aim of this study was to design a mathematical tool based on documented data to predict the risk of metastatic involvement for each nodal station. Methods and Materials: We reviewed the large surgical series published in the literature to identify the main pretreatment parameters that modify the risk of nodal invasion. The probability of involvement for the 17 nodal stations described by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) was computed from all these publications. Starting with the primary site of the tumor as the main characteristic, we built a probabilistic tree for each nodal station representing the risk distribution as a function of each tumor feature. Statistical analysis used the inversion of probability trees method described by Weinstein and Feinberg. Validation of the software based on 134 patients from two different populations was performed by receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves and multivariate logistic regression. Result(s): Analysis of all of the various parameters of pretreatment staging relative to each level of the ATS map results in 20,000 different combinations. The first parameters included in the tree, depending on tumor site, were histologic classification, metastatic stage, nodal stage weighted as a function of the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic examination used (positron emission tomography scan, computed tomography scan), and tumor stage. Software is proposed to compute a predicted probability of involvement of each nodal station for any given clinical presentation. Double cross validation confirmed the methodology. A 10% cutoff point was calculated from ROC and logistic model giving the best prediction of mediastinal lymph node involvement. Conclusion(s): To more accurately define the CTVn in NSCLC three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy, we propose a software that evaluates the risk of mediastinal lymph node involvement from easily accessible individual pretreatment parameters. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

We postulated that this approach, for the same planned tissue dose of 120 Gy, would increase the embolic load, improve distribution, and result in enhanced tumor response without causing additional adverse events., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between June 2007 and September 2008, 50 patients with extensive tumor burden and/or markedly hypervascular tumors (13 hepatocellular carcinomas, and 37 liver metastases) underwent radioembolization with extended-shelf-life microspheres at a planned dose of 120 Gy. Baseline and follow-up imaging and laboratory data were obtained. Response in the target lesion was assessed with cross-sectional imaging by using World Health Organization (WHO) and European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) guidelines., RESULTS: The mean delivered radiation dose was 126 Gy. The mean increase in embolic load with this approach was 111%, corresponding to an increase from 3.6 to 7.3 million microspheres. Clinical toxicities included fatigue (28 patients, 56%), abdominal pain (19 patients, 38%), and nausea/vomiting (six patients, 12%). Grade 3-4 bilirubin toxicity was seen in one patient. Two gastroduodenal ulcers were observed. With cross-sectional imaging, response rates according to WHO and EASL guidelines were 51% and 69%, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the safety and efficacy of extended-shelf-life (90)Y glass microspheres. The increased embolic load and lowered activity per microsphere theoretically resulted in better tumor coverage and, hence, improved response rates.

Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) increased the survival rate of irradiated animals, elevated peripheral white blood cell counts and improved gastrointestinal tract function and intestinal epithelial integrity in irradiated male and female mice. FMT preserved the intestinal bacterial composition and retained mRNA and long non-coding RNA expression profiles of host small intestines in a sex-specific fashion.

1748,"The association of residential altitude on the molecular profile and survival of melanoma: Results of an interreg study Cutaneous melanoma (CM) incidence is rising worldwide and is the primary cause of death from skin disease in the Western world. Personal risk factors linked to environmental ultraviolet radiation (UVR) are well-known etiological factors contributing to its development. Nevertheless, UVR can contribute to the development of CM in different patterns and to varying degrees. The present study aimed at investigating whether altitude of residence can contribute to the development of specific types of CM and/or influence its progression. To this aim, 306 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues from primary CM diagnosed in different geographical areas were submitted to B-RAF proto-oncogene serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) and N-RAS proto-oncogene GTPase (NRAS) mutational status detection and mRNA and miRNA profiling by qPCR. Genes were chosen for their functions in specific processes, such as immune response (CD2, PDL1, or CD274) and pigmentation (MITF, TYRP1, and TRPM1). Furthermore, four microRNAs, namely miR-150-5p, miR-155-5p, miR-204-5p, and miR-211-5p, were included in the profiling. Our results highlight differences in the gene expression profile of primary CM with respect to the geographical area and the altitude of residence. Melanoma-specific survival was influenced by the gene expression of mRNA and miRNAs and varied with the altitude of patients' residence. In detail, TYRP1 and miR-204-5p were highly expressed in patients living at higher altitudes, unlike miR-150-5p, miR-155-5p, and miR-211-5p. Since miRNAs are highly regulated by reactive oxygen species, it is possible that different regulatory mechanisms characterize CMs at different altitudes due to the different environment and UVR intensity.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

Method(s): Fifty patients were prospectively divided into two groups randomly: group A (n = 25), 70 kVp with 25 mL CM, and group B (n = 25), 100 kVp with 40 mL CM. CT attenuation values, noise, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the shoulder, neck, and cerebral arteries were measured for objective image quality. Subjective image quality of the shoulder and cerebral arteries was also evaluated. For patients undergoing digital subtracted angiography (DSA), diagnostic accuracy of CTA was assessed with DSA as reference standard. Result(s): The SNRs of the shoulder, neck, and cerebral arteries in group A were higher than those in group B (P < 0.05). The CNRs of the shoulder and neck arteries in group A were higher than those in group B (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in subjective image quality of arteries between group A and group B (P > 0.05).

2243,"Concurrent chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced esophageal cancer - A pilot study by using daily low-dose cisplatin and continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil Background: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) has recently become a promising treatment for esophageal cancer. However, most investigators have adopted the conventional or modified Wayne-State PF (cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil) regimen, which is inevitably associated with moderate to severe treatment-related toxicities. In this pilot study, we incorporated a daily low-dose regimen of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil into CCRT in order to improve the compliance of the patients. Patients and Methods: Between July 1993 and Dec. 1997, 25 patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer (T3, or N1 disease), received CCRT which consisted of daily low-dose cisplatin (6 mg/m2/day) and continuous infusion of 5-FU (225 mg/m2/day) with radiotherapy (fraction size = 200-250 cGy/day). Except for the initial 9 patients, for whom post-CCRT esophagectomy was compulsory, all subsequent patients underwent esophagectomy only when inadequate response to CCRT was noted. The scheduled radiation dose was 50 Gy for the first 9 patients, and 60 Gy for the rest of the patients. Result(s): Eighteen patients (72%) completed the CCRT without interruption. Clinically, there were 8 CR and 9 PR, with a total response rate of 68% (47-87%, 95% C.I.). All patients were evaluable for toxicity. Grade 3/4 leukopenia and thrombocytopenia developed in 14 (56%) and 7 (28%) patients, respectively. Grade 3/4 non-hematologic toxicity was seen in 4 (16%) patients. The median survival of the whole group was 8 months (range: 2-59+). The projected 3-year overall survival was 24%.

2220,"Pelvic Ring Fragility Fractures: A Debilitationg Fracture Occurring in Elderly Ambulatory Patients with Monoclonal Gammopathy of Uncertain Significance, Pernicious Anemia, Hyponatremia, and Associated with High Mortality PURPOSE: To study the clinical characteristics and course of a cohort of patients presenting with pelvic ring fragility fractures(PFF). METHOD(S): A retrospective chart review of 43 patients with PFF seen over a 4 year period in a community based outpatient fracture clinic was conducted. A complete history and physical, review of medical records and x-rays, CBC, chemistry profile, TSH, urinalysis, vitamin B12, 25-OH vitamin D, PTH, and immunofixation(IMF) was done in all patients. Antiparietal cell(APA) and intrinsic factor(IF) antibody and SPE was done in select cases. Comorbidity including history of solid tumor, diabetes, COPD, cardiac and neurologic disorder were tabulated. RESULT(S): There were 38 females and 5 males ranging in age 55-95 years(mean 82.3). 23 patients had a previous major osteoporotic fracture and 8 a total hip replacement. 17 had received previous osteoporosis treatment. 40 patients were living at home and 22 were still driving within 3 months prior to the fall causing the PFF. 13 were using ambulatory aids. Patients had 0-3(mean 0.93) comorbid conditions: COPD-11, cardiac-11, cancer-7, neurologic-6, and diabetes-5. 2 patients had previous radiation therapy to the pelvic area. The BMI was 20< in 9 patients and 19 had peripheral neuropathy(PN). CT or MRI confirmed the PFF in 37 patients and showed fractures of the sacrum-17, acetabulum-7, and both sacrum and acetabulum-5 in addition to the pelvic rami. Monoclonal protein was found with IMF in 17(42%) patients: IgG-7, IgG-6, and light chains-4. M-spike was found in 8. 5(14%) patients had low vitamin B12 and either APA or IF. 3 patients had vitamin D levels 20<ng/ml and 7 had hyponatremia. Alkaline phosphatase was elevated in 12 patients. 29 patients required rehabilitation in a nursing home. During follow up (mean 20.7 months) 12(31%) patients died,10 within 1 year after PFF from causes unrelated to the fracture. CONCLUSION(S): PFF occurs predominantly in female, elderly, independent and active patients with few comorbid conditions and is associated with significant morbidity. PFF may be a prelude to mortality within 1 year of occurrence. CT or MRI scans are necessary to define the full extent of injury to the pelvis. Although the clinical characteristics may differ between PFF, hip, and vertebral fracture patients, they all share age related conditions such as low BMI, PN, MGUS, pernicious anemia and hyponatremia that predispose to falling and bone fragility.",Excluded
2258,"Automatic spectral imaging protocol selection and iterative reconstruction in abdominal CT with reduced contrast agent dose: initial experience OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility, image quality, and radiation dose of automatic spectral imaging protocol selection (ASIS) and adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) with reduced contrast agent dose in abdominal multiphase CT., METHODS: One hundred and sixty patients were randomly divided into two scan protocols (n = 80 each; protocol A, 120 kVp/450 mgI/kg, filtered back projection algorithm (FBP); protocol B, spectral CT imaging with ASIS and 40 to 70 keV monochromatic images generated per 300 mgI/kg, ASIR algorithm. Quantitative parameters (image noise and contrast-to-noise ratios [CNRs]) and qualitative visual parameters (image noise, small structures, organ enhancement, and overall image quality) were compared., RESULTS: Monochromatic images at 50 keV and 60 keV provided similar or lower image noise, but higher contrast and overall image quality as compared with 120-kVp images. Despite the higher image noise, 40-keV images showed similar overall image quality compared to 120-kVp images. Radiation dose did not differ between the two protocols, while contrast agent dose in protocol B was reduced by 33 %., CONCLUSION: Application of ASIR and ASIS to monochromatic imaging from 40 to 60 keV allowed contrast agent dose reduction with adequate image quality and without increasing radiation dose compared to 120 kVp with FBP., KEY POINTS: * Automatic spectral imaging protocol selection provides appropriate scan protocols. * Abdominal CT is feasible using spectral imaging and 300 mgI/kg contrast agent. * 50-keV monochromatic images with 50 % ASIR provide optimal image quality.",Excluded
2441,"Percutaneous computed tomography-guided lung biopsies: preliminary results using an augmented reality navigation system AIMS AND BACKGROUND: ""Augmented reality"" is a technique to create a composite view by augmenting the real intervention field, visualized by the doctor, with additional information coming from a virtual volume generated using computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance or ultrasound images previously acquired from the same patient. In the present study we verified the accuracy and validated the clinical use of an augmented reality navigation system produced to perform percutaneous CT-guided lung biopsies., METHODS: One hundred and eighty consecutive patients with solitary parenchymal lung lesions, enrolled using a nonrandom enrollment system, underwent percutaneous CT-guided aspiration and core biopsy using a traditional technique (group C, 90 patients) and navigation system assistance (group S, 90 patients). For each patient we recorded the largest lesion diameter, procedure time, overall number of CT scans, radiation dose, and complications. The entire experimental project was evaluated and approved by the local institutional review board (ethics committee)., RESULTS: Each procedure was concluded successfully and a pathological diagnosis was reached in 96% of cases in group S and 90% of cases in group C. Procedure time, overall number of CT scans and incident x-ray radiation dose (CTDIvol) were significantly reduced in navigation system-assisted procedures (P <0.001; z = 5.64) compared with traditional CT-guided procedures. The percentage of procedural complications was 14% in group S and 17% in group C., CONCLUSION: The augmented reality navigation system used in this study was a highly safe, technically reliable and effective support tool in percutaneous CT-guided lung biopsy, allowing to shorten the procedure time and reduce the incident x-ray radiation dose to patients and the rate of insufficient specimens. Furthermore, it has the potential to increase the number of procedures executed in the allocated time without increasing the number of complications.",Excluded

A dose of 7 mL was used for each of 3 acquisitions: images were obtained of each foot in the sagittal plane, and then both feet were imaged simultaneously in the transverse plane. The following parameters were used for acquisition: (TR/TE 4.7 milliseconds/ 1.3 milliseconds, field of view = 28 cm, Flip angle = 30 degrees, 384 x 256 matrix, section thickness = 1.6 mm, Bandwidth = 19.23). The dorsalis pedis, plantar arch, distal posterior tibial, lateral tarsal, and medial plantar arteries were graded for visualization, artifact, and overall image quality on a 4-point scale (1 = worst; 4 = best)., RESULTS: Superior visualization trended towards separate sagittal acquisitions when compared with that of bilateral transverse acquisitions for most of the individual vessels of the foot. Overall, separate sagittal acquisitions (average score = 2.9) were superior to bilateral transverse acquisitions (average score = 2.6). The average image quality score reflecting the amount of artifact was 2.6 for studies obtained using bilateral transverse acquisitions and 3.1 for studies obtained using separate sagittal acquisitions., CONCLUSION: Low-dose gadolinium multi-injection TRICKS and bolus-chase MR angiography at 3.0 T provides an effective and easily reproducible technique for imaging of the pedal vasculature in volunteers and has great potential for clinical application.",Excluded
1348,"In balloon kyphoplasty for osteoporotic vertebral body fractures, the potential of reduction is depending on the time to surgery PURPOSE: For the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral body fractures, balloon kyphoplasty has been shown to be highly efficient in pain reduction. This technique can restore patient mobility and enhance quality of life. Fracture reduction is resulting in part from positioning of the patient and from balloon expansion. This prospective study tries to investigate whether the potential of reduction is depending on the time to surgery in these patients. METHOD(S): Inclusion criteria: t-score < 1.0, thoracolumbar fractures types. Exclusion criteria: more than two fractures, previous fractures, additional posterior instrumentation, age > 90 years, cardiac arrhythmia. 71 patients (47 female, 24 male; average age 74 years) with 101 fractures were included. 62 patients concluded followup (FU) at 2 years post op. The following clinical and radiological data were collected pre and post op, after 6 weeks, and after 3, 6, 12 and 24 months: Bisegmental endplate angle, anterior vertebral body height, Visual-Analog-Score (VAS; 0 no pain; 100 worst possible pain), Oswestry-Disability-Questionnaire (ODQ). Surgical technique follows the standard protocol for balloon-kyphoplasty (Medtronic). Fractures were defined acute, if fracture age was less than two weeks. Fractures were defined chronic, if fracture age was two weeks or more. Conventional X-rays were provided in an upright position during all post op FU visits. RESULT(S): 61 patients suffered from osteoporosis, 10 from osteopenia. For the acute fracture group (n=54), bisegmental endplate angle was improved by 8,6degree on average. For the chronic fracture group (n=47), however, bisegmental endplate angle was improved by 3,7degree only. This difference between groups is statistically significant (p<0.05). For the acute fracture group, anterior vertebral body height was restored from 48% to 81% (p<0.05). For the chronic fracture group, anterior vertebral body height was restored from 41% to 60% (not significant). CONCLUSION(S): If osteoporotic vertebral body fractures are being surgically treated within the first two weeks of injury, restoration of the sagittal spinal profile is significantly improved as compared to older fracture age. The pain reducing effect of the procedure, however, occurs independent of fracture age. As the leading clinical sign for osteoporotic fracture augmentation is persistent pain, cement injection remains an option even in older fractures with reduced potential for sagittal correction.",Excluded

2096,"Preoperative chemoradiation for rectal cancer causes prolonged pudendal nerve terminal motor latency PURPOSE: A worsened anorectal function after chemoradiation for high-risk rectal cancer is often attributed to radiation damage of the anorectum and pelvic floor. Its impact on pudendal nerve function is unclear. This prospective study evaluated the short-term effect of preoperative combined chemoradiation on anorectal physiologic and pudendal nerve function. METHOD(S): Sixty-six patients (39 men, 27 women) with localized resectable (T3, T4, or N1) rectal cancer were included in the study. All patients received 45 Gy (1.8 Gy/day in 25 fractions) over five weeks, plus 5-fluorouracil (350 mg/m2/day) and leucovorin (20 mg/m2/day) concurrently on days 1 to 5 and 29 to 33. Patients who had rectal cancer with a distal margin within 6 cm of the anal verge had the anus included in the field of radiotherapy (Group A, n = 26). Patients who had rectal cancer with a distal margin 6 to 12 cm from the anal verge had shielding of the anus during radiotherapy (Group B, n = 40). The Wexner continence score, anorectal manometry and pudendal nerve terminal motor latency were assessed at baseline and four weeks after completion of chemoradiation. RESULT(S): The median Wexner score deteriorated significantly (P < 0.0001) from 0 to 2.5 for both Groups A (range, 0-8) and B (range, 0-14). The maximum resting anal pressures were unchanged after chemoradiation. The maximum squeeze anal pressures were reduced (mean = 166.5-157.5 mmHg) after chemoradiation. This change was similar in both Groups A and B. Eighteen patients (Group A = 7, Group B = 11) developed prolonged pudendal nerve terminal motor latency after chemoradiation. These 18 patients similarly had a worsened median Wexner continence score (range, 0-3) and maximum squeeze anal pressures (mean = 165.5-144 mmHg). The results obtained were independent of tumor response to chemoradiation. CONCLUSION(S): Preoperative chemoradiation for rectal cancer carries a significant risk of pudendal neuropathy, which might contribute to the incidence of fecal incontinence after restorative proctectomy for rectal cancer. © The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons 2005.",Excluded

The aim of this study is to compare prospectively in a single, high-volume center the outcome of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ablation performed specifically by second-generation cryoballoon or contact force radiofrequency ablation., METHODS: Consecutive patients scheduled for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation transcatheter ablation have been included and prospectively followed up. Aiming to reduce potential bias deriving from baseline characteristics, a propensity score matching analysis has been performed to analyze safety and efficacy outcomes., RESULTS: Out of consecutive patients undergoing atrial fibrillation transcatheter ablation between January 2015 and December 2016, 46 patients approached by cryoablation were matched 1 : 1 by propensity score to a similar population treated by last-generation radiofrequency ablation. Freedom from atrial fibrillation after 12 months (76 vs. 78%, P = 0.804) and incidence of complications (4 vs. 6%, P = 0.168) did not differ between the two groups. Radiological exposure was higher for the cryoballoon group (11 vs. 4 min, P < 0.001), whereas procedural duration did not differ (P = 0.174). Aiming to assess the potential impact of a learning curve in patients undergoing cryoablation, the first-third of patients (n = 15) were compared with the remaining, reporting longer radiological exposure (P < 0.001), but similar safety and efficacy., CONCLUSION: In this propensity score analysis, last-generation cryoballoon and radiofrequency catheters for atrial fibrillation ablation present similar efficacy and safety. Cryoablation requires longer fluoroscopy exposure compared with radiofrequency, although this is reduced by increased experience.",Excluded
1568,"High expression of Rad51c predicts poor prognostic outcome and induces cell resistance to cisplatin and radiation in non-small cell lung cancer Rad51c is critical for homologous recombination repair and genomic stability and may play roles in tumorigenesis and cancer therapy. We investigated the expression level and clinical significance of Rad51c in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and determined the effect of Rad51c on NSCLC cell chemosensitivity and radiosensitivity. Rad51c expression was detected using immunohistochemistry and was higher in NSCLC patient samples than in adjacent normal tissues. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that high Rad51c expression was an independent predictor of short overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in NSCLC patients receiving chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Furthermore, Rad51c knockdown increased the killing effect of ionizing radiation (IR) and enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptotic cells in NSCLC cells by disrupting the repair of cisplatin- and IR-induced DNA damage. In addition, ectopic expression of Rad51c dramatically enhanced NSCLC cell resistance to cisplatin and radiotherapy. These findings suggest that increased expression of Rad51c may confer resistance to chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy of NSCLC, and also be an independent prognostic factor for patient outcome. Therefore, targeting Rad51c may represent an improved therapeutic strategy for NSCLC patients with locally advanced disease.Copyright © 2016, International Society of Oncology and BioMarkers (ISOBM).",Excluded
1675,"Does salivary gland scintigraphy predict response to pilocarpine in patients with post-radiotherapy xerostomia? This study was undertaken to determine whether standard salivary gland scintigraphy may be used for the objective assessment of salivary gland sialogogues, in particular oral pilocarpine, in the treatment of post-radiotherapy xerostomia. Nine patients, with xerostomia following radiotherapy to the head and neck region underwent salivary gland scintigraphy with technetium-99m pertechnetate (40 MBq) both before and following 1 month of oral pilocarpine (5 mg tds). For each scan, the percentage uptake in the first 14 min, the peak uptake, time to peak uptake and the percentage of activity excreted following lemon juice stimulation were calculated. The results were correlated with the subjective response as assessed by questionnaire and visual analogue scale. We found no correlation between subjective response and any of the four scan parameters analysed. We could not identify any parameter that predicted those patients who would respond to pilocarpine. In addition, only one parameter, the percentage of activity excreted following stimulation, correlated with previous dose of radiotherapy to the gland. In conclusion, in this study salivary gland scintigraphy did not appear to correlate with or predict response to oral pilocarpine. However, future studies might consider performing salivary gland scintigraphy prior to radiotherapy as well as at differing time points following the commencement of pilocarpine.",Excluded
1483,"The amount of impaction and loss of reduction in osteoporotic proximal humeral fractures after surgical fixation Summary: After surgical fixation, osteoporotic proximal humeral fractures often show high impaction and loss of reduction. This study aims at assessing the amount of impaction and loss of reduction at a short and medium follow-up. We found an alarming percentage of cases showing these complications in the first postoperative months. Introduction: This study seeks to quantify the amount of humeral head impaction and loss of reduction in a consecutive series of osteoporotic proximal humerus fractures treated with a locking plate. Method(s): A series of displaced proximal humerus fractures were prospectively treated with minimally invasive reduction and ostheosynthesis using a locking plate. Diagnosis and classification of fractures were based on X-ray examination and CT scan. Proximal humerus cortical bone thickness (CBTAVG) was studied to assess osteoporosis. Amount of loss of reduction and head fragment impaction were noted at 3 and 18 months of follow-up. Constant score was calculated at 6 and 18 months of follow-up. Result(s): Thirty-one osteoporotic fractures were studied. Most of the fractures (21, 67.7 %) had a CBTAVG of less than 4 mm. At 3 months of follow-up, 7 cases (22.5 %) had significant loss of reduction and the mean amount of impaction was 2.8 mm. At 18 months of follow-up, only 1 additional fracture showed loss of reduction and mean impaction was 3 mm (p < 0.05). At 6 months follow-up, the mean Constant score was 58 %; while at 18 months, it was 70 % (p = 0.02). Amount of impaction was significantly correlated to age of patients (p = 0.031), female sex (p = 0.011), CBTAVG (p = 0.019), and metaphyseal comminution (p = 0.013). Conclusion(s): Osteoporotic proximal humerus fractures may present an important impaction and loss of reduction in the first 3 months after surgery even if treated with a rigid device and multiple head screws. Surgeons treating these osteoporotic fractures should be aware of these complications even when using a rigid device.Copyright © 2015, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.",Excluded
1894,"Treatment of type I endoleaks using transcatheter embolization with onyx Purpose: To report a single-center experience with transcatheter embolization of type I endoleaks using the liquid embolic agent Onyx, an ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer. Method(s): Eight patients (4 men; mean age 74.8 years, range 63-86) with 10 type I endoleaks (6 abdominal and 4 thoracic) diagnosed 2 days to 9 years after endovascular repair were treated with Onyx embolization because cuff extension was precluded by an insufficient landing zone in 6 cases and an unsuitable aortic diameter in 2. Endoleaks were accessed with a 4-F diagnostic catheter and a coaxially introduced dimethylsulfoxide- compatible microcatheter. Onyx-34 was predominantly applied due to its high viscosity; patent side branches were coil embolized prior to Onyx delivery in 3 cases. Result(s): Technical success of the procedure was achieved in all cases. The mean volume of Onyx used for abdominal endoleaks was 11.8 mL (range 3.0-25.5) and 19.4 mL (range 4.5- 31.5) for thoracic endoleaks. The average duration of the procedure was 76.7 minutes (range 34.5-110.6), and the average radiation dose area product was 18.8 cGy*cm2 (range 10.6-55.8). Reperfusion of the endoleak was detected in one case 2 days after the procedure. A second case showed an occluded endoleak but a small trace of contrast between the aortic wall and the stent-graft. Non-target embolization was not found in any case. Mean follow-up was 13.2 months (range 8-24). The mean reduction in diameters for thoracic aneurysms after 6 and 12 months was 0.4 and 0.9 cm, respectively, and 0.6 and 1.2 cm, respectively, for abdominal aneurysms. Conclusion(s): Transcatheter embolization of type I endoleaks using Onyx is a simple, safe, and sustainable treatment option with a high primary success rate for cases in which stentgraft extension is not possible. The benefit of additional coil embolization remains uncertain. © 2014 by the INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF ENDOVASCULAR SPECIALISTS.",Excluded
2303,"Liver cancers in Mayak workers Liver cancer mortality risks were evaluated in 11,000 workers who started working at the 'Mayak' Production Association in 1948-1958 and who were exposed to both internally deposited plutonium and external gamma radiation. Comparisons with Russian liver cancer incidence rates indicate excess risk, especially among those with detectable plutonium body burdens and among female workers in the plutonium plant. Comparisons within the Mayak worker cohort which evaluate the role of plutonium body burden with adjustment for cumulative external dose indicate excess risk among workers with burdens estimated to exceed 7.4 kBq (relative risk = 17; 95% CI = 8.0-36) and among workers in the plutonium plant who did not have routine plutonium monitoring data based on urine measurements (relative risk = 2.8; 95% CI = 1.3-6.2). In addition, analyses treating the estimated plutonium body burden as a continuous variable indicate increasing risk with increasing burden (P < 0.001). Relative risks tended to be higher for females than for males, probably because of the lower baseline risk and the higher levels of plutonium measured in females. Because of limitations in current plutonium dosimetry, no attempt was made to quantify liver cancer risks from plutonium in terms of organ dose, and risk from external dose could not be reliably evaluated.

1612,"Gastroduodenal complications after concurrent chemoradiation therapy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: endoscopic findings and risk factors PURPOSE: Concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) is useful in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but little is known about radiation-induced gastroduodenal complications following therapy. To determine risk factors, we investigated the prevalence and patterns of gastroduodenal complications following CCRT using endoscopy., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Enrolled in the study were 123 patients treated with CCRT for unresectable HCC between January 1998 and December 2005. Radiation-induced gastroduodenal complications were defined as radiation gastritis/duodenitis, radiation gastric/duodenal ulcer, or other gastroduodenal toxicity associated with radiation, based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE 3.0). Serious gastroduodenal complications were defined as events occurring within 12 months from completion of CCRT, those requiring prompt therapeutic intervention, or symptoms equivalent to Grade 3 or 4 radiation-related gastroduodenal toxicity, including nausea or vomiting, based on CTCAE 3.0., RESULTS: A month after completion of CCRT, 65 (52.8%) patients displayed endoscopic evidence of radiation-induced gastroduodenal complications. Radiation gastric and duodenal ulcers were found in 32 (26.0%) and 20 (16.3%) patients, respectively; radiation gastritis and duodenitis were found in 50 (40.7%) and 42 (34.1%) patients, respectively. Radiation-related bleeding was observed in 13 patients (10.6%). Serious gastroduodenal complications occurred in 18 patients (14.6%) and were significantly more frequent in patients with liver cirrhosis than in those without cirrhosis (p=0.043). There were no radiation-related deaths., CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopically detectable radiation-induced gastroduodenal complications were common in HCC following CCRT. Although serious complications were uncommon, the frequency was higher in patients with liver cirrhosis; thus, these patients should be closely monitored when receiving CCRT.

The properties of galaxies are known to be affected by their environment, but although galaxies in clusters and groups have been quite thoroughly investigated, little is known about galaxies belonging to filaments of the cosmic web, or about the properties of the filaments themselves. Aims. Here we investigate the properties of the rich cluster MACS J0717.5+3745 and its extended filament by analyzing the distribution and fractions of intra-cluster light (ICL) in its core and by trying to detect intra-filament light (IFL) in the filament. We analyze the galaxy luminosity function (GLF) of the cluster core and of the filament. We also study the orientations of galaxies in the filament to better constrain the filament properties. Methods. This work is based on Hubble Space Telescope (HST) archive data, both from the Hubble Frontier Fields in the F435W, F606W, F814W, and F105W bands, and from a mosaic of images in the F606W and F814W bands. The spatial distribution of the ICL was determined with our new wavelet-based software, DAWIS. The GLFs were extracted in the F606W and F814W bands, with a statistical subtraction of the background, and fit with Schechter functions. The galaxy orientations in the filaments were estimated with SExtractor after correction for the point spread function. Results. We detect a large amount of ICL in the cluster core, but no IFL in the cosmic filament. The fraction of ICL in the core peaks in the F606W filter before decreasing with wavelength. Though relatively noisy, the GLFs in the filament are notably different from those of field galaxies, with a flatter faint end slope and an excess of bright galaxies. We do not detect a significant alignment of the galaxies in the filament region analyzed. 2019 A. Ellien et al.",Excluded

2072,"The effects of post-radiation education pamphlet on self-efficacy in cancer patients Cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy often experience anxiety and a sense of loss of control immediately after completion of their active treatment. This study aims to evaluate, using a cross-sectional survey, the effects of a post-radiation education pamphlet on the self-efficacy of cancer patients in terms of seeking/understanding medical information, seeking support, and coping with radiation side effects. Forty-eight patients from various age groups with a variety of cancer diagnoses were recruited from the Radiation Medicine Program at Princess Margaret Hospital. Descriptive analysis of 35 survey responses suggests that the pamphlet improved patient self-efficacy in terms of seeking and understanding medical information, seeking support, and coping with radiation side effects. The benefits of the pamphlet were also found to be independent of patients' education level. Despite the small sample size, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of the education pamphlet in improving patient self-efficacy and gives support to the pamphlet's utility in improving the transition care of cancer patients finishing radiotherapy. In parallel, 40 Princess Margaret Hospital Radiation Medicine Program staff members were also asked, via online surveys, about their awareness of the pamphlet, and its usefulness in terms of content, format, and timing of the information provided. More than 90% of the staff indicated that the pamphlet was an effective tool. Only 57% of oncologists were aware of the pamphlet's existence. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Method(s): Patient charts from consecutive patients with MSCC who were treated with radiotherapy alone at either an onsite hospital radiation department (from 2008 to 2012) or an offsite radiotherapy centre (2012-2015) were reviewed. Patient clinical parameters were compared across groups with either the chi2 test or Fisher's exact test, while survival curves were compared with the log-rank test. The primary end points were ambulatory rate over time, overall survival and cancer-specific survival. Result(s): A total of 45 patients were identified, with 19 patients treated onsite in the hospital department and 26 patients treated at the offsite radiotherapy centre with median follow-up of 42 days vs 48.5 days, respectively. The ambulatory rate over time, overall survival and cancer-specific survival were not significantly different between the two eras. Patients treated in-hospital were more likely to start treatment the same day as the consult (""sim and treat"") (79% vs 27%, p = 0.006) and were more likely to not complete treatment (26% vs 4%, p = 0.029) as compared with those treated in the offsite centre. Conclusion(s): Patients with MSCC can be feasibly treated at an offsite radiotherapy centre with outcomes similar to those treated in-hospital.

To assess cancer control knowledge and priorities among primary care physicians in Missouri, we conducted a random survey of 207 physicians. Although reported knowledge of the role tobacco plays in cancer causation was high, activity in tobacco cessation counselling and referral was low. Respondents considered diet to be a relatively unimportant factor in cancer causation, whereas they viewed sun exposure, genetics/family history, and radiation exposure as large contributors to the cancer burden. Among cancer early detection tests, high activity was shown for the Pap test and breast examination. Conversely, low activity was reported for colon sigmoidoscopy. Inverse correlations were shown between age group of the physician and several cancer prevention and early detection practices. For each cancer prevention and screening practice, reported activity was higher for medical doctors than for doctors of osteopathic medicine.

1915,"Dose, volume, and function relationships in parotid salivary glands following conformal and intensity-modulated irradiation of head and neck cancer PURPOSE: To determine the relationships between the three-dimensional dose distributions in parotid glands and their saliva production, and to find the doses and irradiated volumes that permit preservation of the salivary flow following irradiation (RT)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighty-eight patients with head and neck cancer irradiated with parotid-sparing conformal and multisegmental intensity modulation techniques between March 1994 and August 1997 participated in the study. The mean dose and the partial volumes receiving specified doses were determined for each gland from dose-volume histograms (DVHs). Nonstimulated and stimulated saliva flow rates were selectively measured from each parotid gland before RT and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the completion of RT. The data were fit using a generalized linear model and the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model of Lyman-Kutcher. In the latter model, a ""severe complication"" was defined as salivary flow rate reduced to < or =25% pre-RT flow at 12 months., RESULTS: Saliva flow rates data were available for 152 parotid glands. Glands receiving a mean dose below or equal to a threshold (24 Gy for the unstimulated and 26 Gy for the stimulated saliva) showed substantial preservation of the flow rates following RT and continued to improve over time (to median 76% and 114% of pre-RT for the unstimulated and stimulated flow rates, respectively, at 12 months). In contrast, most glands receiving a mean dose higher than the threshold produced little saliva with no recovery over time. The output was not found to decrease as mean dose increased, as long as the threshold dose was not reached. Similarly, partial volume thresholds were found: 67%, 45%, and 24% gland volumes receiving more than 15 Gy, 30 Gy, and 45 Gy, respectively. The partial volume thresholds correlated highly with the mean dose and did not add significantly to a model predicting the saliva flow rate from the mean dose and the time since RT. The NTCP model parameters were found to be TD50 (the tolerance dose for 50% complications rate for whole organ irradiated uniformly) = 28.4 Gy, n (volume dependence parameter) = 1, and m (the slope of the dose/response relationship) = 0.18. Clinical factors including age, gender, pre-RT surgery, chemotherapy, and certain medical conditions were not found to be significantly associated with the salivary flow rates. Medications (diuretics, antidepressants, and narcotics) were found to adversely affect the unstimulated but not the stimulated flow rates., CONCLUSIONS: Dose/volume/function relationships in the parotid glands are characterized by dose and volume thresholds, steep dose/response relationships when the thresholds are reached, and a maximal volume dependence parameter in the NTCP model. A parotid gland mean dose of < or =26 Gy should be a planning goal if substantial sparing of the gland function is desired.",Excluded
1428,"Changes in the Selected Antioxidant Defense Parameters in the Blood of Patients after High Resolution Computed Tomography Ionizing radiation generated during high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scanning may have an indirect effect on the mechanisms regulating the oxidative-antioxidant balance in the human body, which is one of the necessary factors ensuring the maintenance of its homeostasis. The aim of the study was to analyze the response of antioxidant systems through the determination of the antioxidant markers in the blood of patients exposed to oxidative stress resulting from the routine HRCT examination of the chest. Blood of 35 people aged 60.77 +/- 10.81 taken before and at four time points after the examination constituted the test material. The determination of the total antioxidant capacity expressed as ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) and ferric reducing antioxidant activity and ascorbic acid concentration (FRASC) were performed together with an examination of catalase activity and the concentration of the reduced glutathione. The organism's response to ionizing radiation was associated with a significant decrease in the antioxidant markers' levels at all time-points and showed a significant negative correlation depending on the radiation dose. Visible down-regulation of these markers is a response to increased oxidative stress. In light of the obtained results, the measurement of the selected markers of antioxidant defense may be a useful parameter of oxidative stress caused by ionizing radiation.",Excluded
2417,"Five-year outcome of stand-alone fusion using carbon cages in cervical disc arthrosis From January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2003, in the Neurosurgery Department of Rome University o ""Sapienza,"" 167 patients underwent anterior surgery for cervical spondylodiscoarthrosis. The levels treated by the anterior stand-alone technique were: C3-C4 (11%), C4-C5 (19%), C5-C6 (40%), and C6-C7 (30%). All patients underwent left anterior presternocleidomastoid-precarotid approach, microdiscectomy, and interbody fusion using a carbon fiber cage filled with hydroxyapatite. All patients were discharged within 48 h after surgery with cervical orthosis. In one case, a hematoma of the surgical site occurred within 12 h of surgery; for this reason the patient underwent surgical revision and was discharged 4 days later. All patients have worn cervical orthosis for a mean period of 7 weeks and underwent radiological follow-up with cervical RX at 1 and 3 months after surgery. All patients underwent follow-up from 54 to 90 months after surgery, and all of them underwent cervical RX, cervical CT scans for the estimate of fusion, and evaluation of neurological status using VAS and NDI. Of 167 patients, 132 were cooperative for this study, 18 were non-cooperative, and 17 died. The estimation of fusion made by cervical CT scans with sagittal reconstruction showed complete osteointegration of the cage in 115 patients (87.1%), while it showed pseudoarthrosis in 17 patients (12.9%). In 24 patients, we observed adjacent segment degeneration, and 13 of these underwent new surgical procedures in this institute or in another hospital. Clinical evaluation with VAS and NDI showed a good outcome, with poorest benefit in patients over 60 years. The clinical analysis showed a good fusion rate in according with literature, 13% of non-fusion rate without clinical evidence and 20% of ASDegeneration but only 10% had required new surgery. We also observed that patients over 60 years of age had less satisfactory outcome, probably related with the evolution of pathophysiological degeneration of the cervical spine. In the opinion, pseudoarthrosis is caused by malpositioning of the carbon fiber cage. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Excluded
2350,"Associations of biomechanical properties of the cornea with environmental and metabolic factors in an elderly population: The ALIENOR study PURPOSE. The purpose of this study was to assess the associations of biomechanical properties of the cornea with metabolic and environmental factors in an elderly population. METHODS. The ALIENOR (Antioxydants, Lipides Essentiels, Nutrition, and Maladies OculaiRes) study is a population-based study. In 2009-2010, 624 subjects, aged 74 years or more, underwent an eye examination, including intraocular pressure (IOP), central corneal thickness (CCT), and biomechanical properties of the cornea measurements using the Ocular Response Analyzer. Socio-demographic, lifestyle, and medical history data were collected using standardized questionnaires. Mean lifetime ambient ultraviolet (UV) exposure was estimated using residential history and statistics of UV radiation at each location using the Eurosun UV database. RESULTS. Mean age was 82.2 +/- 4.3 years. Mean corneal hysteresis (CH), corneal resistance factor (CRF), and CCT were 9.4 +/- 1.9, 9.8 +/- 1.9 mm Hg, and 551.6 +/- 36.8 mum, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, CH and CRF values were significantly lower in subjects older than 80 years (-0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.89;-0.24); P < 0.001 and -0.48; 95% CI: -0.75;-0.20; P < 0.001, respectively), in subjects having higher ambient UV exposure (-0.50; 95% CI: -0.88;-0.12; P < 0.01; and -0.46; 95% CI: -0.78;-0.13); P < 0.05, respectively), and in subjects with high plasma LDL cholesterol (CH: -0.46; 95% CI: -0.86;-0.03; P < 0.05; and CRF: -0.37; 95% CI: -0.72;-0.008; P < 0.05). Central corneal thickness was significantly higher in former smokers than in never smokers (+11.01; 95% CI: 0.48;21.55; P < 0.05) and was not significantly associated with age, ambient UV exposure, diabetes, or LDL cholesterol. CONCLUSIONS. Biomechanical properties of the cornea are modified by metabolic and lifetime environmental factors, especially UV exposure. The manner these factors may influence onset and progression of ocular diseases or IOP measurements need further investigation.Copyright © 2016, Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.

1616,"The effects of stimulation frequency and fatigue on the force-intensity relationship for human skeletal muscle OBJECTIVE: Functional electrical stimulation (FES) has not gained widespread application for a number of factors; two of which are rapid muscle fatigue and imprecise control in force. Stimulation intensity is adjusted during FES to overcome the decline in muscle force due to fatigue and precisely control muscle force output. The purpose of this study was to understand the relationship between muscle force output and stimulation intensity and to see how this relationship changes with fatigue., METHODS: Quadriceps femoris muscles of 10 able-bodied adults were tested isometrically. Pre- and post-fatigue muscle force responses to stimulation trains with different intensities and frequencies were recorded and analyzed. In addition, a case study using a subject with spinal cord injury was presented to illustrate the use of the force-intensity relationship to reduce muscle fatigue and improve the control of muscle force during repetitive electrical stimulation., RESULTS: An exponential relationship between muscle force and stimulation intensity was observed; interestingly, the normalized force-intensity relationship did not change with stimulation frequency or fatigue., CONCLUSIONS: The observed consistencies in the force-intensity relationship should assist scientists and clinicians to more accurately predict the forces produced by a muscle with changes in pulse duration during repetitive electrical stimulation., SIGNIFICANCE: The findings of this study provide guidelines for clinicians and researchers to adjust the stimulation intensity to achieve precise control of force repetitively during the application of FES.",Excluded

The proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) results demonstrate that the P(LA-CL) copolymer is successfully synthesized, and that the molecular weight can be controlled by the glycol content. The thermoplastic plate is processed with triallyl isocyanurate as a cross-linking agent by a single-screw extruder followed by gamma-ray irradiation. Shape memory test results show that the material had the desired shape memory effect, with deformation recovery rates reaching 100%. After secondary stretching of samples, deformation recovery rates are unchanged. The results of mechanical property measurements indicate that with added lactide, the tensile strength is improved and shore hardness is increased by 20%-30%. Data from clinical trials also reveal that the material has good clinical effects in thermoplastic membrane fixation.Copyright © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Excluded

However, in some patients, the metastatic disease may be very limited in number and site and local aggressive therapy may potentially prolong survival. In a subset of patients with limited lung metastases we hypothesized that Cyberknife Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy may improve treatments outcome. Material(s) and Method(s): Between February 2007 and December2011, 68 patients, 24 female, 44 male, median age of 69 years (range 32-87 years) with 91 pathologically proven pulmonary metastases not amenable to surgery, (colorectal 36, lung 20, kidney 12, breast 8, parothyd 9, bladder 2, pancreas 2, endometrium 1 and melanoma 1) with a median gross tumor volume of 31 cc (range 3.55-240.06 cc) were referred to our Radiotherapy Department for Cyberknife stereotactic radiotherapy treatment. 1-3gold fiducials (24 patients) were used as markers implanted, except for pts who were eligible for fiducialless Xsight Lung option. Treatment consisted of 48-54 Gy in 3 to 4 fractions for patients with centrally located lesions, and 23-30 Gy single fraction for peripheral lesions. Patients were followed with CT and PET scan to detect disease Local recurrence was defined as an increase in size of tumor following treatment as most tumors shrunk following radiation. Median follow-up was 20 months (range, 4-71months). Result(s): The Kaplan-Meier local control rate (LC) at 1, 2 and 3 years was 95.1%, 90.7%, and 86.9%; overall survival (OS) at 1, 2 and 3 years of 84.6%, 71.2% and 71.2%; disease free Survival (DFS) at 1, 2 and 3 years 63.5%, 48.7% and 40.2% respectively. The overall toxicity was very mild, with the majority of patients without any clinical side effect that did not interfere with their activities of daily living with the exception of fatigue which was experienced by many of them. In one patients with concomitant infection we observed a grade 3 acute pneumonitis, one patients developed significant thoracic pain related to high radiation dose received by the peripheral nerve. Conclusion(s): Cyberknife stereotactic radiotherapy, in patients with pulmonary metastases has been shown to be a promising treatment with high local control and low toxicity profile. Additionally follow up is needed to investigate the optimal radiation dose and overall treatment efficacy.

Method(s): Nimotuzumab (100. mg, 200. mg and 400. mg) was administered weekly from week 1 to week 8 with palliative radiotherapy (30-36. Gy, 3. Gy/day). If tumor control was achieved, nimotuzumab was continued every 2 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Serial skin biopsies were collected for pharmacodynamic assessment. Result(s): Fifteen patients were enrolled in the study, with cohorts of five patients assigned in each dose level of nimotuzumab. Patients and disease characteristics included median age 73 years; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (PS) 0-1/2 (n=3/12); female sex (n=2); adenocarcinoma (n=5); never-smoker status (n=2); and stages IIB/IIIB/IV (n=1/8/6). All patients were unable to tolerate radical therapy because of old age or multiple comorbidities. The most commonly reported adverse events were lymphopenia and asthenia (grades 1-2 in most patients). No skin rash or allergic toxicities appeared. Dose-limiting toxicity occurred with pneumonia with grade 4 neutropenia at the 200. mg dose of nimotuzumab.

DARCA (AlluraXperSwing TM, Philips, the Netherlands) involves a pre-set rotation of the C-arm around the patient and allows for the visualization of each coronary artery in different views, using a single automatic pump contrast injection., METHODS: From November 2012 to February 2013, 201 patients were randomly assigned to either CCA (n = 100) or DARCA (n = 101). Exclusion criteria included acute coronary syndrome (ACS), prior PCI or CABG. CCAs were performed in 4 acquisition runs for the left coronary artery and 2 to 3 acquisition runs for the right coronary artery, whereas DARCAs were performed in a single run for each coronary artery., RESULTS: Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics were similar for both groups. The overall prevalence of CAD was 77.6%. The DARCA group had a significant reduction in the amount of contrast, 60 ml (IQR: 52.5-71.5 ml) versus 76 ml (IQR: 68-87 ml), P < 0.0001; and radiation dose by Air Kerma, 269.5 mGy (IQR: 176-450.5) versus 542.1 mGy (IQR: 370.7-720.8), P < 0.0001. There were fewer patients requiring additional projections in the DARCA group: 54.0% versus 75.0%; P = 0.002., CONCLUSIONS: In a population with a high prevalence of CAD, DARCA was safe and resulted in a significant decrease in contrast volume and radiation dose.

1248,"Mechanisms for discomfort glare in central vision PURPOSE: The presence of a bright light source in the visual field can generate visual discomfort. Based on empirical observations we can predict to a reasonable degree of accuracy how uncomfortable a given lighting installation is likely to be; yet very little is known about the mechanism or physiological underpinnings that lead to visual discomfort. This study attempts to elucidate some of the underlying mechanisms by controlling the amount of light reaching the retina and by varying photometric properties of the glare source., METHODS: The participants were required to view a source of light presented against a simulated residential street background in the form of uniform flashes of light of varying intensity. Discomfort-glare thresholds were estimated using a staircase procedure; the dependent variable was retinal illuminance. The size of the glare source and the luminance of the surrounding background were varied systematically., RESULTS: Across glare-source sizes or background luminances the discomfort-glare threshold varied less in terms of retinal illuminance than it did in terms of pupil-plane illuminance or light flux. A two-stage model based on saturation of photoreceptors followed by summation of an edge response signal that defines the edges of the glare-source accurately predicted the data., CONCLUSIONS: Discomfort glare in central vision is more closely associated with the spatial properties of the glare source, such as contrast-defined edges, than the overall amount of light entering the eye. The results suggest that discomfort glare in lighting installations could be reduced while maintaining adequate illuminance levels by an appropriate choice of illuminant source size.

We have also compared the reliability, accuracy, and precision of camera-based IGRT with results of weekly portal image verification and weekly CBCT volumetric matching. Materials/Methods: One-hundred forty patients, 102 breast only, 23 breast + nodal, and 15 chest wall + nodal, were accrued in an IRB-approved clinical trial of IGRT using 3D/4D optical images at daily setup and beamon time. Breast board and vacuum bag were used for all patients. Eleven patients with left-side diseases were treated under deep inspiration breath hold using ABC device and twenty-two patient using IMRT. Target shifts and rotations relating to CT-based planned reference surface were determined with real-time optical surface images using modified iterativeclosest-point alignment. A selected light ray intersecting the middle-upper abdominal surface and the anterior surface of the target projected onto the principal components were used as the real-time point/marker-based and surface/volume-based motion tracking, respectively. The optical guidance and real-time respiratory motion tracking were completely performed by therapists and results were semi-automatically saved in the camera-control computer. The target displacements (shifts and rotations) were compared with results of the weekly CBCT and portal images from EPID. Motion curves of surface Intersection point and surface principal components were also compared with breathing volume curves from the ABC system. Result(s): Daily target setup errors were reduced from 0.9 cm to <0.4 cm by using the 3D/4D video surface-guidance that was always consistent with results of portal images and CBCT if there were no big body motion during CBCT scanning. Higher accuracy and precision of 0.2 cm and longer stability without hardware change for clinical usage in four years were achieved for the video camera operated at the imaging speed and tracking rate of 15 frames per second. The novel intersection point and surface motion trackings were also more sensitive and accurate than that of commercial RPM and ABC systems. UP to 2 cm body sag on the slant breast board during longer IMRT treatments and surface deformation for five large breasts and some patients undertaken deep breath hold irradiation were detected. Conclusion(s): Accurate and precise optical image-guided setup of breast and chest wall targets was clinically validated with thousands of portal images and CBCT scans on 140 patients. More importantly, one can reliably track irregular target motion during daily dose delivery and detect gross target deformation during the entire course of treatment. The video guidance provides us all-time IGRT of breast and chest wall cancer without large volume low dose irradiation in taking daily CBCT and/or portal images.",Excluded
1419,"An investigation into the effect of electrode placement of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) on experimentally induced ischemic pain in healthy human participants INTRODUCTION: It is claimed that transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) operates via a segmental mechanism by reducing ongoing transmission and sensitization of nociceptive dorsal horn neurons. Hence, TENS electrodes are usually placed at the site of pain., OBJECTIVE: This study compared TENS administered at the site of experimentally induced ischemic pain (ipsilateral forearm) with TENS administered at a location not related to pain (contralateral lower leg)., METHODS: Ten healthy, pain free volunteers took part in a cross-over study during which ischemic pain was induced in the nondominant arm using a modified version of submaximal effort tourniquet technique. Pain intensity was taken at 1-minute interval/s for 5 minutes while receiving TENS either at the ipsilateral arm or contralateral leg., RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in pain intensity or McGill Pain Questionnaire ratings between TENS given at the arm compared with the leg., DISCUSSION: Taken at face value, the findings suggest that TENS effects were nonspecific and that electrode location does not affect outcome. However, this study should be seen as a call for further research rather than a definitive conclusion.",Excluded

The authors report data concerning the safety, effectiveness, and patterns of failure obtained in a Phase I/II study of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for spinal metastatic tumors. Methods. Sixty-three cancer patients underwent near-simultaneous computed tomography-guided SBRT. Spinal magnetic resonance imaging was conducted at baseline and at each follow-up visit. The National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria 2.0 assessments were used to evaluate toxicity. Results. The median tumor volume of 74 spinal metastatic lesions was 37.4 cm3 (range 1.6-358 cm3). No neuropathy or myelopathy was observed during a median follow-up period of 21.3 months (range 0.9-49.6 months). The actuarial 1-year tumor progression-free incidence was 84% for all tumors. Pattern-of-failure analysis showed two primary mechanisms of failure: 1) recurrence in the bone adjacent to the site of previous treatment, and 2) recurrence in the epidural space adjacent to the spinal cord. Grade 3 or 4 toxicities were limited to acute Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea (one case); Grade 3 dysphagia and trismus (one case); and Grade 3 noncardiac chest pain (one case). There was no subacute or late Grade 3 or 4 toxicity. Conclusions. Analysis of the data obtained in the present study supports the safety and effectiveness of SBRT in cases of spinal metastatic cancer. The authors consider it prudent to routinely treat the pedicles and posterior elements using a wide bone margin posterior to the diseased vertebrae because of the possible direct extension into these structures. For patients without a history of radiotherapy, more liberal spinal cord dose constraints than those used in this study could be applied to help reduce failures in the epidural space.",Excluded
2200,"Aldehyde dehydrogenase, a therapeutic target in chordoma: Analysis in 3d cellular models Chordomas are rare, slow-growing tumors of the axial skeleton. These tumors are locally aggressive and refractory to conventional therapies. Radical surgery and radiation remain the first-line treatments. Despite these aggressive treatments, chordomas often recur and second-line treatment options are limited. The mechanisms underlying chordoma radioresistance remain unknown, although several radioresistant cancer cells have been shown to respond favorably to aldehyde de-hydrogenase (ALDH) inhibition. The study of chordoma has been delayed by small patient cohorts and few available models due to the scarcity of these tumors. We thus created cellular 3D models of chordoma by using low-adherence culture systems. Then, we evaluated their radiosensitivity using colony-forming and spheroid size assays. Finally, we determined whether pharmacologically inhibiting ALDH increased their radiosensitivity. We found that 3D cellular models of chordoma (derived from primary, relapse, and metastatic tumors) reproduce the histological and gene expression features of the disease. The metastatic, relapse, and primary spheroids displayed high, me-dium, and low radioresistance, respectively. Moreover, inhibiting ALDH decreased the radiore-sistance in all three models.Copyright © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Excluded
1933,"Staying in bed to benefit ESA's astronauts and Europe's citizens Since Yuri Gagarin's historic first flight into space in April 1961, it has quickly become evident that the space environment influences the human body in many different ways and causes it to adapt in ways that can lead to problems when returning to Earth's gravity. Much research has been performed in the meantime and our understanding of what happens to our bodies in space improved considerably during the Mir space station and Space Shuttle/Spacelab era. However, many questions, particularly regarding how to counteract those changes that we now know take place, still need to be addressed through studies on the International Space Station (ISS) and through simulations on the ground. As we enter an era in which crews will spend longer periods in space on the ISS and of longer term plans by almost every space-faring nation for missions to Mars, it is clear that much more knowledge is needed, and quickly. Although a few hundred men and women have already travelled into space, the operating environment severely limits the amount of systematic research that can be performed--a situation that is unlikely to change. Other avenues for addressing specific scientific questions in a controlled research environment must therefore be found. One of these complementary alternatives is head-down-tilt bed-rest studies in which volunteers are confined to beds that are tilted -6 deg below the horizontal at the head end. Every activity, including eating, reading, showering, etc., is performed in this position for the duration of the study. This leads to changes in the human body that are very similar to those seen during spaceflight, such as bone-mass and muscle-mass loss, cardiovascular and neuro-sensory deconditioning. The controlled bed-rest setting therefore allows meaningful research into the bodily consequences of spaceflight and possible countermeasures. It also gives the scientific community interested in space-related medical research more ready access to a clinical model. The benefits of these studies go far beyond their space application. Patients bed-ridden because of illness or accidents suffer the same symptoms and can thus also profit from the studies. As a clear indication of this link, the clinicians and researchers involved in the bed-rest campaigns typically spend the majority of their time exploring ""terrestrial"" problems.",Excluded

Some patients had surgery before pelvic radiotherapy and some received chemotherapy. A total of 246 Patients were randomized between a placebo and either of two regiments of double strain Bifilact probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus LAC-361 and Bifidobacterium longum BB-536): a standard dose twice a day (1.3 billion CFU) or a high dose three times a day (10 billion CFU). Patients were trained to record their digestive symptoms daily with a standardized scale and they met a registered dietician and radiation oncologist every week during treatment. The main analysis compared time to first appearance of grade >=2-3-4 diarrhea using Kaplan-Meier curves as measured by proportion of patients without moderate and severe diarrhea. Result(s): 229 patients were analyzed. The difference between the groups for overall grade 2-3-4 diarrhea was not statistically significant (p=0.13). However at 60 days, the proportion of patients without moderate and severe diarrhea in the standard dose group (35%) was more than twice as high as that of the placebo group (17%) with a hazard ratio of 0.69 (p=0.04). In patients who had surgery, the standard probiotics dose group had a better proportion of patients without very severe diarrhea than the placebo group, respectively 97% and 74% (p=0.03). In all groups, the average number of bowel movements per day during treatment was less than 3 soft stools (p=0.80) and the median abdominal pain less than 1 based on the National Cancer Institute scale (p=0.23). Conclusion(s): Standard dose of Bifilact may reduce radiation induced grade 2-3-4 diarrhea at the end of the treatment of patients with pelvic cancer. In patients operated on before RT, a standard dose of probiotics may reduce radiation induced grade 4 diarrhea. Nutritional interventions by a registered dietician seemed to reduce global digestive symptoms. Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov.

1761,"Molecular and cellular profiling of acute responses to total body radiation exposure in ovariectomized female cynomolgus macaques Purpose: The threat of radiation exposure requires a mechanistic understanding of radiation-induced immune injury and recovery. The study objective was to evaluate responses to ionizing radiation in ovariectomized (surgically post-menopausal) female cynomolgus macaques. Material(s) and Method(s): Animals received a single total-body irradiation (TBI) exposure at doses of 0, 2 or 5 Gy with scheduled necropsies at 5 days, 8 weeks and 24 weeks post-exposure. Blood and lymphoid tissues were evaluated for morphologic, cellular, and molecular responses. Result(s): Irradiated animals developed symptoms of acute hematopoietic syndrome, and reductions in thymus weight, thymopoiesis, and bone marrow cellularity. Acute, transient increases in plasma monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1) were observed in 5 Gy animals along with dose-dependent alterations in messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) signatures in thymus, spleen, and lymph node. Expression of T cell markers was lower in thymus and spleen, while expression of macrophage marker CD68 (cluster of differentiation 68) was relatively elevated in lymphoid tissues from irradiated animals. Conclusion(s): Ovariectomized female macaques exposed to moderate doses of radiation experienced increased morbidity, including acute, dose-dependent alterations in systemic and tissue-specific biomarkers, and increased macrophage/T cell ratios. The effects on mortality exceeded expectations based on previous studies in males, warranting further investigation.Copyright © 2015 Informa UK, Ltd.",Excluded

Dose-effect curves for the quantal responses of moist desquamation (early epithelial response) and dermal necrosis (late response) were fitted by probit analysis and ED50 values obtained. For a neutron fractionation scheme comprised of 12 fractions in 26 days, and using an unfiltered beam, the ED50 values for moist desquamation and dermal necrosis were 18.67 +/- 2.22 and 22.25 +/- 0.48 Gy, respectively, whereas in the case of the filtered beam, the corresponding ED50 values were 24.78 +/- 1.44 and 23.30 +/- 0.47 Gy. In order to provide a comparison, the values for 24 fractions of 60Co gamma-rays given in 39 days (a clinical protocol used in the Groote Schuur Hospital) were 74.02 +/- 2.92 and 66.72 +/- 1.93 Gy for moist desquamation and dermal necrosis, respectively. For the unfiltered beam, values for the comparative biological effectiveness (CBE) were 3.96 and 3.00 for the early and late skin response, respectively. The corresponding CBE values were for the filtered beam 2.99 and 2.86. These results for the Faure neutron therapy facility can be extrapolated to the human situation with a high degree of confidence, so that the neutron dose which would yield acceptable skin damage in patients may be determined using the data presented here.",Included

The length of visual retention was most dependent on tumour thickness, tumour location with respect to the optic nerve, fovea, or ciliary body, and patient age. In addition to these factors, the retention of 6/12 visual acuity and the time to 6/120 visual acuity were dependent on the preoperative visual acuity. The risk of visual loss was greatest immediately after treatment and decreased with time. The 5 year actuarial metastatic rate was approximately 13%. Patients at the greatest risk of post-radiation visual loss had significantly greater risk of tumour related mortality., CONCLUSIONS: Some patients who would have been eligible for randomisation to either enucleation or radioactive plaque therapy can be irradiated with retention of excellent vision.",Excluded
2088,"Intensity-modulated radiotherapy for locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: a dose-escalation planning study PURPOSE: To evaluate the potential for dose escalation with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in positron emission tomography-based radiotherapy planning for locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: For 35 LA-NSCLC patients, three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy and IMRT plans were made to a prescription dose (PD) of 66 Gy in 2-Gy fractions. Dose escalation was performed toward the maximal PD using secondary endpoint constraints for the lung, spinal cord, and heart, with de-escalation according to defined esophageal tolerance. Dose calculation was performed using the Eclipse pencil beam algorithm, and all plans were recalculated using a collapsed cone algorithm. The normal tissue complication probabilities were calculated for the lung (Grade 2 pneumonitis) and esophagus (acute toxicity, grade 2 or greater, and late toxicity)., RESULTS: IMRT resulted in statistically significant decreases in the mean lung (p <.0001) and maximal spinal cord (p = .002 and 0005) doses, allowing an average increase in the PD of 8.6-14.2 Gy (p <=.0001). This advantage was lost after de-escalation within the defined esophageal dose limits. The lung normal tissue complication probabilities were significantly lower for IMRT (p <.0001), even after dose escalation. For esophageal toxicity, IMRT significantly decreased the acute NTCP values at the low dose levels (p = .0009 and p <.0001). After maximal dose escalation, late esophageal tolerance became critical (p <.0001), especially when using IMRT, owing to the parallel increases in the esophageal dose and PD., CONCLUSION: In LA-NSCLC, IMRT offers the potential to significantly escalate the PD, dependent on the lung and spinal cord tolerance. However, parallel increases in the esophageal dose abolished the advantage, even when using collapsed cone algorithms. This is important to consider in the context of concomitant chemoradiotherapy schedules using IMRT. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1852,"Femoral artery dopplerfluxometry of adult healthy dogs (canis lupus familiaris) Background: In Veterinary Medicine, there are several methods for early and accurate assessment of blood flow dynamics. The Dopplerfluxometry can access the peak systolic velocity, mean velocity and end diastolic velocity, including Resistive Index and Pulsatility Index. Normal values of Dopplerfluxometry in healthy dogs allow the identification of vascular abnormalities and authors' knowledge there are no reference regarding the values of Dopplerfluxometry of the femoral artery in healthy dogs. The aim of the study was to assess the femoral Dopplerfluxometry of adult healthy dogs by Resistive Index, Pulsatility Index, systolic and diastolic velocities, and femoral artery diameter. Materials, Methods & Results: Eighteen healthy intact beagle dogs, male and female, aging from 2 to 4 years old (mean +/- SD: mean 3 +/- 0.8 years), weighing from 10.1-17.9 kg [22.3-39.5 lb] [mean +/- SD: 14.3 +/- 2.7 kg (31.5 +/- 5.96 lb)] were used. The dogs underwent to physical examination, complete blood cell count, serum biochemistry examination urinalysis, and radiographs examination, muscular and cardiac evaluation. Females had to be in anestrous. All dogs were submitted to right femoral artery Dopplerfluxometry. The dogs were positioned in dorsal recumbency by one person without any chemical restraint. A high definition ultrasound device equipped with a 3 - 13 MHz multi-frequency linear transducer was used. The right femoral artery was identified with the transducer positioned transversely on the right triangle femoral area. Peak systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity was measured. The Resistivity Index and Pulsatility Index were calculated automatically by the ultrasound machine software. Three measurements were obtained with the Doppler spectrum. The values of peak systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity, Resistivity Index, Pulsatility Index and femoral artery diameter were expressed as Mean +/- Standard Deviation (SD). Discussion(s): No studies regarding to femoral artery Dopplerfluxometry in healthy dogs were found in the literature. These results can be used as normal reference values of Dopplerfluxometric parameters for adult dogs. The literature cited only Dopplerfluxometric values of renal arteries, abdominal aorta and of the internal thoracic artery. The normal values of arterial Dopplerfluxometry is necessary to identify the spectral quantitative characteristics of the blood flow for diagnosis and prognosis of vascular diseases. Authors referred to changes in blood perfusion by Dopplerfluxometry examination, but no changes in B-mode ultrasonography. The femoral Resistivity Index values can be used to correlate the postoperative evolution in dogs submitted to femoral bone, hip and knee surgeries, since Dopplerfluxometry allows blood flow assessment in the femoral region muscles. Changes in the heart rate, blood pressure, stress, exercise, and diseases as hypotension, renal lesion, hepatic diseases, diabetes, hyperadrenocorticism can change the Dopplerfluxometric parameters. All dogs which used in this study were clinically healthy, and were used beagle dogs due to lowest variations within breed. Sedation was avoid due to possible changes in Dopplerfluxometric parameters since the use of sedation or tranquilization in animals is strongly discussed due to possible hemodynamic changes that may occur during the examination. In conclusion, the mean values of the right femoral artery Dopplerfluxometry in male and female adult healthy dogs is Resistivity Index (0.887); Pulsatility Index (1.599); peak systolic velocity (124.41 cm/s), end-diastolic velocity (14.12 cm/s), femoral artery diameter (3.9 mm).Copyright © 2018 Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul.

1361,"Flipping a Switch ""Down"" When Not Aligned with the Gravitational Vertical INTRODUCTION: To flip a switch ""down,"" our motor system can normally rely on concordant visual, gravitational, and egocentric cues about the vertical. However, divers must sometimes perform this task while visual cues are limited and gravitational cues are misaligned with egocentric cues. Astronauts must also flip switches ""down"" in absence of gravitational cues. Our study evaluates this ability using a laboratory simulation., METHODS: The subjects were 24 healthy volunteers who were blindfolded, tilted into different angles of roll, and asked to silence an alarm by flipping a switch ""down."" The switch was constructed such that it could be flipped in any direction in the subjects' frontal plane., RESULTS: Two subjects deflected the switch in accordance with the direction of gravity, irrespective of their body orientation. Twenty subjects deflected it in accordance with their body orientation, irrespective of the direction of gravity. The remaining two persons could not be classified unequivocally. Notably, some egocentric responders deflected the rod consistently toward their feet, but others deflected it consistently toward other parts of their body., DISCUSSION: Since our findings disagree with perceptual studies where gravitational rather than egocentric cues predominated in the absence of vision, we posit that perception and action may access distinct internal representations of the vertical. On the practical side, our findings indicate that designers of spaceflight and underwater equipment should not rely on divers' intuitive knowledge on how to flip a switch ""down."" Bock O, Bury N.

2046,"Preservation of laryngeal functions in surgical treatment of pyriform sinus carcinoma Conclusion: The tumor's grade, rather than the tumor's location, was related to the opportunity of preserving laryngeal functions in patients with pyriform sinus cancer. The survival rate decreased significantly with the increase of tumor grade or node grade. Preservation of laryngeal functions is a safe and promising method without compromising the survival rate of patients with pyriform sinus cancer. Objective(s): Surgical resection of pyriform sinus carcinoma has a profound influence on the preservation of laryngeal functions. The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of the surgical treatment of pyriform sinus carcinoma in the preservation of laryngeal functions without compromising the survival rate. Method(s): Two hundred and thirty patients with pyriform sinus cancer had been operated from March 1978 to December 2002. Of them, 158 cases had been operated with the preservation of laryngeal functions and 72 cases had been undergone total laryngectomy. In addition, 216 cases had received adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy. All cases were followed up for 6-12 months (mean 51 +/- 26) after surgery. The survival rate was calculated on the basis of Kaplan-Meier analysis, and the factors that influenced the survival rate of patients with and without preservation of laryngeal functions were analyzed with the log-rank test. Result(s): Laryngeal functions were preserved completely (speech, respiration, and deglutition) in 70.9% (112/158) cases, and partially (speech and deglutition) in 29.1% (46/158) cases. The 3- and 5-year survival rates were 75.4% and 59.0%, respectively, for the group with laryngeal function preservation, and 58.6% and 41.5%, respectively, for the group without preservation. There was no statistically significant difference in the survival rate between the two groups within the follow-up period (p > 0.05). Increase in the tumor grade resulted in a proportional decrease of patients with preservation of laryngeal function (p < 0.05). Increase in the tumor grade (p < 0.05) or node grade (p < 0.05) also led to significant decrease in the survival rate. The location of the primary lesions (the lateral wall or medial wall of the pyriform sinus) showed no significant influence on either the opportunity for preserving laryngeal functions (p > 0.05) or survival rate of patients (p > 0.05). © 2011 Informa Healthcare.",Excluded
1918,"Pre-operative versus post-operative radiosurgery of brain metastases-Volumetric and dosimetric impact of treatment sequence and margin concept Background: Pre-operative radiosurgery (SRS) preceding the resection of brain metastases promises to circumvent limitations of post-operative cavity SRS. It minimizes uncertainties regarding delineation and safety margins and could reduce dose exposure of the healthy brain (HB). Method(s): We performed a systematic treatment plan comparison on 24 patients who received post-operative radiosurgery of the resection cavity at our institution. Comparative treatment plans were calculated for hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (7 x 5 Gray (Gy)) in a hypothetical pre-operative (pre-op) and two post-operative scenarios, either with (extended field, post-op-E) or without the surgical tract (involved field, post-op-I). Detailed volumetric comparison of the resulting target volumes was performed, as well as dosimetric comparison focusing on targets and the HB. Result(s): The resection cavity was significantly smaller and different in morphology from the pre-operative lesion, yielding a low Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 53% (p = 0.019). Post-op-I and post-op-E targets showed high similarity (DSC = 93%), and including the surgical tract moderately enlarged resulting median target size (18.58 ccm vs. 22.89 ccm, p < 0.001). Dosimetric analysis favored the pre-operative treatment setting since it significantly decreased relevant dose exposure of the HB (Median volume receiving 28 Gy: 6.79 vs. 10.79 for pre-op vs. post-op-E, p < 0.001). Dosimetrically, pre-operative SRS is a promising alternative to post-operative cavity irradiation that could furthermore offer practical benefits regarding delineation and treatment planning. Comparative trials are required to evaluate potential clinical advantages of this approach.Copyright © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Excluded

PSD measurement (PSDFilm) was obtained by placing XR-RV3 Gafchromic under the patient's back for each procedure. PSD (PSDem.dose) was computed with the software em.dose©. The calculation was performed on the dose metrics collected from the private dose report of each procedure. Two calculation methods (method A: fluoroscopic kerma equally spread on cine acquisition and B: fluoroscopic kerma is added to one air Kerma cine acquisition that contributes to the PSD) were used to calculate the fluoroscopic dose contribution as fluoroscopic data were not recorded in our interventional room. Statistical analyses were carried out to compare PSDFilm and PSDem.dose., RESULTS: The PSDFilm median (1st quartile; 3rd quartile) was 0.251(0.190;0.336)Gy for CA-PTCA and 1.453(0.767;2.011)Gy for CTO. For method-A, the PSDem.dose was 0.248(0.182;0.369)Gy for CA-PTCA and 1.601(0.892;2.178)Gy for CTO, and 0.267(0.223;0.446)Gy and 1.75 (0.912;2.584)Gy for method-B, respectively. For the two methods, the correlation between PSDFilm and PSDem.dose was strong. For all cardiology procedures investigated, the mean deviation between PSDFilm and PSDem.dose was 3.4+/-21.1% for method-A and 17.3%+/-23.9% for method-B., CONCLUSION: The dose mapping software is convenient to calculate peak skin dose in interventional cardiology.

1920,"Time trend of patient setup deviations during pelvic irradiation using electronic portal imaging An electronic portal imaging device (EPID) was used to detect patient setup displacement during the course of a 3-field pelvic irradiation of two groups of patients: 10 rectal and 10 prostate carcinomas. These patients were irradiated with conventional treatment techniques in routine clinical practice. A total of 469 portal images and 60 simulator films were used to determine the values of setup deviations in the X- Y- and Z-directions of a fixed coordinate system, corresponding to the medio-lateral, cranio-caudal and antero-posterior direction, respectively. The absolute displacement averaged over all setups and patients ranged between 0.4 mm and 1.4 mm with a standard deviation (S.D.) of 1.6-3.9 mm. The overall distribution along each direction could be separated into a distribution of random deviations (S.D.s ranging from 1.2 to 2.8 mm) around the mean deviation of each patient and a distribution of the means themselves: the distribution of systematic deviations (S.D.s ranging from 1.0 to 2.6 mm). Significant gradual displacement as a function of time was detected in 5 out of the 20 patients, 2 in the rectum and 3 in the prostate group. This ""time trend"" was found along each of the 3 directions specified. The magnitude of the time-dependent displacement throughout the course of treatment ranged between 4 and 11 mm.

1436,"DNA-protein crosslinks as a biomarker of exposure to solar radiation: a preliminary study in brick-kiln workers In India, fired clay bricks are produced in small-scale factories. There are 60, 000 active brick kilns, providing employment to nearly 12 million people in different suboccupations. This industry is largely non-mechanized and operates from November to June. Almost all the workers are exposed to direct sunlight for 8-10 h a day. Cellular DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) are the biologically active nucleoprotein complexes formed between DNA and proteins. Ultraviolet light and gamma-rays, and other suspected carcinogens in humans, induce DPC formation in blood cells. DPCs have therefore been identified as a biomarker for monitoring exposure to these hazardous agents. Here we report steady-state levels of DPCs in human peripheral lymphocytes from 46 brick-kiln workers exposed occupationally for 8-10 h a day to solar radiation in brickfields and 25 unexposed controls. A significant increase (p <0.05) in DPC content and DPC coefficients in peripheral lymphocytes was observed in the brick-kiln workers compared with the controls.

2167,"Correlation of bone mineral density with skeletal muscle content and physical activity BACKGROUND: Bone mineral density is the most important indicator for bone level. Osteoporosis is a worldwide problem, and there is no safe and effective radical treatment. It can only be prevented, so bone mineral density arise more attention. OBJECTIVE(S): To explore the relationship between skeletal muscle content, physical activity level and bone mineral density in older adults, so as to provide theoretical basis for preventing osteoporosis treatment. METHOD(S): Totally 111 subjects aged 40 to 84 years were recruited randomly. The bone mineral density was measured by double energy X-Ray bone density meter, and the human skeletal muscle content, fat content and percentage of skeletal muscle were measured by human body component analyzer. The variance analysis was used for multiple group comparisons in different age groups, LSD method for comparisons between groups, and Pearson correlation analysis for correlation analysis. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION(S): Bone mineral density was significantly related to the physical activity, body mass, and skeletal muscle content (r=0.30, 0.41, and 0.45, P < 0.01). For middle and older adults, skeletal muscle content, physical activity level and body mass were positively related to bone mineral density. Age and bone mineral density had a negative relationship. These results indicate that physical activity is an important factor affecting bone density, and higher level of physical activity is beneficial to maintain and improve bone mineral density. Increasing muscle mass and improving body composition can improve bone mineral density.Copyright © 2018, Journal of Clinical Rehabilitative Tissue Engineering Research. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2280,"Low-dose CT with automatic tube current modulation, adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction, and low tube voltage for the diagnosis of renal colic: Impact of body mass index OBJECTIVE. The objective of our study was to evaluate the impact of body mass index (BMI) on dose, diagnostic performance, and image quality of a low-dose CT examination for renal colic. MATERIALS AND METHODS. This retrospective study included all patients who underwent a low-dose CT examination for renal colic performed during the year 2012 with automatic tube current modulation, adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction, and a low tube voltage (kV). Three readers independently reviewed all images for the presence of renal colic and evaluated diagnostic confidence and image quality. The results and doses were compared among patients grouped by body mass index (BMI) and between patients with a BMI < 25 and those with a BMI >= 25. RESULTS. Eighty-six patients were included in the study: 39 patients had a BMI < 25 and 47 had a BMI >= 25. No statistically significant difference was found between the accuracy rates for the diagnosis of renal colic when the rates of the three independent readers were averaged for both BMI groups (95.7% vs 96.4%, respectively; p = 0.83). Image quality and diagnostic confidence scores were significantly better for patients with a BMI >= 25 than for patients with a BMI < 25 (mean image quality score, 3.7 vs 3.4, p < 0.001; mean diagnostic confidence score, 2.8 vs 2.5, p < 0.001). The mean radiation dose for patients with a BMI < 25 was 2.4 mGy compared with 3.7 mGy for patients with a BMI >= 25 ( p < 0.001). CONCLUSION. The diagnostic performance of our low-dose CT protocol for renal colic was excellent for all patients, and image quality and diagnostic confidence were significantly better for patients with a BMI >= 25. However, our protocol also required exposure to a greater dose of radiation for these overweight and obese patients. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded
2436,"Impact of Vessel Suppressed-CT on Diagnostic Accuracy in Detection of Pulmonary Metastasis and Reading Time Rationale and Objectives: To assess if vessel suppression (VS) improves nodule detection rate, interreader agreement, and reduces reading time in oncologic chest computed tomography (CT). Material(s) and Method(s): One-hundred consecutive oncologic patients (65 male; median age 60y) who underwent contrast-enhanced chest CT were retrospectively included. For all exams, additional VS series (ClearRead CT, Riverrain Technologies, Miamisburg) were reconstructed. Two groups of three radiologists each with matched experience were defined. Each group evaluated the SD-CT as well as VS-CT. Each reader marked the presence, size, and position of pulmonary nodules and documented reading time. In addition, for the VS-CT the presence of false positive nodules had to be stated. Cohen's Kappa (k) was used to calculate the interreader-agreement between groups. Reading time was compared using paired t test. Result(s): Nodule detection rate was significantly higher in VS-CT compared to the SD-CT (+21%; p <0.001). Interreader-agreement was higher in the VS-CT (k = 0.431, moderate agreement) compared to SD-CT (k = 0.209, fair agreement). Almost all VS-CT series had false positive findings (97-99 out of 100). Average reading time was significantly shorter in the VS-CT compared to the SD-CT (154 +/- 134vs. 194 +/- 126; 21%, p<0.001). Conclusion(s): Vessel suppression increases nodule detection rate, improves interreader agreement, and reduces reading time in chest CT of oncologic patients. Due to false positive results a consensus reading with the SD-CT is essential.Copyright © 2020 The Association of University Radiologists",Excluded
1973,"Independent roles of calcium and voltage-dependent potassium currents in controlling spike frequency adaptation in lateral amygdala pyramidal neurons The calcium-dependent afterhyperpolarization (AHP) that follows trains of action potentials is responsible for controlling action potential firing patterns in many neuronal cell types. We have previously shown that the slow AHP contributes to spike frequency adaptation in pyramidal neurons in the rat lateral amygdala. In addition, a dendritic voltage-gated potassium current mediated by Kv1.2-containing channels also suppresses action potential firing in these neurons. In this paper we show that this voltage-gated potassium current and the slow AHP act together to control spike frequency adaptation in lateral amygdala pyramidal neurons. The two currents have similar effects on action potential number when firing is evoked either by depolarizing current injections or by synaptic stimulation. However, they differ in their control of firing frequency, with the voltage-gated potassium current but not the slow AHP determining the initial frequency of action potential firing. This dual mechanism of controlling firing patterns is unique to lateral amygdala neurons and is likely to contribute to the very low levels of firing seen in lateral amygdala neurons in vivo.",Excluded
1522,"Fragility fracture and osteoarthritis: Interactions between bone mineral and bone mass index Increased BMD and BMI are associate with increased risk of osteoarthritis (OA) and reduced risk of fragility fracture. However, little is known about the relationship between fragility fracture and osteoarthritis. This study sought to examine the interactions between BMD and BMI in the determination of the OA-fracture relationship. The study was part of the on-going Dubbo Osteoporosis Epidemiology Study, which involved 2,412 women and 1,452 men aged between 46-99 years. Baseline BMD was measured at femoral neck (FNBMD) and lumbar spine (LSBMD) by DXA. Osteoarthritis was ascertained by self-report. The incidence of fragility fracture was ascertained by x-ray report. A total 1,077 participants (691 women and 386 men) had reported a diagnosis of OA. Overall, the risk of OA was associated significantly with increased LSBMD in men (odds ratio [OR] 1.34, 95% CI, 1.19-1.52) and women (1.20; 1.09- 1.32). Elevation in FNBMD was significantly associated with increased risk of OA in men (OR 1.16; 1.02-1.32), but not in women. When stratified by BMI, significant association remained between OA risk and high LSBMD amongst women with BMI <25 kg/m2 (OR 1.26; 1.07-1.47) and BMI >30 kg/m2 (1.26; 1.05-1.51); and in men with BMI <25 kg/m2 (OR 1.75; 1.37-2.27) or BMI 25-30 kg/m2 (1.21; 1.02-1.43). OA was associated with an increased risk of fracture. After adjusting for LSBMD, women with OA had significant increased fracture risk (OR 1.41; 1.16-1.72), particularly in those with BMI 25-30 kg/m2 (OR 1.45; 1.05-1.99). However, the association was not significant in men. These data suggest that high BMD is associated with a greater risk of OA in both men and women,especially those with low BMI; and hence, BMD could be a useful measure for identifying individuals at high risk of OA, particularly among those at lower BMI spectrum. Despite having higher bone density, women with self-reported OA,especially those overweight, have an increased risk of fragility fracture, suggesting that the OA-fracture association is mediated via non-BMD factors.",Excluded
1560,"Radiation-induced oscillopsia in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients PURPOSE: To apply a battery of audiovestibular function tests and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate the causes of oscillopsia in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients after irradiation (RT)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Of 300 NPC patients, 12 (4%) developed oscillopsia after RT. The mean accumulated radiation dose to the nasopharynx was 112 +/- 30 Gy. Each patient underwent a battery of audiovestibular function tests, including audiometry and the dynamic illegible E, caloric, and rotational tests., RESULTS: Excluding 3 patients with neck fibrosis who could not perform the head turning movement, the remaining 9 patients displayed 100% abnormal dynamic illegible E test results and 100% abnormal refixation saccades. All 12 patients presented with bilateral hearing loss, caloric reductions, and reduced gains of the vestibular ocular reflex (VOR) on the rotational test, indicating bilateral VOR loss. After excluding tumor relapse and radiation necrosis of the brain by MRI, the oscillopsia in these 12 irradiated NPC patients was attributed to bilateral VOR loss., CONCLUSION: Radiation-induced oscillopsia in our NPC patients was attributed to bilateral VOR loss, possibly as a result of higher radiation doses. Hence, the therapeutic benefits of a second course of RT are associated with the potential risk of oscillopsia after RT.",Excluded

1993,"Lung Cancer Screening with Low-Dose CT: Baseline Screening Results in Shanghai OBJECTIVE: To report the initial baseline lung cancer screening results with low dose computed tomography (LDCT) in a multicenter study in Shanghai., METHODS: A total of 14,506 subjects underwent LDCT lung cancer screening and completed questionnaires consisting of 13 risk factors for lung cancer in the prospective study. The positive result was defined as any size and density nodule. The nodules were classified into calcified, solid, part-solid, and nonsolid nodules. The positive rate and incidental detection rate of lung cancer and stage I lung cancer were calculated. The proportion of lung nodule and lung cancer with different density and size was analyzed., RESULTS: The positive rate and incidental detection rate of lung cancer was 29.89% and 1.23%, respectively. The incidental detection rate of stage I lung cancer was 0.97%. The proportion of lung cancer in lung nodules and stage I in lung cancer was 3.48% and 81.09%, respectively. The ratio of nonsolid nodule, part-solid nodule, and solid nodule in lung cancer was 52.94%, 31.93%, and 15.13%, respectively. 74.88% lung nodules were less than 5 mm and 94.12% lung cancers were larger than 5mm in size., CONCLUSION: The baseline LDCT lung cancer screening showed subsolid nodules accounted for the majority of lung cancer, and 5 mm in size would be recommended as the positive result threshold.

2337,"Long-Term, Prospective Performance of the MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory in ""Low-Intermediate Risk"" Oropharyngeal Carcinoma After Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy PURPOSE: To characterize long-term MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI) results after primary intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPC) among patients with ""low-intermediate risk"" OPC who would be eligible for current trials (eg, ECOG 3311, NRG HN002, CRUK PATHOS)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective pooled analysis combined data from 3 single-institution clinical trials for advanced-stage head and neck carcinoma. Inclusion criteria were clinical stage III/IV OPC (T1-2/N1-2b, T3/N0-2b) treated with definitive split-field IMRT and prospectively collected MDADI at baseline and at least 1 posttreatment interval available in trial databases. Patients were sampled to represent likely human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated disease (HPV+/p16+ or <10 pack-years if HPV/p16 unknown). The MDADI composite scores were collected at baseline and 6, 12, and 24 months after treatment. Pairwise tests were Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons., RESULTS: Forty-six patients were included. All received bilateral neck irradiation with a median dose of 70 Gy and systemic therapy (57% concurrent, 43% induction only). Overall the mean baseline MDADI composite score was 90.1, dropping to 74.6 at 6 months (P<.0001) and rising to 78.5 (P<.0001) and 83.1 (P=.002) by 12 and 24 months relative to baseline, respectively, representing a clinically meaningful drop in MDADI scores at 6 months that partially recovers by 24 months (6 vs 24 months, P=.05). Poor MDADI scores (composite <60) were reported in 4%, 11%, 15%, and 9% of patients at baseline and 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. Fifteen percent of patients had a persistently depressed composite score by at least 20 points at the 24-month interval., CONCLUSION: ""Low-intermediate risk"" patients with OPC treated with laryngeal/esophageal inlet dose-optimized split-field IMRT are highly likely to report recovery of acceptable swallowing function in long-term follow-up. Only 15% report poor swallowing function and/or persistently depressed MDADI at 12 months or more after IMRT. These data serve as a benchmark future trial design and endpoint interpretation.

1714,"Hyperfractionated Accelerated Radiotherapy (HART) for anaplastic thyroid carcinoma: toxicity and survival analysis PURPOSE: Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is one of the most aggressive cancers, and the current protocol of hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy was initiated to improve survival while limiting toxicities., METHODS AND MATERIALS: All patients with ATC from 1991 to 2002 were accrued and received megavoltage radiotherapy from the mastoid processes to the carina up to 60 Gy in twice-daily fractions of 1.8 and 2 Gy, 6 hours apart., RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were accrued with a median age of 69 years, and 55% were women. Debulking was performed in 26%, and total thyroidectomy, in 6%, whereas 68% received radical radiotherapy alone. Local control data were available for 27 patients: 22% had a complete response, 26% had a partial response, 15% showed progressive disease, and 37% showed static disease. Median overall survival for all 31 patients was 70 days (95% confidence interval, 40-99). There was no significant difference in median survival between patients younger (70 days) and older than 70 years (42 days), between men (70 days) and women (49 days), and between patients receiving postoperative radiotherapy (77 days) and radical radiotherapy alone (35 days). Grade III or higher skin erythema was seen in 56% patients; desquamation in 21%; dysphagia in 74%; and esophagitis in 79%., CONCLUSION: The current protocol failed to offer a significant survival benefit, was associated with severe toxicities, and thus was discontinued. There is a suggestion that younger patients with operable disease have longer survival, but this would require a larger study to confirm it.",Excluded
1831,"Gamma Knife radiosurgery for the treatment of intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas Background: Intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulae (DAVF) may present a treatment challenge. Endovascular embolization is in most cases the first line of treatment but does not always achieve cure. Gamma Knife (GK) radiosurgery represents an alternative treatment option, and the purpose of this study was to further evaluate its utility. Method(s): We reviewed all cases of DAVF treated between 2009 and 2016 at our institution with GK radiosurgery independently, or following failed/refused endovascular or surgical management. Patients' clinical files, radiological images, catheter angiograms, and surgical DAVF disconnection reports were retrospectively reviewed. Result(s): Sixteen DAVF (14 patients) treated by GK radiosurgery were identified. Eleven fistulae were aggressive and five were benign. Marginal doses ranged from 15 to 25 Gy. Target volumes ranged from 0.04 to 4.47 cm3. In all symptomatic patients, GK treatment resulted in symptom palliation. In 13/15 lesions, cure of symptoms (86.0%) was reported. One lesion was asymptomatic. Angiographic cure was achieved in eight cases (50%), small residual DAVF occurred in four, and four were unchanged. One patient developed headache that resolved at one year. No hemorrhage occurred during the follow-up period. There was no significant association between Borden type and cure rate. Prior failed endovascular treatment and small target volume were associated with lower rates of cure. Conclusion(s): Stereotactic radiosurgery is viable treatment for DAVF. It is very effective in palliating symptoms as a de novo approach or adjunctive to endovascular therapy. In our experience it is only somewhat effective in achieving complete angiographic cure.Copyright © The Author(s) 2016.",Excluded
2241,"[Assessment of clinical image quality in feline chest radiography with a needle-image plate (NIP) storage phosphor system--an approach to the evaluation of image quality in neonatal radiography] PURPOSE: Is the image quality of thoracic radiographs of cats obtained with a needle-based storage phosphor (NIP) system superior to conventional (PIP) storage phosphor radiography? Is it possible to decrease the mAs by 50 % with the NIP system without significant loss of information?, MATERIALS AND METHODS: From each of the 20 animals, three lateral radiographs were acquired. The assessment of the exposure level was based on the generated lgM-values. Images were acquired 1. with the NIP system and exposure settings equivalent to an lgM of 1.9, 2. with the PIP system and identical settings, and 3. with the NIP system and 50 % of the mAs. Six blinded readers used a 5-step scale to assess the reproducibility of five anatomical structures and image noise sensation. Data were analysed using Visual Grading Characteristics Analysis (VGC)., RESULTS: While applying identical exposure values the NIP system for all features revealed superior ratings to those of the PIP system (AUC (VGC) values ranged from 0.81 for ""cardiac silhouette"" to 0.92 for ""trachea""). Even when reducing mAs by 50 % in the NIP images all features were rated better compared with the PIP images and original settings (AUC (VGC) values ranged from 0.60 for ""cardiac silhouette"" to 0.74 for ""trachea"" and ""caudal thoracic field"")., CONCLUSION: The NIP system demonstrates clearly better image quality compared to the reference PIP system. A dose reduction of 50 % seems to be possible without relevant detraction from image quality. The results obtained in the animal model are valid for simulating conditions in neonatal radiological practise.",Excluded
1701,"Hyperparathyroidism after thyroid surgery and autotransplantation of histologically normal parathyroid glands BACKGROUND: Parathyroid autotransplantation is a well-established method to prevent hypoparathyroidism during parathyroid and thyroid operations. The reported success rate of parathyroid autotransplantation ranges from 75% to 100%. Recurrent hyperparathyroidism may develop after parathyroid autotransplantation, especially after the transplantation of hyperplastic or adenomatous parathyroid tissue. Hyperparathyroidism recurs most frequently after subtotal parathyroidectomy or total parathyroidectomy and autotransplantation, in patients with renal failure and secondary hyperparathyroidism, and in patients with familial primary hyperparathyroidism or MEN I or MEN II syndrome. We report three patients who experienced primary hyperparathyroidism after autotransplantation of normal parathyroid tissue during thyroid operations (two patients) or after a long period of hypoparathyroidism., STUDY DESIGN: We reviewed our records from 1983 to May 1998 and identified three patients in whom hyperparathyroidism developed after thyroid operations., RESULTS: One patient had a thyroidectomy with left modified radical neck dissection for papillary thyroid cancer, followed by radioiodine ablative therapy. Two patients had thyroid operations for benign thyroid disease. One of these patients had a history of radiation exposure for acne, and in the other one secondary hyperparathyroidism arose 6 years after a thyroidectomy for hyperthyroidism., CONCLUSIONS: Our study documents that hyperparathyroidism may develop after autotransplantation of histologically normal parathyroid tissue and after a period of hypoparathyroidism after thyroid operations. For this reason, it is important to mark the site of the parathyroid transplantation.",Excluded
1658,"Dental Long Axes using Digital Dental Models Compared to Cone-Beam Computed Tomography OBJECTIVE: Standard methods of evaluating tooth long axes are not comparable (digital dental models [DDMs], panoramic and cephalometric radiographs) or expose patients to more radiation (cone-beam computed tomography [CBCT]). This study aimed to compare angular changes in tooth long axes using DDMs versus using CBCTs. Settings and sample population Secondary data analysis of DDMs and CBCTs, taken before and after orthodontic treatment with piezocision of 24 patients. METHOD(S): Angular changes in tooth long axes were evaluated using landmarks on first molars (center of the occlusal surface and center of the furcation), canines and incisors (cusp tip and center of the root at the cementoenamel junction). Wilcoxon test, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman plots were used to test intra- and inter-rater agreement and compare DDM and CBCT measurements. RESULT(S): The mesiodistal angulation and buccolingual inclination DDM measurements were reproducible. Overall mean differences between DDM and CBCT measurements of mesiodistal angulation, 1.9degree+/-1.5degree, and buccolingual inclination, 2.2+/-2.2degree, were not significant for all teeth. ICC between DDM and CBCT measurements ranged from good (0.85 molars) to excellent (0.94 canines; 0.96 incisors). The percentages of measurements outside the range of +/-5 were 17.4% for molars, 13.8% for canines, and 4.5% for incisors. CONCLUSION(S): DDM assessment of changes in tooth long axes has good reproducibility and yields comparable measurements to those obtained from CBCT within a 5degree range. These findings lay the groundwork for machine learning approaches that synthesize crown and root canal information towards planning tooth movement without the need for ionizing radiation scans.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

2190,"Comparison of Interlaminar and Transforaminal Approaches for Treatment of L5/S1 Disc Herniation by Percutaneous Endoscopic Discectomy Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the clinical efficacy of percutaneous endoscopic interlaminar discectomy (PEID) and percutaneous endoscopic transforaminal discectomy (PETD) in treating L5/S1 disc herniation. Method(s): A retrospective analysis of 76 patients with L5/S1 intervertebral disc herniation was performed. There were two surgical treatment groups: one with patients receiving PEID and the other with patients receiving PETD. The two groups were compared by length of surgery, times of intraoperative X-ray exposure, postoperative time in bed, length of hospital stay, operative complications, patient's assessment of pain using a visual analogue scale (VAS), and disability using the Oswestry disability index (ODI) before and after surgery. Result(s): Subjects in the PEID group were in surgery for 60.90 +/- 13.11 min and needed intraoperative X-ray exposure 4.10 +/- 1.09 times. Patients in this group were ambulatory by 7.52 +/- 1.08 h after surgery and were hospitalized for 5.05 +/- 0.92 days. In contrast, patients in the PETD group were in surgery for 84.06 +/- 15.58 min and needed intraoperative X ray exposure 12.81 +/- 8.46 times. These patients were ambulatory by 7.06 +/- 0.91 h after surgery and remained in the hospital for 4.94 +/- 0.80 days. Based on these data, operation time and fluoroscopy time were significantly less (P < 0.002 and P < 0.001, respectively) for subjects in the PEID group. However, ambulatory time and hospitalization were similar for both in terms of pain relief and decreased disability, and subjects in both groups responded well to the surgery and showed a significant decrease in both VAS and ODI scores at their 1-year follow-up (P < 0.01). Furthermore, there were no statistically significant differences between the two surgeries in terms of pain relief and decrease in disability. Conclusion(s): For L5/S1 disc herniation, PEID and PETD provide similar results for patients. However, PEID has the advantage over PETD in that it is a shorter procedure and exposes the patient to less radiation. Keywords.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

2437,"Dose reduction and image quality in MDCT colonography using tube current modulation OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to evaluate the dose reduction potential of combined online (x- and y-axes) and topogram-based (l) X-ray tube current modulation in CT colonography in a screening population., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty asymptomatic individuals underwent CT colonography screening for colon polyps. A 16-MDCT scanner (Somatom Sensation 16) was used. Forty patients were examined at 120 kVp and 120 effective mAs (supine) and 40 effective mAs (prone) using online x- and y-axis tube current modulation. Another 40 patients were scanned using combined x-, y-, and z-axis tube current modulation. Individual patient radiation exposure was determined using the dose-length product. Image noise was determined by Hounsfield unit measurements in the colonic lumen at four anatomic levels. Image quality was rated on a 5-point confidence scale by two independent reviewers. The unpaired Student's t test (for radiation dose, image noise) and Wilcoxon's test (for image quality) were used to test for statistically significant differences between these values., RESULTS: Radiation dose was significantly lower in the patient group scanned with x-, y-, and z-axis tube current modulation than in the group scanned with x- and y-axis tube current modulation (supine: 4.24 vs 6.50 mSv, p < 0.0001; prone: 1.61 vs 2.38 mSv, p < 0.0001). Radiation dose was reduced by 35% (supine) and 33% (prone). No statistically significant difference was seen in overall image noise (supine: 15.9 vs 16.3 H, p = 0.13; prone: 23.5 vs 24.8 H, p = 0.44) or image quality (supine: 4.6 vs 4.5, p = 0.62; prone: 3.5 vs 3.6, p = 0.54)., CONCLUSION: Combined x-, y-, and z-axis tube current modulation leads to a significant reduction of radiation exposure in CT colonography without loss of image quality.",Excluded
1389,"Nuclear cardiology practices and radiation exposure in Africa: results from the IAEA Nuclear Cardiology Protocols Study (INCAPS) OBJECTIVE: While nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) offers many benefits to patients with known or suspected cardiovascular disease, concerns exist regarding radiation-associated health effects. Little is known regarding MPI practice in Africa. We sought to characterise radiation doses and the use of MPI best practices that could minimise radiation in African nuclear cardiology laboratories, and compare these to practice worldwide., METHODS: Demographics and clinical characteristics were collected for a consecutive sample of 348 patients from 12 laboratories in six African countries over a one-week period from March to April 2013. Radiation effective dose (ED) was estimated for each patient. A quality index (QI) enumerating adherence to eight best practices, identified a priori by an IAEA expert panel, was calculated for each laboratory. We compared these metrics with those from 7 563 patients from 296 laboratories outside Africa., RESULTS: Median (interquartile range) patient ED in Africa was similar to that of the rest of the world [9.1 (5.1-15.6) vs 10.3 mSv (6.8-12.6), p = 0.14], although a larger proportion of African patients received a low ED, <= 9 mSv targeted in societal recommendations (49.7 vs 38.2%, p < 0.001). Bestpractice adherence was higher among African laboratories (QI score: 6.3 +/- 1.2 vs 5.4 +/- 1.3, p = 0.013). However, median ED varied significantly among African laboratories (range: 2.0-16.3 mSv; p < 0.0001) and QI range was 4-8., CONCLUSION: Patient radiation dose from MPI in Africa was similar to that in the rest of the world, and adherence to best practices was relatively high in African laboratories. Nevertheless there remain opportunities to further reduce radiation exposure to African patients from MPI.",Excluded
1331,"Using a three-dimensional computer assisted stone volume estimates to evaluate extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy treatment of kidney stones This study describes and evaluates the use of non-contrast enhanced computerized tomography (NCCT) before and after extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (SWL). Computer measured stone volume was used as an exact measurement for treatment response. 81 patients received SWL of kidney stones at Herlev Hospital between April 2013 and January 2014 and follow-up was possible in 77 (95 %) patients. NCCT was used before and after treatment. Treatment response was expressed as a reduction of the stone volume. Stone characteristics as the stone volumes, HU, SSD and localization were measured by radiologist using a vendor non-specific computer program. Complications, patient characteristics and additional treatment were registered. On average, 5858 shocks were given each patient. The follow-up NCCT was performed 24 days after treatment. It was possible to calculate the stone volume in 88 % of the patients-the remaining 12 % it was not possible due to stone disintegration. The stone free rate was 22 %. The average relative reduction in stone burden was 62 %. Only 8 % of the patients were radiological non-responders. Steinstrasse was observed in 13 (17 %) and 28 (36 %) patients had additional treatment performed. Irradiation dose per NCCT was 2.6 mSv. Stone volume could be calculated in most patients. The relative reduction in stone burden after treatment was 62 %. The stone volume was redundant when evaluating stone free patients, but in cases of partial response it gave an exact quantification, to be used in the further management and follow-up of the patients.Copyright © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
1907,"Development and validation of a nomogram for prediction of survival and local control in laryngeal carcinoma patients treated with radiotherapy alone: A cohort study based on 994 patients Introduction: To advise laryngeal carcinoma patients on the most appropriate form of treatment, a tool to predict survival and local control is needed. Material(s) and Method(s): We performed a population-based cohort study on 994 laryngeal carcinoma patients, treated with RT from 1977 until 2008. Two nomograms were developed and validated. Performance of the models is expressed as the Area Under the Curve (AUC). Result(s): Unfavorable prognostic factors for overall survival were low hemoglobin level, male sex, high T-status, nodal involvement, older age, lower EQD2T (total radiation dose corrected for fraction dose and overall treatment time), and non-glottic tumor. All factors except tumor location were prognostic for local control. The AUCs were 0.73 for overall survival and 0.67 for local control. External validation of the survival model yielded AUCs of 0.68, 0.74, 0.76 and 0.71 for the Leuven (n = 109), the VU Amsterdam (n = 178), the Manchester (n = 403) and the NKI cohort (n = 205), respectively, while the validation procedure for the local control model resulted in AUCs of 0.70, 0.71, 0.72 and 0.62. The resulting nomograms were made available on the website www.predictcancer.org. Conclusion(s): For patients with a laryngeal carcinoma treated with RT alone, we have developed visual, easy-to-use nomograms for the prediction of overall survival and primary local control. These models have been successfully validated in four external centers. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
