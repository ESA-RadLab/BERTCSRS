3078,"Delayed radiation necrosis of brain evaluated positron emission tomography In four patients highly suspected of having delayed radiation necrosis of the brain, regional cerebral blood flow and metabolism were studied by using positron emission tomography (PET) with the 15O-labelled gases, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG). All four patients showed marked decreases in glucose and oxygen consumption in the lesion with that suspected pathology in comparison with those in normal brain parenchyma. Two of them were histologically proved to have radiation injuries (one was radiation necrosis and another was early delayed reactions). But one patient was histologically proved to have a recurrent tumor. Although metabolic study with PET using 18FDG is generally an excellent procedure for differentiation between radiation injuries and recurrent brain tumor, these results imply that in some cases the differential diagnosis is difficult even with 18FDG. The present study demonstrated considerably more pronounced reduction in the metabolism than the decrease of the blood flow in the lesion with radiation necrosis. This result would indicate that the primary effect causing the radiation necrosis is a direct effect of irradiation on neural tissue rather than the capillary damage.",Excluded
2499,"Benefit of surgery after chemoradiotherapy in stage IIIB (T4 and/or N3) non-small cell lung cancer Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate postchemoradiotherapy surgery in stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer. Method(s): Forty patients with stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer were included in this phase II study. A preoperative diagnosis of stage IIIB cancer was based on mediastinoscopy or a thoracotomy in all patients. Induction treatment included two cycles of cisplatin (100 mg/m2, day 1), 5-fluorouracil (1 g/m2, days 1-3), and vinblastine (4 mg/m2, day 1) combined with 42 Gy of hyperfractionated radiotherapy delivering 21 Gy in two sessions. Patients with a clinical response were offered surgery. Result(s): The minimum follow-up for survivors was 48 months. Thirty patients had a T4 lesion and 18 had N3 disease. Twenty-nine patients (73%) had a clinical objective tumor response after induction treatment. These 29 patients underwent thoracotomy, and a complete resection was performed in 23 (58%). Two postoperative deaths occurred (7%). Four patients had a pathologic complete response at the time of surgery (10%). The 5-year survival is 19% for the overall population. When only patients who had persistent viable tumor cells at surgery are considered (n = 25), the 5-year survival is 28%. The 5-year survival is 42% for patients having no mediastinal lymph node involvement at the time of surgery and being treated with complete resection. Conclusion(s): This study shows that surgery, when feasible, is associated with a 28% long-term survival for patients in whom chemoradiotherapy alone fails to control disease.",Excluded
3683,"CT urography for the diagnosis of medullary sponge kidney Background: Medullary sponge kidney (MSK) is characterized by malformation of the terminal collecting ducts and is associated with an increased risk of nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, urinary tract infections, renal acidification defects, and reduced bone density. It has been historically diagnosed with intravenous pyelography (IVP), which is falling out of favor as an imaging modality. CT urography (CTU) performed with multidetector CT (MDCT) has been shown to create images of the renal collecting system with similar detail as IVP; however, its utility in diagnosing MSK has not been defined. Case Report: We present the first 15 patients with recurrent symptomatic nephrolithiasis who were evaluated in our renal stone clinic with CTU. Four patients were diagnosed with MSK after visualization of the characteristic radiologic findings. Discussion(s): CTU effectively demonstrates the characteristic radiologic findings of MSK including collecting tubule dilatation, medullary nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, and medullary cysts. Dose reduction protocols can reduce radiation exposure below that associated with conventional IVP. We propose CTU be considered for the diagnosis of MSK. © 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel.",Excluded
3329,"When should the doctor order a spine X-ray? Identifying vertebral fractures for osteoporosis care: results from the European Prospective Osteoporosis Study (EPOS) UNLABELLED: Vertebral fractures are common but usually remain unrecognized in primary care. Data from 2908 women and 2653 men in the EPOS study were used to derive algorithms to indicate the need for a spine X-ray to identify a fracture using easily elicited determinants. At a sensitivity of 50% for identifying cases, the specificity was increased from 50% to 78% in women and from 50% to 72% in men compared with a random allocation of X-rays. Use of X-rays can be optimized by selecting patients at high risk using a short screening procedure., INTRODUCTION: Previous osteoporotic fracture is an independent risk factor for further fractures and an indication for treatment. Vertebral fractures are the most common osteoporotic fractures before age 75, accounting for 48% of all fractures in men and 39% in women over 50. They usually remain unrecognized, so many patients requiring treatment are denied it, doubling their risk of a further fracture. Our objective was to develop an efficient algorithm indicating the need for an X-ray., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 2908 women and 2653 men >or=50 years of age in the European Prospective Osteoporosis Study (EPOS) were analyzed. Lateral thoracic and lumbar spine radiographs were taken at baseline and at an average of 3.8 years later. Prevalent fractures were qualitatively diagnosed by an experienced radiologist. Fracture risk was modeled as a function of age, statural height loss since age 25, gender, and fracture history including limb fractures in the last 3 years using negative binomial regression. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to summarize a model's predictive ability, and a prediction algorithm was devised to identify those most likely to have a fracture., RESULTS: In a multivariate model for women, the risk of prevalent vertebral fracture significantly increased with age (RR, 1.67 [95% CI, 1.46, 1.93] per decade), statural height loss (1.06, [1.03, 1.10] per centimeter decrease), self-reported history of spine fracture (7.52 [5.52, 10.23]), and history of other major fracture (1.83 [1.46, 2.28]). Higher body weight reduced risk (0.86 [0.79, 0.95] per 10-kg increase). In men, the respective RR estimates were as follows: age (1.32 [1.18, 1.49]); height loss (1.06 [1.04, 1.09]); self-reported spine fracture (5.05 [3.69, 6.90]); other major fracture (1.42 [1.12, 1.81]); and weight (0.86 [0.79, 0.94]). Using algorithms based on these easily elicited determinants, specificity was increased from 50% to 78% in women and from 50% to 72% in men at a sensitivity of 50% compared with a random allocation of X-rays. At a sensitivity of 75%, the specificity was 50% in women and 40% in men. Inclusion of hip BMD (femoral neck or trochanter), measured in 1360 women and 1046 men, significantly improved the area under the ROC curves by 4% in women (p < 0.002) but not in men (p > 0.350). Spine BMD, measured in 982 women and 847 men, produced a significant 5% AUC improvement in women (p = 0.007) but not in men (p = 0.554)., CONCLUSION: A woman 65 years of age with one vertebral fracture has a one in four chance of another fracture over 5 years, which can be reduced to one in eight by treatment. Positive treatment decisions are often contingent on identifying a vertebral fracture. Selective use of lateral vertebral X-rays can be optimized using a 2-minute screening procedure administered by a nurse.",Excluded
3366,"The utility of PET/CT in staging and assessment of treatment response of nasopharyngeal cancer Introduction: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of positron emission tomography/computerised tomography (PET/CT) as an adjunct to conventional imaging (CI) in the management of nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) both for initial staging and assessment of post-treatment response. Method(s): All NPC cases referred to the Peter MacCallum Centre for Metabolic Imaging between January 2002 and December 2007 were identified. In patients undergoing initial staging, any differences between the pre-PET/CT management plan based on CI and that following performance of the PET/CT scan were noted. Clinical impact was scored using the Centre's published criteria: 'high' if PET/CT changed the primary treatment modality or intent, 'medium' if treatment modality was unchanged but the radiotherapy technique or dose was altered, and 'low' if there was no change in treatment modality or intent. Patients undergoing PET/CT following definitive treatment were scored according to whether or not they achieved a complete metabolic response. Result(s): Forty-eight patients underwent a staging PET/CT. The clinical impact was high in 8%, medium in 25% and low in 66% of patients. Twenty-one patients were scanned for post-treatment response. PET/CT was less frequently equivocal than MRI (3 vs 8/21). A complete metabolic response on PET/CT was associated with a 93% negative predictive value for subsequent recurrence. Conclusion(s): PET/CT is a valuable staging tool for the detection of occult metastatic disease and defining the extent of neck nodal disease. Post-treatment, a complete metabolic response on PET/CT has a very high negative predictive value with fewer equivocal results than MRI. © 2011 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists.",Excluded
3586,"Ocular Surface Squamous Neoplasia After Corneal Graft Purpose: To describe the clinical features and management of ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN) after corneal graft. Design(s): Retrospective case series of 4 patients. Method(s): Four eyes of 4 patients treated for OSSN after corneal graft in an institutional setting were included. All 4 patients were treated with topical chemotherapy and additionally 1 patient each was treated with excisional biopsy and photodynamic therapy. The main outcome measure was the recurrence of OSSN and the clarity of corneal graft after treatment. Result(s): The mean time interval between corneal graft and diagnosis of OSSN was 36 months (range, 2 to 73 months). All 4 eyes were on chronic treatment with topical steroids for a minimum duration of 2 months and 2 eyes had previous herpes keratitis. Misdiagnosis of graft rejection was found in 2 cases. The mean tumor basal diameter was 18 mm (range, 14- to 25-mm) and the tumor involved a mean of 76% of the corneal surface (range, 15% to 90%). Management was successful in all cases using topical mitomycin C (n = 1), topical interferon alpha2b (n = 4), and photodynamic therapy (n = 1). At mean follow-up of 20 months, tumor control was achieved in all cases and all 4 eyes showed chronic graft opacification with vascularization but no intraocular tumor. Conclusion(s): Corneal OSSN should be considered in patients using chronic topical steroids for corneal graft. Nonsurgical management with topical chemotherapy or photodynamic therapy can achieve tumor control. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2554,"Head CT: Image quality improvement of posterior fossa and radiation dose reduction with ASiR - comparative studies of CT head examinations OBJECTIVES: To evaluate head CT protocol developed to improve visibility of the brainstem and cerebellum, lower bone-related artefacts in the posterior fossa and maintain patient radioprotection., METHODS: A paired comparison of head CT performed without Adaptive Statistical Iterative Reconstruction (ASiR) and a clinically indicated follow-up with 40 % ASiR was acquired in one group of 55 patients. Patients were scanned in the axial mode with different scanner settings for the brain and the posterior fossa. Objective image quality analysis was performed with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). Subjective image quality analysis was based on brain structure visibility and evaluation of the artefacts., RESULTS: We achieved 19 % reduction of total DLP and significantly better image quality of posterior fossa structures. SNR for white and grey matter in the cerebellum were 34 % to 36 % higher, respectively, CNR was improved by 142 % and subjective analyses were better for images with ASiR., CONCLUSIONS: When imaging parameters are set independently for the brain and the posterior fossa imaging, ASiR has a great potential to improve CT performance: image quality of the brainstem and cerebellum is improved, and radiation dose for the brain as well as total radiation dose are reduced., KEY POINTS: *With ASiR it is possible to lower radiation dose or improve image quality *Sequentional imaging allows setting scan parameters for brain and posterior-fossa independently *We improved visibility of brainstem structures and decreased radiation dose *Total radiation dose (DLP) was decreased by 19.",Excluded
3595,"Multidrug resistance determinants in acute myeloid leukemia developed in persons exposed to ionizing radiation due to the Chernobyl accident The results of multidrug resistance determinants expression analysis on leukemic cells of 56 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients by immunophenotyping are presented. Of these, there were 21 persons exposed to ionizing radiation due to the Chemobyl accident with radiation-associated AML and 35 patients with spontaneous leukemia. The aim of this study was to determine if transport proteins (P-glycoprotein, LRP, and MDR1), apoptosis-related proteins (Fas, Bcl-2, Bax, p53, and Bcl-X(L)), and topoisomerase IIalpha expression in AML patients with the history of radiation exposure differed from those in spontaneous AML cases. Leukemic cells in patients with radiation-associated diseases compared to spontaneous AML more often overexpressed antiapoptotic oncoprotein Bcl-2 (12/21 vs. 6/35, p < 0.005) and less often demonstrated expression of Fas receptor (12/21 vs. 30/35, p < 0.05). Moreover, leukemic cells were simultaneously Fas negative and Bcl-2 positive in 4 out of 21 patients exposed to ionizing radiation but none of spontaneous cases had similar phenotype (p < 0.05). Leukemic cells in patients with radiation-associated AML compared to spontaneous cases more often were P-glycoprotein positive (12/20 vs 9/31, p < 0.05). P-glycoprotein overexpression significantly correlated with resistant disease in patients with radiation-associated AML (r = 0.47, p < 0.05), but was not a prognostic variable for the treatment outcome in terms of overall survival. Defects in pathways of drug-induced apoptosis and function of pump, that actively effluxes drugs could contribute significantly to developing drug resistance in radiation-associated AML.",Included
3137,"Adjuvant Radiation and Chemoradiation for High-Risk Salivary Gland Malignancies: A 20-Year Single Institution Experience Purpose/Objective(s): To report our institutional outcomes of patients with non-previously treated, high-risk salivary gland malignancies treated with surgery followed by adjuvant radiation (RT) and chemoradiation (CRT). Materials/Methods: From January 1997 to December 2017, 108 patients were treated with surgery, and adjuvant RT (n = 50) or CRT (n = 58) for high-risk pathologic features: perineural involvement (PNI), lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), positive/close (<2mm) margin, high grade, extracapsular extension (ECE), or positive lymph nodes. Adjuvant RT was delivered in 2 Gy daily fractions, and adjuvant CRT was delivered for 4-6 alternating week cycles: the most common regimen, TFHX, consisted of 5 days paclitaxel (100 mg/m2 on d1), infusional 5-fluorouracil (600 mg/m2/d x 5d), hydroxyurea (500 mg PO BID), and 1.5 Gy twice daily irradiation followed by a 9-day break without treatment. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate rates of locoregional control (LRC), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). Regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with LRC, DFS, and OS. Multivariable Cox Regression (MVA) was performed for known confounding risk factors, and factors associated with a trend to significance (p <0.20). Chi-Square was used to compare rates of toxicities between groups. Result(s): Median follow-up was 52 months (range: 3 - 226). The most common histologies included: Adenoid Cystic (n = 30), Mucoepidermoid (n = 20), and Salivary Duct Adenocarcinoma (n = 18). The most common location included the parotid (n = 73). The median RT dose was 66 Gy (range 43.2 - 74 Gy). The 5-year LRC was 88%, 5-year DFS was 57%, and 5-year OS was 78%. On MVA, LRC was not associated with any factors; DFS was associated with the size of the tumor (HR 2.0, p = 0.01), tumor location (HR 2.0, p = 0.01), and stage (HR 1.7, p = 0.02); and OS was associated with N stage (HR 2.3, p = 0.005), LVSI (HR 1.9, p = 0.012), ECE (HR 1.5, p = 0.032), and stage (HR 1.3, p = 0.05). CRT was not associated with improved LRC (HR 0.5, p = 0.34), DFS (HR 0.4, p = 0.44), or OS (HR: 0.46, p = 0.384). Since 87% of node positive patients were treated with adjuvant CRT compared to 13% with RT, therefore comparison was not possible. There was no difference in any acute or late grade 3+ toxicities, or parenteral nutrition between RT and CRT (p = 0.98, p = 0.85, and p = 0.83), respectively. There was one acute grade 5 toxicity in the RT group. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge, this is the largest single institution cohort of adjuvant CRT for high-risk salivary malignancies. Overall, adjuvant CRT doesn't enhance outcomes compared to adjuvant RT alone. However, LRC was similar between RT and CRT groups in spite of more adverse features (nodal disease and ECE) in the CRT group. Distant metastatic disease remains a significant pattern of failure. We await large prospective evidence to determine which subsets of patients benefit from adjuvant CRT.Copyright © 2019",Excluded
3108,"Additional myeloablation with 52Fe before bone marrow transplantation For many hematological malignancies, high-dose chemoradiotherapy followed by bone marrow transplantation offers the best and sometimes the only chance for cure. However, the main causes of failure of this therapy are relapse and toxicity. In order to selectively deliver higher doses of radiotherapy to the bone marrow and to spare normal organs, we explored 52Fe therapy before a conventional BMT conditioning regimen. Twenty-four patients at high risk for relapse after BMT were included in a phase II study. The median follow-up was 42 months. The median 52Fe dose was 59 mCi. This resulted in a median radiation-absorbed dose (RAD) to the BM of 626 rad. The median RAD to the liver was 338 rad. No untoward effects were noted after the injections of 52Fe. The patients recovered hematopoiesis without toxicity in excess of that expected with conventional conditioning alone. The 3-year DFS probability was 49% (95% CI: 20-78%), Eight patients have relapsed,three of them in extramedullary sites. 52Fe should provide a way to boost the radiation dose to marrow-based diseases before bone marrow transplantation without excessive toxicity.",Excluded
3306,"Targeted disruption of NBS1 reveals its roles in mouse development and DNA repair Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) is an autosomal recessive hereditary disease that shares some common defects with ataxia-telangiectasia. The gene product mutated in NBS, named NBS1, is a component of the Mre11 complex that is involved in DNA strand-break repair. To elucidate the physiological roles of NBS1, we disrupted the N-terminal exons of the NBS1 gene in mice. NBS1(m/m) mice are viable, growth retarded and hypersensitive to ionizing radiation (IR). NBS1(m/m) mice exhibit multiple lymphoid developmental defects, and rapidly develop thymic lymphoma. In addition, female NBS1(m/m) mice are sterile due to oogenesis failure. NBS1(m/m) cells are impaired in cellular responses to IR and defective in cellular proliferation. Most systematic and cellular defects identified in NBS1(m/m) mice recapitulate those in NBS patients, and are essentially identical to those observed in Atm(-/-) mice. In contrast to Atm(-/-) mice, spermatogenesis is normal in NBS1(m/m) mice, indicating that distinct roles of ATM have differential requirement for NBS1 activity. Thus, NBS1 and ATM have overlapping and distinct functions in animal development and DNA repair.",Excluded
3616,"Long-term pain outcomes for recurrent idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia after stereotactic radiosurgery: A prospective comparison of first-time microvascular decompression and repeat stereotactic radiosurgery OBJECTIVE Microvascular decompression (MVD) and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) are common surgical treatments for trigeminal neuralgia (TN). Many patients who receive SRS have pain recurrence; the ideal second intervention is unknown. The authors directly compared pain outcomes after MVD and repeat SRS in a population of patients in whom SRS failed as their first-line procedure for TN, and they identified predictors of pain control. METHODS The authors reviewed a prospectively collected database of patients undergoing surgery for TN between 1997 and 2014 at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Standardized data collection focused on preoperative clinical characteristics, surgical characteristics, and postoperative outcomes. Patients with typical type 1, idiopathic TN with >= 1 year of follow-up were included. RESULTS In total, 168 patients underwent SRS as their first procedure. Of these patients, 90 had residual or recurrent pain. Thirty of these patients underwent a second procedure at UCSF and had >= 1 year of follow-up; 15 underwent first-time MVD and 15 underwent repeat SRS. Patients undergoing MVD were younger than those receiving repeat SRS and were more likely to receive >= 80 Gy during the initial SRS. The average follow-up was 44.9 +/- 33.6 months for MVD and 48.3 +/- 45.3 months for SRS. All patients achieved complete pain freedom without medication at some point during their follow-up. At last follow-up, 80% of MVD-treated patients and 33.3% of SRS-treated patients had a favorable outcome, defined as Barrow Neurological Institute Pain Intensity scores of I-IIIa (p < 0.05). Percentages of patients with favorable outcome at 1 and 5 years were 86% and 75% for the MVD cohort and 73% and 27% for the SRS cohort, respectively (p < 0.05). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis demonstrated that performing MVD was statistically significantly associated with favorable outcome (HR 0.12, 95% CI 0.02-0.60, p < 0.01). There were no statistically significant predictors of favorable outcome in the MVD cohort; however, the presence of sensory changes after repeat SRS was associated with pain relief (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Patients who received MVD after failed SRS had a longer duration of favorable outcome compared to those who received repeat SRS; however, both modalities are safe and effective. The presence of post-SRS sensory changes was predictive of a favorable pain outcome in the SRS cohort.Copyright ©AANS 2019.",Excluded
3640,"Detection of urolithiasis: comparison of 100% tube exposure images reconstructed with filtered back projection and 50% tube exposure images reconstructed with sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction PURPOSE: To compare images acquired with 50% tube exposure with a dual-source computed tomographic (CT) scanner and reconstructed with sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction (SAFIRE) with 100% exposure images reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP) for reader ability to detect stones, reader confidence, and findings outside the urinary tract., MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this HIPAA-compliant, institutional review board-approved study, imaging examinations in 99 patients with urolithiasis were assessed. Data from both tubes were reconstructed with FBP; data from the primary tube only were reconstructed with SAFIRE. Seven readers evaluated randomized studies for calculi in nine regions. Reader confidence was scored by using a five-point scale. Ancillary findings were noted. Nonparametric methods for clustered data were used to estimate the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves with 95% confidence intervals to test for noninferiority of 50% exposure with SAFIRE., RESULTS: Calculi were found in 113 locations (pyelocalyceal ureter, 86; proximal ureter, seven; midureter, four; distal ureter, 15; bladder, one) and not found in 752 locations. Mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for FBP was 0.879 (range, 0.607-0.967) and for SAFIRE, 0.883 (range, 0.646-0.971; 95% confidence interval: -0.025, 0.031). The SAFIRE images were not significantly inferior to FBP images (P = .001). Reader confidence levels for images with stones were similar with FBP and SAFIRE (P = .963). For the 52 patients who had extraurinary findings, readers reported them correctly in 74.4% (271 of 364) and 72.0% (262 of 364) of cases (P = .215) for FBP and SAFIRE, respectively. For the nine patients with potentially important findings per the reference standard, the detection rates were 44% (28 of 63) and 33% (21 of 63, P = .024), respectively. For the 43 patients with unimportant or likely unimportant findings, the false detection rates were 15% (44 of 301) and 14% (43 of 301, P = .756), respectively., CONCLUSION: The 50% tube exposure CT images reconstructed with SAFIRE were not inferior to 100% exposure images reconstructed with FBP for diagnosis of urolithiasis, without decreases in reader confidence.",Excluded
2609,"Influence of diabetes on the interpretation of PET scans in patients with esophageal cancer Purpose: Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) can have altered sugar transport into cells, potentially affecting the results of 18-FDG PET scans. The specific aim of this study was to determine the effect of DM on pre- and post treatment standard uptake value (SUV) scores in patients undergoing chemo-radiotherapy for esophageal cancer. Method(s): Patients with locally advanced esophageal carcinoma undergoing preoperative or definitive chemoradiotherapy underwent pre-and post treatment 18-FDG PET scans. Maximum SUV score was measured from the tumor before chemoradiotherapy and 3 to 4 weeks after chemoradiotherapy (preoperatively). Patients were identified as having DM by medical record review. Random serum glucose measurements were obtained prior to 18-FDG PET scans. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to test for differences in SUV scores between patients with and without DM, and a generalized linear model with backward selection was applied to search for significant predictors of initial and post treatment SUV scores. Result(s): Sixty-three patients underwent 18-FDG PET scans during the course of treatment for esophageal malignancies between 6/02 and 8/05. Fifty-four patients received chemotherapy. The median radiation dose was 46.8 Gy. Eighteen patients had DM, six were insulin-dependent DM (IDDM). There was no difference in initial SUV scores between DM and non-DM patients (P >.05). There was also no difference in initial SUV scores between IDDM and non-IDDM groups. Patients with tumors at the gastroesophageal junction had lower initial SUV scores compared to patients with tumors in the lower or midesophagus(P =.05). T stage was associated with initial SUV score (T2 lower than T3, P =.014). Older age (P =.03), diabetes (P =.007), higher T stage (P =.002), and presence of nodes (P =.05) were each positively associated with post treatment SUV scores. Blood glucose levels prior to 18-FDG PET scan, endoscopic tumor length, and tumor location were not predictive of post treatment SUV scores. Patients with DM had significantly lower post treatment SUV scores compared to patients without DM (P =.04). Pathologic complete response or percent SUV decrease did not differ between patients with or without DM. Conclusion(s): Regardless of glucose levels, DM and IDDM do not influence pretreatment SUV scores in patients with localized esophageal cancer. However, DM may influence post treatment SUV scores and thus complicate interpretation of treatment response. Further confirmatory study in a larger cohort of DM patients to evaluate the relationship of post treatment SUV score to pathologic response is warranted. © 2009 by International Society of Gastrointestinal Oncology.",Excluded
3417,"Reinforcing the Importance and Feasibility of Implementing a Low-dose Protocol for CT-guided Biopsies RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: This study sought to more definitely illustrate the impact and feasibility of implementing a low-dose protocol for computed tomography (CT)-guided biopsies using size-specific dose estimates and multivariate analyses., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty consecutive CT-guided lung and extrapulmonary biopsies were reviewed before and after implementation of a low-dose protocol (200 patients total, mean age 61 +/- 15 years, 128 women). Analyses of variance with Bonferroni correction were used to compare standard and low-dose protocols in terms of patient demographics, physician experience, target lesion size, total dose-length product, total acquisitions, size-specific dose estimate, signal-to-noise ratio, contrast-to-noise ratio, and lesion conspicuity ratings. All procedures were performed on the same 16-slice CT scanner., RESULTS: Voluntary protocol adherence was 100% (lung) and 89% (extrapulmonary). The low-dose protocol achieved significantly lower total average dose-length product [(lung) 735.6 +/- 599.4 mGy x cm to 252.1 +/- 101.9 mGy x cm, P < .001; (extrapulmonary) 724.7 +/- 545.0 mGy x cm to 392.9 +/- 239.5 mGy x cm, P < .001] and size-specific dose estimate [(lung) 5.2 +/- 0.8 mGy x cm to 4.3 +/- 1.5 mGy, P < .001; (extrapulmonary) 10.1 +/- 6.7 mGy to 6.5 +/- 2.7 mGy, P < .001]. Only the change in protocol was independently associated with lower size-specific dose estimates when controlling for the other variables (P < .0001). This was achieved with no significant differences in signal-to-noise ratio, contrast-to-noise ratio, or lesion conspicuity., CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a low-dose protocol for CT-guided biopsies resulted in 21% and 36% of size-specific dose estimate reduction for lung and extrapulmonary biopsies, respectively, with excellent adherence. Interventional and body radiologists should implement low dose CT-guidance protocols aiming to improve patient safety. Copyright © 2018 The Association of University Radiologists.

Materials/Methods: Wereviewed our experience in treating adult (age.18) patientswith a diagnosis ofmedulloblastoma. Information was gathered retrospectively on 66 patients who were seen at the time of initial diagnosis at our institution from1969 to 2008. Pathology was reviewed at the time of this analysis for all patients with available slides.Median age was 33. 44 patients hadM0 disease, 9 had M1, and 13were classified asMX.31 patientswere classified as high risk, 31 as standard risk and 4 patients had incomplete information for risk stratification. Classic histology was the most common type (n = 40) followed by desmoplastic (n = 9) and large cell/ anaplastic (n = 1). Radiation information was available in 64 patients. 61 received craniospinal radiotherapy (median dose 36 Gy) and 62 received posterior fossa radiotherapy (median total dose 55 Gy). 28 patients received adjuvant chemotherapy which was most commonly cisplatin based. Overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS)were estimated with Kaplan-Meier curves.Any recurrence or deathwas counted as an event in the estimation of PFS. Cox regression analysiswas used to compare recurrences between different groups (only patients that recurred were counted as having an event). The effect of chemotherapy in different groups was also assessed. Result(s):Median follow-upwas 80months. The estimated 5-yearOS and PFSwas 74%and 59%, respectively.High risk classification was associatedwithworseOS (p= 0.03) and recurrence (HR2.56, p= 0.05) and trend forworse PFS(p= 0.1313). Five-yearOSand PFS was 61% and 49% for high-risk, compared to 86% and 69% for patients classified as standard risk. Gross total resection (GTR) was associatedwith an improvement inOS (p = 0.03) and a trend toward improved PFS (p = 0.09) compared to subtotal resection or biopsy. No significant differenceswere observed for gender, location (midline vs. lateral), radiation dose, histologic type, anaplasia extent, treatment era or use ofMRI for staging.No benefit for chemotherapy could be demonstrated for the group as a whole. For high risk patients with classic histology (n= 25), chemotherapywas associatedwith animprovement in 5 year PFS from36%to 71%(p = 0.10 by log-rank and 0.05 by Wilcoxon test) and an improvement in 5 year OS from 49% to 100% (p = 0.08 by log-rank and 0.04 by Wilcoxon test). Conclusion(s): In adult patients with medulloblastoma, extent of resection and risk group are predictors of outcome. No significant difference in outcomes was observed by treatment era. These exploratory results suggest a possible benefit for chemotherapy in the group of high risk patients with classic histology.",Excluded
2705,"Chernobyl birds have smaller brains BACKGROUND: Animals living in areas contaminated by radioactive material from Chernobyl suffer from increased oxidative stress and low levels of antioxidants. Therefore, normal development of the nervous system is jeopardized as reflected by high frequencies of developmental errors, reduced brain size and impaired cognitive abilities in humans. Alternatively, associations between psychological effects and radiation have been attributed to post-traumatic stress in humans., METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING: Here we used an extensive sample of 550 birds belonging to 48 species to test the prediction that even in the absence of post-traumatic stress, there is a negative association between relative brain size and level of background radiation. We found a negative association between brain size as reflected by external head volume and level of background radiation, independent of structural body size and body mass. The observed reduction in brain size in relation to background radiation amounted to 5% across the range of almost a factor 5,000 in radiation level. Species differed significantly in reduction in brain size with increasing background radiation, and brain size was the only morphological character that showed a negative relationship with radiation. Brain size was significantly smaller in yearlings than in older individuals., CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Low dose radiation can have significant effects on normal brain development as reflected by brain size and therefore potentially cognitive ability. The fact that brain size was smaller in yearlings than in older individuals implies that there was significant directional selection on brain size with individuals with larger brains experiencing a viability advantage.",Included
3546,"Feasibility of ultra low-dose thallium stress-redistribution protocol including prone imaging in obese patients using CZT camera High efficiency cadmium-zinc-telluride (CZT) cameras provide an opportunity to lower the injected activities of radiopharmaceuticals for single photon emission tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). The limits for reducing activities of thallium have not been determined, particularly in obese patients. After an injection of 0.7 megabecquerel (MBq) of thallium/kg, we collected an average 1.5 million counts for the 10-min acquisition in a pilot cohort of ten patients. After extrapolation, we reduced the administered activity to 0.5 MBq/kg to obtain the expected 1 million counts. We studied the image quality in 124 patients (86 men, 43 obese with body mass index over 30 kg/m2) referred for MPI. The quality of images was assessed by a number of recorded counts and visually by a four-grade scale (one-poor quality, four-excellent quality). In non-obese and obese patients, the average number of recorded counts was 1.1 vs. 1.07 million counts for the 10-min stress acquisition, 1.04 vs. 1.06 million counts for the 13-min rest acquisition, and the average quality score was 3.97 vs. 3.90, respectively (p = NS). The mean administered activity was 39.2 +/- 7 MBq for non-obese and 48.7 +/- 6 for obese patients (p < 0.0001), and the calculated effective dose was 4.0 +/- 0.7 and 4.9 +/- 0.6 mSv respectively (p < 0.0001). The ultra-low-dose thallium stress-redistribution protocol, including post-stress prone imaging, provides good quality of images with a low radiation burden, even in obese patients.",Excluded
2905,"Adding concurrent chemotherapy to postoperative radiotherapy improves locoregional control but Not overall survival in patients with salivary gland adenoid cystic carcinoma-a propensity score matched study Purpose: To compare the long-term outcomes in patients with salivary gland adenoid cystic carcinoma (SGACC) treated with post-operative chemoradiotherapy (POCRT) versus post-operative radiotherapy (PORT). Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed the records of 91 SGACC patients treated with surgery followed by PORT (n = 58) or POCRT (n = 33) between 2000 and 2013. Treatment outcomes between groups were compared using propensity score matching (1:1 nearest neighbor). Result(s): The median radiation dose was 66 Gy, and patients were followed up for a median of 71 months. Cisplatin-based concurrent regimens were the most commonly used chemotherapy schedules. In the entire study cohort, patients undergoing POCRT showed a trend toward higher locoregional control (LRC) rates than those treated with PORT alone at both 5 and 8 years (97 and 97 % versus 84 and 79 %, respectively; P =.066). Distant metastases were the most common form of treatment failure and occurred in 31 (34 %) patients (PORT, n = 17; POCRT, n = 14). After propensity score matching (33 pairs), patients receiving POCRT had 5- and 8 year LRC rates of 97 and 97 %, respectively, compared with 79 and 67 % for patients treated with PORT alone (P =.017). The two groups did not differ significantly in terms of distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). However, a significantly better opioid-requiring pain-free survival (ORPFS) was achieved in POCRT group (P =.038). Subgroup analyses revealed that patients with stage III - IV disease (P =.040 and.017), positive surgical margins (P =.011 and.050), or perineural invasion (P =.013 and.035) had significantly higher 5- and 8 year LRC and ORPFS when treated with POCRT, respectively. Conclusion(s): In SGACC patients, adding concurrent chemotherapy to PORT may increase LRC and ORPFS rates, particularly in presence of stage III - IV disease, positive surgical margins, or perineural invasion. However, no significant differences in DMFS, DFS, and OS were observed.Copyright © 2016 Hsieh et al.",Excluded
3124,"A high lymph node ratio predicts loco-regional recurrence while microscopic N2 predicts survival after radiation therapy in pIIIA-N2 non-small cell lung cancer Objective: Post-operative management of pIIIA-N2 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is still debated. Our objective was to identify subgroups of patients who could benefit from treatment based on invaded lymph node ratio (LNR). Method(s): From January 2003 to December 2012, 297 pIIIA-N2 NSCLC patients treated with surgery followed by conformational radiation therapy (RT) were retrospectively analysed. Result(s): Median follow-up time was 30 months. A correlation was observed between LNR and overall survival (OS) (R = -0.3, p < 0.0001), local relapse (R = -0.27, p < 0.0001) and extra-capsular spread (ECS) (Cramer's V = 0.49, p < 0.0001). In univariate analysis, OS was significantly lower in patients with LNR higher than 1/3 (median survival 61 +/- 6.5 vs. 28 +/- 3.8 months, p < 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, favourable prognostic factors for OS were a LNR <1/3 (HR = 0.53, 95 % CI 0.33-0.85, p = 0.009) and microscopic N2 (HR = 0.56, 95 % CI 0.35-0.90, p = 0.01). For local relapse, multivariate analysis identified the following risk factors: female gender (HR = 2.41, CI 1.36-4.27, p = 0.003), microscopic N2 (HR = 0.40, CI 0.2-0.81, p = 0.01) and a LNR of lower than 2/3 (HR = 0.18, CI 0.07-0.48, p = 0.001). Conclusion(s): Our study supports that LNR is likely related to OS and loco-regional recurrence. Furthermore, microscopic N2 seems to be associated with a better prognosis.Copyright © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
2717,"Radiation Exposure Optimisation During AF Ablations Utilising the Cryoballoon Ablation System BACKGROUND: Radiation risk minimisation during cardiac catheterisation, particularly atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation procedures, requires a multifaceted approach involving both technique and technology., OBJECTIVE: To evaluate radiation dose associated with cryoballoon compared to conventional radiofrequency (RF) AF ablation procedures., METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing AF ablation were collected in a single-centre registry. Radiation and procedural data for index AF ablation procedures using four ablation techniques were compared: RF ablation with and without the anti-scatter grid (RF Grid and RF Gridless), and cryoballoon ablation utilising first and second-generation Medtronic Arctic Front Cryoballoons (Cryo; Arctic Front, Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA), with and without 3D imaging during fluoroscopy (Cryo 3D and Cryo)., RESULTS: We studied 418 patients; 30 RF Grid, 68 RF No Grid, 12 Cryo 3D and 308 Cryo. The dose area product (DAP; Gycm2), adjusted for patient standardised weight of 80kg, was significantly higher for the Cryo 3D (21.91) and RF Grid (7.31) than the Cryo (2.13) and RF Gridless (3.31) groups; as a result, Cryo 3D was discontinued and RF Grid was only used when clinically required. Comparing the remaining groups, DAP for Cryo was significantly lower than RF Gridless (p<0.001) mainly attributable to a difference in fluoroscopy use (13.2 vs. 17.3 mins; p<0.001). Cryo procedure time was also significantly shorter (80 mins vs. 133 mins; p<0.01)., CONCLUSION: Cryoballoon AF ablations can be performed efficiently using Gridless fluoroscopy techniques achieving significant reduction in radiation exposure and procedure time while maintaining safety and efficacy. In this observational study, cryoballoon AF ablations compare favourably to conventional RF ablations in terms of these parameters.

3273,"Improvement and induction property of radiation-responsive promoter through DNA shuffling of 5'-flanking regions of the human p21 gene A promoter that augments gene expression in response to stimulation of ionizing radiation would be a desired tool for radiogenetic therapy, a combination of radiotherapy and gene therapy. Although various promoters occurring naturally or artificially have been used for researches, one showing higher reactivity to ionizing radiation is desirable. In the present study, we attempted to improve a radiation-responsive promoter of the p21 through a technique called DNA shuffling. A library of DNA fragments was constructed by re-ligation of randomly digested promoter fragments and improved promoters were chosen out of the library. We repeated this process twice to obtain a promoter showing 2.6-fold better reactivity to ionizing radiation compared with its parent, p21 promoter after 10 Gy gamma-ray irradiation. Nucleotide sequence analyses revealed that the obtained promoter was densely packed with some of the cis-acting elements including binding sites for p53, NF-kappaB, NRF-2, AP-1 and NF-Y more than p21 promoter. In addition, it was shown that its induction by ionizing radiation was dependent upon p53 status of a cell line, suggesting that the promoter retained properties of the p21 promoter. This technique is simple and efficient to improve a promoter responsive to other stimulus of interest besides IR. © 2009 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.",Excluded
2718,"Technological Advances in Arrhythmia Management Applied to Adults With Congenital Heart Disease Arrhythmias are a leading cause of morbidity in adults with congenital heart disease. Numerous challenges to managing arrhythmias include vascular access issues, intracardiac shunts, unconventional locations of the conduction system, and anatomical complexities. Technological advances are improving our ability to diagnose and treat arrhythmias. Implantable loop recorders and various technologies developed for consumers to record electrocardiographic tracings using smartphone applications, watches, and dedicated portable devices are expanding our armamentarium of diagnostic tools. Remote magnetic-guided catheter ablation is enhancing access to otherwise difficult to reach arrhythmia substrates. Cryoablation allows perinodal arrhythmias to be safely treated in patients with displaced or difficult to predict locations of the atrioventricular conduction system. Interventions that minimize radiation exposure to near 0 levels are gaining interest and pulmonary vein isolation procedures to treat atrial fibrillation are increasingly performed. Cardiac implantable electronic devices compatible with magnetic resonance imaging have become the norm. Subcutaneous defibrillators and leadless pacemakers are providing effective solutions to patients in whom transvenous leads are contraindicated or not desired. His-bundle pacing is emerging as a viable option to provide more physiological pacing. Progressive advances in multicomponent communicating leadless devices carry the promise of providing leadless dual chamber pacing and cardiac resynchronization therapy in the near future. The safety of transvenous lead extraction procedures is likely to improve with advances such as the low-pressure balloon to manage superior vena cava lacerations. Awareness of these developments and referral to sites with dedicated expertise could contribute to further improving outcomes in adults with congenital heart disease.

2916,"The evaluation of different radiological measurement parameters of the degree of collapse of the vertebral body in vertebral compression fractures For compression fracture, vertebral body height loss (VBHL) and kyphotic angle (KA) are two important imaging parameters for determining the prognosis and appropriate treatment. This study used previous measurement methods to assess the degree of VBHL and KA, compare and examine differences between various measurement methods, and examine the correlation between relevant measurement parameters and intravertebral cleft (IVC) in the vertebral body. The radiographic images (lateral view of the T-L spine) of 18 patients with a single-level vertebral compression fracture were reviewed. We measured 9 characteristic lengths and angles on plain radiographs, including anterior vertebral height (AVH) and AVH of the adjacent upper and lower levels, middle vertebral height (MVH) and MVH of the adjacent upper and lower levels, posterior vertebral height (PVH), and vertebral body width, and assessed 6 parameters, including vertebral compression ratio (VBCR), percentage of anterior height compression (PAHC), percentage of middle height compression (PMHC), kyphotic angle (KA), calculated kyphotic angle (CKA), and IVC. The results showed that VBCR is a simple and rapid method of VBHL assessment, but it may result in an underestimation of the degree of VBHL compared to PAHC. When PMHC < 40% or kyphotic angle > 15degree, the probability of IVC occurring on the vertebral body was higher which means the higher risk of vertebral body instability. The results of this study could provide a reference for surgeons when using imaging modalities to assess the degree of vertebral body collapse.Copyright © 2019 Wei-En Hsu et al.

3318,"T1/T2 matching to differentiate tumor growth from radiation effects after stereotactic radiosurgery Objective: We define magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical criteria that differentiate radiation effect (RE) from tumor progression after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Method(s): We correlated postoperative imaging and histopathological data in 68 patients who underwent delayed resection of a brain metastasis after SRS. Surgical resection was required in these patients because of clinical and imaging evidence of lesion progression 0.3 to 27.7 months after SRS. At the time of SRS, the median target volume was 7.1 mL (range, 0.5-26 mL), which increased to 14 mL (range, 1.3-81 mL) at the time of surgery. After initial SRS, routine contrast-enhanced MRI was used to assess tumor response and to detect potential adverse radiation effects. We retrospectively correlated these serial MRIs with the postoperative histopathology to determine if any routine MRI features might differentiate tumor progression from RE. Result(s): The median time from SRS to surgical resection was 6.9 months (range, 0.3-27.7 months). A shorter interval from SRS to resection was associated with a higher rate of tumor recurrence (P = .014). A correspondence between the contrast-enhanced volume on T1-weighted images and the low signal-defined lesion margin on T2-weighted images (""T1/T2 match"") was associated with tumor progression at histopathology (P < .0001). Lack of a clear and defined lesion margin on T2-weighted images compared to the margin of contrast uptake on T1-weighted images (""T1/T2 mismatch"") was significantly associated with a higher rate of RE in pathological specimens (P < .0001). The sensitivity of the T1/T2 mismatch in identifying RE was 83.3%, and the specificity was 91.1%. Conclusion(s): We found that time to progression and T1/T2 mismatch were able to differentiate tumor progression from RE in most patients. When REs are suspected, surgery may not be necessary if patients respond to conservative measures. When tumor progression is suspected, resection or repeat radiosurgery can be effective, depending on the degree of mass effect. © 2010 by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.",Excluded
3396,"Osteoporotic fractures in rheumatoid arthritis patients in Argentina: a matched retrospective cohort study Background: To compare the incidence of osteoporotic fractures in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with matched controls from a university hospital. Method(s): Consecutive RA patients (n = 100) were matched (age and sex) with controls (1:2). The follow-up period began at the index date, defined as the date of diagnosis for RA patients and the date of the first medical claim at the Health Management Organization (HMO) for non-RA patients. Fracture incidence rates per 1000 persons-years (PY) for distinct types of fractures were calculated. Multivariate cox regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with fractures. Result(s): One hundred RA patients were followed for a total of 975.1 patients-years and 200 controls for 1485.7 patients-years. No difference was found in the overall fracture incidence rate per 1000 PY between RA and controls (19.5, 95% CI 12.7-28.6 vs 12.1, 95% CI 7.7-18.7, p = 0.07). In the Cox regression analysis, only age (HR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02-1.11, p = 0.006) and history of a prior fracture (HR 9.85, 95% CI 2.97-32.64, p < 0.001) were associated with fractures after the index date.

3041,"Results of adjuvant radiochemotherapy for gastric adenocarcinoma in Slovenia Aims: To analyze the results of postoperative concomitant radiochemotherapy with 5-florouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin (LV) in patients with gastric carcinoma treated in a single institution. Method(s): During 2001-2004, 123 patients with the mean age of 60 years, were treated for adenocarcinoma of the stomach, stage Ib-IV, with postoperative concomitant radiochemotherapy. Radical (R0) and non-radical (R1) resection of the tumor was performed in 107 and 16 patients, respectively. Adjuvant treatment consisted of five cycles of five-day chemotherapy with 5-FU (425 mg/m2) and LV (20 mg/m2) and concomitant radiotherapy with the total dose of 45 Gy. Result(s): The treatment was completed according to the protocol in 101 patients. Stomatitis, dysphagia, and nausea and vomiting of grade three occurred in 32, 27, and 23 patients, respectively. The median follow-up time of 87 survivors was 30.4 months (range 17.4-58.3 months). At two years, locoregional control (LRC), disease-free survival (DFS), disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 86%, 65%, 74%, and 73%, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, the initial Hb level was identified as independent prognostic factor for all survival four endpoints, the involvement of whole stomach with cancer for LRC, the total dose of 5-FU per five-day cycle for DFS, and pT stage for DSS. Conclusion(s): In operable gastric carcinoma, postoperative concomitant radiochemotherapy with 5-FU and LV is feasible and its toxicity acceptable. Its potential to improve the treatment outcome compared to the surgery alone is yet to be tested in well designed prospective randomized studies. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded

2653,"IN-VIVO RADIATION DOSIMETRY USING PORTABLE L BAND EPR: ON-SITE MEASUREMENT OF VOLUNTEERS IN FUKUSHIMA PREFECTURE, JAPAN The aim of this study was to make direct measurements of the possible radiation-induced EPR signals in the teeth of volunteers who were residents in Fukushima within 80 km distance from the Fukushima Nuclear Power plant at the time of the disaster, and continued to live there for at least 3 month after the disaster. Thirty four volunteers were enrolled in this study. These measurements were made using a portable L-band EPR spectrometer, which was originally developed in the EPR Center at Dartmouth. All measurements were performed using surface loop resonators that have been specifically designed for the upper incisor teeth. Potentially these signals include not only radiation-induced signals induced by the incident but also background signals including those from prior radiation exposure from the environment and medical exposure. We demonstrated that it is feasible to transport the dosimeter to the measurement site and make valid measurements. The intensity of the signals that were obtained was not significantly above those seen in volunteers who had not had potential radiation exposures at Fukushima.Copyright © The Author 2016.

3682,"Assessment of DNA damage in nuclear medicine personnel--comparative study with the alkaline comet assay and the chromosome aberration test Despite much research over the last few decades, there still remains considerable uncertainty as to the genetic impact of ionizing radiation on human populations, particularly at low levels. The aim of the present study was to provide data on the genetic hazards due to occupational exposure of low doses of ionizing radiation in nuclear medicine departments. The assessment of primary DNA damage in peripheral blood leukocytes of medical staff was performed using the alkaline comet assay and the data obtained were compared with the results of conventional cytogenetic biodosimetry using the chromosome aberration (CA) test. Altogether 120 subjects (60 exposed and 60 controls) participated in the study. Statistically significant increases in primary DNA damage and increased frequencies of CAs compared to controls were observed. Within the exposed population, significant inter-individual differences in DNA damage were found, indicating differences in genome sensitivity. Age and gender were not confounding factors, while smoking enhanced the levels of primary DNA damage only in control subjects, as revealed by both biomarkers studied. The present study suggests that genotoxic damage results from exposure to chronic low doses of ionizing radiation in nuclear medicine departments. Therefore, the exposed medical personnel should carefully comply with the radiation protection procedures and should minimize radiation exposure where possible to avoid potential genotoxic effects. The results obtained in this study point to the significance of biological indicators providing information on the actual risk to the radiation exposed individuals. According to our results, the alkaline comet assay and CA test are sensitive biomarkers that can be used as additional complements to physical dosimetry for assessing exposure to radiation in nuclear medicine personnel.",Included

Previous ground-based research has indicated around a 50% occurrence of both venous gas emboli (VGE) and symptoms of decompression illness (DCI) after similar decompressions. In contrast, no DCI symptoms have been reported from past or current space activities. Twenty subjects were studied using Doppler ultrasound to detect any VGE during decompression to 386hPa, where they remained for up to 6h. Subjects were supine to simulate weightlessness. A large number of VGE were found in one subject at rest, who had a recent arm fracture; a small number of VGE were found in another subject during provocation with calf contractions. No changes in exhaled nitric oxide were found that can be related to either simulated EVA or actual EVA (studied in a parallel study on four cosmonauts). We conclude that weightlessness appears to be protective against DCI and that exhaled NO is not likely to be useful to monitor VGE.",Excluded

Our aim was to directly compare the effectiveness of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) and dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced (DSC) magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion in differentiating radiation effects from tumor growth in patients with increased enhancement following radiotherapy for primary or secondary brain tumors., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively identified 12 consecutive patients with primary and secondary brain tumors over a 1-year period that demonstrated indeterminate enhancing lesions after radiotherapy and that had undergone DSC MR perfusion, FDG PET-CT, and subsequent histopathologic diagnosis. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) of the lesion (SUVlesion max), SUVratio (SUVlesion max/SUVnormal brain), maximum relative cerebral blood volume, percentage of signal intensity recovery, and relative peak height were calculated from the positron emission tomography and MR perfusion studies. A prediction of tumor or radiation injury was made based on these variables while being blinded to the results of the surgical pathology., RESULTS: SUVratio had the highest predictive value (area under the curve=0.943) for tumor progression, although this was not statistically better than any MR perfusion metric (area under the curve=0.757-0.829)., CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study suggests that FDG PET-CT and DSC MR perfusion may demonstrate similar effectiveness for distinguishing tumor growth from radiation injury. Assessment of the SUVratio may increase the sensitivity and specificity of FDG PET-CT for differentiating tumor and radiation injury. Further analysis is needed to help define which modality has greater predictive capabilities. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Differences in image noise, image quality, and pulmonary nodule detection, size, and characterization were specifically evaluated., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Low-dose chest CT images obtained for 50 consecutive patients between December 2015 and January 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Images were reconstructed using FIRST and AIDR 3D for both lung and soft-tissue reconstruction. Images were independently reviewed to assess image noise, subjective image quality (with use of a 5-point Likert scale, with 1 denoting far superior image quality; 2, superior quality; 3, equivalent quality; 4, inferior quality; and 5, far inferior quality), pulmonary nodule count, size of the largest pulmonary nodule, and characterization of the largest pulmonary nodule (i.e., solid, part solid, or ground glass)., RESULTS: Across all 50 cases, measured image noise was lower with FIRST than with AIDR 3D (lung window, 44% reduction, 41 +/- 7 vs 74 +/- 8 HU, respectively; soft-tissue window, 32% reduction, 11 +/- 2 vs 16 +/- 2 HU, respectively). Readers subjectively rated images obtained with FIRST as comparable to images obtained with AIDR 3D (mean [+/- SD] Likert score for FIRST vs AIDR 3D, 3.2 +/- 0.3 for soft-tissue reconstructions and 3.0 +/- 0.3 for lung reconstructions). For each reader, very good agreement regarding nodule count was noted between FIRST and AIDR 3D (interclass correlation coefficient [ICC], 0.83 for reader 1 and 0.78 for reader 2). Excellent agreement regarding nodule size (ICC, 0.99 for reader 1 and 0.99 for reader 2) and characterization of the largest nodule (kappa value, 0.92 for reader 1 and 0.82 for reader 2) also existed., CONCLUSION: Images reconstructed with FIRST are superior to those reconstructed AIDR 3D with regard to image noise and are equivalent with regard to subjective image quality, pulmonary nodule count, and nodule characterization.",Excluded

3566,"A rare complication after shoulder arthroplasty, Radial Nerve Palsy: A case report INTRODUCTION: Shoulder arthroplasty modernized by Neer and al for proximal humerus fracture has shown excellent outcome.1 Despite its clinical success, complications do occur. Neurological injury is a rare complication with an estimated incidence 1% to 4%.2 Here we would like to report an uncommon complication of radial nerve palsy hence to discuss the possible causes and preventive measures. CASE REPORT: Mr X, a 50 year old gentleman, right hand dominant who works an office clerk, presented with a 4 parts fracture of proximal right humerus with anterior shoulder following a motor-vehicle accident (Figure 1). He underwent a shoulder hemiarthroplasty 2 weeks post-trauma. Procedure was performed under interscalene regional block with a standard delto-pectoral approach. The displaced humeral head button hole into pectoralis major muscle was removed carefully under direct visualization. No complication occurred intra-operatively. Shoulder x-ray showed a well-placed, cemented humeral stem arthroplasty (Figure 2). On post-operative evaluation, patient had clinical evidence of complete radial nerve palsy; where else other peripheral nerves were intact. This initially attributed to the residual effects of interscalene block. However on discharge post-operative day 5, there was no improvement. DISCUSSION: Complications related to shoulder implant arthroplasty are well documented. Incidence of complications approached 14%.3 These include instability, rotator cuff tear, ectopic ossification, glenoid loosening, intraoperative fracture, nerve injury, infection and humeral loosening. No vascular injury was reported. Most cases of nerve injury are neuropraxia involving the axillary nerve, musculocutaneous nerve, median and ulnar nerves.3 Age, sex, height, weight, preoperative diagnosis, and coexistant rotator cuff disease were not statistically significant risk factors.2 We believe that tractional injury on the brachial plexus during surgery is likely mechanism of injury. Placing the shoulder in excessive abduction, extension and external rotation for prolonged period of time especially during removal of the humeral head from the pectoralis major muscle may have caused tractional injury to the posterior cord. (Figure Parsented) CONCLUSION(S): Although neurovascular injury after shoulder replacement surgery is rare, its occurrence could lead to significant impairment. Knowledge of shoulder anatomy, meticulous surgical technique and proper positioning and traction can decrease the chance of occurrence of this injury.

3681,"Magnetic resonance imaging of musculoskeletal neoplasms MRI has been shown to be very useful in the work-up of musculoskeletal neoplasms. The lack of ionizing radiation, the superb contrast resolution, and the ability to directly scan the sagittal and coronal planes make MRI a very attractive imaging mode for treatment planning. With spin-echo MRI, maximum contrast between tumor and fatty tissues generally occurs with short TR and TE times (T1-weighted images). Likewise, maximum contrast between tumor and muscle, tendon, or ligaments occurs with long values of TR and TE (T2-weighted images). Early experience suggests that the already exceptional contrast resolution seen with MRI can be improved even more with the administration of intravenous contrast agents. Just as with CT, fatty tumors can usually be easily distinguished from other tissue types with MRI by means of their differential intensity behavior at different pulse sequences. Fluid-filled tumors, such as unicameral bone cysts or aneurysmal bone cysts may be suspected in the same manner, especially if a fluid-fluid level is seen within the lesion. Otherwise, MRI has not been useful so far in noninvasively determining the histologic type of tumors. Our experience and that of others suggests that MRI is equal or superior to CT in the work-up of musculoskeletal neoplasms. This is especially striking when it is remembered that one is comparing an immature MRI technology with a mature CT technology. Although CT presently has a central role in the staging of musculoskeletal tumors, MRI will shortly supplant it in many cases.",Excluded
2847,"Radioimmunoguided-intraoperative radiation therapy in colorectal carcinoma: A new technique to precisely define the clinical target volume Purpose: The clinical target volume (CTV) to be irradiated by intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) after resection is generally based on the surgeon's estimation of close margins. We have developed a new technique, radioimmunoguided-intraoperative radiation therapy (RIG-IORT), that uses an intraoperative hand-held gamma-detecting probe to define areas of residual microscopic disease containing radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies to tumor associated antigen, to more precisely delineate the CTV for IORT. Methods and Materials: Patients were injected i.v. with 2 mCi 125I-radiolabeled CC49 antibody approximately 3 weeks before surgery. They then underwent radioimmunoguided surgery (RIGS) with maximal resection of tumor. A hand- held gamma-detecting probe (Neoprobe 1000) was used intraoperatively to detect and resect areas of high radioactivity, representing tumor. Areas with persistently high probe counts after resection were the areas of occult residual disease, and represented the CTV to be irradiated. The IORT was given with either 6-9 MeV electron beam from a dedicated linear accelerator, or with high-dose-rate brachytherapy from a remote afterloader. If all RIGS- positive tissue had been resected, or if widely disseminated disease remained, the patient was not considered for IORT. Result(s): This technique was used in 31 patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma recurrent into the pelvis (n = 23) or paraortic nodes (n = 8). The CTV for IORT was delineated by increased RIGS count in 13 of 19 patients (68%) with microscopic residual, and in 11 of 12 patients (92%) with gross residual. In the other 7 patients, the tumor area did not accumulate the radiolabeled antibody; therefore, these tumor beds were irradiated based on the surgeon's estimation of close margins. Hence, overall, the RIG-IORT technique was used to define the tumor bed for IORT in 24 of 31 patients (77%). This technical report focuses on the development of the RIG-IORT technique and does not address the outcome results of the treated patients. Conclusion(s): A new technique, RIG-IORT, which uses radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies to precisely determine the CTV for IORT, is described. Whether the use of this technique will lead to improved tumor control will only be known upon the outcome analysis of RIG-IORT- treated patients compared with those obtained using traditional IORT techniques.",Excluded
3574,"The degeneration of adjacent intervertebral discs negatively influence union rate of osteoporotic vertebral fracture: A multicenter cohort study Background: With the increasing aging population in developed countries, there has been an associated increased prevalence of osteoporotic vertebral fracture (OVF). Many previous reports have attempted to predict the risk of delayed union associated with OVF. However, the role of endplate failure and the degeneration of adjacent intervertebral discs, and their association with delayed union has received little attention. The aim of this study was to evaluate the endplate fracture and disc degeneration rank as risk factors for delayed union. Material(s) and Method(s): Two hundred and eighteen consecutive patients with fresh OVF were enrolled in the study. MRI and X-ray were performed at the time of enrollment and at the 6 months follow-up. The MR images were used to assess the degeneration grade of adjacent intervertebral discs (using the modified Pfirrmann grading system), and endplate failure. Supine and weight-bearing radiographs were used to define angular motion and compression ratio of the anterior vertebral body wall. Result(s): A total of 139 patients (112 female, 27 male) completed the 6 month follow-up (a 65.1% follow-up rate). The study revealed 27 cases of delayed union (19.4%). A healthier adjacent caudal disc with low grade degeneration was found to be associated with an increased risk of delayed union (P = 0.008). Bi-endplate injury and significant compression of the anterior vertebral body wall were significantly associated with delayed union (P = 0.019, and P = 0.001 respectively). Rapid progression of the adjacent cranial disc degeneration was observed at the end of the 6 month follow-up period (P = 0.001). Conclusion(s): Modified Pfirrmann grading system revealed that a healthier adjacent intervertebral disc at the caudal level and bi-endplate fracture were significantly associated with an increased risk of delayed union. These findings may influence the management strategy for patients with OVF.Copyright © 2018",Excluded

From 2006 to 2015, 80 inoperable T1-2N0M0 NSCLC patients were treated with two median dose levels: 60 Gy in six fractions (range, 48-60 Gy in 4-8 fractions) prescribed to the 74% isodose line (range, 58%-79%) for central lesions (ie within 2 cm of, but not abutting, the proximal bronchial tree; n = 43), and 56 Gy in seven fractions (range, 48-60 Gy in 5-10 fractions) prescribed to the 74% isodose line (range, 60%-80%) for ultra-central lesions (ie abutting the proximal bronchial tree; n = 37) on consecutive days. Primary endpoint was overall survival (OS); secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), tumor local control rate (LC), and toxicity. Median OS and PFS were 64.47 and 32.10 months (respectively) for ultra-central patients, and not reached for central patients. Median time to local failure, regional failure, and any distant failures for central versus ultra-central lesions were: 27.37 versus 26.07 months, 20.90 versus 12.53 months, and 20.85 versus 15.53 months, respectively, all P <.05. Multivariate analyses showed that tumor categorization (ultra-central) and planning target volume >=52.76 mL were poor prognostic factors of OS, PFS, and LC, respectively (all P <.05). There was one grade 5 toxicity; all other toxicities were grade 1-2. Our results showed that ultra-central tumors have a poor OS, PFS, and LC compared with central patients because of the use of risk-adapted SBRT schedules that allow for equal and favorable toxicity profiles.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

2829,"Constraining the brachial plexus does not compromise regional control in oropharyngeal carcinoma BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence suggests that brachial plexopathy following head and neck cancer radiotherapy may be underreported and that this toxicity is associated with a dose-response. Our purpose was to determine whether the dose to the brachial plexus (BP) can be constrained, without compromising regional control., METHODS: The radiation plans of 324 patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPC) treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) were reviewed. We identified 42 patients (13%) with gross nodal disease <1 cm from the BP. Normal tissue constraints included a maximum dose of 66 Gy and a D05 of 60 Gy for the BP. These criteria took precedence over planning target volume (PTV) coverage of nodal disease near the BP., RESULTS: There was only one regional failure in the vicinity of the BP, salvaged with neck dissection (ND) and regional re-irradiation. There have been no reported episodes of brachial plexopathy to date., CONCLUSIONS: In combined-modality therapy, including ND as salvage, regional control did not appear to be compromised by constraining the dose to the BP. This approach may improve the therapeutic ratio by reducing the long-term risk of brachial plexopathy.",Excluded
2819,"Submandibular function recovery after IMRT in head and neck cancer: A prospective dose modelling study Purpose: To estimate the dose response relationship for submandibular gland (SMG) recovery using salivary scintigraphy in patients diagnosed with head and neck cancer treated with curative image guided chemoradiation. Material(s) and Method(s): Ninety newly diagnosed head and neck cancer patients (T1-3, N0-2c, M0) treated with intensity modulated radiotherapy on a prospective clinical trial were assessed for salivary toxicity at predefined intervals using dynamic salivary scintigraphy. The SMG function was measured using salivary excretion fraction (SEF) ratios at baseline and 6 monthly. Tolerance dose (TD) 50 for submandibular gland was estimated from dose response curves. Result(s): The mean SEF ratio of 180 SMGs decreased at 6 months with a nadir at 12 months after treatment (SEF ratio 15%) and progressively recovered over time reaching 38% over 24 months. There was significant inverse correlation between SEF ratio and mean SMG dose at 6 months (r = -0.18, p = 0.04); 12-months (r = -0.36, p < 0.001); 18-months (r = -0.48, p < 0.001); 24-months (r = -0.42, p < 0.001); and more than 24-months (r = -0.56, p < 0.001). The estimated TD 50 values at 1 year and 2 year post treatment were 36 Gy and 44 Gy respectively with SEF ratio of <=45% used to define severe xerostomia. For every 1 Gy reduction in mean dose below 54 Gy, there is 2-2.5% reduction in the probability of severe xerostomia. Conclusion(s): The submandibular gland function declines after radiotherapy with a nadir at 12 months and there is incomplete recovery over time with continued improvement over 24 months. The TD 50 at 1 year and 2 year was 36 Gy and 44 Gy with a 2-2.5% reduction in the probability of severe xerostomia for every 1 Gy reduction in mean dose.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): The mosquito, C. pipiens Linnaeus (L) was irradiated as pupae with three gamma doses 40, 60 and 80 Gy. Different biological aspects include the ovarian development of irradiated females tested. Result(s): Gamma doses used significantly increased the larval and pupal mortality percentages, the larval and pupal duration and significantly decreased the adult emergence percentages. Moreover, fecundity and egg hatchability percentages were severely decreased with increasing gamma doses. While the sterility% was positively correlated with the doses used. Gamma doses caused a dose-dependent decrease in the number of developed eggs, reduction in the number of developed oocytes, signs of degenerative processes in oocytes, yolk mass and egg size decrease. Conclusion(s): Results obtained indicated that gamma radiation of C. pipiens induced remarkable effects on the biological, developmental and reproductive activity.© 2018, Copyright © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group LLC.",Excluded
3475,"Association of clinical response and long-term outcome among patients with biopsied orbital pseudotumor receiving modern radiation therapy Purpose: To retrospectively evaluate institutional outcomes for patients treated with modern radiation therapy (RT) for biopsied orbital pseudotumor (OP). Methods and Materials: Twenty patients (26 affected orbits) with OP were treated with RT between January 2002 and December 2011. All patients underwent biopsy with histopathologic exclusion of other disease processes. Sixteen patients (80%) were treated with intensity modulated RT, 3 (15%) with opposed lateral beams, and 1 (5%) with electrons. Median RT dose was 27 Gy (range 25.2-30.6 Gy). Response to RT was evaluated at 4 months post-RT. Partial response (PR) was defined as improvement in orbital symptoms without an increase in steroid dose. Complete response (CR) 1 and CR 2 were defined as complete resolution of orbital symptoms with reduction in steroid dose (CR 1) or complete tapering of steroids (CR 2). The median follow-up period was 18.6 months (range 4-81.6 months). Result(s): Seventeen patients (85%) demonstrated response to RT, with 7 (35%), 1 (5%), and 9 (45%) achieving a PR, CR 1, and CR 2, respectively. Of the 17 patients who had >=PR at 4 months post-RT, 6 (35%) experienced recurrence of symptoms. Age (>46 years vs <=46 years, P=.04) and clinical response to RT (CR 2 vs CR 1/PR, P=.05) were significantly associated with pseudotumor recurrence. Long-term complications were seen in 7 patients (35%), including 4 with cataract formation, 1 with chronic dry eye, 1 with enophthalmos, and 1 with keratopathy. Conclusion(s): RT is an effective treatment for improving symptoms and tapering steroids in patients with a biopsy supported diagnosis of OP. Older age and complete response to RT were associated with a significantly reduced probability of symptom recurrence. The observed late complications may be related to RT, chronic use of steroids/immunosuppressants, medical comorbidities, or combination of factors. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
3643,"Axon initial segment Kv1 channels control axonal action potential waveform and synaptic efficacy Action potentials are binary signals that transmit information via their rate and temporal pattern. In this context, the axon is thought of as a transmission line, devoid of a role in neuronal computation. Here, we show a highly localized role of axonal Kv1 potassium channels in shaping the action potential waveform in the axon initial segment (AIS) of layer 5 pyramidal neurons independent of the soma. Cell-attached recordings revealed a 10-fold increase in Kv1 channel density over the first 50 microm of the AIS. Inactivation of AIS and proximal axonal Kv1 channels, as occurs during slow subthreshold somatodendritic depolarizations, led to a distance-dependent broadening of axonal action potentials, as well as an increase in synaptic strength at proximal axonal terminals. Thus, Kv1 channels are strategically positioned to integrate slow subthreshold signals, providing control of the presynaptic action potential waveform and synaptic coupling in local cortical circuits.",Excluded
3098,"Genomic characterization of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in radiation-exposed Chornobyl cleanup workers Background: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) was the predominant leukemia in a recent study of Chornobyl cleanup workers from Ukraine exposed to radiation (UR-CLL). Radiation risks of CLL significantly increased with increasing bone marrow radiation doses. Current analysis aimed to clarify whether the increased risks were due to radiation or to genetic mutations in the Ukrainian population. Method(s): A detailed characterization of the genomic landscape was performed in a unique sample of 16 UR-CLL patients and age- and sex-matched unexposed general population Ukrainian-CLL (UN-CLL) and Western-CLL (W-CLL) patients (n = 28 and 100, respectively). Result(s): Mutations in telomere-maintenance pathway genes POT1 and ATM were more frequent in UR-CLL compared to UN-CLL and W-CLL (both p < 0.05). No significant enrichment in copy-number abnormalities at del13q14, del11q, del17p or trisomy12 was identified in UR-CLL compared to other groups. Type of work performed in the Chornobyl zone, age at exposure and at diagnosis, calendar time, and Rai stage were significant predictors of total genetic lesions (all p < 0.05). Tumor telomere length was significantly longer in UR-CLL than in UN-CLL (p = 0.009) and was associated with the POT1 mutation and survival. Conclusion(s): No significant enrichment in copy-number abnormalities at CLL-associated genes was identified in UR-CLL compared to other groups. The novel associations between radiation exposure, telomere maintenance and CLL prognosis identified in this unique case series provide suggestive, though limited data and merit further investigation.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).",Excluded
3427,"Factors governing prepulse inhibition and prepulse facilitation of the acoustic startle response in mice The influence of prepulses on the acoustic startle response (ASR) was measured in three inbred mouse strains, C57BL/6J, 129/SvHsd, and AKR/OlaHsd, and one hybrid strain produced by crossing wild mice and NMRI mice. Prepulse inhibition (PPI), i.e. reduction of ASR by prepulses, was maximal when the interval between prepulses and startle stimuli was in the range of 37.5-100 ms. Prepulse facilitation (PPF), i.e. increase of ASR by prepulses, was maximal when the prepulse preceded the startle stimulus by 12.5 ms. PPI increased with increasing prepulse SPL, PPF first increased then decreased when prepulse SPL was increased. Percent PPI was independent from startle stimulus SPL. All strains showed a long-term increase of PPI when tested for several days; one strain (129) also showed an increase of PPF over days. The present results clearly show that PPI and PPF are independent processes, which add to yield the final response change. PPF and the observed long-term changes of PPI and PPF are stronger expressed in mice than have been observed in rats under similar conditions. Since there were significant differences between the strains of mice with respect to PPI and PPF, genetically different strains of mice are a promising tool to study these two processes.

The characteristics and estimated effective dose of CTs unrelated to the final diagnosis were analyzed. The factors affecting the estimated effective dose of CTs unrelated to final diagnosis were investigated., Results. More than half of all CT examinations were not associated with the final diagnosis. The additional estimated effective dose due to CTs being unrelated to the final diagnosis in each patient was a sufficient amount of radiation exposure to increase the possibility of fatal cancer., Introduction. Computed tomography (CT) has many diagnostic advantages, spurring growth in the number of CT examinations. As the use of CT increases, the potential for radiation-induced adverse effects has become an issue. The primary objective of this study was to assess the liberal use of CT induced radiation exposure in patients with multiple blunt traumas. The secondary objective was to investigate the factors affecting the estimated effective dose resulting from CTs unrelated to final diagnosis., Conclusion. A considerable number of CT scans were unrelated to the patient's final diagnosis, which exposes the patient to additional radiation exposure.Copyright ©, Pharmamed Mado Ltd.

The scattering light intensity of the surface and internal matrix of the optic was measured using Scheimpflug photography. Visual acuity (VA) was measured using VA charts, and contrast VA and that with glare (glare VA) were examined using a contrast sensitivity tester. Ocular higher-order aberrations (HOAs) were measured using a Hartmann-Shack aberrometer., RESULTS: Mean scattering light intensity of the surface and internal matrix of the optic was significantly higher in the acrylic group than in the silicone and PMMA groups (P < .0001). Mean uncorrected VA, photopic and mesopic contrast VA and glare VA, and HOAs did not differ significantly among groups, although mean corrected VA in the acrylic group was significantly better than that in the other groups (P = .0023). Scattering light intensity of the surface and internal matrix did not correlate with VA, contrast VA, or glare VA, and did not correlate with ocular and internal optic HOAs in the acrylic group., CONCLUSIONS: At more than 10 years postoperatively, visual function, including contrast sensitivity, and ocular HOAs were comparable among eyes that received acrylic, silicone, and PMMA IOLs.

ORN usually develops on the mandible and less frequently on the maxilla. We present three cases of ORN of the cervical vertebrae, which is rarely reported. Two patients suffered from secondary osteomyelitis after neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by definitive concurrent chemoradiation therapy with a hyperfractionated and an accelerated hyperfractionated regimen, respectively. For these patients, the high intensity of treatment was considered the cause of ORN. The third patient underwent concurrent chemoradiation therapy for upper thoracic esophageal cancer and subsequently underwent endoscopic laser resection and radiation therapy for hypopharyngeal cancer. ORN developed in the area of reirradiation. In this case, an excessive radiation dose was considered the cause. ORN of cervical vertebrae, different from that of the mandible and maxilla, has a risk of radiculopathy and myelopathy. In the future, ORN of cervical vertebrae will increase because metachronous double cancers will increase and opportunities for reirradiation, in turn, will increase. To prevent this, it is necessary to optimize the treatment schedule for radiation therapy, including the total dose, fractionation, and concurrent chemotherapy, and to decrease the volume of cervical vertebrae within the irradiation field. © 2010 Japan Radiological Society.",Excluded

Showing the theoretical benefit of using these models could stimulate conductance of such studies. In addition, it would pave the way for developing more advanced models, based on genomics, proteomics and imaging information, to further improve the performance of the models., PURPOSE: In this prospective single-center study, previously developed and validated statistical models were used to predict the two-year survival (2yrS), dyspnea (DPN), and dysphagia (DPH) outcomes for lung cancer patients treated with chemo radiation. These predictions were compared to probabilities provided by doctors and guideline-based recommendations currently used. We hypothesized that model predictions would significantly outperform predictions from doctors., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Experienced radiation oncologists (ROs) predicted all outcomes at two timepoints: (1) after the first consultation of the patient, and (2) after the radiation treatment plan was made. Differences in the performances of doctors and models were assessed using Area Under the Curve (AUC) analysis., RESULTS: A total number of 155 patients were included. At timepoint #1 the differences in AUCs between the ROs and the models were 0.15, 0.17, and 0.20 (for 2yrS, DPN, and DPH, respectively), with p-values of 0.02, 0.07, and 0.03. Comparable differences at timepoint #2 were not statistically significant due to the limited number of patients. Comparison to guideline-based recommendations also favored the models., CONCLUSION: The models substantially outperformed ROs' predictions and guideline-based recommendations currently used in clinical practice.

These results show that health conditions of the liquidators became worse during the whole observation period. A considerable development of both pathological states atypical of radiation damages and diseases, which may be considered as radiation-induced ones, was determined. Rise of the sickness rate of almost all organism systems, first of all, nervous, cardiovascular, respiratory and digestive ones, was observed. In 70% of liquidators the main disease was primarily detected after working on CNPP. In the intervening years, the average number of diagnoses per 1 liquidator increased from 1.5 in 1987 to 7-8 in the recent time. In addition to the detected diseases, particular functional shifts in neuropsychological and vegetative status of the liquidators were observed. The overwhelming majority of them have increased tonicity of the sympathetic vegetative nervous system, asthenic and depressive syndromes occurring in the form of weakness, somnolence, mood instability, mental capacity decrease, and memory defects.

3573,"Evaluating the radioprotective effect of Cimetidine, IMOD, and hybrid radioprotectors agents: An in-vitro study Introduction: There are various radioprotective agents with different mechanisms that help to decrease ionizing radiation side effects. The radioprotective effect of Cimetidine and IMOD was assessed individually and compared with the hybrid radioprotectors agents (HRPAs-IMOD and Cimetidine) on human lymphocyte cells. Method(s): Twenty healthy volunteers (ten men and ten women) participated in the present study. About 75 mL peripheral blood lymphocytes from each individual were collected, and they were divided into 36 groups. Briefly, the blood samples were treated with different concentrations of Cimetidine (12.6 and 25.2 mug/mL) and IMOD (0.04, 0.08, and 0.12 mg/mL), and also a combination of these agents, namely hybrid radioprotectors agents (HRPAs). Besides, the irradiated groups were exposed to 2 and 4 Gy of Co-60 gamma irradiation. The amount of cellular damage was assessed using the micronucleus assay. The repeated measurements and paired T-test statistical analysis were used to compare the micronucleus frequencies in different groups. Result(s): The micronucleus frequencies were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) in irradiated groups when the non-toxic concentrations of Cimetidine, IMOD, and HRPAs have been used. The reduction in micronucleus frequency was obtained 5-29% for Cimetidine and 40-51% for IMOD in peripheral blood lymphocytes irradiated with 2 Gy. This reduction in 4 Gy irradiation was 8-17% for Cimetidine and 27-37% for IMOD. The HRPAs resulted in a higher radioprotective effect, in a way that they cause up to 58% and 43% micronucleus frequency reduction in 2 and 4 Gy, respectively. Conclusion(s): In conclusion, the HRPAs showed the highest level of radioprotective. In addition, IMOD was remarkably higher radioprotective than Cimetidine, which may be related to its greater non-toxic concentrations.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
3352,"Preoperative chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced gastric cancer Background: To examine toxicity and outcomes for patients treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for gastric cancer. Method(s): Patients with gastroesophageal (GE) junction (Siewert type II and III) or gastric adenocarcinoma who underwent neoadjuvant CRT followed by planned surgical resection at Duke University between 1987 and 2009 were reviewed. Overall survival (OS), local control (LC) and disease-free survival (DFS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Toxicity was graded according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. Result(s): Forty-eight patients were included. Most (73%) had proximal (GE junction, cardia and fundus) tumors. Median radiation therapy dose was 45 Gy. All patients received concurrent chemotherapy. Thirty-six patients (75%) underwent surgery. Pathologic complete response and R0 resection rates were 19% and 86%, respectively. Thirty-day surgical mortality was 6%. At 42 months median follow-up, 3-year actuarial OS was 40%. For patients undergoing surgery, 3-year OS, LC and DFS were 50%, 73% and 41%, respectively. Conclusion(s): Preoperative CRT for gastric cancer is well tolerated with acceptable rates of perioperative morbidity and mortality. In this patient cohort with primarily advanced disease, OS, LC and DFS rates in resected patients are comparable to similarly staged, adjuvantly treated patients in randomized trials. Further study comparing neoadjuvant CRT to standard treatment approaches for gastric cancer is indicated. © 2013 Pepek et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
3490,"Differential radio-adaptive responses in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice: pivotal role of calcium and nitric oxide signalling Purpose: Our earlier studies demonstrated that transient radio-adaptive responses (RAR) in BALB/c mice were due to MAPK hyperactivation. The objective of this study was to determine the time duration of this low dose induced MAPK activation in BALB/c mice and to find out if similar adaptive responses are observed in C57BL/6 mice. Materials and methods: Mice were irradiated with 0.1 Gy priming dose (PD), 2 Gy challenge dose (CD) with an interval of 4 h (P + CD) and radiation induced immunosuppression in splenic lymphocytes was monitored as the endpoint for RAR. Results: Time kinetics following 0.1 Gy demonstrated persistence of MAPK hyperactivation till 48 h. Similar experiments in C57BL/6 mice indicated absence of RAR at 24 h following CD, in spite of MAPK activation which was also confirmed by time kinetics. Therefore, upstream activators of MAPK, viz., reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS, RNS) and calcium levels were estimated. There was increased intracellular calcium (Ca2+) and nitric oxide (NO) in BALB/c and an increase in intracellular ROS in C57BL/6 mice 24 h after PD. Inhibition of NO and calcium chelation abrogated RAR in BALB/c mice. In vitro treatment of spleen cells with combination of NO donor and Ca2+ ionophore mimicked the effect of PD and induced adaptive response after 2 Gy not only in BALB/c but also in C57BL/6 mice confirming their crucial role in RAR. Conclusions: These results suggest that low dose induced differential induction of Ca2+ and NO signaling along with MAPK was responsible for contrasting RAR with respect to immune system of BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice.

3472,"Salivary anionic changes after radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma: A 1-year prospective study Objectives: To investigate the salivary anionic changes of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treated by radiotherapy. Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty-eight patients with T1-4, N0-2, M0 NPC received conventional radiotherapy. Stimulated whole saliva was collected at baseline and 2, 6 and 12 months after radiotherapy. Salivary anions levels were measured using ion chromatography. Result(s): A reduction in stimulated saliva flow and salivary pH was accompanied by sustained changes in anionic composition. At 2 months following radiotherapy, there was a significant increase in chloride, sulphate, lactate and formate levels while significant reductions in nitrate and thiocyanate levels were found. No further changes in these anion levels were observed at 6 and 12 months. No significant changes were found in phosphate, acetate, or propionate levels throughout the study period. Conclusion(s): Conventional radiotherapy has a significant and prolonged impact on certain anionic species, likely contributing to increased cariogenic properties and reduced antimicrobial capacities of saliva in NPC patients post-radiotherapy.Copyright © 2016 Pow et al.

3603,"Intra-arterial versus intravenous chemoradiation for advanced head and neck cancer: Results of a randomized phase 3 trial BACKGROUND: Chemoradiation is the preferred treatment for advanced stage IV head and neck cancer. Higher doses of chemotherapy yielded promising results in vitro and vivo, confirmed by intra-arterial (IA) cisplatin-based chemoradiation in phase 2 studies. METHOD(S): Two hundred and thirty-nine patients with (functionally) unresectable head and neck cancer were included, from 2000 to 2004, in a multicenter, randomized phase 3 trial, comparing IA and intravenous chemoradiation. Intravenous chemoradiation comprised 3x100 mg/m 2 cisplatin infusion on Days 1, 22, 43 combined with 70 Gy in 35 daily fractions. The IA chemoradiation treatment arm comprised 4x150 mg/m2 cisplatin administered in the tumor-feeding artery on Days 1, 8, 15, 22, immediately followed by systemic rescue with sodium thiosulfate with the same radiotherapeutic regimen. RESULT(S): Two patients were excluded from analysis because of nontreatment-related death immediately after randomization (n=1) and esophageal carcinoma (n=1). The median follow-up was 33 months 1-104 months. Ninety percent of the patients required tube feeding during treatment. Renal toxicity >grade 2 was 9% in the intravenous compared with 1% in the IA treatment arm (P <= .0001). There was no difference in locoregional control, disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS), between the treatment arms. At 3 years, local control, locoregional control, DFS, and OS was .76, .63, .44, .51 in the IA versus .70, .65, .47, .47 in the intravenous treatment arm, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): Cisplatin-based IA chemoradiation was not superior to intravenous chemoradiation for advanced stage IV head and neck cancer regarding locoregional control and survival. © 2010 American Cancer Society.",Excluded
2716,"Questionnaire Survey of Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant Workers in 2016 on Knowledge and Anxiety About Radiation The results of a survey of radiation workers suggest that they are worried about the effects of radiation exposure on health, and approximately 30% of Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) workers have anxiety. This questionnaire survey reveals that the higher the frequency of radiation education, the higher the knowledge of radiation the workers will have, and that the higher the level of knowledge, the lower the anxiety. To reduce anxiety, it is important to increase knowledge about radiation through radiation education. However, even those workers who had radiation education several times still had anxiety. According to the Ordinance on the Prevention of Ionizing Radiation Hazards, the time spent on education about the effects of radiation on the human body is only about 30 minutes. This education is not enough to reduce anxiety. FDNPP workers needed more effective education to increase their knowledge and to reduce their anxiety.",Excluded
2830,"Ultrasonic backscatter difference measurements of cancellous bone from the human femur: Relation to bone mineral density and microstructure Ultrasonic backscatter techniques are being developed to detect changes in cancellous bone caused by osteoporosis. One technique, called the backscatter difference technique, measures the power difference between two portions of a backscatter signal. The goal of the present study is to investigate how bone mineral density (BMD) and the microstructure of human cancellous bone influence four backscatter difference parameters: the normalized mean of the backscatter difference (nMBD) spectrum, the normalized slope of the backscatter difference spectrum, the normalized intercept of the backscatter difference spectrum, and the normalized backscatter amplitude ratio (nBAR). Ultrasonic measurements were performed with a 3.5MHz broadband transducer on 54 specimens of human cancellous bone from the proximal femur. Volumetric BMD and the microstructural characteristics of the specimens were measured using x-ray micro-computed tomography. Of the four ultrasonic parameters studied, nMBD and nBAR demonstrated the strongest univariate correlations with density and microstructure. Multivariate analyses indicated that nMBD and nBAR depended on trabecular separation and possibly other microstructural characteristics of the specimens independently of BMD. These findings suggest that nMBD and nBAR may be sensitive to changes in the density and microstructure of bone caused by osteoporosis.",Excluded

Consequently, when the atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki an estimated 40,000 Koreans died and 30,000 survived. In 2004, 2,235 Koreans were registered as A-bomb survivors in South Korea. A mail questionnaire survey to evaluate the present status and self-reported diseases of the Korean survivors was conducted. In total, 1,256 questionnaires were returned and analysed. The most frequent chronic diseases reported by Korean survivors were hypertension (40.1 per cent), peptic ulcer disease (25.7 per cent), anaemia (23.3 per cent) and cataracts (23.1 per cent). The most frequent malignant diseases were stomach cancer (1.9 per cent), colon cancer (0.5 per cent) and leukaemia/multiple myeloma (0.4 per cent).

2796,"Economic Analysis of a Three-Arm RCT Exploring the Delivery of Intensive, Prophylactic Swallowing Therapy to Patients with Head and Neck Cancer During (Chemo)Radiotherapy Research advocates for the use of intensive, prophylactic swallowing therapy to help reduce the severity of dysphagia in patients receiving (chemo)radiotherapy ([C]RT) for head/neck cancer (HNC). Unfortunately, the intensity of this therapy, coupled with growing patient numbers and limited clinical resources, provides challenges to many international cancer facilities. Telepractice has been proposed as a potential method to provide patients with greater support in home-practice, whilst minimising burden to the health service. This study investigated the clinical and patient-attributable costs of delivering an intensive, prophylactic swallowing therapy protocol via a new telepractice application ""SwallowIT"" as compared to clinician-directed FTF therapy and independent patient self-directed therapy. Patients (n = 79) with oropharyngeal HNC receiving definitive (C)RT were randomised to receive therapy via a: clinician-directed (n = 26), patient-directed (n = 27), or SwallowIT-assisted (n = 26) model of care. Data pertaining to health service costs (service time, consumables, therapy resources), patient-attributable costs (travel and wages) and patient-reported health-related quality of life (QoL) (AQoL-6D) were collected. SwallowIT provided a cost-efficient model of care when compared to the clinician-directed model, with significant cost savings to both the health service and to HNC consumers (total saving of $1901.10 AUD per patient; p < 0.001). The SwallowIT model also proved more cost-effective than the patient-directed model, yielding clinically significantly superior QoL at the end of (C)RT, for comparable costs. Overall, when compared to the alternate methods of service-delivery, SwallowIT provided a financially viable and cost-effective method for the delivery of intensive, prophylactic swallowing therapy to patients with HNC during (C)RT.Copyright © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded

2956,"CT-Guided Microcoil Localization of Small Peripheral Pulmonary Nodules to Direct Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Resection without the Aid of Intraoperative Fluoroscopy OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of CT-guided microcoil localization of solitary pulmonary nodules (SPNs) for guiding video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between June 2016 and October 2019, 454 consecutive patients with 501 SPNs who received CT-guided microcoil localization before VATS in our institution were enrolled. The diameter of the nodules was 0.93 +/- 0.49 cm, and the shortest distance from the nodules to the pleura was 1.41 +/- 0.95 cm. The distal end of the microcoil was placed less than 1 cm away from the nodule, and the proximal end was placed outside the visceral pleura. VATS was performed under the guidance of implanted microcoils without the aid of intraoperative fluoroscopy. RESULT(S): All 501 nodules were marked with microcoils. The time required for microcoil localization was 12.8 +/- 5.2 minutes. Microcoil localization-related complications occurred in 179 cases (39.4%). None of the complications required treatment. A total of 463 nodules were successfully resected under the guidance of implanted microcoils. VATS revealed 38 patients with dislocated microcoils, of which 28 underwent wedge resection (21 cases under the guidance of the bleeding points of pleural puncture, 7 cases through palpation), 5 underwent direct lobectomy, and the remaining 5 underwent a conversion to thoracotomy. In 4 cases, a portion of the microcoil remained in the lung parenchyma. CONCLUSION(S): CT-guided microcoil localization of SPNs is safe and reliable. Marking the nodule and pleura simultaneously with microcoils can effectively guide the resection of SPNs using VATS without the aid of intraoperative fluoroscopy.Copyright © 2021 The Korean Society of Radiology.",Excluded
2823,"Coronary CT angiography performed by the novel whole organ volumetric high definition CT scanner in patients with atrial fibrillation Objectives: To evaluate the image quality, coronary interpretability and radiation exposure of coronary CT angiography (CCTA) performed with a newest generation of cardiac-CT scanner in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Background(s): Despite the relevant improvement in the CT temporal resolution that characterizes the last scanner generation, the evaluation of coronary arteries by CCTA in patients with AF remains the more challenging application of cardiac- CT, particularly in patients with heart rate (HR) >75 bpm. Moreover, the radiation exposure associated with CT is still very high in this clinical subset. Material(s) and Method(s): 49 patients (30 males, mean age 71,5+/-7,3 years old) with chronic AF undergoing CCTA for suspected CAD by using a novel whole organ volumetric high definition CT scanner (16cm z-axis coverage with 256 detector rows and 512 slices, gantry rotation time 0.28 sec), were enrolled in the study. Prospective ECG-triggering was used in all patients, of whom 20 with double-shot technique and the remaining 29 with single-shot technique. In all patients, image quality score (by a 4-point Likert scale on a per-segment level) and coronary interpretability were evaluated and the effective dose (ED) was recorded. Result(s): The mean HR during the scan was 87.7+/-22 bpm. The overall image quality was very high (Likert=3.4+/-1.2, excellent image quality=451 segments, good=206 segments, adequate=90 segments, poor/non diagnostic=19 segments). The overall coronary interpretability was 97.5% (747/766 segments); in patients performed with double-shot technique, the interpretability was 96.4%, whereas we found an interpretability of 98.4% with single-shot technique. The overall mean ED was 4.6+/-2.1 mSv, while a significantly lower dose (3.6+/-1.5 mSv) was measured for single-shot technique vs. double-shot approach (5.9+/-2.1 mSv, p<0.01). Conclusion(s): The novel whole organ high definition CT scanner allows to evaluate coronary arteries with high image quality and coronary interpretability and low radiation exposure in patients with atrial fibrillation and high HR during the scan.",Excluded
3327,"Quantitative changes in respiratory enzyme activity in premalignant lesions and experimentally irradiated skin Chronic exposure of human skin to solar irradiation results in a variety of preneoplastic and frankly neoplastic skin lesions. We have shown that in solar keratoses (SK) and in paralesional skin there is instead of an even distribution of succinic dehydrogenase (SDH) activity a relative decreased activity in the granular cell layer. Furthermore, there is enhancement of the usual concentration of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) activity in the granular zone as well as an increase in total G6PDH epidermal activity. In the experimental part of this study, six normal volunteer subjects had areas of normally non exposed skin (buttocks) irradiated with a 2 Mean erythema dose of ultra violet light (290--400 nm) on between 3 and 5 occasions per week for 2--6 week periods. The results obtained indicated that the same changes in enzyme activity localization take place in artificially irradiated normally non exposed epidermis as seen in normally exposed skin nearby actinic keratoses. It is suggested that these quantitative changes may be the basis of a model for the study of chronic ultra violet light damage to the epidermis.",Excluded
2501,"The features of bone metabolism in patients with periodontal diseases Background The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between bone metabolic disturbances and periodontal diseases Objectives Several studies discuss the relationship between systemic bone mineral density (BMD) and periodontal diseases. Osteoporosis or low systemic BMD should be considered as the risk factor for periodontal disease progression. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of bone metabolism on the periodontal status in the patients. Methods The study included 89 patients (38 men and 51 women, mean age - 43.5+/-5.1 years) with the healthy periodontal status (HPS) and 231 patients (108 men and 123 women, mean age - 45.6+/-5.2 years) with generalized periodontitis (GP). Clinical conditions of periodontal tissue and radiographic determinations (panoramic X-Ray) were evaluated. Skeletal systemic BMD was measured by DXA. Metabolic processes of bone tissue were evaluated by bone turnover markers: bone tissue formation - osteocalcin (OC), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) in serum and bone tissue resorption marker - deoxypiridinoline (DPD) in urine. Results Comparative analysis of structural and functional state of bone tissue in patients showed a mineral density reduction in GP group compared to HPS, but these changes were not statistically significant. Disorders of bone tissue metabolism and dissociation in the processes of bone tissue remodeling were determined in patients with GP. The OC level in the patients with GP (18.89+/-0.87 ng/ml in men and 20.39+/-1.14 ng/ml in women) was statistically significantly (p<0.01) lower compared to the HPS group (24.14+/-1.04 ng/ml in men and 27.56+/-1.12 ng/ml in women). BAP show significant differences between groups. The level of DPD in the GP group (5.78+/-0.79 mmol in men, 8.34+/-0.56 mmol in women) was significantly higher (p<0.01) compared to HPS group (3.57+/-1.12 mmol in men, 4.47+/-0.76 mmol in women).

The novel tSS was utilized to quantify targeted-PCI complexity., METHODS: We studied 420 consecutive patients who had PCI in our hospital. Two investigators independently measured tSS using the SYNTAX scoring algorithm. Patients were divided into three BMI (kg/m(2) ) subgroups: <25 (normal), 25-30 (overweight), and >30 (obese); and tSS tertiles: <5.5 (simple), 5.5-9 (moderate), and >9 (complex)., RESULTS: Obese patients were significantly younger and likely to have diabetes mellitus (DM). tSS positively correlated with RD for both genders, with median RD significantly higher in males (P < 0.0001). tSS correlated with RD in all three BMI subgroups (all P < 0.0001). Multivariate linear regression showed RD can be predicted by the formula: RD = -898 + 18 tSS + 49 BMI + 142 DM + 207 male., CONCLUSIONS: We report that tSS is a quantitative index of ""target-lesion"" PCI complexity, which is easy to measure with good reproducibility. tSS significantly and independently correlates with RD, although the strength of the association is less than for other predictors of RD (gender, diabetes, and BMI). tSS may be used to determine the RD from PCI and enhance patient risk-stratification when formulating a PCI strategy.

3497,"Radiation dose optimization of a dual tracer PET/CT protocol for multiple myeloma: A Whole body ultra-low dose CT Aim/Introduction: To design an optimized dual-tracer PET/CT protocol for multiple myeloma and to retrospectively review the radiation dose received by patients who underwent this procedure. Material(s) and Method(s): In a research project carried out in our PET department, a dual-tracer PET/CT scan covering head to feet and a whole-body low dose CT (WBLDCT) were prescribed for patients with multiple myeloma. For the scope of optimization, PET/CT and WBLDCT were merged in a one-stop-shop. Thus, FDG PET/CT included a diagnostic CT (WBLDCT: 120 kV-80 mAs) while MET PET/ CT included a CT dedicated only for attenuation correction, referred as whole body ultra-low dose CT (WBULDCT: 100 kV-40 mAs). Both PET/CT scans covered the whole patient from head to feet, in supine position with the arms beside the body. Thirty-one patients with proven multiple myeloma who underwent this protocol were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic data and dose parameters (doselength product, DLP) were recorded. Effective doses were calculated with CT-Expo for the CT component and with dose coefficients for the PET contribution (0.019 mSv/MBq for FDG and 0.0084 mSv/MBq for MET). Result(s): We analyzed 31 patients, 23 males and 8 females, aged 59 +/- 10 years, with BMI 27.0 +/- 3.8 kg/m2. DLP expressed as median (interquartile range, IQR) was 790 (IQR: 282) mGy.cm for WBLDCT and 262 (IQR: 123) mGy.cm for WBULDCT (p<0.0001). Patients received a median effective dose of 6.4 (IQR: 2.0) mSv from the WBLDCT and 2.1 (IQR: 0.8) mSv from the WBULDCT (p<0.0001). Patients were administered 327 +/- 75 MBq of FDG and 469 +/- 50 MBq of MET. The resultant effective doses (mean +/- standard deviation) were 6.2 +/- 1.4 mSv and 3.9 +/- 0.4 mSv, respectively. Total effective dose for each PET/ CT was 12.7 +/- 3.0 mSv for FDG and 6.1 +/- 0.8 mSv for MET. Conclusion(s): In this protocol for multiple myeloma evaluation, radiation dose optimization achieved due to both, the merge of nuclear medicine and radiological examinations, and to the inclusion of a WBULDCT (with a 66.7% dose reduction respect to the WBLDCT), entailed a great benefit for the patients. An effort in reviewing each PET/CT indication could lead to the customization and optimization of protocols and to the subsequent dose reduction.",Excluded
3670,"Prospective comparison study of 532/1064 nm picosecond laser vs 532/1064 nm nanosecond laser in the treatment of professional tattoos in asians Background and Aims: Although, the pulse width should be shorter than the thermal relaxation time of the target, nanosecond laser pulses are not short enough for tattoo removal. Complications are common, such as hyper or hypopigmentation, textural changes, and scarring. Moreover, patients with darker skin types are at a higher risk of complications from tattoo removal using these lasers. Picosecond lasers were developed to overcome the limitation of nanosecond lasers. We did a comparison study of a 532/1064 nm picosecond laser vs a 532/1064 nm nanosecond laser to evaluate the clinical efficacy and complications of multi-color tattoos in Asians. Material(s) and Method(s): Eleven Asian patients with 37 professional tattoos were enrolled in the study. Each patient was treated with a 532/1064 nm nanosecond laser and a 532/1064 nm picosecond laser. The spot size that was used with each laser was 3 mm. Four treatments were performed, with four week intervals between each treatment. Patients were examined a week after the first treatment and 3 months after the last treatment. Results and Conclusion(s): All patients tolerated the treatments well. The efficacy of the 1064 nm picosecond laser for black tattoos is significantly better than the other studied lasers. The efficacy of the 532 nm picosecond laser is significantly better than the other studied lasers for red tattoos. The efficacy of the 532 nm picosecond laser is significantly better than the 532 nm nanosecond laser and better than the 1064 nm picosecond laser for green tattoos. Mild to moderate post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation was observed in 35.1%, 24.3% 27.0%, and 21.6% of the tattoos treated with the 532 nm nanosecond laser, the 532 nm picosecond laser, the 1064 nm nanosecond laser, and the 1064 nm pico-second laser, respectively. Paradoxical darkening (5.4%) was observed equally with each type of laser. There was no scar formation in any of the tattoos treated. The 532/1064 nm picosecond laser is more effective than the 532/1064 nm nanosecond laser in the treatment of multi-color tattoos in Asians. The 532 nm picosecond laser is more effective than 1064 nm picosecond laser in every tattoo color, with the exception of black. Paradoxical darkening was observed, even the use of picosecond lasers.Copyright © 2020 JMLL, Tokyo, Japan.",Excluded

2601,"Delayed non-myeloablative irradiation after lung transplantation to induce allograft acceptance in a large animal model Purpose: Previously, we induced long term tolerance in animals that underwent perioperative irradiation and a donor-specific alloantigen infusion in our miniature swine lung transplantation model. Here, we delayed induction to improve its clinical applicability. Method(s): Left sided single lung transplantation from MHC mismatched male donors was performed in 11 female outbred minipigs. Group 1 (n= 5) received non-myeloablative irradiation (7 Gy thymus and 1,5 Gy whole body, IRR) 12 hours before transplantation and perioperative donor-specific splenocyte infusion (SpTx). Group 2 (n= 3) also received a perioperative SpTx, but underwent delayed irradiation 3 days after transplantation. Group 3 (n= 3) was also exposed to delayed IRR but did not receive a donor-specific SpTx. Immunosuppression was maintained for 28 days with tacrolimus and methylprednisolone. Peripheral blood chimerism was monitored by flow cytometry and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Result(s): In group 1, three animals never rejected their grafts until elective sacrifice at postoperative days (POD) 800+, the other two showed rejection on POD 239 and 360. In group 2, median allograft survival was 92 days. Out of the third group, one animal showed rejection on POD 226, the other two are currently alive at POD 216 and 393. In all groups, chimerism was detectable 1 hour after reperfusion of the lung, and peaked 1 hour after SpTx in groups 1 and 2. Group 1 showed early leukocyte chimerism levels of up to 30%. Analysis of putative regulatory CD4+CD25 high T cells revealed a rising tendency in group 1, whereas groups 2 and 3 had decreasing levels of this T cell subpopulation after withdrawal of immunosuppression. Conclusion(s): Preoperative irradiation and perioperative SpTx had the potential to upregulate the frequency of putative regulatory CD4+CD25 high T cells. SpTx without preceding IRR seemed to rather upregulate the effector arm, than inducing Treg proliferation. Delayed IRR only may lead to prolonged allograft survival in all three animals.

The impact of these incidental findings on patient management is unclear., PURPOSE: The goals of our study were to determine the impact of reporting CAC on patient management and to determine whether standardized reporting of CAC affects the likelihood of future interventions., METHODS: In this IRB-approved retrospective study, we queried our LCS database for reports of LDCT performed between January 2016 and September 2018. All reports with significant findings of CAC designated with the letter ""S"" for any Lung-RADS category were selected. The grading of CAC was extracted from the reports. Medical records were reviewed for each patient to determine demographics, clinical history, medications, and cardiac-related diagnostic and interventional procedures. The changes in management after the report of significant CAC on LDCT were documented. Statistical analysis with Student t test and Pearson chi test was performed., RESULTS: A total of 756/3110 patients (mean age: 67+/-6.4 y; M=466, 61.6%: F=290, 38.4%) were reported to have significant CAC on LDCT for LCS. Of them, 236/756 patients (31.2%) had established coronary artery disease (CAD) at baseline, before the initial LDCT. A change in management was observed in 155/756 patients (20.5%). The most common changes in management included the following: alteration in medication regimen (n=114/155, 73.5%), stress testing (n=65/155, 41.9%), and referral to a cardiologist (36/155, 23.2%). Percutaneous coronary intervention (4, 2.6%) and surgery (3, 1.9%) were uncommon. Changes in management were more common in those without established CAD and in those whose CAC was semiquantitatively graded (35% vs. 25%, P=0.02)., CONCLUSION: CAC is a common significant finding in LDCT for LCS. Reporting of CAC in patients with nonestablished CAD and semiquantitative assessment resulted in changes in management.",Excluded
3316,"Gene expression signatures of radiation exposure in peripheral white blood cells of smokers and non-smokers Purpose: The issue of potential confounding factors is critical to the development of any approach to radiation biodosimetry, and has not been fully addressed for gene expression-based approaches. Material(s) and Method(s): As a step in this direction, we have investigated the effect of smoking on the global radiation gene expression response in ex vivo-irradiated peripheral blood cells using microarray analysis. We also evaluated the ability of gene expression signatures to predict the radiation exposure level of ex vivo-exposed samples from smokers and non-smokers of both genders. Result(s): We identified eight genes with a radiation response that was significantly affected by smoking status, and confirmed an effect of smoking on the radiation response of the four and a half LIM domains 2 (FHL2) gene using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The performance of our previously defined 74-gene signature in predicting the radiation dose to samples in this study was unaffected by differences in gender or smoking status, however, giving 98% correct prediction of dose category. This is the same accuracy as that found in the original study from which the signature was derived, using different donors. Conclusion(s): The results support the development of peripheral blood gene expression as a viable strategy for radiation biodosimetry. © 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.",Excluded

Two hundred patients were prospectively selected. Of these, 100 were subjected to percutaneous procedure with the use of Sirio and 100 to traditional CT-guided percutaneous procedure. The two methods were compared in terms of absorbed dose, procedure time, complications, and number of non-diagnostic specimens (diagnostic success)., RESULTS: Sirio has shown a significant reduction in the absorbed dose and procedure times (p < 0.05), with a lower incidence of complications compared to the traditional procedure. Sirio has also allowed to carry out biopsies of lesions' diameter <=10 mm, obtaining fewer non diagnostic specimens thus resulting more effective in terms of diagnostic success., CONCLUSIONS: The use of Sirio in sampling biopsy showed a statistically significant reduction in terms of performed scans and procedural time with lower incidence of post-procedural complications compared to the traditional percutaneous procedure, especially for lesions <=10 mm. The best diagnostic result, the reduction of the dose absorbed and procedural complications makes the procedures more reliable, safety and less invasive. In addition, the reduction of execution time will increase the number of daily interventional procedures improving clinical management.",Excluded
2974,"A Two-step intensity-modulated radiation therapy method for nasopharyngeal cancer: The Kinki University experience Objective: The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical results of our adaptive radiation therapy scheme of a two-step intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) method for nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) at Kinki University Hospital. Method(s): Between 2000 and 2007, 35 patients with Stage I-IVB NPC treated by IMRT were included. For all patients, treatment-planning computed tomography was done twice before and during IMRT to a total dose of 60-70 Gy/28-35 fractions (median 68 Gy). Chemotherapy (cisplatin 80 mg/m2/3 weeks x 1-3 courses) was given concurrently with IMRT for 31 patients. Result(s): The 3- and 5-year overall survival rates for the 31 patients treated with concurrent chemotherapy were 88% and 83%, respectively. The 3- and 5-year loco-regional control rates for the 31 patients were 93% and 87%, respectively. Planning target volume delineation for the primary site or involved nodes was insufficient for three early cases, resulting in marginal recurrence in the three patients (9%). Except for one patient with early death, xerostomia scores at 1-2 years were: Grade 0, 11; Grade 1, 17; Grade 2, 5; Grade 3, 1. Conclusion(s): Excellent overall survival and loco-regional control rates were obtained by a two-step IMRT method with concurrent chemotherapy for NPC, although marginal recurrence was noted in some early cases. © The Author (2009).

3617,"Definitive high-dose photon/proton radiotherapy for unresected mobile spine and sacral chordomas Study Design.: A retrospective review. Objective.: The purpose of this study is to report the results of high-dose proton based definitive radiotherapy for unresected spinal chordomas. Summary of Background Data.: Spine chordoma is treated primarily by surgical resection. However, local recurrence rate is high. Adjuvant radiotherapy improves local control. In certain locations, such as high sacrum, resection may result in significant neurological dysfunction. Methods.: We retrospectively reviewed 24 patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated spinal chordomas (core biopsy only; no prior incision or resection) treated with high-dose definitive radiotherapy alone using protons and photons at our center from 1988 to 2009. Results.: Reasons for radiotherapy alone included medical inoperability (3) and concern for neurological dysfunction based on spine level (21). Median age was 69.5 years. Tumor locations included cervical (2), thoracic (1), lumbar (2), S1-S2 (17), and S3 or below (2). Median maximal tumor diameter was 6.6 cm (1.4-25.5), and median tumor volume was 198.3 cm (4.65-2061). Median total dose was 77.4 GyRBE (proton dose unit, gray relative biological effectiveness). Analysis at median follow-up of 56 months showed overall survival of 91.7% and 78.1%, chordoma specific survival of 95.7% and 81.5%, local progression free survival of 90.4% and 79.8% and metastases free survival of 86.5% and 76.3%, at 3 and 5 years respectively. Tumor volume more than 500 cm was correlated with worse overall survival. Long-term side effects included 8 sacral insufficiency fractures (none required surgical stabilization), 1 secondary malignancy, 1 foot drop, 1 erectile dysfunction, 1 perineal numbness, 2 worsening urinary/fecal incontinence, and 4 grade-2 rectal bleeding. None required new colostomy. All surviving patients remained ambulatory. Conclusion.: These results support the use of high-dose definitive radiotherapy for patients with medically inoperable or otherwise unresected, mobile spine or sacrococcygeal chordomas.

3461,"Optimization of 64-MDCT urography: Effect of dual-phase imaging with furosemide on collecting system opacification and radiation dose OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to compare opacification of the urinary collecting system and radiation dose associated with three-phase 64-MDCT urographic protocols and those associated with a split-bolus dual-phase protocol including furosemide. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Images from 150 CT urographic examinations performed with three scanning protocols were retrospectively evaluated. Group A consisted of 50 sequentially registered patients who underwent a three-phase protocol with saline infusion. Group B consisted of 50 sequentially registered patients who underwent a reduced-radiation three-phase protocol with saline. Group C consisted of 50 sequentially registered patients who underwent a dual-phase split-bolus protocol that included a low-dose furosemide injection. Opacification of the urinary collecting system was evaluated with segmental binary scoring. Contrast artifacts were evaluated, and radiation doses were recorded. Results were compared by analysis of variance. RESULTS. A significant reduction in mean effective radiation dose was found between groups A and B (p < 0.001) and between groups B and C (p < 0.001), resulting in 65% reduction between groups A and C (p < 0.001). This reduction did not significantly affect opacification score in any of the 12 urinary segments (p = 0.079). In addition, dense contrast artifacts overlying the renal parenchyma observed with the three-phase protocols (groups A and B) were avoided with the dual-phase protocol (group C) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION. A dual-phase protocol with furosemide injection is the preferable technique for CT urography. In comparison with commonly used three-phase protocols, the dualphase protocol significantly reduces radiation exposure dose without reduction in image quality. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded
2526,"Arterial Stiffness as a Biomarker of Radiation-Induced Carotid Atherosclerosis Arterial stiffness is thought to be a precursor to atherosclerosis. Conventional arterial stiffness parameters as potential biomarkers of radiation-induced damage were investigated. Patients with head and neck cancer treated with radiotherapy >=2 years previously to one side of the neck were included. The unirradiated side was the internal control. Beta stiffness index (B) and elastic modulus (Ep) were used to assess arterial stiffness and were measured in proximal, mid, and distal common carotid artery (CCA) and compared with the corresponding unirradiated segments. Fifty patients (68% male; median age 58 years; interquartile range 50-62) were included. Mean +/- standard deviation maximum doses to irradiated and unirradiated arteries were 53 +/- 13 and 1.9 +/- 3.7 Gy, respectively. Differences in B were not significant. Significant differences in Ep were demonstrated-proximal CCA: 1301 +/- 1223 versus 801 +/- 492 (P < .0001), mid CCA: 1064 +/- 818 versus 935.5 +/- 793 (P < .0001), and distal CCA: 1267 +/- 1084 versus 775.3 +/- 551.9 (P < .0001). Surgery had no impact on arterial stiffness. Arterial stiffness is increased in irradiated arteries, in keeping with radiation-induced damage.

However, to date, there is no studies quantifying the effective dose during MIS-TLIF procedure, and the radiation dose distribution is still unclear. In this study, the surgeons' radiation doses at 5 places on the bodies were measured and the effective doses were assessed during 31 consecutive 1- to 3-level MIS-TLIF surgeries. The operating surgeon, assisting surgeon, and radiological technologist wore thermoluminescent dosimeter on the unshielded thyroid, chest, genitals, right middle finger, and on the chest beneath a lead apron. The doses at the lens and the effective doses were also calculated. Mean fluoroscopy times were 38.7, 53.1, and 58.5 seconds for 1, 2, or 3 fusion levels, respectively. The operating surgeon's mean exposures at the lens, thyroid, chest, genitals, finger, and the chest beneath the shield, respectively, were 0.07, 0.07, 0.09, 0.14, 0.32, and 0.05 mSv in 1-level MIS-TLIF; 0.07, 0.08, 0.09, 0.18, 0.34, and 0.05 mSv in 2-level; 0.08, 0.09, 0.14, 0.15, 0.36, and 0.06 mSv in 3-level; and 0.07, 0.08, 0.10, 0.15, 0.33, and 0.05 mSv in all cases. Mean dose at the operating surgeon's right finger was significantly higher than other measurements parts (P,0.001). The operating surgeon's effective doses (0.06, 0.06, and 0.07 mSv for 1, 2, and 3 fusion levels) were low, and didn't differ significantly from those of the assisting surgeon or radiological technologist. Revision MIS-TLIF was not associated with higher surgeons' radiation doses compared to primary MIS-TLIF. There were significantly higher surgeons' radiation doses in over-weight than in normal-weight patients. The surgeons' radiation exposure during MIS-TLIF was within the safe level by the International Commission on Radiological Protection's guidelines. The accumulated radiation exposure, especially to surgeon's hands, should be carefully monitored. © 2014 Funao et al.",Excluded
2463,"Rapid detection of radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations in lymphocytes and hematopoietic progenitor cells by mFISH Structural chromosome aberrations (SCAs) are sensitive indicators of a preceding exposure of the hematopoietic system to ionizing radiation. Cytogenetic investigations have therefore become routine tools for an assessment of absorbed radiation doses and their biological effects after occupational exposure or radiation accidents.Due to its speed and ease of use, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with whole chromosome painting (WCP) probes has become a method of choice to visualize SCAs. Until recently, this technique was limited to a rather small number of chromosomes, which could be tested simultaneously. As a result, only a fraction of the structural aberrations present in a sample could be detected and the overall dose effect had to be calculated by extrapolation. The recent introduction of two genome-wide screening techniques in tumor research, i.e., Spectral Karyotyping (SKY) and multicolor FISH (mFISH) now allows the detection of translocations involving any two non-homologous chromosomes.The present study was prompted by our desire to bring the power of mFISH to bear for the rapid identification of radiation-induced SCAs. We chose two model systems to investigate the utility of mFISH: lymphocytes that were exposed in vitro to 3 Gy photons and single hematopoietic progenitor cell colonies isolated from a Chernobyl victim 9 years after in vivo exposure to 5.4 Sv.In lymphocytes, we found up to 15 different chromosomes involved in rearrangements indicating complex radiation effects. Stable aberrations detected in hematopoietic cell colonies, on the other hand, showed involvement of up to three different chromosomes. These results demonstrated that mFISH is a rapid and powerful approach to detect and characterize radiation-induced SCAs in the hemopoietic system. The application of mFISH is expected to result in a more detailed and, thus, more informative picture of radiation effects. Eventually, this technique will allow researchers to rapidly delineate chromosomal breakpoints and facilitate the identification of the genes involved in radiation tumorigenesis.

Data from the 64 row and the 320 row detector CT scanners was used to determine lifetime attributable risks (LAR) of cancer based on the biological effects of ionizing radiation (BEIR) VII report., RESULTS: The relative reduction of LAR (%) for 50-, 60-, and 70-year-old patients undergoing scanning with the 320 row detector CT scanner was 30% lower for lung, and more than 50% lower for female breast when compared with results from 64 row detector CT scanner. The use of 320 row detector CT would result in a combined cumulative cancer incidence of less than 1/500 for breast in women and less than 1/1000 for lung in men; By comparison, this is much lower than other more common risk factors: 16-fold for lung cancer in persistent smokers, 2-fold for breast cancer with a first degree family member history of breast cancer, and 10-fold for thyroid cancer with a family member with thyroid cancer. Decennial screening would benefit at least 355,000 patients from sudden cardiac death each year, 94% of whom have significant coronary artery disease, with at least one stenosis >75%. LAR for thyroid cancer was negligible for both scanners., CONCLUSION: Lung and female breast LAR reductions with 320 row detector compared with 64 row detector CT are substantial, and the benefits would outweigh increased cancer risks with decennial screening in the age group of 50-70 years.",Excluded

We investigated the relationship between OA and serum adiponectin levels according to the radiographic features of knee and hand OA. A total of 2402 subjects was recruited from the Dong-gu Study. Baseline characteristics were collected via a questionnaire, and X-rays of knee and hand joints were scored using a semi-quantitative grading system. The relationship between serum adiponectin levels and radiographic severity was evaluated by linear and logistic regression analysis. Subjects in the higher serum adiponectin levels tertiles were older and had a lower body mass index (BMI) than those in the lower tertiles. Regarding knee joint scores, serum adiponectin levels was positively associated with the total (P<0.001), osteophyte (P=0.003), and joint space narrowing (JSN) scores (P<0.001) after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption, education, and physical activity. In terms of hand joint scores, no association was found between serum adiponectin levels and the total, osteophyte, JSN, subchondral cyst, sclerosis, erosion, or malalignment score after the above-mentioned adjustments. Similarly, subjects with serum adiponectin levels above the median had higher total radiographic scores in the knee joints, but not in the hand joints, after adjustment.

3216,"Cardiac-CTand transoesophageal echocardiography comparison for left atrial appendage clots detection in patients referred for left atrial interventional procedures Introduction: Left atrial appendage (LAA) was identified as a main location of clots formation (91% in non-valvular AF), and it is related with stroke and systemic embolic events. Presence of LAA clots is a contraindication to left atrial interventional procedures as pulmonary veins isolation or LAA percutaneous closure. Transoeophageal echocardiography (TEE) is the gold standard technique for exclude LAA clots, but other imaging modalities are emerging for this indication. Our aim was compare TEE and CT diagnostic performance for exclude LAA thrombus in patients referred for left atrium interventional procedure. Material(s) and Method(s): All patients studied with TEE (Philips EPIQ-7) and CT (Philips iCT-256) previous LAA percutaneous closure or pulmonary vein isolation procedures between May/2015 and May/2016 were included. LAA was studied with TTE in mid-esophageal views at 0degree, 45degree, 90degree, 135degree. LAA clot, spontaneous echo-contrast and low LAA velocities were assessed with TEE. CT was performed in two-phase scan (early arterial and venous phase with 70-90 sec delay), for detect filling defects in one or both phases. Result(s): 52 patients were included (67+/-15 years, 75% male). Main structural values were LV ejection fraction 57+/-11%, LA indexed volume 84 ml/m2, atrial fibrillation prevalence 46%. Procedure indication was 50% for LAA closure and 50% for pulmonary veins isolation. TEE detected 1.9% LAA clot (one patient), spontaneous echo-contrast 17,3% and low LAA velocities at 9.6%. Assessment with CT detected 1.9% LAA clot (1 case) and arterial defect at 17.3%. LAA clots cases are no coincident between both techniques (Pearson 0.02 p-value 0.889). Spontaneous echo-contrast was detected in 9 patients with TEE, 6 of them had arterial defect also at CT. On the other hand, arterial defect was detected at 9 with CT, 6 of them with spontaneous echo-contrast at TEE (Pearson 0.595 p-value <0.001). After comparison between indications there were differences in LAA defects prevalence. Previous LAA closure, TEE and CT detected thrombus at 3.8% (1 case) but are no coincident. TEE prevalence of spontaneous echo-contrast 30.8% and low flow velocity 19.2%; while with CT arterial defect 30.8% (Pearson 0.632 p-value 0-001). Previous pulmonary vein isolation TEE no detected any LAA defects and CT detected arterial defect but not at venous phase in one patient. Security data related with CT were 75 ml average of ionidated contrast (Visipaque 320mg), and a mean of radiation dose of 4.4 mSv. Conclusion(s): In our sample, LAA clots had a low prevalence. Both techniques detected a clot which it was no detected by the other modality. Instead, assessment of spontaneous echo-contrast or arterial defects had a moderate diagnostic correlation. A combined strategy with both techniques could improve the accuracy of LAA thrombus exclusion, especially in patients with LAA closure indication.",Excluded
3485,"The patient's experience of defaecating proctography: Comparing magnetic resonance with conventional fluoroscopy techniques Introduction: Fluoroscopy and MRI are currently used to investigate defaecation and pelvic floor dysfunction, with advantages and disadvantages to both modalities. Anecdotally it is suspected that MRI, allowing more privacy, may be better tolerated by patients but that symptoms may be more easily replicated with fluoroscopic technique due to the physiological position. The aim of this study was to evaluate the patient experience of both techniques to potentially help guide the choice of defaecating proctography modality in the future. Method(s): This prospective study was conducted June 2015-March 2017 in a large teaching hospital. Patients undergoing fluoroscopy (FDP) or MR defaecating proctography (MRDP) completed a post-procedure questionnaire rating their satisfaction (1-5, 5 being most satisfied) of different aspects of the test. Result(s): 24 patients underwent FDP and 17 MRDP. Both procedures were scored highly in general for all questions with mean >4.1 and median 5, out of 5. Though not statistically significant, the mean scores for all aspects of the test were slightly higher for fluoroscopy than MR. As well as scoring higher for comfort (4.8 vs 4.4) and dignity maintained (4.6 vs 4.1), the patients who underwent fluoroscopy thought it was easier to replicate symptoms than the patient who underwent MR defaecating proctography (4.6 vs 4.2). Conclusion(s): This study shows that both FDP and MRDP are well tolerated in the investigation of defaecation and pelvic floor dysfunction. FDP was scored consistently higher than MRDP, but this was not statistically significant. Thus, this study suggests that patient tolerance of the test is unlikely to be any worse for FDP than for MRDP. Clinicians and radiologists should take into account risks of radiation exposure as well as potential for surgical management when making their decision as to which test is appropriate. The authors recommend that if the patient is unable to replicate their symptoms in MRDP, fluoroscopy should be performed to ensure significant pathology is not being missed.Copyright © 2018",Excluded

All these employees are known to have been involved in dealing with the fire itself, or in the clean-up operation afterwards. The size of the study population is small, leading to predicted low power to reveal any effects, but the cohort is of interest because of the involvement of the workers in the accident. For 1957-97, using rates for England and Wales to calculate the expected numbers, the all causes standardised mortality ratio (SMR) is 100 (observed = 258, expected = 258.80), and the all malignant neoplasms SMR is 79 (observed = 58, expected = 73.12) which is not significantly different from 100. For 1971-91, the all malignant neoplasms standardised registration ratio (SRR) of 85 (observed = 59, expected = 69.23) is not significantly different from 100.

Here, we report, through in vitro studies and in vivo human pilot clinical studies, the use of inert, inorganic silica-gold nanoshells for the treatment of a widely prevalent and researched, yet poorly treated disease of acne. We use ~ 150 nm silica-gold nanoshells, tuned to absorb near-IR light and near-IR laser irradiation to thermally disrupt overactive sebaceous glands in the skin which define the etiology of acne-related problems. Low-frequency ultrasound was used to facilitate deep glandular penetration of the nanoshells. Upon delivery of the nanoshells into the follicles and glands, followed by wiping of superficial nanoshells from skin surface and exposure of skin to near-infrared laser, nanoshells localized in the follicles absorb light, get heated, and induce focal thermolysis of sebaceous glands. Pilot human clinical studies confirmed the efficacy of ultrasonically-delivered silica-gold nanoshells in inducing photothermal disruption of sebaceous glands without damaging collateral skin.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
3365,"Dynamic visual acuity during walking after long-duration spacefl ight Introduction: Astronauts experience alterations in gaze control as a result of adaptive changes in eye-head coordination produced by microgravity exposure. This may lead to potential changes in postfl ight visual acuity during head and body motion. Method(s): We gathered dynamic visual acuity (DVA) data from 14 astronauts and cosmonauts after longduration (~6 mo) stays in space. Walking was used to induce self-motion and visual acuity was determined by sequentially presenting Landolt ring optotypes on a computer display placed 4 m in front of subjects. Acuity assessments were made while seated (static condition) and walking (dynamic condition) at 6.4 km . h-1 on a motorized treadmill. In each condition, a psychophysical threshold detection algorithm minimized the required number of optotype presentations by maximizing the amount displayed around the subject's acuity threshold. The difference between static and dynamic acuity measures provided a metric of change in the subjects' ability to maintain gaze fi xation on the visual target while walking. Result(s): A decrement in postfl ight visual acuity during walking was found. A mean dynamic acuity decrement of approximately 0.75 eye-chart lines was observed 1 d after returning from space. The population mean showed a consistent improvement in DVA performance during the fi rst postfl ight week. Discussion(s): The recovery curves for individual subjects did not necessarily follow a pattern of continuous improvement with each passing day.

Estimated erythemal solar UV exposure in the 6 weeks before blood collection best predicted serum 25(OH)D concentrations. Serum 25(OH)D rose with increasing personal solar UV exposure to a maximum of about 89 nmol L(-1) at an estimated mean weekly solar erythemal UV exposure of about 1230 mJ cm(-2). The maximum was the same after accounting for clothing coverage and was reached at an estimated whole body equivalent exposure to ambient UV of ca 700 mJ cm(-2). These results suggest that an average maximum serum 25(OH)D of ca 89 nmol L(-1) is achieved from sun exposure in a healthy Australian adult population. Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

3003,"Dosimetry-based treatment for Graves' disease Objective The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the long-Term outcome of a personalized dosimetry approach in Graves' disease aiming to render patients euthyroid from a planned thyroid absorbed dose of 60 Gy. Patients and methods A total of 284 patients with Graves' disease were followed prospectively following administration of radioiodine calculated to deliver an absorbed dose of 60 Gy. Patients with cardiac disease were excluded. Outcomes were analysed at yearly intervals for up to 10 years with a median follow-up of 37.5 months. Results A single radioiodine administration was sufficient to render a patient either euthyroid or hypothyroid in 175 (62%) patients, the remainder requiring further radioiodine. The median radioactivity required to deliver 60 Gy was 77 MBq. Less than 2% patients required 400-600 MBq, the standard activity administered in many centres. In the cohort receiving a single administration, 38, 32 and 26% were euthyroid on no specific thyroid medication at 3, 5 and 10 years, respectively. Larger thyroid volumes were associated with the need for further therapy. The presence of nodules on ultrasonography did not adversely affect treatment outcome. Conclusion A personalized dosimetric approach delayed the long-Term onset of hypothyroidism in 26% of patients. This was achieved using much lower administered activities than currently recommended. Future studies will aim to identify those patients who would benefit most from this approach.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",Excluded
3478,"Imaging for appendicitis: should radiation-induced cancer risks affect modality selection? PURPOSE: To compare life expectancy (LE) losses attributable to three imaging strategies for appendicitis in adults-computed tomography (CT), ultrasonography (US) followed by CT for negative or indeterminate US results, and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-by using a decision-analytic model., MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this model, for each imaging strategy, LE losses for 20-, 40-, and 65-year-old men and women were computed as a function of five key variables: baseline cohort LE, test performance, surgical mortality, risk of death from delayed diagnosis (missed appendicitis), and LE loss attributable to radiation-induced cancer death. Appendicitis prevalence, test performance, mortality rates from surgery and missed appendicitis, and radiation doses from CT were elicited from the published literature and institutional data. LE loss attributable to radiation exposure was projected by using a separate organ-specific model that accounted for anatomic coverage during a typical abdominopelvic CT examination. One- and two-way sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate effects of model input variability on results., RESULTS: Outcomes across imaging strategies differed minimally-for example, for 20-year-old men, corresponding LE losses were 5.8 days (MR imaging), 6.8 days (combined US and CT), and 8.2 days (CT). This order was sensitive to differences in test performance but was insensitive to variation in radiation-induced cancer deaths. For example, in the same cohort, MR imaging sensitivity had to be 91% at minimum (if specificity were 100%), and MR imaging specificity had to be 62% at minimum (if sensitivity were 100%) to incur the least LE loss. Conversely, LE loss attributable to radiation exposure would need to decrease by 74-fold for combined US and CT, instead of MR imaging, to incur the least LE loss., CONCLUSION: The specific imaging strategy used to diagnose appendicitis minimally affects outcomes. Paradigm shifts to MR imaging owing to concerns over radiation should be considered only if MR imaging test performance is very high.",Excluded
3113,"Establishing a local computed tomography dose reference level for adults based on acceptable quality dose approach Introduction The present study attempted to establish local Computed Tomography DRL by collecting radiation doses of the three most frequently performed CT examinations at our institute. The present study focuses on the local DRLs which are based on clinical indications as the main determinants of patient radiation dose in correlation with acceptable image quality within facility. Method The present study included a total 125 patient imaged on Helical MDCT Ingenuity (Philips Healthcare, Cleveland, USA) 42 detector rows 128 slice. The CT examinations performed were for CT head for acute stroke, routine chest CT and routine abdomen CT examinations. A set of common data was collected for each CT examinations such as patient ID, age, weight, beam width, rotational time, image quality score (IQS). The CT dose parameters displayed CTDIvol and DLP were also measured for scout image and diagnostic CT respectively during each single phase CT examination. The median value was calculated for individual clinical CT examination based on standard of adequate image quality. Results The patients underwent CT in this study were in the range of 25 to 70 years of age with mean +/- SD age (49.8 +/- 15.3). The medium DLP calculated was 1195.8 mGy.cm, 333.2 mGy.cm and 512.9 mGy.cm for acute stroke head, routine chest and routine abdomen CT examination respectively for IQS of 3. The scout image median DLP calculated was 4.2 mGy.cm, 3.8 mGy.cm and 3.7 mGy.cm for acute stroke head, routine chest and routine abdomen CT examination respectively for IQS of 3. Conclusion The purpose of this study was integration of DRL with clinical image quality. The optimization of doses was correlated with diagnostic adequacy of clinical image. Further the study is ongoing to collect data and categorize on the basis of different weight group to further optimize the dose index for CT.",Excluded
2703,"Treatment of Recurrent Bronchial Carcinoma: The Role of High-Dose-Rate Endoluminal Brachytherapy Purpose: This study's aim was to assess outcome and toxicity of high-dose-rate endoluminal brachytherapy (HDREB) for recurrent bronchial carcinoma. Methods and Materials: From 1987 to 2005, 41 patients were treated with HDREB for symptomatic recurrent bronchial carcinoma. All patients had previously undergone external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) with a median dose of 56 Gy (range, 30-70 Gy). The median HDREB dose applied was 15 Gy (range, 5-29 Gy). The median time interval between primary EBRT and reirradiation was 9 months (range, 2-54 months). Result(s): After a median follow-up of 6.7 months, the 6-, 12-, and 24-month overall survival rates were 58%, 18%, and 7%, respectively. The median overall survival time was 6.7 months. Local remission was achieved in 73% of patients (n = 30). A total of 24% of patients (n = 10) showed no response or progressive disease within 8 weeks after treatment. In 1 patient, treatment response was not documented. The 6-, 12-, and 24-month local control rates were 38%, 17%, and 3%, respectively. The median local progression-free survival time was 4 months (range, 1-23 months). Prognostic factors were a total dose of >=15 Gy of HDREB (p = 0.029) and a Karnofsky performance score of >=80% (p = 0.0012). The cause of death was locoregional progression in 27% of patients (n = 11), distant metastases in 24% of patients (n = 10), fatal hemorrhage in 15% of patients (n = 6), and other causes in 29% of patients (n = 12). None of the patients with locally controlled disease showed grade 3 or 4 late effects. Conclusion(s): Palliative treatment of symptomatic, locally recurrent bronchial carcinoma with HDREB can effectively relieve symptoms in the majority of patients while causing only few complications. Still, time to progression is short. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

The effect of radiotherapy was assessed in 55 patients with 68 obstructed kidneys. Six patients with eight obstructed kidneys required percutaneous nephrostomy or ureteric catheters in addition to radiotherapy., RESULTS: Drainage improved in 20% of kidneys and the diverting catheter was withdrawn permanently in one (17%) of the diverted patients. The median survival was 11 months. Irradiation was followed by significant complications in 37 patients (67%)., CONCLUSION: The results of this study raise doubts about the assumed beneficial effect of irradiation on ureteric obstruction due to muscle-invasive bladder cancer. The short median survival of 11 months confirms that ureteric obstruction is a poor prognostic factor in muscle-invasive bladder cancer.",Excluded
2944,"Oncogenic N-Ras Mitigates Oxidative Stress-Induced Apoptosis of Hematopoietic Stem Cells Leukemic relapse is believed to be driven by transformed hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) that harbor oncogenic mutations or have lost tumor suppressor function. Recent comprehensive sequencing studies have shown that mutations predicted to activate Ras signaling are highly prevalent in hematologic malignancies and, notably, in refractory and relapsed cases. To better understand what drives this clinical phenomenon, we expressed oncogenic NrasG12D within the hematopoietic system in mice and interrogated its effects on HSC survival. N-RasG12D conferred a survival benefit to HSCs and progenitors following metabolic and genotoxic stress. This effect was limited to HSCs and early progenitors and was independent of autophagy and cell proliferation. N-RasG12D-mediated HSC survival was not affected by inhibition of canonical Ras effectors such as MEK and PI3K. However, inhibition of the noncanonical Ras effector pathway protein kinase C (PKC) ameliorated the protective effects of N-RasG12D. Mechanistically, N-RasG12D lowered levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which correlated with reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP levels. Inhibition of PKC restored the levels of ROS to that of control HSCs and abrogated the protective effects granted by N-RasG12D. Thus, N-RasG12D activation within HSCs promotes cell survival through the mitigation of ROS, and targeting this mechanism may represent a viable strategy to induce apoptosis during malignant transformation of HSCs. SIGNIFICANCE: Targeting oncogenic N-Ras-mediated reduction of ROS in hematopoietic stem cells through inhibition of the noncanonical Ras effector PKC may serve as a novel strategy for treatment of leukemia and other Ras-mutated cancers.

Methods Our single-centre, retrospective study analysed the pertinence of guidelines produced by ENT UK to improve the investigation and management of suspected upper aerodigestive fish bone foreign bodies during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Results Our results demonstrated 43.3 per cent (n = 13) low-risk cases and 56.7 per cent (n = 17) moderate-risk cases. Nine fish bones (two low risk, seven moderate risk) were found; none of these were confirmed with X-ray and three (moderate risk) required nasoendoscopy for diagnosis. One patient required rigid pharyngoscopy. Conclusion This study confirms that soft tissue neck X-ray and flexible nasoendoscopy are unnecessary in low-risk cases; however, early nasoendoscopy in higher suspicion cases is appropriate. Recommendations are made about the long-term sustainability of these guidelines, and additional measures are encouraged that relate to repeat attendances and varying prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 in the hospital catchment area.Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

2816,"Effects of motion segment level, Pfirrmann intervertebral disc degeneration grade and gender on lumbar spine kinematics MRI allows non-invasive assessment of intervertebral disc degeneration with the added clinical benefit of using non-ionizing radiation. What has remained unclear is the relationship between assessed disc degeneration and lumbar spine kinematics. Kinematic outcomes of 54 multi-segment (L1-Sacrum) lumbar spine specimens were calculated to discover if such an underlying relationship exists with degeneration assessed using the Pfirrmann grading system. Further analyses were also conducted to determine if kinematic outcomes were affected by motion segment level, gender or applied compressive preload. Range of motion, hysteresis, high flexibility zone size and rotational stiffness in flexion-extension, lateral bending and axial rotation were the kinematic outcomes. Caudal intervertebral discs in our study sample were more degenerative than cranial discs. L5-S1 discs had the largest flexion-extension range of motion (p<0.005) and L1-L2 discs the lowest flexion high flexibility zone size (p<0.013). No other strict cranial-caudal differences in kinematic outcomes were found. Low flexibility zone rotational stiffness increased with disc degeneration grade in extension, lateral bending and axial rotation (p<0.001). Trends towards higher hysteresis and lower range of motion with increased degeneration were observed in flexion-extension and lateral bending. Applied compressive preload increased flexion-extension hysteresis and augmented the effect of degeneration on hysteresis (p<0.0005). Female specimens had about one degree larger range of motion in all rotational modes, and higher flexion extension hysteresis (p=0.016). These results suggest that gender differences exist in lumbar spine kinematics. Additionally high disc loads, applied compressive preload or applied moment, are needed to kinematically distinguish discs with different levels of degeneration.Copyright © 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

2620,"Utility of cone beam computed tomography verification after stereoscopic kV localization in head and neck tumors treated by stereotactic body radiation therapy Purpose/Objective(s): Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for tumors of the head and neck is an emerging technique gaining popularity as literature regarding its efficacy and safety continues to grow. At our institution, we utilize an x-ray 6D image-guided radiation therapy system (combined infrared-based optical positioning and stereoscopic kV pair localization) for patient positioning followed by soft tissue verification with cone beam CT (CBCT). Here, we identify the magnitude of correction based on CBCT verification after stereoscopic kV pair localization for various anatomic sites of the head and neck and identify subsites in which planning target volume (PTV) margins may be reduced or CBCT may be eliminated. Materials/Methods: The retrospective record was reviewed for patients undergoing SBRT for head and neck tumors between the dates of 6/1/15 and 12/31/15. Patients who received intra-fraction image guidance by stereoscopic kV pair imaging followed by CBCT verification were identified. The magnitude and direction of applied shifts based on CBCT imaging in the vertical, longitudinal, and lateral directions were recorded, from which the vector magnitude of each shift in three dimensions was calculated. Result(s): Thirty-three patients were treated with SBRT for head and neck pathology in the 6-month time period, of which 19 received stereoscopic kV pair localization followed by CBCT verification. For each of the 69 treatments delivered by this method, the vector magnitude was calculated for each shift. The average of these magnitudes was 1.77 mm >=1.75 mm (mean >= standard deviation). For skull base and cervical spine treatments (n = 41), the mean isocenter shift was 1.53 mm >= 1.41 mm, compared to 2.12 mm >= 2.12 mm for non-skull base, non-spine head and neck treatments (n = 28). Conclusion(s): Shifts based on soft tissue localization by CBCT after positioning by stereoscopic kV imaging were typically less than 2 mm for the head and neck treatments in this series, particularly in those treatments directed towards the skull base or cervical spine. For head and neck tumors treated with SBRT near bony anatomy, CBCT verification may not be necessary after stereoscopic kV localization provided that an additional 2 mm margin is added to the PTV in quadrature.",Excluded
3387,"Challenges in the re-irradiation of locally advanced head and neck cancers: outcomes and toxicities Purpose: To retrospectively review outcomes and toxicities for patients with recurrent head and neck cancer (HNC) undergoing re-irradiation (re-RT). Method(s): Retrospective review of oncologic outcomes and toxicity data from patients who received head and neck (HN) re-RT with curative intent using intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) from 2011 to 2016. Common toxicities were scored using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) V4. Treatment outcomes included progression-free survival (PFS), locoregional control (LRC), and overall survival (OS). Result(s): Twenty-one patients with HNC were re-irradiated with curative intent. The median follow-up after re-RT was 27.8 months. The median retreatment dose was 66 Gy (range, 60-70), and the median retreatment volume was 194.1 cm3 (range, 52.4-1375.6). The median LRC, PFS, and OS were 10 months, 8.4 months, and 18.1 months, respectively. Patients treated with surgery as a component of primary HN cancer treatment had significantly worse PFS and OS when retreated compared with those initially treated with chemoradiation alone (p = 0.026 and p = 0.005, respectively). Those with stage IVA/B recurrent disease had worse LRC, PFS, and OS compared with stage II/III disease (p = 0.029, p = 0.049, and p = 0.020 respectively). Acute grade >= 3 toxicity and late grade >= 3 toxicity were 38% and 38%, respectively, with dysphagia being most common (24% acute and 14% late). Conclusion(s): Re-irradiation with IMRT for locally advanced HN recurrences either definitively or after salvage surgery is feasible, but treatment-related toxicity remains significant. Patients who received surgery as a component of their initial treatment and those with more advanced stage disease may be more difficult to salvage with re-irradiation.Copyright © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
2885,"X-irradiation removes endogenous primordial germ cells (PGCs) and increases germline transmission of donor PGCs in chimeric chickens Primordial germ cells (PGCs) are embryonic precursors of germline cells with potential applications in genetic conservation, transgenic animal production and germline stem cell research. These lines of research would benefit from improved germline transmission of transplanted PGCs in chimeric chickens. We therefore evaluated the effects of pretransplant X-irradiation of recipient embryos on the efficacy of germline transmission of donor PGCs in chimeric chickens. Intact chicken eggs were exposed to X-ray doses of 3, 6 and 9 Gy (dose rate = 0.12 Gy/min) after 52 h of incubation. There was no significant difference in hatching rate between the 3-Gy-irradiated group and the nonirradiated control group (40.0 vs. 69.6%), but the hatching rate in the 6-Gy-irradiated group (28.6%) was significantly lower than in the control group (P<0.05). No embryos irradiated with 9 Gy of X-rays survived to hatching. X-irradiation significantly reduced the number of endogenous PGCs in the embryonic gonads at stage 27 in a dose-dependent manner compared with nonirradiated controls. The numbers of endogenous PGCs in the 3-, 6- and 9-Gy-irradiated groups were 21.0, 9.6 and 4.6% of the nonirradiated control numbers, respectively. Sets of 100 donor PGCs were subsequently transferred intravascularly into embryos irradiated with 3 Gy X-rays and nonirradiated control embryos. Genetic cross-test analysis revealed that the germline transmission rate in the 3-Gy-irradiated group was significantly higher than in the control group (27.5 vs. 5.6%; P<0.05). In conclusion, X-irradiation reduced the number of endogenous PGCs and increased the germline transmission of transferred PGCs in chimeric chickens.",Excluded
3532,"Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma patients for whom transcatheter arterial chemoembolization was ineffective or unsuitable OBJECTIVES: To evaluate 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients for whom transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) was ineffective or unsuitable, and to determine whether tumor response and portal vein thrombosis (PVT) response to treatment were prognostic factors for overall survival. METHOD(S): From July 2001 to June 2005, 70 unresectable HCC patients were treated with 3D-CRT; PVT was present in 41 patients. A daily radiation dose ranging from 2 to 3 Gy was administered using 6 or 15 MV x-rays to deliver a total dose between 44 and 54 Gy. RESULT(S): Of 70 patients, follow-up computed tomography showed that primary tumor responses were complete response (CR) in 4 (5.7%) patients, partial response (PR) in 34 (48.6%), no response (NR) in 28 (37.1%), and progressive disease (PD) in 4 (8.6%). Of 41 patients with PVT, PVT responses were CR in 4 (9.7%) patients, PR in 12 (29.3%), NR in 20 (48.8%), and PD in 5 (12.2%). The median survival times were 18.0 and 20.1 month in the primary tumor and the PVT responders (CR + PR), respectively, which were longer than the 6.8 and 7.2 months in the primary tumor and the PVT nonresponders (NR + PD), respectively. CONCLUSION(S): 3D-CRT was associated with a 54.3% objective response rate for primary tumors and a 39.0% objective response rate for PVT. Both primary tumor and PVT responses were found to be prognostic factors for overall survival.

3272,"A preliminary experience of moderate-intensity stereotactic body radiation therapy for ultra-central lung tumor Purpose: Administration of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to ultra-central (UC) lung tumors, generally defined as those abutting the proximal bronchial trees, is difficult due to concerns about serious toxicities. Therefore, our institution has performed moderate-intensity SBRT. Patients and Methods: Patients with UC tumors underwent SBRT at a dose of 50-60 Gy in 10 fractions, with Dmax in the target volume not exceeding 110% of the prescribed dose. The primary outcomes were tumor response and overall survival (OS). Result(s): From January 2017 to September 2018, we treated eight patients who had been diagnosed with UC tumors. The median follow-up time was 8.6 months (range: 2.7-14.9). Five of the eight patients (62.5%) showed a complete response (CR), two (25%) had a partial response (PR), and one (12.5%) had stable disease (SD); the response and disease control rates were 87.5% and 100%, respectively. Seven patients were alive with no evidence of disease or with controlled disease until the last follow-ups, except for one patient who died due to a non-RT cause at 3 months after SBRT. One patient experienced grade 2 esophageal pain and another had grade 1 cough. No grade 3 or higher toxicities were reported. Conclusion(s): Moderate-intensity SBRT might aid in achieving good control of UC tumors without excessive toxicities.

2923,"Uncertainty in assessment of radiation-induced diffusion index changes in individual patients The purpose of this study is to evaluate repeatability coefficients of diffusion tensor indices to assess whether longitudinal changes in diffusion indices were true changes beyond the uncertainty for individual patients undergoing radiation therapy (RT). Twenty-two patients who had low-grade or benign tumors and were treated by partial brain radiation therapy (PBRT) participated in an IRB-approved MRI protocol. The diffusion tensor images in the patients were acquired pre-RT, week 3 during RT, at the end of RT, and 1, 6, and 18 months after RT. As a measure of uncertainty, repeatability coefficients (RC) of diffusion indices in the segmented cingulum, corpus callosum, and fornix were estimated by using test-retest diffusion tensor datasets from the National Biomedical Imaging Archive (NBIA) database. The upper and lower limits of the 95% confidence interval of the estimated RC from the test and retest data were used to evaluate whether the longitudinal percentage changes in diffusion indices in the segmented structures in the individual patients were beyond the uncertainty and thus could be considered as true radiation-induced changes. Diffusion indices in different white matter structures showed different uncertainty ranges. The estimated RC for fractional anisotropy (FA) ranged from 5.3% to 9.6%, for mean diffusivity (MD) from 2.2% to 6.8%, for axial diffusivity (AD) from 2.4% to 5.5%, and for radial diffusivity (RD) from 2.9% to 9.7%. Overall, 23% of the patients treated by RT had FA changes, 44% had MD changes, 50% had AD changes, and 50% had RD changes beyond the uncertainty ranges. In the fornix, 85.7% and 100% of the patients showed changes beyond the uncertainty range at 6 and 18 months after RT, demonstrating that radiation has a pronounced late effect on the fornix compared to other segmented structures. It is critical to determine reliability of a change observed in an individual patient for clinical decision making. Assessments of the repeatability and confidence interval of diffusion tensor measurements in white matter structures allow us to determine the true longitudinal change in individual patients.",Excluded
3036,"The human leulocyte test system. VII. Further investigations concerning micronucleus-derived premature chromosome condensation Premature chromosome condensation (PCC) from X-ray induced micronuclei shows a dose-effect relationship in human leukocytes in vitro. Preparations at different culture times without colcemide treatment reveal complex variations of the frequencies of micronuclei and PCC correlated with the fixation time. The positions of PCC patches in the metaphase plate and the frequencies of different PCC types (S and G2) ar independent on the X-ray dose. The latter indicates that the slowing down of the micronuclei in the cell cycle, which is the reason for the formation of PCC, may be an outcome rather of a regulatory phenomenon than of an unspecific physiological damage of the chromatin included in the micronuclei. This is especially evident from labeling experiments with tritiated thymidine, showing that the extent of asynchrony between main nuclei and micronuclei is independent on the X-ray dose. Labeling experiments with tritiated uridine reveal a X-ray dose dependent suppression of RNA synthesis in cells with main nuclei and micronuclei. THE S-phase nature of ""pulverized"" PCC patches could be verified by incorporation of tritiated thymidine in aound 50%.

3649,"Effects of sex and gender on adaptation to space: neurosensory systems Sex and gender differences have long been a research topic of interest, yet few studies have explored the specific differences in neurological responses between men and women during and after spaceflight. Knowledge in this field is limited due to the significant disproportion of sexes enrolled in the astronaut corps. Research indicates that general neurological and sensory differences exist between the sexes, such as those in laterality of amygdala activity, sensitivity and discrimination in vision processing, and neuronal cell death (apoptosis) pathways. In spaceflight, sex differences may include a higher incidence of entry and space motion sickness and of post-flight vestibular instability in female as opposed to male astronauts who flew on both short- and long-duration missions. Hearing and auditory function in crewmembers shows the expected hearing threshold differences between men and women, in which female astronauts exhibit better hearing thresholds. Longitudinal observations of hearing thresholds for crewmembers yield normal age-related decrements; however, no evidence of sex-related differences from spaceflight has been observed. The impact of sex and gender differences should be studied by making spaceflight accessible and flying more women into space.

3689,"Dopaminergic Modulation of Sensory Attenuation in Parkinson's Disease: Is There an Underlying Modulation of Beta Power? Background and Aims: Pathological high amplitude of beta oscillations is thought as the underlying mechanism of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), in particular with regard to bradykinesia. In addition, abnormality in a neurophysiological phenomenon labeled sensory attenuation has been found in patients with PD. The current study explored the hypothesis that the abnormal sensory attenuation has a causal link with the typical abnormality in beta oscillations in PD. Method(s): The study tested sixteen right-handed patients with a diagnosis of PD and 22 healthy participants, which were matched by age and gender. Somatosensory evoked potentials were elicited through electrical stimulation of the median nerve at the wrist. Electrical activity was recorded at the scalp using a 128 channels EEG. Somatosensory evoked potentials were recorded in 2 conditions: at rest and at the onset of a voluntary movement, which was a self-paced abduction movement of the right thumb. Result(s): Healthy participants showed a reduction of the N20-P25 amplitude at the onset of the right thumb abduction compared to the rest condition (P < 0.05). When patients were OFF medication, they showed mild reduction of the N20-P25 component at movement onset (P < 0.05). On the contrary, they did show greater attenuation of the N20-P25 component at the onset of movement compared to the rest condition when ON medication (P < 0.05). There was no significant evidence of a link between the degree of sensory attenuation and the change in beta oscillations in our cohort of patients. Conclusion(s): These results confirmed a significant link between dopaminergic modulation and sensory attenuation. However, the sensory attenuation and beta oscillations were found as two independent phenomena.© Copyright © 2019 Macerollo, Limousin, Korlipara, Foltynie, Edwards and Kilner.",Excluded
3086,"Carcinogenesis studies with benzoyl peroxide (Panoxyl gel 5%) Several groups of hairless mice were given UV radiation with and without pretreatment with 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA), 5% benzoyl peroxide in a gel (Panoxyl), and gel alone, in various combinations, with appropriate control groups included, in order to see whether benzoyl peroxide, which is known to enhance chemical skin carcinogenesis after a single, small dose of DMBA, also enhances UV carcinogenesis. The mice were observed for skin tumors, and all skin lesions were histologically investigated. The percentage of tumor-bearing animals with time is called the tumor rate, the total number of tumors occurring is called the tumor yield. Continual treatment with 5% benzoyl peroxide in gel twice a week, with or without a short pretreatment period of UV radiation resulted in only 2 skin carcinomas, which is remarkable, but not significant. Both Panoxyl and gel alone enhanced tumorigenicity significantly in animals pretreated with a single dose of 51.2 micrograms DMBA. There was no difference between the enhancement caused by Panoxyl and the gel as regards the tumor rate, but when measured as final tumor yield, Panoxyl was slightly more tumor-enhancing than gel alone. However, both Panoxyl and gel protected significantly against UV tumorigenesis (all tumors). There was no difference between the protective effect of the 2 types of treatment. Neither Panoxyl nor gel alone influenced significantly UV skin carcinogenesis (malignant tumors). It is concluded that under these experimental conditions both Panoxyl and gel alone tend to protect against the tumorigenicity and do not enhance the carcinogenicity of UV radiation in hairless mice, whereas both gel and Panoxyl enhance chemical carcinogenesis. The carcinogenic mechanisms may be different for UV and chemical carcinogenesis, respectively.",Excluded

3403,"Novel use of ultrasound guidance for recanalization of iliac, femoral, and popliteal arteries OBJECTIVES: We attempted to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)-guided endluminal endovascular therapy for chronic total occlusion (CTO) of the iliac and/or femoropopliteal arteries using Treasure 12, a stiff guidewire for peripheral CTO of 0.018 in. in monodirectional approach setting., BACKGROUND: Endovascular therapy for CTO of the iliac and femoropopliteal arteries is still technically challenging., METHODS: Endovascular therapy was performed in 110 patients who were admitted to Hyogo College of Medicine Hospital with iliac and/or femoropopliteal artery disease from January 2006 to October 2007. We retrospectively analyzed the data of consecutive 47 patients who underwent the endovascular therapy by monodirectional approach for CTO lesions of the iliac and femoropopliteal arteries. From January 2006 to November 2006 (phase 1), standard technique was applied for the treatment of 21 lesions. From December 2006 to October 2007 (phase 2), IVUS-guided endovascular therapy was applied for the treatment of 31 lesions., RESULTS: Clinical and lesion characteristics in phase 1 were not significantly different from those in phase 2. The overall initial technical success rate improved from 81% in phase 1 to 97% in phase 2. There were no significant differences in radiation exposure time between phase 1 and phase 2. Total volume of contrast material was significantly smaller in phase 2 than in phase 1 (P < 0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: The IVUS-guided endovascular therapy for CTO using Treasure 12 guidewire is feasible and safe, minimizes contrast material, and has a high initial technical success rate.

2523,"Measuring Corneal Haze by Using Scheimpflug Photography and Confocal Microscopy PURPOSE: We compared corneal backscatter estimated from a Scheimpflug camera with backscatter estimated from a clinical confocal microscope across a wide range of corneal haze., METHODS: A total of 59 corneas from 35 patients with a range of severity of Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy and 15 corneas from 9 normal participants were examined using a Scheimpflug camera (Pentacam) and a confocal microscope (ConfoScan 4). The mean image brightness from the anterior 120 mum, midcornea, and posterior 60 mum of the cornea across the central 2 mm recorded by the Scheimpflug camera and analogous regions from the confocal microscope were measured and standardized. Differences between instruments and correlations between backscatter and disease severity were determined by using generalized estimating equation models., RESULTS: Backscatter measured by the two instruments in the anterior and midcornea were correlated (r = 0.67 and 0.43, respectively, P < 0.001), although in the posterior cornea they were not correlated (r = 0.13, P = 0.66). Measured with the Scheimpflug camera, mean backscatter from the anterior and midcornea were greater, whereas backscatter from the posterior cornea was lower (P < 0.001) than that measured by the confocal microscope. Backscatter from the anterior cornea was correlated with disease severity for both instruments (Scheimpflug, r = 0.55, P < 0.001; confocal, r = 0.49, P = 0.003)., CONCLUSIONS: The Scheimpflug camera and confocal microscope should not be used interchangeably to measure corneal haze. The ability to detect changes in backscatter with disease severity is superior with the Scheimpflug camera. However, the confocal microscope provides higher resolution of corneal structure.",Excluded
2961,"Control of growth of vestibular schwannomas with low-dose Gamma Knife surgery OBJECT: The treatment of solitary vestibular schwannomas by performing Gamma Knife surgery is well established. It has been reported that decreasing the surface dose reduces patient morbidity, especially facial weakness and numbness. The authors of this retrospective study examine patient data from a single center to determine if low-dose ( 14 Gy). METHOD(S): Based on the formula for ellipsoid volumes, the tumor volumes were calculated using measurements from MR images obtained at follow up in patients treated at the authors' center. Follow-up data were available in 159 patients with a mean age of 59.5 +/- 14.2 years at treatment. Fifty-six percent of the patients were women and 53.5% of the tumors were located on the right side of the brain. The mean tumor volume was 3.3 +/- 4.3 cm3 with 10% of the tumors having volumes larger than 8 cm3. After GKS, smaller tumors (> or = 40% decrease in volume) were observed in 44.8% of patients treated with a low dose and in 48.8% treated with a high dose. Enlarged tumors (> or = 40% increase in volume) were seen in 5.2% of the patients receiving a low dose and 2.3% of those receiving a high dose. These differences were not statistically significant. Patients who had been followed up for longer than 5 years after treatment had median residual volumes of only 28.2% of the starting volume in the low-dose group and 26% in the high-dose group. This difference was statistically not significant.

2940,"Laboratory longevity and competitiveness of Dacus ciliatus Loew (Diptera: Tephritidae) following sub-sterilizing gamma irradiation The effect of a sub-sterilizing gamma radiation dose on Dacus ciliatus adults was investigated to assess the suitability of the sterile insect technique (SIT) as an alternative method to control this pest. Late pupae (48 h prior to adult emergence) from a laboratory strain were irradiated with 120 Gy of gamma rays emitted by a 60Co source. Following adult emergence, the mortality of irradiated and non-irradiated cohorts was recorded. Over a period of 50 days after emergence, no significant negative effects of irradiation upon the longevity of male or female laboratory flies were observed. A laboratory competitiveness study (Fried test), using irradiated laboratory and wild males at a ratio of 3:1 was conducted to assess the ability of irradiated males to reduce the egg hatch rates of a wild population. The overall competitiveness was found to be ca. 0.32, suggesting a reduced, but satisfactory, quality of irradiated laboratory as compared with wild males. Based on the above findings, we calculated and proposed effective male release ratios for field application of SIT against D. ciliatus.",Excluded

The fraction of cancer attributable to lifestyle and environmental factors in the UK in 2010 This chapter summarises the results of the preceding sections, which estimate the fraction of cancers occurring in the UK in 2010 that can be attributed to sub-optimal, past exposures of 14 lifestyle and environmental risk factors. For each of 18 cancer types, we present the percentage of cases attributable to one or all of the risk factors considered (tobacco, alcohol, four elements of diet (consumption of meat, fruit and vegetables, fibre, and salt), overweight, lack of physical exercise, occupation, infections, radiation (ionising and solar), use of hormones, and reproductive history (breast feeding)).Exposure to less than optimum levels of the 14 factors was responsible for 42.7% of cancers in the UK in 2010 (45.3% in men, 40.1% in women)-a total of about 134 000 cases.Tobacco smoking is by far the most important risk factor for cancer in the UK, responsible for 60 000 cases (19.4% of all new cancer cases) in 2010. The relative importance of other exposures differs by sex. In men, deficient intake of fruits and vegetables (6.1%), occupational exposures (4.9%) and alcohol consumption (4.6%) are next in importance, while in women, it is overweight and obesity (because of the effect on breast cancer)-responsible for 6.9% of cancers, followed by infectious agents (3.7%).Population- attributable fractions provide a valuable quantitative appraisal of the impact of different factors in cancer causation, and are thus helpful in prioritising cancer control strategies. However, quantifying the likely impact of preventive interventions requires rather complex scenario modelling, including specification of realistically achievable population distributions of risk factors, and the timescale of change, as well as the latent periods between exposure and outcome, and the rate of change following modification in exposure level. © 2011 Cancer Research UK All rights reserved.",Included
3102,"Eye lens radiation exposure to interventional cardiologists: A retrospective assessment of cumulative doses Radiation dose to the eye lens is a crucial issue for interventional cardiologists (ICs) who are exposed during the procedures they perform. This paper presents a retrospective assessment of the cumulative eye lens doses of ICs enrolled in the O'CLOC study for Occupational Cataracts and Lens Opacities in interventional Cardiology. Information on the workload in the catheterisation laboratory, radiation protection equipment, eye lens dose per procedure and dose reduction factors associated with eye-protective equipment were considered. For the 129 ICs at an average age of 51 who had worked for an average period of 22 years, the estimated cumulative eye lens dose ranged from 25 mSv to more than 1600 mSv; the mean+SD was 423+359 mSv. After several years of practice, without eye protection, ICs may exceed the new ICRP lifetime eye dose threshold of 500 mSv and be at high risk of developing early radiation-induced cataracts. Radiation protection equipment can reduce these doses and should be used routinely. © The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2691,"Maternal effects of the scid mutation on radiation-induced transgenerational instability in mice The results of a number of recent studies show that mutation rates in the offspring of irradiated parents are substantially elevated, however, the effect of parental genotype on transgenerational instability remains poorly understood. Here, we have analysed the mutation frequency at an expanded simple tandem repeat (ESTR) locus in the germline and bone marrow of the first-generation male offspring of control and irradiated male mice. The frequency of ESTR mutation was studied in the offspring of two reciprocal matings male symbol scid x female symbol BALB/c and male symbol BALB/c x female symbol scid, which were compared with that in BALB/c mice. In the offspring of the BALB/c x BALB/c and male symbol scid x female symbol BALB/c matings, which were conceived after paternal sperm irradiation, the frequency of ESTR mutation was significantly elevated in both tissues. In contrast, ESTR mutation frequency was only slightly elevated in the offspring of male symbol BALB/c x female symbol scid mating conceived after paternal irradiation. The results of this study suggest that the oocytes of scid females are unable to fully support the repair of double-strand breaks induced in paternal sperm which may in turn result in the elimination of cells/embryos containing high levels of DNA damage, thus partially preventing the manifestation of genomic instability.",Excluded
2978,"Radiosensitivity: Gender and Order of Administration of G-CSF, An Experimental Study in Mice To elucidate the potential influence of stimulating bone marrow before cell-cycle-dependent irradiation, we sought to determine overall survival in mice receiving total-body irradiation (TBI) when administered granulocyte stimulating factor (G-CSF) at different time points. Gender differences were also studied. C57/BL/6J mice, aged 9-14 weeks, received 8 Gy TBI in a perspex cage using a linear accelerator. In each of five different experiments, three groups were studied: 1. one control group receiving TBI only; 2. one group treated with filgrastim [500 lg/kg subcutaneously/intraperitoneally (s.c./i.p.)] the day before TBI, followed by daily filgrastim injections postirradiation (1-5 days); and 3. one group treated with daily filgrastim injections only post-TBI (1-5 days). Each experimental group included male and female mice. Survival of the mice was monitored daily, and mice were euthanized when their condition deteriorated. A total of 293 mice were monitored for at least 37 days post-TBI. Control mice that received 8 Gy TBI showed a significant gender difference, with a median survival of 22 days in females and 17 days in males. Addition of G-CSF, irrespective of pre- or postirradiation, significantly improved survival, but in males the improvement was significantly better when G-CSF was not given before TBI. Improved survival in females was independent of the order of administration of GCSF. Multiple filgrastim injections were more effective than a single injection, and s.c. administration was not better than i.p. In conclusion, these findings indicate that male mice are more sensitive to TBI than females. Filgrastim improved survival in both genders irrespective of whether given pre- or postirradiation, but in males the improvement was significantly less if an injection was given before irradiation. These results suggest that, to prevent toxicity most effectively, GCSF should not be given before cytotoxic therapy. While a completely different experimental model was used here, these results may also be extrapolated to indicate that endocrine cell-cycle suppression therapy should not be given before or during cytotoxic therapy of hormone-dependent tumors (e.g., breast and prostate cancer), thus a reduction in the efficacy of cell-cycle-dependent therapy can be prevented.Copyright © 2019 by Radiation Research Society.

The U.S. EPA recommends testing homes for radon and mitigating over the advisory level of 4 picocuries per liter (4 pCi L(-1), or 148 Bq m(-3)). A sample population from a list of Vermont residents who had tested their residence for radon through the Vermont Department of Health and who had elevated levels were mailed a survey to assess demographic characteristics, knowledge about radon, mitigation rates, types of mitigation, as well as barriers to mitigation. The response rate was 63%. Forty-three percent of respondents mitigated. Roughly half were not completely knowledgeable of radon based upon the ability to associate radon exposure with lung cancer risk. Reasons not to mitigate radon levels in homes were cost and lack of concern over elevated levels. A multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed factors associated with mitigating: an education level of college or higher (p = 0.02), concern that a high radon level would affect real estate value (p = 0.04), and home age less than 10 y (p = 0.05). In summary, less than half of Vermonters with elevated radon levels participating in the Department of Health program mitigated.

3033,"Effects of NKG2D haplotypes on the cell-surface expression of NKG2D protein on natural killer and CD8 T cells of peripheral blood among atomic-bomb survivors NKG2D is a primary activating receptor that triggers cell-mediated cytotoxicity in NK cells against tumor and virus-infected cells. We previously identified the NKG2D haplotypes in the natural killer gene complex region on chromosome 12p. Two major haplotype alleles, LNK1 and HNK1, were closely related to low and high natural cytotoxic activity phenotypes, respectively. Furthermore, the haplotype of HNK1/HNK1 has revealed a decreased risk of cancer compared with LNK1/LNK1. In the present study, using flow cytometry, we evaluated the functional effects of NKG2D haplotypes and five htSNPs in terms of the cell-surface expression of NKG2D protein on NK and CD8 T cells of peripheral blood among 732 atomic-bomb survivors. NKG2D expression on NK cells showed significant increases, in the order of LNK1/LNK1, LNK1/HNK1 and HNK1/HNK1 haplotypes (p for trend = 0.003), or with major homozygous, heterozygous, and minor homozygous genotypes for individual htSNPs (p for trend = 0.02-0.003). The same trend was observed for NKG2D expression on CD8 T cells.

Materials and Methods The institutional review board approved this study, and written informed consent was obtained from each patient. Standard- and reduced-dose chest CT (60 and 250 mA) and MR imaging with UTE were used to examine 52 patients; 29 were men (mean age, 66.4 years +/- 7.3 [standard deviation]; age range, 48-79 years) and 23 were women (mean age, 64.8 years +/- 10.1; age range, 42-83 years). Probability of nodule presence was assessed for all methods with a five-point visual scoring system. All nodules were then classified as missed, ground-glass, part-solid, or solid nodules. To compare nodule detection capability of the three methods, consensus for performances was rated by using jackknife free-response receiver operating characteristic analysis, and kappa analysis was used to compare intermethod agreement for nodule type classification. Results There was no significant difference (F = 0.70, P = .59) in figure of merit between methods (standard-dose CT, 0.86; reduced-dose CT, 0.84; MR imaging with UTE, 0.86). There was no significant difference in sensitivity between methods (standard-dose CT vs reduced-dose CT, P = .50; standard-dose CT vs MR imaging with UTE, P = .50; reduced-dose CT vs MR imaging with UTE, P >.99).

3140,"Radiotherapy plus concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide for glioblastoma BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma, the most common primary brain tumor in adults, is usually rapidly fatal. The current standard of care for newly diagnosed glioblastoma is surgical resection to the extent feasible, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy. In this trial we compared radiotherapy alone with radiotherapy plus temozolomide, given concomitantly with and after radiotherapy, in terms of efficacy and safety. METHOD(S): Patients with newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed glioblastoma were randomly assigned to receive radiotherapy alone (fractionated focal irradiation in daily fractions of 2 Gy given 5 days per week for 6 weeks, for a total of 60 Gy) or radiotherapy plus continuous daily temozolomide (75 mg per square meter of body-surface area per day, 7 days per week from the first to the last day of radiotherapy), followed by six cycles of adjuvant temozolomide (150 to 200 mg per square meter for 5 days during each 28-day cycle). The primary end point was overall survival. RESULT(S): A total of 573 patients from 85 centers underwent randomization. The median age was 56 years, and 84 percent of patients had undergone debulking surgery. At a median follow-up of 28 months, the median survival was 14.6 months with radiotherapy plus temozolomide and 12.1 months with radiotherapy alone. The unadjusted hazard ratio for death in the radiotherapy-plus-temozolomide group was 0.63 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.75; P<0.001 by the log-rank test). The two-year survival rate was 26.5 percent with radiotherapy plus temozolomide and 10.4 percent with radiotherapy alone. Concomitant treatment with radiotherapy plus temozolomide resulted in grade 3 or 4 hematologie toxic effects in 7 percent of patients. CONCLUSION(S): The addition of temozolomide to radiotherapy for newly diagnosed glioblastoma resulted in a clinically meaningful and statistically significant survival benefit with minimal additional toxicity.

The impact of different primary sites on the safety and efficacy of definitive chemoradiotherapy in JCOG0909 is not well characterized. Method(s): Patients were categorized into three groups (Ut, Mt, and Lt) according to the primary tumor location. We compared acute adverse events during definitive chemoradiotherapy, complete response (CR) rate, 3-year progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) among the 3 groups. Result(s): Out of the 96 patients enrolled in JCOG0909 between April 2010 and August 2014, 94 patients (16, 59, and 19 patients in the Ut, Mt, and Lt groups, respectively) were included in this exploratory analysis. The proportion of patients with cStage III was 25% in the Ut, 37% in the Mt, and 47% in the Lt group.

Purpose(s): Our prospective study compared the biomarker, the LA mechanical, and the electrophysiological findings as indicators of LA myocardial damage after a high-power short duration (HPSD) with contact force radiofrequency catheter and second-generation cryoballoon (CB2) ablation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). Methods :We enrolled 40 patients with paroxysmal AF [16 (40%) women, mean age = 55.9 +/- 12.4 years] who underwent HPSD (n = 21) or CB2 (n = 19). Biomarker levels (hs-cTnT, CK-MB, hs-CRP, LDH) and the transport function of the LA by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) were compared pre and post procedurally. High-density mapping (HDM) was performed in sinus rhythm using a multielectrode diagnostic catheter in each group to define isolated left atrial low voltage area (LVA; <0.2mV in bipolar voltage mapping). LA CT-angiography and HDM merge was used to calculate the post-PVI LVA and the LVA/LA surface ratio. Result(s): Postablation hs-cTnT and hs-CRP levels were comparable in the ablation groups (HPSD: 1249 +/- 469 and 9.53 +/- 10.30 vs. CB2: 995 +/- 280 and 12.36 +/- 5.76, p = 0.065 and p = 0.732), while CK-MB and LDH levels were significantly higher following CB2 ablation (HPSD: 6.61 +/- 2.62 and 349.9 +/- 65.6 vs. CB2: 26.01 +/- 6.88 and 451.6 +/- 91.3, p < 0.001 and p < 0.001).

3456,"New dose constraint reduces radiation-induced fatal pneumonitis in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy Background. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) allows treatment of patients with large tumour volumes, but radiation pneumonitis (RP) remains a dose limiting complication. The incidence of severe RP using three-dimensional (3D) conformal radiotherapy, was previously reported to be 17%, with 2% lethal RP. The aim of this study was to monitor the incidence of RP following the introduction of IMRT.Material and methods. IMRT was delivered using 4-8 beam arrangements and introduced in three phases. In phase I, 12 patients were treated using only one dose constraint (V20), in which the total lung volume receiving 20 Gy was limited to 40%. In phase II, 25 patients were treated with an additional dose constraint of mean lung dose (MLD) <= 20 Gy. In phase III, 50 patients were treated with an extra dose constraint (V5) in which the total lung volume receiving a dose of 5 Gy was <= 60%. RP was prospectively documented. The results of phase I & II (IMRT-1) were compared to those in phase III (IMRT-2).Results. The median follow-up time was 17 months. The introduction of IMRT was associated with an increase in the incidence of RP in Phase I&II (IMRT-1) to 41%, six of 37 (16%) had grade 5 RP (IMRT-1). Introducing the dose constraint V5, led to a significant reduction in the lung volume receiving doses <= 20 Gy from 51 +/- 2% to 41 +/- 1% (p < 0.0001). Introducing V5 constraint did not decrease the incidence of severe (grade >= 3) RP, but significantly decreased the lethal pneumonitis to 4% (two of 50 patients), p = 0.05.Conclusion. Introducing IMRT resulted in an increase in the incidence of severe and fatal RP, however a new dose constraint to the volume of lung receiving low doses reduced the incidence of lethal pneumonitis.Copyright © 2015 Informa Healthcare.",Excluded
2636,"Dosimetric study of intensity modulated arc therapy for total marrow irradiation Purpose/Objective(s): In recent years, helical tomotherapy has been used for total bone marrow irradiation for sparing of critical organs. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of intensity-modulated arc therapy (IMAT) for total bone marrow irradiation. Materials/Methods: Three patients who received total marrow irradiation with helical tomotherapy, two females and one male, were selected for this dosimetric study. Each patient had one CT scan with normal breathing from the skull to the mid-thigh, and two CT scans at the end of the expiration and inspiration phases. Contours for target volumes and normal organs were drawn to take into account breathing effects. The target volumes included the bone volume from the skull to the mid-thigh, lymph nodes, and spleen. 12 Gy in 8 fractions was prescribed to the target volumes. Varian RapidArc IMAT plans were generated with the same target volumes as the helical tomotherapy plans. For each patient, 23 normal structures were included in plan optimization, including all the major organs in the body. In helical tomotherapy plans, 5 cm jaw width was used. For IMAT planning, eight arc fields were used for each patient to cover the entire target volumes, with the isocenters aligned along the superior-inferior axis. Both the helical tomotherapy and IMAT plans were normalized to cover 85% of the bone volume by 12 Gy. Result(s): The average values of themean doses to the normal organswere 6.0 Gy, 6.0 Gy, and 5.8Gy in helical tomotherapy plans for the three patients; they were 4.8 Gy, 5.4 Gy, and 5.2 Gy, respectively, in IMAT plans. Of the 63 organs that could be compared pairwise, 43 had lower means using IMATand 17 had lowermeans using tomotherapy.Of the 40 organ pairs whose mean doses differed bymore than 10%, 33 had lower means in IMAT plans.D10 (theminimumdose level covering 10%of the volume) for the bone volume were 13.5 Gy, 13.1 Gy, and 13.5 Gy in helical tomotherapy plans for the three patients, respectively; they were 13.7 Gy, 14.4Gy, and 14.3Gy in IMAT plans. Comparable dose coveragewas achieved by IMAT plans for other target volumes. The average beam-on timewas 19.4minutes for helical tomotherapy and approximately 16 minutes for IMAT. Planning time excluding contouring was approximately 4h for each method. The average monitor unit (MU) in helical tomotherapy plans was 17,207 MU; it was 4,916 MU in IMAT plans. Conclusion(s): Compared to helical tomotherapy plans, IMAT plans showed consistent improvement in sparing of normal organs while delivering a somewhat less homogeneous dose to the target volumes for total bone marrow irradiation. This study indicates that IMAT can be used effectively for total bone marrow irradiation. With either treatment lower extremities are most efficiently treated with conventional open fields.",Excluded

3139,"Clinical outcomes of 130 patients with primary and secondary lung tumors treated with Cyberknife robotic stereotactic body radiotherapy Authors report clinical outcomes of patients treated with robotic stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for primary, recurrent and metastatic lung lesions. 130 patients with 160 lesions were treated with Cyberknife SBRT, including T1-3 primary lung cancers (54%), recurrent tumors (22%) and pulmonary metastases (24%). The mean biologically equivalent dose (BED10Gy) was 151 Gy (72-180 Gy). Median prescribed dose for peripheral and central lesions was 3x20 Gy and 3x15 Gy, respectively. Local control (LC), overall survival (OS), and cause-specific survival (CSS) rates, early and late toxicities are reported. Statistical analysis was performed to identify factors influencing local tumor control. Median follow-up time was 21 months. In univariate analysis, higher dose was associated with better LC and a cut-off value was detected at BED10Gy <= 112.5 Gy, resulting in 1-, 2-, and 3-year actuarial LC rates of 93%, vs 73%, 80% vs 61%, and 63% vs 54%, for the high and low dose groups, respectively (p = 0.0061, HR = 0.384). In multivariate analysis, metastatic origin, histological confirmation and larger Planning Target Volume (PTV) were associated with higher risk of local failure. Actuarial OS and CSS rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 85%, 74% and 62%, and 93%, 89% and 80%, respectively. Acute and late toxicities >= Gr 3 were observed in 3 (2%) and 6 patients (5%), respectively. Our favorable LC and survival rates after robotic SBRT, with low rates of severe toxicities, are coherent with the literature data in this mixed, non-selected study population.Copyright © 2017 Radiol Oncol.",Excluded

3695,"Time efficiency and diagnostic accuracy of new automated myocardial perfusion analysis software in 320-row CT cardiac imaging Objective: We aimed to evaluate the time efficiency and diagnostic accuracy of automated myocardial computed tomography perfusion (CTP) image analysis software. Material(s) and Method(s): 320-row CTP was performed in 30 patients, and analyses were conducted independently by three different blinded readers by the use of two recent software releases (version 4.6 and novel version 4.71GR001, Toshiba, Tokyo, Japan). Analysis times were compared, and automated epi- and endocardial contour detection was subjectively rated in five categories (excellent, good, fair, poor and very poor). As semi-quantitative perfusion parameters, myocardial attenuation and transmural perfusion ratio (TPR) were calculated for each myocardial segment and agreement was tested by using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Conventional coronary angiography served as reference standard. Result(s): The analysis time was significantly reduced with the novel automated software version as compared with the former release (Reader 1: 43:08 +/- 11:39 min vs. 09:47 +/- 04:51 min, Reader 2: 42:07 +/- 06:44 min vs. 09:42 +/- 02:50 min and Reader 3: 21:38 +/- 3:44 min vs. 07:34 +/- 02:12 min; p < 0.001 for all). Epi- and endocardial contour detection for the novel software was rated to be significantly better (p < 0.001) than with the former software. ICCs demonstrated strong agreement (>= 0.75) for myocardial attenuation in 93% and for TPR in 82%. Diagnostic accuracy for the two software versions was not significantly different (p = 0.169) as compared with conventional coronary angiography. Conclusion(s): The novel automated CTP analysis software offers enhanced time efficiency with an improvement by a factor of about four, while maintaining diagnostic accuracy.",Excluded
2780,"Real world outcomes of combination and timing of immunotherapy with radiotherapy for melanoma with brain metastases Introduction: Immunotherapy (IT) and radiotherapy (RT) have improved overall survival in patients with melanoma with brain metastasis (MBM). We examined the real-world survival impact of IT and RT combination and timing strategies. Material(s) and Method(s): From the facility-based National Cancer Database (NCDB) data set, 3008 cases of MBM were identified between 2011 and 2015. Six treatment cohorts were identified: stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) + IT, SRS alone, whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) + IT, WBRT alone, IT alone, and none. Concurrent therapy was defined as IT given within 28 days before or after RT; nonconcurrent defined as IT administered within 28-90 days of RT. The co-primary outcomes were propensity score-adjusted overall survival by treatment regimen and overall survival by RT and IT timing. Result(s): Median overall survival (mOS) was performed for each treatment category; SRS +IT 15.77 m; (95%CI 12.13-21.29), SRS alone (9.33 m; 95%CI: 8.0-11.3), IT alone (7.29 m; 95%CI: 5.35-12.91), WBRT +IT (4.89 m; 95%CI: 3.65-5.92), No RT or IT (3.29 m; 95%CI: 2.96-3.75), and WBRT alone (3.12 m; 95%CI 2.79-3.52). By propensity score matching, mOS for SRS +IT (15.5 m; 95%CI: 11.5-20.2) was greater than SRS alone (10.1 m; 95%CI: 8.4-11.8) (p = 0.010), and median survival for WBRT +IT (4.6 m; 95%CI: 3.4-5.6) was greater than WBRT alone (2.9 m; 95%CI: 2.5-3.5) (p < 0.001). In the SRS +IT group, 24-month landmark survival was 47% (95%CI; 42-52) for concurrent versus 37% (95%CI; 30-44) for nonconcurrent (p = 0.40). Conclusion(s): Those who received IT in addition to WBRT and SRS experienced longer survival compared to RT modalities alone, while those receiving concurrent SRS and IT trended toward improved survival versus nonconcurrent therapy.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

3035,"Radioprotective effects of exogenous glutathione against whole-body gamma-ray irradiation: age- and gender-related changes in malondialdehyde levels, superoxide dismutase and catalase activities in rat liver Age- and gender-related changes in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities in rat livers exposed to different doses of whole-body gamma-ray radiation were determined. In addition, the effects of exogenous glutathione (GSH) against radiation injury in rat livers were investigated. We found that MDA levels have an age-associated increment and an increasing radiation dose-related elevation, although they decrease slightly in the 4 Gy group. The MDA levels in old rats were lower in males than in females, while those of young rats did not change. There were no observed age-related changes in SOD activities, although male rats had higher SOD activity than females. Female rats had the highest CAT activities in the 4 Gy group, while male rats had the highest CAT activities in the 6 Gy group. CAT activities in the 8 Gy group were lower than those of the 2 Gy group for each gender and age. While MDA levels were decreased and CAT activities increased by GSH, SOD activities remained unchanged. The results indicate that gamma-ray radiation affects gender- and age-dependent MDA levels, SOD and CAT activities. Administration of GSH appears to be a useful approach to reduce radiation injury by reducing MDA levels and increasing CAT activities.",Included
2838,"Physiological, behavioral, and serological responses of horses to shaded or unshaded pens in a hot, sunny environment Housing recommendations for horses invariably include providing access to shade on hot, sunny days, but the potential benefits have not been scientifically studied. This experiment measured physiological, behavioral, and serological responses of horses confined individually to completely shaded (SH) or completely unshaded (SUN) drylot pens during the summer in Davis, CA. Twelve healthy adult horses in a crossover design experienced both treatments for 5 d each. Rectal temperature, respiration rate, skin temperature, and sweat scores were recorded hourly from 1230 to 1730 h daily. Observations were recorded from 1200 to 1800 h for proximity to water, foraging, locomotion, and insect avoidance behaviors. Daily blood samples were obtained to measure cortisol, hematocrit, and neutrophil- to-lymphocyte ratio. Automated and handheld sensors were used to record environmental conditions. The mean ambient temperature from 1200 to 1800 h during the study was 30.6degreeC. Rectal temperature was greater for horses in SUN than for SH (mean 37.8degreeC and 37.5degreeC, respectively, SE = 0.06, P = 0.002) as was respiration rate (25.5 and 20.5 breaths/min, SE = 1.3, P = 0.008), and skin temperature (35.6degreeC and 34.6degreeC, SE = 0.1, P < 0.001). Horses in SUN showed sweat in 51.4% of observations vs. 1.1% for horses in SH. Horses in SUN spent more time than SH horses standing near their water source (34.0% of observations vs. 20.2%, SE = 0.3, P = 0.004). No differences were observed for foraging, locomotion, or insect avoidance behavior (P > 0.05). Cortisol concentrations were greater in SUN than SH (3.4 and 2.6 mug/dL, respectively, P < 0.001) but remained within the normal range for resting horses. No treatment differences were observed for hematocrit or neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (P > 0.05). Horses exhibited treatment differences in the physiological measures first, most notably in rectal temperature at 1230 h, corresponding to peak solar radiation. Behavioral responses followed these physiological changes, with treatment differences in time standing near water becoming apparent at 1400 h as ambient and black globe temperature increased. Our results indicate that both the SH and SUN treatment groups exhibited thermoregulatory responses to these summer conditions and horses benefited from shade, as it mitigated these physiological and behavioral changes. These results are applicable in developing best management practices for the care of domestic horses. © 2013 American Society of Animal Science. All rights reserved.",Excluded

3613,"Establishment of diagnostic reference levels in cardiac computed tomography The aim of this study was to determine diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) for cardiac computed tomography (CCT) in Jordan. Volume computed tomography dose index (CTDIvol ) and dose-length product (DLP) were collected from 228 CCTs performed at seven Jordanian hospitals specialized in cardiac CT. DRLs for cardiac CT were defined at the 75th percentile of CTDIvol and DLP. CTDIvol and DLP were collected from 30 successive cardiac CT in each center except for one center (18 scans). The 75th percentile of the CTDIvol and the DLP of the centers calculated from mixed retrospective and prospective gated modes were 47.74 milligray (mGy) and 1035 mGy/cm, respectively. This study demonstrated wide dose variations among the surveyed hospitals for cardiac CT scans; there was a 5.1-fold difference between the highest and lowest median DLP with a range of 223.2-1146.7 mGy/cm. Differences were associated with variations in the mAs and kVp. This study confirmed large variability in CTDIvol and DLP for cardiac CT scans; variation was associated with acquisition protocols and highlights the need for dose optimization. DRLs are proposed for CCT; there remains substantial potential for optimization of cardiac CT examinations for adults in Jordan.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

2886,"Clinical utility of ultra high pitch dual source thoracic CT imaging of acute pulmonary embolism in the emergency department: Are we one step closer towards a non-gated triple rule out? Objectives/Purpose: Aim of this study was to retrospectively compare the image quality and the radiation dose of an ultra high pitch CT scan for the evaluation of pulmonary embolism and visualization of cardiac structures in comparison to our institution's standard pulmonary embolism protocol. Method and materials: The study cohort consisted of 115 consecutive patients, 57 underwent CT pulmonary angiography on a dual source 128 slice scanner (Siemens Somatom Definition FLASH) via an ultra high pitch mode (Pitch 2.8) while 58 were scanned on a dual source 64 slice scanner (Siemens Somatom Definition Dual Source) with standard pitch (Pitch 0.9). Qualitative image assessment was determined by two blinded radiologists with 3 and 15 years' experience in chest and cardiac CT. Quantitative image assessment was determined by the signal to noise ratio (SNR) and contrast to noise ratio (CNR). Effective radiation dose was calculated via the product of the dose length product. Result(s): For the ultra high pitch protocol, 14% (8/57) were positive for pulmonary embolus compared to 13.7% (8/58) for the standard pitch group. 98.2% of the ultra high pitch scans were diagnostic for pulmonary embolus vs. 94.8% of the standard protocol. Visualization of cardiac structures was significantly improved with the ultra high pitch protocol (p < 0.0001). Significantly more lung parenchymal motion was observed on the standard protocol (p < 0.0001). The mean pulmonary vessel attenuation, SNR, and CNR were not significantly different. The mean effective dose was lower for the ultra high pitch studies (4.09 mSv +/- 0.78 vs. 7.72 mSv +/- 2.60, p < 0.0001). Conclusion(s): Ultra high pitch CT imaging for pulmonary embolus is a technique which has potential to assess motion free evaluation of most cardiac structures and proximal coronary arteries at lower radiation doses. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Excluded

A comparison of pertinent metabolite concentrations revealed a magnetization transfer attenuation factor of the methyl and methylene resonances of creatine and phosphocreatine of 0.87 +/- 0.05 (p < 0.01). No attenuation was observed for the resonances of N-acetylaspartate and N-acetylaspartylglutamate, glutamate and glutamine, choline-containing compounds, and myo-inositol. The finding for total creatine is in excellent agreement with data reported for rat brain.

2585,"Solid cancer mortality associated with chronic external radiation exposure at the french atomic energy commission and nuclear fuel company Studies of nuclear workers make it possible to directly quantify the risks associated with ionizing radiation exposure at low doses and low dose rates. Studies of the CEA (Commissariat l'Energie Atomique) and AREVA Nuclear Cycle (AREVA NC) cohort, currently the most informative such group in France, describe the long-term risk to nuclear workers associated with external exposure. Our aim is to assess the risk of mortality from solid cancers among CEA and AREVA NC nuclear workers and its association with external radiation exposure. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated and internal Poisson regressions were conducted, controlling for the main confounding factors sex, attained age, calendar period, company and socioeconomic status (SES). During the period 19682004, there were 2,035 solid cancers among the 36,769 CEA-AREVA NC workers. Cumulative external radiation exposure was assessed for the period 19502004, and the mean cumulative dose was 12.1 mSv. Mortality rates for all causes and all solid cancers were both significantly lower in this cohort than in the general population. A significant excess of deaths from pleural cancer, not associated with cumulative external dose, was observed, probably due to past asbestos exposure. We observed a significant excess of melanoma, also unassociated with dose. Although cumulative external dose was not associated with mortality from all solid cancers, the central estimated excess relative risk (ERR) per Sv of 0.46 for solid cancer mortality was higher than the 0.26 calculated for male Hiroshima and Nagasaki A-bomb survivors 50 years or older and exposed at the age of 30 years or older. The modification of our results after stratification for SES demonstrates the importance of this characteristic in occupational studies, because it makes it possible to take class-based lifestyle differences into account, at least partly. These results show the great potential of a further joint international study of nuclear workers, which should improve knowledge about the risks associated with chronic low doses and provide useful risk estimates for radiation protection. © 2011 by Radiation Research Society.",Included

The purpose of this study was to measure the dose of radiation delivered to the cochlea during a Gamma knife surgery (GKS) procedure for treatment of patients with vestibular schwannomas (VSs), and to analyze the relationship between cochlear irradiation and the hearing outcome of these patients. Methods. Eighty-two patients with VSs were treated with GKS using a marginal dose of 12 Gy. No patient had neurofibromatosis Type 2 disease, and all had a Gardner-Robertson hearing class of I to IV before treatment, and a radiological and audiological follow-up of at least 1-year after GKS. The dosimetric data of the volume of the cochlea were retrospectively analyzed and were correlated with the auditory outcome of patients. Results. The mean radiation dose delivered to the cochlear volume ranged from 1.30 to 10.00 Gy (median 4.15 Gy). The cochlea received significantly higher radiation doses in patients with worsening of hearing after GKS. A highly significant association between the cochlear and the intracanalicular dose of radiation delivered during GKS was found. Conclusions. During GKS for VSs, relatively high doses of radiation can be delivered to the cochlea. Worsening of hearing after GKS can be the consequence of either radiation injury to the cochlea or the irradiation dose delivered into the auditory canal, or both.",Excluded

The dataset (57 tumors, 19 lymphoma patients who underwent SPECT/CT imaging during I-131 radioimmunotherapy) included tumors of varying size, shape, and contrast. OLINDA calculations were first carried out using the baseline tumor volume and residence time from SPECT/CT imaging during 6 days post-tracer and 8 days post-therapy. Next, the OLINDA calculation was split over multiple time periods and summed to get the total dose, which accounted for the changes in tumor size. Results from the second calculation were compared with results determined by coupling SPECT/CT images with DPM Monte Carlo algorithms. Results from the OLINDA calculation accounting for changes in tumor size were almost always higher (median 22%, range-1%-68%) than the results from OLINDA using the baseline tumor volume because of tumor shrinkage. There was good agreement (median-5%, range-13%-2%) between the OLINDA results and the self-dose component from Monte Carlo calculations, indicating that tumor shape effects are a minor source of error when using the sphere model. However, because the sphere model ignores cross-irradiation, the OLINDA calculation significantly underestimated (median 14%, range 2%-31%) the total tumor absorbed dose compared with Monte Carlo. These results show that when the quantity of interest is the mean tumor absorbed dose, the unit density sphere model is a practical alternative to Monte Carlo for some applications. For applications requiring higher accuracy, computer-intensive Monte Carlo calculation is needed. © 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Excluded
3684,"Neo-adjuvant chemo-radiation of rectal cancer with Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy: Summary of technical and dosimetric features and early clinical experience Background: To report about initial technical and clinical experience in preoperative radiation treatment of rectal cancer with volumetric modulated arcs with the RapidArc (RA) technology. Method(s): Twenty-five consecutive patients (pts) were treated with RA. All showed locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma with stage T2-T4, N0-1. Dose prescription was 44 Gy in 22 fractions (or 45 Gy in 25 fractions). Delivery was performed with single arc with a 6 MV photon beam. Twenty patients were treated preoperatively, five did not receive surgery. Twenty-three patients received concomitant chemotherapy with oral capecitabine. A comparison with a cohort of twenty patients with similar characteristics treated with conformal therapy (3DC) is presented as well. Result(s): From a dosimetric point of view, RA improved conformality of doses (CI95% = 1.1 vs. 1.4 for RA and 3DC), presented similar target coverage with lower maximum doses, significant sparing of femurs and significant reduction of integral and mean dose to healthy tissue. From the clinical point of view, surgical reports resulted in a down-staging in 41% of cases. Acute toxicity was limited to Grade 1-2 diarrhoea in 40% and Grade 3 in 8% of RA pts, 45% and 5% of 3DC pts, compatible with known effects of concomitant chemotherapy. RA treatments were performed with an average of 2.0 vs. 3.4 min of 3DC. Conclusion(s): RA proved to be a safe, qualitatively advantageous treatment modality for rectal cancer, showing some improved results in dosimetric aspects. © 2010 Richetti et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
3236,"Reliability of appendicular muscle mass assessment by bioelectrical impedance analysis vs. dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry in hemodialysis patients Background: Loss of skeletal muscle mass(MM) increases the risk for morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is a valid tool for assessing skeletal MM but limited by cost and radiation exposure. In contrast, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is cheap and has no radiation exposure risk. Aim of this study was to assess the concordance between MM measured by BIA and DXA in HD patients. Method(s): We enrolled 55 clinically stable HD patients. Body composition, including appendicular lean muscle mass (ALM), was evaluated by BIA (Inbody S10) and whole body DXA (HOLOGIC). Hand grip strength (HGS) was performed to evaluate muscle performance. Agreement between tools was assessed by means of the Bland Altman method. Multiple linear regression was used to develop an ALM value by BIA closed to that by DXA. Result(s): The mean age was 63.4+/-11.29 years (range 39 to 88 years) and 65.5% were men. The prevalence of diabetes and hypertension was 54.5% and 94.5%, respectively. There was a significant association between muscle mass index which determined via DXA and BIA. The mean value of ALM divided by the height2 (AMMI) was found to be 5.98+/-0.90 kg/m2 and 7.90 +/-1.39 kg/m2 by DXA and by BIA, respectively, indicating overestimation of ALM in BIA method. BIA overestimated total body lean mass in 98% of participants. Bland-Altman plots for differences in AMMI between BIA and DXA showed large bias (Mean= 1.92kg/m2), with significant mean differences ([0.29, 3.55], P<0.001). After adjusting for sex, age and BMI, AMMI by BIA was significantly correlated with those measure by DXA (R2=0.643, P<0.001). Using the formula, we can estimate the AMMI by DXA with AMMI by BIA (DXA=0.859+0.452BIA+0.068BMI, R2=0.709, P<0.001). Mean HGS was 24.6+/-7.90 kg and AMMI showed no correlation with the HGS. Conclusion(s): Our results showed that AMMI measured by BIA is reliable but overestimated in HD patients. Further reinfinement of adaptation formula for use BIA is needed to obtain accurate measurement of AMMI close to that measured by DXA.",Excluded
3238,"Polymorphisms in DNA repair genes and susceptibility to glioma in a Chinese population The excision repair cross-complementing rodent repair deficiency complementation group 1 (ERCC1), and X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1) genes appear to protect mammalian cells from the harmful effects of ionizing radiation. We conducted a large case-control study to investigate the association of polymorphisms in ERCC1 C118T, ERCC1 C8092A, XRCC1 A194T, XRCC1 A194T, and XRCC3 C241T, with glioma risk in a Chinese population. Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped, using the MassARRAY IPLEX platform, in 443 glioma cases and 443 controls. Association analyses based on an chi2 test and binary logistic regression were performed to determine the odds ratio (OR) and a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for each SNP. For XRCC1 Arg194Trp, the variant genotype T/T was strongly associated with a lower risk of glioma cancer when compared with the wild type C/C (OR = 2.45, 95% CI = 1.43-4.45). Individuals carrying the XRCC1 399A allele had an increased risk of glioma (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.02-1.64). The XRCC3 241T/T genotype was associated with a strong increased glioma risk (OR = 3.78, 95% CI = 1.86-9.06). Further analysis of the interactions of two susceptibility-associated SNPs, XRCC1 Arg194Trp and XRCC3 Thr241Met, showed that the combination of the XRCC1 194T and XRCC3 241T alleles brought a large increase in glioma risk (OR = 2.75, 95% CI = 1.54-4.04). XRCC1 Arg194Trp, XRCC1 Arg399Gln, and XRCC3 C241T, appear to be associated with susceptibility to glioma in a Chinese population. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Excluded
2603,"[123 I]Iodometomidate for molecular imaging of adrenocortical cytochrome P450 family 11B enzymes BACKGROUND: Due to advances in conventional imaging, adrenal tumors are detected with increasing frequency. However, conventional imaging provides only limited information on the origin of these lesions, which represent a wide range of different pathological entities. New specific imaging methods would therefore be of great clinical value. We, therefore, studied the potential of iodometomidate (IMTO) as tracer for molecular imaging of cytochrome P450 family 11B (Cyp11B) enzymes., METHODS: Inhibition of Cyp11B1 and Cyp11B2 by IMTO, etomidate, metomidate, and fluoroetomidate was investigated in NCI-h295 cells and in Y1 cells stably expressing hsCyp11B1 or hsCyp11B2. Pharmacokinetics and biodistribution after iv injection of [(123/125)I]IMTO were analyzed in mice in biodistribution experiments and by small-animal single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Furthermore, four patients with known adrenal tumors (two metastatic adrenal adenocarcinomas, one bilateral adrenocortical adenoma, and one melanoma metastasis) were investigated with [(123)I]iodometomidate-SPECT., RESULTS: In cell culture experiments, all compounds potently inhibited both Cyp11B1 and Cyp11B2. Adrenals showed high and specific uptake of [(123/125)I]IMTO and were excellently visualized in mice. In patients, adrenocortical tissue showed high and specific tracer uptake in both primary tumor and metastases with short investigation time and low radiation exposure, whereas the non-adrenocortical tumor did not exhibit any tracer uptake., CONCLUSION: We have successfully completed the development of an in vivo detection system of adrenal Cyp11B enzymes by [(123)I]IMTO scintigraphy in both experimental animals and humans. Our findings suggest that [(123)I]IMTO is a highly specific radiotracer for imaging of adrenocortical tissue. Due to the general availability of SPECT technology, we anticipate that [(123)I]IMTO scintigraphy may become a widely used tool to characterize adrenal lesions.",Excluded
2946,"Developmental defects and male sterility in mice lacking the ubiquitin-like DNA repair gene mHR23B mHR23B encodes one of the two mammalian homologs of Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD23, a ubiquitin-like fusion protein involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER). Part of mHR23B is complexed with the XPC protein, and this heterodimer functions as the main damage detector and initiator of global genome NER. While XPC defects exist in humans and mice, mutations for mHR23A and mHR23B are not known. Here, we present a mouse model for mHR23B. Unlike XPC-deficient cells, mHR23B(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts are not UV sensitive and retain the repair characteristics of wild-type cells. In agreement with the results of in vitro repair studies, this indicates that mHR23A can functionally replace mHR23B in NER. Unexpectedly, mHR23B(-/-) mice show impaired embryonic development and a high rate (90%) of intrauterine or neonatal death. Surviving animals display a variety of abnormalities, including retarded growth, facial dysmorphology, and male sterility. Such abnormalities are not observed in XPC and other NER-deficient mouse mutants and point to a separate function of mHR23B in development. This function may involve regulation of protein stability via the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway and is not or only in part compensated for by mHR23A.",Excluded
3481,"Bone mineral content in the senescent rat femur: an assessment using single photon absorptiometry The single photon absorptiometry technique was evaluated for measuring bone mineral content (BMC) of the excised femurs of the rat, and the system was used to examine the changes in cortical and trabecular bone from young adult (6 mo), mature adult (12 mo), and senescent (24 mo) male and female animals. BMC of the femur midshaft, representing cortical bone, apparently increased progressively with advancing age. The width of the femur at the scan site also increased with age. Normalizing the midshaft BMC by width partially compensated for the age-associated increase. However, when bone mineral values were normalized by the cortical area at the scan site, to take into account the geometric differences in the femurs of different aged animals, maximum bone densities were found in the mature adult and these values decreased slightly in the femurs from senescent rats. In contrast, the BMC of the femur distal metaphysis, representing trabecular bone, decreased markedly in the aged rat. The loss of trabecular bone was also evident from morphological examination of the distal metaphysis. These findings indicated that bone mineral loss with age was site specific in the rat femur. These studies provided additional evidence that the rat might serve as a useful animal model for specific experiments related to the pathogenesis of age-associated osteopenia.",Excluded
3214,"Results of hypofractionated whole brain radiotherapy (2x8 Gy) for patients with brain metastases from lung cancer Purpose: To evaluate the clinical and radiologic response rates, toxicity and tolerability of 2x8 Gy whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) in lung cancer patients with brain metastases (BM). Method(s): WBRT was delivered to 126 lung cancer patients with BM during 2002-2006. External beam RT was delivered with a fraction dose of 8 Gy on the same day of each consecutive week. Tumor and symptom response and toxicity were recorded at every follow-up. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) and the new Graded Prognostic Assessment (GPA) were used for analysis of overall survival (OS). Result(s): Twenty-three patients had small cell (SCLC) and 103 had non small cell lung cancer. Pretreatment median Karnofsky performance score (KPS) was 70 (range 20-90). Clinical response rates were as follows: complete 31%; good partial 30.2%; partial 21.4%; stable 7.9%; and progressive 5.6%. Median palliation and survival duration was 57 and 80 days, respectively. Two- and 6-month survival rates (SR) were 59.5% and 25.4%, respectively. According to recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) 6-month SR for groups 1, 2 and 3 were 61.5, 41.6 and 33.9%, respectively (p=0.002). Six-month SR for the new Graded Prognostic Assessment (GPA) were: GPA 0-1, 7%; GPA 1.5-2.5, 34.2%; GPA 3, 25%; and GPA 3.5-4.0, 66.6% (p=0.0003). Conclusion(s): 2x8 Gy WBRT was found to be feasible. However, the late morbidity of this schedule is unknown so its use could be restricted to patients with poor performance status, with a short life expectancy and/or social problems, unlikely to tolerate more protracted radiotherapy regimens. © 2011 Zerbinis Medical Publications.",Excluded
2513,"Defining bowel dose volume constraints for bladder radiotherapy treatment planning AIMS: Increases to radiotherapy dose are constrained by normal tissue effects. The relationship between bowel dose volume data and late bowel toxicity in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer treated with radical radiotherapy was assessed., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The bowel was contoured retrospectively on radiotherapy plans of 47 patients recruited to the BC2001 trial (CRUK/01/004). The relationship between bowel volume at various dose levels and prospectively collected late bowel toxicity was explored., RESULTS: Fifteen per cent and 6% of patients experienced grade 1 and grade 2 or more late bowel toxicity, respectively. The mean bowel volume was significantly less at doses >=50 Gy in those treated with reduced high dose volume radiotherapy compared with standard radiotherapy. The probability of late bowel toxicity increased as bowel volume increased (P <= 0.05 for dose levels 30-50 Gy). No grade 2 or more late bowel toxicity was observed in patients with bowel volumes under the thresholds given in the model that predict for 25% probability of late bowel toxicity., CONCLUSIONS: There is a dose volume effect for late bowel toxicity in radical bladder radiotherapy. We have modelled the probability of late bowel toxicity from absolute bowel volumes to guide clinicians in assessing radical bladder radiotherapy plans. Thresholds predicting for a 25% probability of late bowel toxicity are proposed as dose volume constraints. Copyright © 2014. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",Excluded
3201,"Investigating the SPECT Dose-Function Metrics Associated With Radiation-Induced Lung Toxicity Risk in Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Undergoing Radiation Therapy Purpose: Dose to normal lung has commonly been linked with radiation-induced lung toxicity (RILT) risk, but incorporating functional lung metrics in treatment planning may help further optimize dose delivery and reduce RILT incidence. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of the dose delivered to functional lung regions by analyzing perfusion (Q), ventilation (V), and combined V/Q single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) dose-function metrics with regard to RILT risk in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who received radiation therapy (RT). Methods and Materials: SPECT images acquired from 88 patients with locally advanced NSCLC before undergoing conventionally fractionated RT were retrospectively analyzed. Dose was converted to the nominal dose equivalent per 2 Gy fraction, and SPECT intensities were normalized. Regional lung segments were defined, and the average dose delivered to each lung region was quantified. Three functional categorizations were defined to represent low-, normal-, and high-functioning lungs. The percent of functional lung category receiving >=20 Gy and mean functional intensity receiving >=20 Gy (iV20) were calculated. RILT was defined as grade 2+ radiation pneumonitis and/or clinical radiation fibrosis. A logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between dose-function metrics and risk of RILT. Result(s): By analyzing V/Q normalized intensities and functional distributions across the population, a wide range in functional capability (especially in the ipsilateral lung) was observed in patients with NSCLC before RT. Through multivariable regression models, global lung average dose to the lower lung was found to be significantly associated with RILT, and Q and V iV20 were correlated with RILT when using ipsilateral lung metrics. Through a receiver operating characteristic analysis, combined V/Q low-function receiving >=20 Gy (low-functioning V/Q20) in the ipsilateral lung was found to be the best predictor (area under the curce: 0.79) of RILT risk. Conclusion(s): Irradiation of the inferior lung appears to be a locational sensitivity for RILT risk. The multivariable correlation between ipsilateral lung iV20 and RILT, as well as the association of low-functioning V/Q20 and RILT, suggest that irradiating low-functioning regions in the lung may lead to higher toxicity rates.Copyright © 2021 The Authors",Excluded

A Single-Center Experience Background Intraprocedural aneurysm sac embolization (embo-EVAR) during endovascular abdominal aneurysm repair (EVAR) using coils and fibrin glue is a technique for preventing type II endoleak (EII). Our aim is to evaluate feasibility, safety and clinical outcome of this promising approach. Materials and Methods A retrospective clinical case analysis of 72 patients who underwent EVAR during the period 2011-2014. Two groups were compared at 6 and 12 months follow-up with contrast media computed tomography scan and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) imaging: consecutively, 36 patients (group A) treated with classic EVAR and 36 patients (group B) treated with embo-EVAR. Coils were released filling better as possible the aneurysm sac; the embolization was completed by injecting fibrin glue. Device and materials used, differential systemic and sac pressures, presence of any endoleak, and complication were registered. Results In our experience, we had 100% technical success without surgical conversion. Embo-EVAR was performed, after endograft deployment, in group B patients, all with ratio of DELTA-pressures (obtained from DELTA-sac pressure/DELTA-differential pressure) > 0.16. No early or late complications occurred and mortality was nil. Follow-up was performed with computed tomography-angiography and CEUS at 6 and 12 months. We observed 9 type II and 1 type Ia endoleak in group A and 2 type II and 1 type Ib endoleaks in group B. Mean radiation exposure time was 30.3 min in group A and 43.3 min in group B. EVAR procedure average cost was 9,000 . The average cost of sac embolization was 1,500. Conclusions Although a randomized study is necessary, embo-EVAR may be a valid approach to prevent type II endoleaks and further complications. Mild costs and exposure-dose increase could be accepted to avoid reinterventions, and in our experience, it could be routinely performed with excellent results.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

2836,"Influence of cartilage lesions in the lateral compartment on clinical outcome following medial openwedge osteotomy Objectives: High tibial osteotomy (HTO) is an established treatment method for cartilage damage of the medial compartment with concurrent varus deformity. The influence of lateral compartment cartilage lesions on the final clinical outcome remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of those lesions on the functional outcome in patients suffering from cartilage damage of the medial compartment and undergoing a valgus high tibial osteotomy. Method(s): From January 2005 to December 2013, there were 156 patients, suffering from cartilage damage of the medial compartment and an underlying varus deformity, who were treated by a biplane HTO. In all of the cases, a preoperative diagnostic arthroscopy was performed, and the presence of underlying cartilage lesions of the lateral compartment (LC) was assessed and evaluated using the ICRS classification. Preoperatively, the Lysholm score, pain levels (VAS) as well as the presence of pain in the lateral compartment were recorded. Clinical outcome parameters were raised at final follow-up (post-OP: VAS, Lysholm, KOOS, IKDC, WOMAC). Analysis of the pre-and post-operatively recorded X-Rays was performed by means of using a planning software (mediCAD\, Hectec GmbH, Germany), as well as a statistical analysis was carried out with the aid of SPSS Statistics 21.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, USA.) software. A p-value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result(s): 37 patients (= 24%) had noticed pain in the LC before the day of surgery. 76. 3% (n = 119, group A) of the patients had no cartilage damage of the LC, 10.3% (n = 16) had a single lesion of the lateral tibial plateau or femoral condyle (group B), 13.4% (n = 21) had corresponding lesions of the LC (group C). Preoperatively, there were no differences between the groups concerning mean follow-up, BMI, the Lysholm score or VAS score (p > 0.05). Differences could be found concerning patient age (group A, B > group C; p > 0.001) and preoperative varus deformity (group A < group B,C; p < 0.003). In all patients, HTO was planed aiming for a comparable mild postoperative valgus alignment (p = 0.53). With regard to clinical outcome parameters, group A had the best results reaching statistical significance in the final WOMACpain score (p = 0.032) and WOMACfunction score (p = 0.049). ICRS score of the LC cartilage lesions correlated significantly with WOMACpain and the WOMACfunction. Nonetheless, all of the groups A to C showed a significant increase in the Lysholm score (p< 0.001) and decrease in pain level (VAS score) at final follow up (p < 0.001). Preoperative patient selection prior to the performance of a valgus high tibial osteotomy is of major importance. Presence of cartilage damage of the lateral compartment is adversely influencing final clinical outcome and has to be seen as a relative contraindication for valgus high tibial osteotomy. Nonetheless, even in those patients a significant improvement of functional parameters and decrease of pain levels can be observed.",Excluded
3080,"Finger joint cartilage evaluated by ultrasound and X-ray in rheumatoid arthritis and control joints Background: Joint destruction in RA includes both bone and cartilage lesions. By X-ray examination, cartilage destruction is evaluated as a joint space narrowing (JSN). However, joint space narrowing is not a direct evaluation of cartilage. Objective(s): The aim of the study was to examine the finger joint cartilage by ultrasound (US) imaging and to compare it with JSN score in relation to clinical relevance. Method(s): We enrolled 27 RA patients in low disease activity or clinical remission (DAS28-CRP <2.7) and 21 healthy controls in this study. The cartilage thickness (CT) of metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints of 2nd to 5th fingers was bilaterally visualized and measured from a dorsal view, with approximately 90 degrees flexion. In addition, JSN of finger were scored by van der Heijde- modified Sharp method. Result(s): In patients with RA, CT in MCP joints ranged from 0.0 to 0.8 mm (median 0.4 mm), and CT in PIP ranged from 0.0 to 0.4mm (median 0.2mm), respectively. The sum of total CT from 8 fingers ranged from 2.7 to 6.8 mm (median 4.7 mm), and there was a significant difference in CT, but not in JSN score, between male and female patients (5.6 versus 4.6, respectively, p=0.005). Healthy controls had the sum of total CT significantly thicker as compared with RA (p<=0.001). Importantly, CT was well correlated with JSN (r=-0.696, p<0.001). Although CT was not correlated with age, disease duration, DAS28-CRP, functional disability score, positivity of rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP-antibody, CT was reduced in RA patients with elevated serum matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) values compared with those with normal MMP-3 (3.9 versus 5.0, p=0.015).

3600,"Antegrade wire escalation for chronic total occlusions in coronary arteries: Simple algorithms as a key to success Aims: Antegrade wire escalation (AWE) remains the method of choice for tackling chronic total occlusions (CTOs), especially for lesions with low J-CTO score. To increase the number of operators which treat CTOs and increase AWE success rates, there is a need for a clear, algorithmic approach. We report the results of a simple AWE algorithm with new guidewire technology in coronary CTOs. Method(s): Hundred consecutive CTO lesions selected for AWE as the primary strategy were included in five Benelux centers. The algorithm follows a step-wise increase in guidewire tip load. Lesions were categorized according to the J-CTO score. Primary endpoint was successful guidewire crossing. Result(s): No differences in baseline demographics were present between successful and unsuccessful procedures. Overall, in 75% of the lesions AWE resulted in successful crossing. AWE success rates in easy, intermediate, difficult and very difficult CTOs were 83, 86, 71 and 43%, respectively. 46% could be crossed using a soft guidewire only. An additional success of 34 and 60% could be reached with an intermediate and stiff guidewire, respectively. Adding additional techniques resulted in 88% overall success. Procedure and fluoroscopy times, radiation doses and use of contrast were within highly acceptable ranges (67+/-39min, 27+/-19min, 1.7+/-1.3 Gy, 264+/-123ml). Conclusion(s): The algorithm and new wire technologies led to high success rates. AWE as a standalone procedure is highly successful in J-CTO 0-1. Low- and intermediatevolume CTO operators should try to implement a systematic approach in their CTO procedures, especially for lesions with low J-CTO scores. Adding additional techniques further increases these success rates.© Copyright 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
3247,"Mitochondrial DNA somatic mutations are frequent in nasopharyngeal carcinoma Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is one of the most common cancers in southern China, and is highly sensitive to radiotherapy. The control region (D-loop) of mtDNA is a polymorphic region in which point mutations occur frequently. In this study, point mutation and common deletion (CD) mutations were investigated in 23 samples of NPC tumor tissue and in the radiation-treated NPC cell line CNE2. Polymorphisms at 72 (7.28%, 72/988) nucleotide positions in D-loop region and 6 (0.75%, 6/795) nucleotide positions in part of the functional gene encoding regions were detected in all NPC patients. Of the detected polymorphisms, 8 are novel. These variants are nonencoding transitions, including np292T-->C , np517G-del, np16038A-->G, np513G-del, np16242C-->A, np513G-del, np16242C-->A and np15787T-->C transition. A total of 39 point mutations in the D-loop region of mtDNA were detected in 43.5% (10/23) of the NPC patients. Three point mutations in the functional gene encoding regions of mtDNA were detected in only 8.7% (2/23) of NPC patients. The effect of he mutation at np709G-->A in the 12sRNA gene is unclear, and the A-->G substitution at np15769 in the cytochrome B gene is a synonymous mutation. The C-->T substitution at np15970 in the T Psi C loop of the tRNA(pro) gene could alter the position of the proline residue. After irradiation, the survival fraction of CNE2 cells decreased as X-ray dose increased. Moreover, X-ray radiation could induce apoptosis and the CD mutation in a time- and dose-dependent manner, but did not induce mtDNA point mutations. A positive correlation between the apoptosis index and the ratio of CD/WT mtDNA was observed in irradiated CNE2 cells. Our results suggest that CD mutation induced by irradiation is one of the late events after apoptosis of the cancer cells, and the mtDNA CD mutation may associated with the susceptibility of NPC cells to IR-induced apoptosis.",Excluded
3324,"A Prospective Study of Distal Microscopic Spread in Rectal Cancer After Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation in Pinned and Unpinned Specimen The most important margin in determining the prognosis of rectal cancer is circumferential resection margin (CRM). But, the type of surgery is determined by distal rectal margin (DRM), whether sphincter saving procedure is possible or patient needs an abdominoperineal resection. There are no standardized uniform guidelines for measurement of DRM. The purpose of this study is to assess the distal microscopic spread beyond gross margin after neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) in rectal cancers, the factors influencing the distal microscopic spread, the shrinkage of the distal margin in pinned and unpinned fresh and fixed specimen, and to find out the best method of measurement of distal rectal margin. A prospective analytical study was conducted from May 2013 through February 2015 in 47 cases of carcinoma rectum (both AR and APR) who had received neoadjuvant CCRT. Fresh specimen was collected within 30 min of specimen retrieval and a longitudinal cut was made in the distal margin of all specimens. One side of the specimen was pinned onto a cork board and the other side was left unpinned. Measurements were made from the distal end of clinical gross tumor. DRM was determined in both pinned and unpinned sides in fresh and fixed specimen. Of the 47 patients, 2 patients (4.2%) had small focus of tumor beyond gross margins, 1 at 6 mm and another at 3.5 mm on the unpinned side. The average margin for fresh and fixed pinned specimens was 3.67 and 3.47 cm, respectively, with percentage shrinkage of 5.4% for the pinned specimens. The average margin for fresh and fixed unpinned specimens was 3.32 and 2.84 cm, respectively, with percentage shrinkage of 14.4% for the unpinned specimens. Six patients (12.7%) had complete pathological response. Correlation of distal margin was better in pinned specimen. A correction factor of 15% for shrinkage needs to be taken into account while assessing unpinned specimen. Only in 4.2% of patients, there was distal submucosal spread beyond gross margin. Long-term follow up is required for assessing adequacy of DRM post neoadjuvant CCRT.Copyright © 2017, Indian Association of Surgical Oncology.",Excluded
2696,"Potential benefits and pitfalls of respiratory-gated radiotherapy in the treatment of thoracic malignancy Aim: Despite advances in radiotherapy delivery, the prognosis of lung cancer remains poor. Higher doses of radiation have been associated with improved outcomes but may result in higher toxicities. Respiratory gated radiotherapy (RGRT) has the potential to reduce pulmonary toxicity but there are significant limitations and pitfalls to its use. The aim of this article is to (i) describe the RGRT technique currently employed at Nepean and Westmead Hospitals; (ii) discuss the practical issues of implementing such a program; (iii) present the results of our RGRT program and (iv) review the potential uncertainties in using this technique and the methods we have used to overcome these. Method(s): A retrospective review of all patients who had a 4D-computed tomography (4D-CT) scan was undertaken. Records from treatment planning systems were used to assess the prospective gating program. Result(s): Between September 2007 and June 2011, 53 patients at Nepean and 26 patients at Westmead Hospital underwent a 4D-CT. Between April and August 2011, 26 patients at Westmead Hospital underwent a prospective 4D-CT scan as treatment verification. Two of the 26 patients (7.7%) were found to have incomplete coverage of the planning target volume. Both patients underwent respiratory re-coaching, alleviating the need for replanning. Conclusion(s): RGRT may reduce doses to organs at risk with the potential for dose escalation. However its implementation requires significant staff training, treatment time and resources. Treatment verification with image guided radiation therapy are essential for safe delivery. © 2013 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.",Excluded

Overall survival (OS), local control (LC), regional control (RC), and grade 3 to 4 late toxicity (LT) were compared between ipsilateral RT and bilateral RT within HPV+ and HPV- patients, separately., RESULTS: HPV status was ascertained in 379/427 (88%) consecutive patients (ipsilateral RT: 62 HPV+, 34 HPV-; bilateral RT: 240 HPV+ 240, 41 HPV-). The proportion of ipsilateral RT by N category for HPV+ and HPV- patients were as follows: N0: 24/37 (65%) versus 28/48 (74%); N1: 21/49 (43%) versus 4/9 (44%); N2a: 10/39 (26%) versus 1/4 (25%); and N2b: 7/177 (4%) versus 1/24 (4%), respectively. Of the patients receiving ipsilateral RT, 94/96 (98%) were treated with RT alone. The median follow-up time was 5.03 years. The respective 5-year rates of OS, LC, RC, and LT were similar between ipsilateral RT and bilateral RT for the HPV+ patients (OS: 89% vs 87%, P=.55; LC: 97% vs 98%, P=.65; RC: 98% vs 97%, P=.27; LT: 17% vs 12%, P=.83) and HPV- patients (OS: 63% vs 48%, P=.27; LC: 90% vs 80%, P=.19; RC: 94% vs 83%, P=.14; LT: 15% vs 22%, P=.36). Of the 96 patients receiving ipsilateral RT, contralateral neck failure (CNF) occurred in 1/52 HPV+ patients and 1/34 HPV- patients. The 5-year CNF rates were 2% (95% CI: 1-9) (HPV+: 2% [0-14]; HPV-: 3% [0-21], P=.66). Five local failures (2 HPV+; 3 HPV-) and no distant failures were seen. The 5-year rates of LC, RC, and LT were 97% versus 90% (P=.24), 98% versus 94% (P=.25), and 18% versus 15% (P=.75) for the HPV+ and HPV- cohorts, respectively. Osteoradionecrosis occurred in 9 patients: 6/47 (13%) treated with conventional RT and 3/49 (6%) with intensity modulated RT (P=.32)., CONCLUSION: Ipsilateral radiation to selected patients with T1-T2N0-N2b tonsillar cancer results in equally excellent outcomes regardless of tumor HPV status.

2907,"Feasibility and safety of extended adjuvant temozolomide beyond six cycles for patients with glioblastoma Introduction: Temozolomide is the first chemotherapeutic agent proven effective for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. The drug is well tolerated for its low toxicity. The current standard practice is concomitant chemoradiotherapy for 6 weeks followed by 6 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide. Some Caucasian studies have suggested that patients might benefit from extended adjuvant cycles of temozolomide (>6 cycles) to lengthen both progression-free survival and overall survival. In the present study, we compared differences in survival and toxicity profile between patients who received conventional 6-cycle temozolomide and those who received more than 6 cycles of temozolomide. Method(s): Patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma without progressive disease and completed concomitant chemoradiotherapy during a 4-year period were studied. Progression-free survival was compared using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. t Test, U test, and correlation were chosen accordingly to examine the impact of age, extent of resection, MGMT promoter methylation status and adjuvant cycles on progression-free survival. For factors with a P value of <0.05 in univariate analyses, Cox regression hazard model was adopted to determine the strongest factors related to progression-free survival. Result(s): The median progression-free survival was 17.0 months for patients who received 6 cycles of temozolomide (n=7) and 43.4 months for those who received more than 6 cycles (n=7) [P=0.007, log-rank test]. Two patients in the former group and one in the latter group encountered grade 1 toxicity and recovered following dose adjustment. Cycles of adjuvant temozolomide were correlated with progression-free survival (P=0.016, hazard ratio=0.68). Conclusion(s): Extended cycles of temozolomide are safe and feasible for Chinese patients with disease responsive to temozolomide.Copyright © 2017, Hong Kong Academy of Medicine Press.

2697,"Bone loss in very early inflammatory back pain in undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy: A 1-year observational study Objective: Bone loss in patients with inflammatory back pain (IBP) suspicious of early undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy is poorly defined. The aim of this study was to examine changes in bone mineral density (BMD) at the hip, lumbar spine and hand in patients with early IBP and to look for possible biomarkers associated with this change. Method(s): In 30 patients with early IBP, clinical data were collected and BMD assessed using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Further imaging performed included MRI of the sacroiliac joints (SIJs) and spine at baseline and x-rays of the SIJs at baseline and after 8 years. Result(s): After 12 months no significant reduction in hip, spine and hand BMD was seen at the group level. However, hip bone loss was found to be associated with raised baseline C-reactive protein levels, baseline MRI bone marrow oedema of the SIJs and the presence of radiographic sacroiliitis after 8 years. No association was found with change in spine and hand BMD. Conclusion(s): Systemic bone loss in the hip is an early feature of the inflammatory disease process in patients with IBP in undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy and is related to disease activity. These data highlight the importance of aggressive intervention in the early stages of disease in undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy.",Excluded

However, the optimal combination remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of 2 induction chemotherapy cycles (days 1 and 22) with docetaxel 75 mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 followed by concurrent chemotherapy (weekly docetaxel-cisplatin, 20 mg/m2) and 3-D conformal radiotherapy for 6 weeks (66 Gy/5 fractions per week/2 Gy per fraction). The primary endpoint was the response rate. Secondary objectives were toxicity, time to progression, and overall survival. Forty-four patients were included and 40 were eligible. The mean age was 60.5 years (range 40.7-72.1), and 75% had stage IIIB disease. Six patients underwent complete R0 resection including 2 pathologic complete responses after a planned intermediate evaluation. Thirty-three patients completed CHRT. The objective response rate was 65% (95% CI 50.2-79.8). Grade 3-4 hematologic and digestive toxicities were observed mainly during the induction phase. Grade 3 esophagitis (5%) was experienced during CHRT. With a median follow-up of 38.7 months, the median progression-free survival was 28.3 months (95% CI 11.0-35.0) and the median survival rate was 31.4 months. Cisplatin-docetaxel induction followed by concurrent 3-D conformal radiotherapy and weekly chemotherapy is a feasible protocol associated with a promising response rate and acceptable toxicity.

3335,"Gene-arsenic interaction in longitudinal changes of blood pressure: Findings from the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study (HEALS) in Bangladesh Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and mounting evidence indicates that toxicant exposures can profoundly impact on CVD risk. Epidemiologic studies have suggested that arsenic (As) exposure is positively related to increases in blood pressure (BP), a primary CVD risk factor. However, evidence of whether genetic susceptibility can modify the association between As and BP is lacking. In this study, we used mixed effect models adjusted for potential confounders to examine the interaction between As exposure from well water and potential genetic modifiers on longitudinal change in BP over approximately 7. years of follow-up in 1137 subjects selected from the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study (HEALS) cohort in Bangladesh. Genotyping was conducted for 235 SNPs in 18 genes related to As metabolism, oxidative stress and endothelial function. We observed interactions between 44 SNPs with well water As for one or more BP outcome measures (systolic, diastolic, or pulse pressure (PP)) over the course of follow-up. The interaction between CYBA rs3794624 and well water As on annual PP remained statistically significant after correction for multiple comparisons (FDR-adjusted p for interaction = 0.05). Among individuals with the rs3794624 variant genotype, well water As was associated with a 2.23. mm. Hg (95% CI: 1.14-3.32) greater annual increase in PP, while among those with the wild type, well water As was associated with a 0.13. mm. Hg (95% CI: 0.02-0.23) greater annual increase in PP. Our results suggest that genetic variability may contribute to As-associated increases in BP over time.Copyright © 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
3096,"Standard dose and dose-escalated radiation therapy are associated with favorable survival in select elderly patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma We hypothesized elderly patients with good Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) treated with standard dose or dose-escalated radiation therapy (SDRT/DERT) and concurrent temozolomide (TMZ) would have favorable overall survival (OS) compared to historical elderly patients treated with hypofractionated RT (HFRT). From 2004 to 2015, 66 patients age >= 60 with newly diagnosed, pathologically proven glioblastoma were treated with SDRT/DERT over 30 fractions with concurrent/adjuvant TMZ at a single institution. Kaplan-Meier methods and the log-rank test were used to assess OS and progression-free survival (PFS). Multivariate analysis (MVA) was performed using Cox Proportional-Hazards. Median follow-up was 12.6 months. Doses ranged from 60 to 81 Gy (median 66). Median KPS was 90 (range 60-100) and median age was 67 years (range 60-81), with 29 patients >= 70 years old. 32% underwent gross total resection (GTR). MGMT status was known in 28%, 42% of whom were methylated. Median PFS was 8.3 months (95% CI 6.9-11.0) and OS was 12.7 months (95% CI 9.7-14.1). Patients age >= 70 with KPS >= 90 had a median OS of 12.4 months. Median OS was 27.1 months for MGMT methylated patients. On MVA controlling for age, dose, KPS, MGMT, GTR, and adjuvant TMZ, younger age (HR 0.9, 95% CI 0.8-0.9, p < 0.01), MGMT methylation (HR:0.2, 95% CI 0.1-0.7, p = 0.01), and GTR (HR:0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.9, p = 0.01) were associated with improved OS. Our findings do not support routine use of a standard 6-week course of radiation therapy in elderly patients with glioblastoma. However, a select group of elderly patients with excellent performance status and MGMT methylation or GTR may experience favorable survival with a standard 6-week course of treatment.",Excluded
3377,"Complete histopathological regression in rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and sphincter preserving surgical treatment Background/Aim. Multimodal approach to locally advanced rectal cancer treatment results in better disease outcome. Preoperative chemoradiotherapy improves disease local control, reduces risk of local recurrence and in the majority of patients with complete or substantial regression of the tumors significantly improves survival rates. According to the literature data, approximately 20% of patients had achieved complete histopathological response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate overall survival in rectal cancer patients treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy and sphincter preserving surgery. Methods. This retrospective study included 191 patients. Patients received preoperative radiation therapy and chemotherapy-chemoradiation therapy (CRT) followed by operation that favorized sphincter preservation with total mesorectal excision (TME) from June 2000 until December 2010. Diagnosis was established according to the following algorithm: patient history, digital rectal examiantion, colonoscopy with biopsy and histopathology verification, and preoperative clinical staging. Patients with tumors located below promontorium were included in the study and patients with metastatic disease and local recurrence were excluded from the study. For tumors located below the promontorium preoperative radiotherapy was used with total dose of 50.4 Gy, divided into daily doses of 1.8 Gy, during 28 days. Chemotherapy followed radiotherapy with 5- fluorouracil and folic acid (Leucovorin) on days 1, 2, 10, 11, 20 and 21. Six to ten weeks after neoadjuvant therapy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to restage tumors and operation were performed. Results. Of all patients that received preopertive chemoradiation, 163 had radical sphincter preservig surgery and 28 patients had paliative operations. Histopathological examination of the specimens showed that the complete histopathological regression was achieved in 21.4% of the patients, downstaged was found in 63.2% of them and unchanged stage was found in 15.3% of the patients. The five-year survival rate was 63.3% and 50.5 % in the patients with pCR and patients with incomplete histopathological regression, respectively. Survival rates between two groups were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Conclusion. The preoperative chemoradiotherapy is very important in achieving optimal clinical care for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.Copyright © 2018, Inst. Sci. inf., Univ. Defence in Belgrade.

3474,"Muscle injury following experimental intraoperative irradiation The paraaortic region of beagle dogs was irradiated to 15 to 55 Gy intraoperative irradiation, 10 to 47.5 Gy intraoperative irradiation following 50 Gy external beam irradiation in 25 fractions, or 50 to 80 Gy external beam irradiation in 30 fractions. Six MeV electrons were used for intraoperative irradiation, and external beam irradiation was done using photons from a 6 MV linear accelerator. The psoas muscle in the irradiation field was examined histomorphometrically 2 or 5 years after irradiation. The percentage of muscle fibers and capillaries decreased, whereas the percentage of connective tissue increased with increased dose for both intraoperative irradiation only and intraoperative irradiation plus external beam irradiation. The dose causing a 50% decrease in the percentage of muscle fibers was 21.2 Gy and 33.8 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation alone, and 22.9 Gy and 25.2 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation combined with 50 Gy external beam irradiation. The ED50 for severe vessel lesions was 19.2 Gy and 25.8 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation alone and 16.0 Gy and 18.0 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation combined with 50 Gy external beam irradiation. External beam irradiation alone caused a slight decrease in percentage of muscle fibers with increased dose, and vessel lesions were infrequent or mild. Radiation-induced muscle injury was characterized by loss of muscle fibers, decreased fiber size, severe vessel lesions, hemorrhage, inflammation, coagulation necrosis, and fibrosis. These histopathologic characteristics distinguish this muscle injury from that caused by neurogenic atrophy. These data indicate that radiation-induced muscle injury most likely was caused by injury of the supporting vasculature. The lesions produced were largely a function of the single intraoperative dose rather than the external beam fractionated doses. Furthermore, it appears that 20 to 25 Gy intraoperative irradiation combined with 50 Gy external beam irradiation may be near the maximum tolerated dose by sublumbar musculature and its supporting vasculature.",Excluded
3421,"Changes in liver stiffness using acoustic radiation force impulse imaging in patients with obstructive cholestasis and cholangitis Background: Acoustic radiation force impulse imaging is used to assess stages of liver fibrosis. The aim of our study was to evaluate liver stiffness changes in patients with biliary obstruction with or without sclerosing cholangitis after biliary drainage. Method(s): A total of 71 patients were enrolled in this prospective study (cohort N= 51, control group N= 20); 51 patients with obstructive cholestasis, indicated for endoscopic retrograde cholangiography, received stiffness measurement by acoustic radiation force impulse imaging before and 1-2 days after endoscopic retrograde cholangiography. Seventeen patients with obstructive cholestasis had primary or secondary sclerosing cholangitis. Forty one patients had a follow-up acoustic radiation force impulse imaging measurement after 3.0 +/- 9.31 weeks. Result(s): In all patients with obstructive cholestasis, stiffness decreased significantly after biliary drainage (p< 0.001). The main decrease was observed within 2 days after endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (1.92-1.57 m/s, p< 0.001) and correlated with the decrease of bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase (p= 0.04 and p= 0.002, respectively). In patients with sclerosing cholangitis, the initial decrease of stiffness after biliary drainage was weaker than in those without (2.1-1.85 m/s vs. 1.81-1.43 m/s, p= 0.016). Conclusion(s): Acoustic radiation force impulse imaging elastography shows that liver stiffness is increased by biliary obstruction, and decreases after endoscopic retrograde cholangiography irrespective of the aetiology. In patients with sclerosing cholangitis the reduction in stiffness after biliary drainage is impaired. © 2014 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.",Excluded

2755,"When is rotational angiography superior to conventional single-plane angiography for planning coronary angioplasty? OBJECTIVES: To investigate the value of rotational coronary angiography (RoCA) in the context of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) planning., BACKGROUND: As a diagnostic tool, RoCA is associated with decreased patient irradiation and contrast use compared with conventional coronary angiography (CA) and provides superior appreciation of three-dimensional anatomy. However, its value in PCI remains unknown., METHODS: We studied stable coronary artery disease assessment and PCI planning by interventional cardiologists. Patients underwent either RoCA or conventional CA pre-PCI for planning. These were compared with the referral CA (all conventional) in terms of quantitative lesion assessment and operator confidence. An independent panel reanalyzed all parameters., RESULTS: Six operators performed 127 procedures (60 RoCA, 60 conventional CA, and 7 crossed-over) and assessed 212 lesions. RoCA was associated with a reduction in the number of lesions judged to involve a bifurcation (23 vs. 30 lesions, P < 0.05) and a reduction in the assessment of vessel caliber (2.8 vs. 3.0 mm, P < 0.05). RoCA improved confidence assessing lesion length (P = 0.01), percentage stenosis (P = 0.02), tortuosity (P < 0.04), and proximity to a bifurcation (P = 0.03), particularly in left coronary artery cases. X-ray dose, contrast agent volume, and procedure duration were not significantly different., CONCLUSIONS: Compared with conventional CA, RoCA augments quantitative lesion assessment, enhances confidence in the assessment of coronary artery disease and the precise details of the proposed procedure, but does not affect X-ray dose, contrast agent volume, or procedure duration.

The clinical and technical characteristics of the first ten proton beam radiotherapy treatments are reported. Ten patients, six males and four females (age range 27-73 years, median 55.5), were treated with proton beam radiotherapy. After one to two surgical procedures, seven patients received a histological diagnosis of chordoma (of the skull base in three cases, the cervical spine in one case and the sacrum in three cases) and three of low-grade chondrosarcoma (skull base). Prescribed doses were 74 GyE for chordoma and 70 GyE for chondrosarcoma at 2 GyE/fraction delivered 5 days per week. Treatment was well tolerated without toxicity-related interruptions. The maximal acute toxicity was grade 2, with oropharyngeal mucositis, nausea and vomiting for the skull base tumours, and grade 2 dermatitis for the sacral tumours. After 6-12 months of follow-up, no patient developed tumour progression. The analysis of the first ten patients treated with proton therapy at CNAO showed that this treatment was feasible and safe.

Our experience included eight male and three female patients. The median patient age at GKSR was 62 years (range 46-72 years). At the time of GKSR, seven patients had a first recurrence and four had two or more recurrences. The median interval from the initial diagnosis until GKSR was 17 months (range 5-34.5 months). The median tumor volume was 13.6 cm(3) (range 1.2-45.1 cm(3)) and the median margin dose of GKSR was 16 Gy (range 13-18 Gy). Following GKSR, bevacizumab was administrated with irinotecan in nine patients and with temozolomide in one patient. One patient was treated with bevacizumab monotherapy. The treatment outcomes were compared to 44 case-matched controls who underwent GKSR without additional bevacizumab. At a median of 13.7 months (range 4.6-28.3 months) after radiosurgery, tumor progression was evident in seven patients. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 15 months (95% confidential interval (CI), 6.5-23.3 months). Six-month and 1-year PFS rates were 73 and 55%, respectively. The median overall survival (OS) from GKSR was 18 months (95% CI, 10.1-25.7 months) and 1-year OS rate was 73%. One patient (9%) experienced grade III toxicity and one patient (9%) had major adverse radiation effects.

2645,"Empty peek cages in ACDF: Does partial titanium coating improve the radiographic fusion? BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is an effective standard surgical treatment for radiculopathy and myelopathy. Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is a popular and advantageous material for the cages used in ACDF, but clinical studies have shown that radiographic fusion is slower with PEEK cages than with titanium cages. In a previous large prospective multicenter study, we showed that empty PEEK cages have slow and insufficient radiographic fusion and that failure to achieve complete radiographic fusion results in less improvement in pain and disability. It was hypothesized that a PEEK cage coated with titanium on the top and bottom surfaces would achieve better radiographic fusion rates than an otherwise identical uncoated PEEK cage. PURPOSE: To determine if a PEEK cage with a titanium coating on the top and bottom surfaces achieves better radiographic fusion than an identical PEEK cage without any titanium coating. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Prospective multicenter single-arm clinical trial, with matched controls from another prospective multicenter singlearm clinical trial. PATIENT SAMPLE: Fifty patients receiving single-level ACDF, for radiculopathy or myelopathy at a single level C3-4 to C7-T1, and 50 matched controls selected from a similar clinical trial. This interim analysis presents results from the first 28 cases and 50 controls, and the presentation at the Annual Meeting will present the full final results of all 50 patients and 50 controls. OUTCOME MEASURES: Radiographic fusion was assessed on X-ray images by two independent investigators for three aspects-bony bridging, subsidence/migration, and range of motion, yielding a 0-7 score, with scores of 6 and 7 defined as ""complete fusion."" Clinical outcomes included Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain, Neck Disability Index (NDI) for functioning, and Odom's criterion. METHOD(S): Single-level ACDF was performed using stand-alone empty PEEK cages with versus without titanium coating on the top and bottom surfaces, without postoperative bracing. Follow-up assessments were made at 6, 12, and 18 months. RESULT(S): The rate of complete fusion for PEEK+Ti cages versus uncoated PEEK controls was: 50.0% vs 40.0% at 6 months, 75.0% vs 72.0% at 12 months, and 78.5% vs 84.0% at 18 months, and there was no statistically significant difference between these rates. There was also no statistically significant difference between the two groups for the amount of subsidence at any follow-up. Pain (VAS) and functioning (NDI) improved in both groups with no statistically significant difference between them. The fusion status correlated significantly (p<.05) with VAS at 6 and 18 months and with NDI at 12 and 18 months. The Odom's criterion at 18 months was the same in both groups: ""good"" or ""excellent"" for 89% of PEEK+Ti patients vs 90% for PEEK patients (p=.90). CONCLUSION(S): This interim analysis from our study rejects our hypothesis that titanium coating of PEEK cages at the bearing surface (cage/ vertebra interface) would improve the low fusion rate of empty PEEK cages: neither the speed nor the ultimate frequency of fusion was significantly different between the cases and matched controls. Our study suggests that endplate/interface coating alone does not improve fusion. Perhaps a possible immune response to the remaining uncovered PEEK at the lateral and inner cage surfaces may be a reason for the slow and insufficient rate of fusion. PEEK cages fully coated with titanium should be tested next.",Excluded
3648,"Definitive chemoradiotherapy of limited-disease small cell lung cancer: Retrospective analysis of new predictive factors affecting treatment results The aim of this study was to evaluate potential predictive factors in the treatment of limited-disease small cell lung cancer (LD-SCLC). A total of 33 patients with LD-SCLC who underwent definitive chemoradiotherapy at our institute between April 1996 and May 2007 were enrolled in our retrospective study. The relationship between a range of potential predictive factors and the initial response, time to progression and pattern of failure was analyzed. The factors evaluated included the tumor markers Pro-gastrin-releasing peptide (Pro-GRP) and neuron-specific enolase; net tumor size (sum of each lesion mass on computed tomography at 1-cm intervals); total radiation dose; biological effective dose (BED); overall treatment time (OTT); time between the start of any type of treatment and the end of radiation therapy (SER). In addition, the novel factors of radiation dose-intensity (RDI = BED/OTT) and RDI/NTS (= RDI/net tumor size) were defined. Of the 33 patients evaluated in our study, 22 (67%) achieved a complete response (CR) and 27 (82%) experienced treatment failure or recurrence. High RDI/NTS values showed a significant correlation with CR (P=0.043). Prolonged OTT and lower values of RDI and RDI/NTS showed a significant correlation with recurrence within 12 months (P=0.022, 0.033 and 0.015, respectively). The lower values of RDI and RDI/NTS showed a significant correlation with distant metastasis as a first failure site (P=0.038 and 0.044, respectively). Patients with RDI/NTS =0.08 had a more favorable prognosis (P=0.045). Thus, RDI and RDI/NTS may become beneficial predictive factors in the treatment of LD-SCLC. However, further studies are required to confirm our preliminary results.",Excluded
2644,"Mediastinal Nodal Involvement After Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation for Siewert II/III Adenocarcinoma Background: Adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction (AEG) poses a management challenge, as preoperative prediction of occult mediastinal nodal metastasis is difficult. We sought to identify factors predictive of mediastinal involvement among patients undergoing trimodality therapy. Method(s): Patients undergoing trimodality therapy for Siewert II and III AEG at a single institution between 2000 and 2015 were identified. Mediastinal involvement was defined as pathologic nodal involvement after neoadjuvant chemoradiation (ypN+) in mediastinal stations or mediastinal recurrence 2 years or less after resection. Maximal chi2 analysis and Youden's J index were used to identify the pretreatment proximal tumor extent that best discriminated mediastinal involvement. Result(s): In all, 204 patients (151 [74%] AEG II, 53 [26%] AEG III) were included, of whom 47 (23%) had clinical evidence of thoracic nodal disease. Thirty-one of the 204 patients (15%) met criteria for mediastinal involvement (24 of 31 ypN+, 10 of 31 mediastinal recurrence). Patients with mediastinal involvement had greater proximal tumor extent (median 2 cm [interquartile range, 1.0 to 3.0 cm] vs 1.4 cm [interquartile range, 0.7 to 3.0 cm], P =.030), were more frequently Siewert II lesions (27 of 31 [87.1%] vs 124 of 173 [71.7%], P =.071), and were more often observed to have clinical thoracic nodal metastasis (cN) evidence (13 of 31 [42%] vs 34 of 173 [20%], P =.007) than patients who did not. On multivariable analysis of patients with intrathoracic cN0, esophageal extent of 1.5 cm or greater was independently predictive of mediastinal involvement (odds ratio 5.46, P =.011), whereas Siewert classification was not (Siewert II odds ratio 3.48, P =.116). Conclusion(s): Pretreatment proximal tumor extent, rather than Siewert classification, is an independent predictor of mediastinal involvement among AEG II/III patients without clinical evidence of mediastinal metastasis and should be considered during treatment planning.Copyright © 2019 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons",Excluded
2951,"DW-MRI-guided dose escalation improves local control of locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated with chemoradiotherapy Background: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is one of the most highly radiosensitive malignancies; however, some locally advanced NPC patients experienced local recurrence even though they received aggressive treatment regimens. Defining the tumor volume precisely is important to escalate the total dose required for the primary tumor. In this study, we aimed to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of dose escalation guided by DW-MRI in patients with locally advanced NPC. Patients and Methods: A total of 230 patients with locally advanced NPC treated with intensive modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) at Sichuan Cancer Hospital between January 2010 and January 2015 were enrolled in this retrospective study. All the patients were treated with all-course of simultaneous integrated boost-IMRT. DW-MRI-guided dose escalation with 2.2-2.5 Gy/F, qd for 1-3daysor1.2-1.5 Gy/F, bid for 1-3 days were prescribed to 123 patients. Survival and complication of the patients were evaluated, and multivariate analysis was performed. Result(s): The median follow-up of patients in the DW-MRI-guided dose-escalation group and the conventional group was 48 months (range 8-88 months) and 52 months (range 6-90 months), respectively. The 5-year overall survival rate, distant metastasis-free survival rate, progression-free survival, and local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) of patients in the dose-escalation group and the conventional group were 88% vs 82.5% (p = 0.244), 86.1% vs 83.3% (p = 0.741), 82.2% vs 76.6% (p = 0.286), and 89.1% vs 80.1% (p = 0.029), respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that dose escalation was independent prognostic factor for LRFS (HR 0.386, 95% CI 0.163-0.909, p = 0.03). Conclusion(s): DW-MRI-guided dose escalation is a feasible strategy to improve local control of patients with locally advanced NPC. The treatment-related complications are tolerable.Copyright © 2020 Huang et al.",Excluded
3154,"Synchronous Chemoradiotherapy in Patients with Locally Advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck using Capecitabine: A Single-centre, Open-label, Single-group Phase II Study Aim: To evaluate the efficacy of concurrent oral capecitabine with accelerated hypofractionated radical radiotherapy in locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Material(s) and Method(s): Between 2001 and 2004, 50 patients with stage III/IV SCCHN (0 to 2 performance status) were enrolled into this study. The capecitabine dose was between 450 and 550mg/m2 twice daily, continuously for 28 days. The radiotherapy dose was 5500cGy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks. No intensity-modulated radiation was used. We evaluated the complete response rate, toxicity, locoregional control, overall survival, disease-free survival and cancer-specific survival. Result(s): The median age was 55 (range 38-76) years; 72% had stage IV disease. The median follow-up was 6 years on the 30 surviving patients. Eighty-two per cent of patients completed the course of capecitabine and 94% completed prescribed radiotherapy. There were no treatment-related deaths, grade 3/4 haematological or renal toxicity. Five patients developed drug-related grade 3/4 acute toxicity (cardiac, skin, bowel); 47 developed grade 3/4 mucositis from chemoradiotherapy. Twenty-two (44%) patients required tube feeding and the tube dependency rate at 1 year was 6%. The complete response rate at 3 months was 90% (45/50 patients). Relapse occurred in 17/50 (34%) patients by 5 years. The locoregional control, overall survival, cancer-specific survival and disease-free survival rates at 3 years were 78, 72, 82 and 62%, respectively, and at 5 years were 72, 64, 75 and 56%, respectively. Conclusion(s): This schedule of synchronous capecitabine for locally advanced SCCHN is well tolerated. The local control in this series compares favourably with other synchronous chemoradiotherapy reports. Chronic dysphagia and tube dependence is uncommon with this approach. Capecitabine as targeted therapy given with each fraction of radiotherapy and administered orally may have significant advantages over intravenous, 3 weekly cisplatin. © 2010 The Royal College of Radiologists.",Excluded
2937,"Autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia with oculomotor apraxia (ataxia-telangiectasia-like syndrome) is linked to chromosome 9q34 Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia (ataxia-telangiectasia-like syndrome [AOA]; MIM 208920) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by ataxia, oculomotor apraxia, and choreoathetosis. These neurological features resemble those of ataxia-telangiectasia (AT), but in AOA there are none of the extraneurological features of AT, such as immunodeficiency, neoplasia, chromosomal instability, or sensitivity to ionizing radiation. It is unclear whether these patients have a true disorder of chromosomal instability or a primary neurodegenerative syndrome, and it has not been possible to identify the defective gene in AOA, since the families have been too small for linkage analysis. We have identified a new family with AOA, and we show that the patients have no evidence of chromosomal instability or sensitivity to ionizing radiation, suggesting that AOA in this family is a true primary cerebellar ataxia. We have localized the disease gene, by linkage analysis and homozygosity mapping, to a 15.9-cM interval on chromosome 9q34. This work will ultimately allow the disease gene to be identified and its relevance to other types of autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias to be determined.",Excluded
2557,"[Cardiologic side effects of therapeutic irradiation of breast cancer--early results] Authors prospectively examined 54 breast-cancer patients treated by postoperative telecobalt (28), or electron therapy (26). They studied the cardiological side-effects caused by ionizing radiation. ECG, echocardiography and measurement of the systolic time intervals were performed before, immediately, 6 weeks, 6 months, one and 1.5-2 yrs after the completion of radiotherapy. Twenty-three symptom-free patients were found to have signs of transitorial pericardial irritation, more after telecobalt, than electron therapy (17/6). T-wave inversions were seen on the ECG of twenty patients. In 5 and 3 patients small amounts of pericardial effusion could be detected by echocardiography with, or without ECG alterations, respectively. Other side-effects mentioned by the literature could not be found yet, further follow-up is recommended, however. In the authors' opinion the effect of ionizing radiation, mainly of telecobalt therapy is possibly a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, it is suggested to be considered at the planning of radiation therapy accordingly.",Excluded
2881,"Predictive value of skin invasion in recurrent head and neck cancer patients treated by hypofractionated stereotactic re-irradiation using a cyberknife Background: This study aimed to elucidate the influence of skin invasion in patients with recurrent head and neck cancer treated with re-irradiation using stereotactic radiotherapy. Materials: We reviewed 104 patients treated using CyberKnife in four institutions. Result(s): Nine cases of skin invasion were recognized (8.6 %). Larger tumors tended to exhibit skin invasion. The skin invasion (+) group showed a lower response rate (0/9, 0 %) than the skin invasion (-) group (56/95, 59 %) (p = 0.002). The skin invasion (+) group showed lower local control (LC) and progression free survival (PFS) rates, both 0 % at 6 months, than the skin invasion (-) group, which had a LC of 69 % (p = 0.0001) and a PFS of 48 % at 1 year (p = 0.0157). Median survival time and one-year survival rates for the skin invasion (+) and (-) groups were 6.6 vs. 15.3 months and 14 % vs. 59 % (p = 0.0005), respectively. No patient with skin invasion survived more than 14.4 months. The percentage of patients who developed grade 3 or higher toxicity was 44 % in the skin invasion (+) group and 18 % in the skin invasion (-) group (p = 0.14).

2737,"Validation of prognostic scoring systems for myelodysplastic syndromes in the Swedish MDS-register Background: Since the survival in patients diagnosed with MDS varies from months to decades, prognostic models are important tools for estimating prognosis and making therapy-related decisions. Several scoring systems for risk stratification have been developed including the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), the Revised IPSS (IPSS-R) and the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification-based Prognostic Scoring System (WPSS). The nationwide Swedish MDS-register was started in 2009 and includes newly diagnosed patients with Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and disorders with combined features of myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN). All hospitals in Sweden diagnosing these patients report to the MDS-register, including university hospitals, county and local hospitals. The completeness against the compulsory Swedish Cancer Register was 95% for the period under study (2009-2013). Aim(s): The aim of this study was to validate and compare IPSS, IPSS-R and WPSS in a nationwide population-based setting. Furthermore, we present data on incidence, clinical characteristics at diagnosis and clinical outcomes such as overall survival and AML-transformation. Method(s): All patients aged 16 years or older diagnosed with MDS 2009-2013 and reported to the MDS-register were included (n=1334). Patients with MDS/MPN were excluded (n=291). Data included date of diagnosis, age, gender, WHO-diagnosis, laboratory parameters, transfusions-dependency, diagnostic procedures including information on bone marrow morphology and cytogenetics and information on previous treatment with chemotherapy or irradiation. By means of record linkage, information was obtained from the Swedish Cause of Death Register and the Swedish AML-register up to December 31, 2014 to calculate overall survival (OS) and transformation to AML. Overall and AML-free survival was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Prognostic scores were calculated for IPSS, IPSS-R and WPSS, respectively. The prognostic methods were evaluated using Harrell's concordance (C) index. The indices were internally validated by bootstrapping with 1000 samples. Result(s): The crude yearly incidence of MDS was 3.5 per 100.000 persons. Median age at diagnosis was 76 years and 58% of the patients were male. At time of diagnosis, 49% of patients were dependent on red blood cell transfusions. The median OS for the whole population was 2.7 years and time to 25% AML-transformation was 3.8 years. For 848 (64%) patients data were complete, enabling risk score assessment for all three systems. The major part of missing data was attributed to that karyotyping was not performed, mainly in the older population. Compared to previous register-based studies we found that a larger proportion of patients had higher risk disease. Risk category in the different scoring systems, OS and time to 25% AML-transformation are presented in Table 1. Comparisons between the scoring systems show that all three had good prognostic power. However, IPSS-R and WPSS had significantly better prognostic properties compared to IPSS. (Table Presented) Summary/Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first nationwide population based validation of IPSS, IPSS-R and WPSS. While our findings confirm the prognostic power of all three systems, IPSS-R and WPSS appear to be slightly more powerful tools for prognostication than IPSS.",Excluded
3118,"Magnetic resonance imaging-based tumour perfusion parameters are biomarkers predicting response after radiation to brain metastases PURPOSE: To investigate whether early relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and permeability (Ktrans(2)) measurements may serve as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers of radiation response or progression for brain metastases., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy brain metastases in 44 patients treated with either stereotactic radiosurgery or whole brain radiotherapy were imaged with dynamic susceptibility and dynamic contrast enhancement MRI at baseline, 1 week and 1 month after treatment. The final response status was determined according to volume criteria derived from a 1 year post-treatment MRI or last available follow-up MRI. Tumours were characterised as responders, non-responders, progressors and non-progressors and compared for Ktrans(2), rCBF and rCBV differences. Uni- and multivariate analysis evaluated factors associated with tumour response and progression at 1 week and 1 month. A generalised estimating equations (GEE) model accounted for multiple tumours per subject. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis identified optimal cut-off values, sensitivity and specificity for response or progression., RESULTS: Tumour responders showed lower Ktrans(2) and reduced rCBF at 1 week (P < 0.05 each). Progressive disease showed lower rCBF and reduced rCBV at 1 month (P < 0.05 each). GEE and multivariate analysis revealed lower Ktrans(2) at 1 week, an absence of prior radiation predicted response. At 1 month only lower rCBV predicted progressive disease on GEE and multivariate analysis. Optimal cut-off points for Ktrans(2) and rCBV were 1.37 and 2.03 with sensitivity and specificity of 61.5 and 81.1% and 73.9 and 81.8%, respectively., CONCLUSION: Lower Ktrans(2) at 1 week and rCBV at 1 month discriminated responders and progressive disease, respectively.

3599,"Low dose IR-induced IGF-1-sCLU expression: a p53-repressed expression cascade that interferes with TGFbeta1 signaling to confer a pro-survival bystander effect Inadvertent mammalian tissue exposures to low doses of ionizing radiation (IR) after radiation accidents, remediation of radioactive-contaminated areas, space travel or a dirty bomb represent an interesting trauma to an organism. Possible low-dose IR-induced bystander effects could impact our evaluation of human health effects, as cells within tissue are not equally damaged after doses of IR <=10 cGy. To understand tissue responses after low IR doses, we generated a reporter system using the human clusterin promoter fused to firefly luciferase (hCLUp-Luc). Secretory clusterin (sCLU), an extracellular molecular chaperone, induced by low doses of cytotoxic agents, clears cell debris. Low-dose IR (>=2 cGy) exposure induced hCLUp-Luc activity with peak levels at 96 h, consistent with endogenous sCLU levels. As doses increased (>=1 Gy), sCLU induction amplitudes increased and time-to-peak response decreased. sCLU expression was stimulated by insulin-like growth factor-1, but suppressed by p53. Responses in transgenic hCLUp-Luc reporter mice after low IR doses showed that specific tissues (that is, colon, spleen, mammary, thymus and bone marrow) of female mice induced hCLUp-Luc activity more than male mice after whole body (>=10 cGy) irradiation. Tissue-specific, non-linear dose- and time-responses of hCLUp-Luc and endogenous sCLU levels were noted. Colon maintained homeostatic balance after 10 cGy. Bone marrow responded with delayed, but prolonged and elevated expression. Intraperitoneal administration of alpha-transforming growth factor (TGF)beta1 (1D11), but not control (13C4) antibodies, immediately following IR exposure abrogated CLU induction responses. Induction in vivo also correlated with Smad signaling by activated TGFbeta1 after IR. Mechanistically, media with elevated sCLU levels suppressed signaling, blocked apoptosis and increased survival of TGFbeta1-exposed tumor or normal cells. Thus, sCLU is a pro-survival bystander factor that abrogates TGFbeta1 signaling and most likely promotes wound healing.",Included

Design(s): Prospective randomised study. Setting(s): Dutch (n = 80), English (n = 1), German (n = 1), Swedish (n = 9), and Swiss (n = 1) hospitals. Subjects: The first 500 randomised Dutch patients with primary rectal cancer. Main Outcome Measure(s): Local recurrence, survival, operation- related factors, specific pathological tumour characteristics, short and long term morbidity, and quality of life. Result(s): Between January 1996 and April 1998, 871 Dutch and 94 other patients were randomised. Our feasibility analysis shows that cooperation between and within the participating disciplines goes well. With regard to the surgical part, this can be confirmed by the large number of operations attended by consultant surgeons (58%). The number of abdominoperineal resections appeared to be low (30%), as did the percentage of lateral margins involved (13%). The rate of adverse effects of radiotherapy was acceptable. Apart from a larger operative blood loss and a higher infective complication rate in the irradiated group, no significant differences were found with regard to morbidity and mortality between the randomised groups.

2837,"Mandibulotomy: an analysis of its morbidities The mandibulotomy is a procedure that was developed to improve access in tumour resection. This study aimed to investigate the complications associated with mandibulotomy and analyze factors that could affect the risks of developing these complications. The hospital records of all patients who underwent a mandibulotomy as part of their tumour ablative surgery at two major centres in Malaysia were reviewed retrospectively. Demographic, clinical, and complications data were recorded and analyzed. Early postoperative complications occurred in 46.5% of the patients and post-radiation therapy complications in 16.1%. Wound dehiscence (27.9%) and inferior alveolar nerve injury (25.6%) were the common early postoperative complications. Dental injuries (9.7%) and plate exposure/infection (9.7%) were the common post-radiation therapy complications. Furthermore, inferior alveolar nerve injury and early abscess formation were significantly associated with the site of the mandibulotomy. The T-stage of a tumour but not the site of mandibulotomy was significantly associated with tumour margin clearance. Mandibulotomy does pose an added risk of complications for a patient undergoing tumour surgery. The benefits of mandibulotomy in terms of gaining margin clearance could not be proven in this study. The site of mandibulotomy appears to increase the risk of developing an inferior alveolar nerve injury.Copyright © 2019",Excluded

Background(s): ICBT was commonly used to treat coronary ISR prior to the availability of drug-eluting stents (DES). The long-term outcomes of ICBT for ISR remain unknown. Method(s): Six hundred and eighty consecutive patients who underwent ICBT treated for ISR between September 1998 and April 2005 were included in the study. Clinical and angiographic data were collected and the long-term MACE were measured for all-cause death, myocardial infarction (MI), and target vessel revascularization (TVR) at 10-year follow-up. Result(s): Patients were 63 +/- 11 years old (66% male). The majority of patients were treated with a bare metal stent 670/680 (99%) prior to ICBT. Significant baseline clinical findings include high incidence of smokers 479/680 (70%), hyperlipidemia 638/680 (94%), and multivessel disease 526/680 (77%). The majority of target lesions were diffuse 407/680 (60%), and either in the left anterior descending 258/680 (38%) or right coronary artery 215/680 (32%). At 10-year follow-up, the rate of death was 25%, MI was 22.4%, and TVR was 48%. Conclusion(s): MACE at 10-year follow-up following ICBT for ISR indicates steady rate of death and MI and declining rate of TVR after 5 years.Copyright © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
3147,"Patterns of relapse in patients with high grade glioma receiving combined treatments including stereotactic re-irradiation for a first relapse Purpose Bevacizumab and stereotactic treatment are efficient combined or alone in relapse glioma. However, patterns of relapse after this kind of salvage treatment have never been studied. The purpose of this unicentric retrospective analysis was to assess and understand the patterns of relapse of high grade glioma treated with stereotactic radiation, with or without bevacizumab. Patients and methods Twenty patients with high grade glioma relapse received a stereotactic radiation; among them two patients received temozolomide and eight patients received bevacizumab; among the latter, four received also irinotecan. We matched the stereotactic radiation treatment planning scan with the images of the first treatment and of the second relapse in order to determine the patterns of failure and associate dosimetric profile. Results For the total population, median follow-up from the first diagnosis and relapse were 46.1 and 17.6 months, respectively. Among the 13 patients who relapsed, ten did not receive chemotherapy and three received it (P < 0.05), two received temozolomide and one bevacizumab. Patients who received bevacizumab had no ""out-of-field"" recurrences. Among the 32 irradiated relapses, 15 were ""in-field"" recurrences; among them two were treated with bevacizumab and 13 were not (P < 0.05). For the 32 lesions, a favourable prognostic factor of control was the association of a high-dose of irradiation and the use of bevacizumab. Conclusion For patients with relapsed high grade glioma, local control was higher with combined bevacizumab and high-dose stereotactic radiation.Copyright © 2016",Excluded

The response to treatment (i.e. repigmentation of depigmented areas) was rated retrospectively comparing photographs taken before and after therapy and correlation analysis revealed that it was statistically significantly linked to the number of KUVA treatments (r = 0.833, P = 0.001) and to total cumulative UVA dose (r = 0.840, P = 0.001). Of 17 patients who had continued therapy for longer than 3 months, 7 (41%) had a good response (i.e., more than 70% repigmentation of lesional skin) after a mean of 194 treatments (range, 69-386 treatments) and a mean cumulative UVA dose of 2,036 J/cm2 (range, 690-4,411 J/cm2), whereas lower response grades were observed in the patients with lower treatment numbers.

2962,"Ultrasound Guidance Reduces Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy Cost Compared to Fluoroscopy OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost factors associated with ultrasound and fluoroscopic guidance for percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and to determine which method can be performed at a lower cost per case., METHODS: A cost comparison study was performed utilizing clinical data from a prospectively maintained research database. We included the most recent 33 consecutive ultrasound-guided PCNL cases in 2016 and the most recent 40 consecutive fluoroscopy-guided PCNL cases before the operative surgeon transitioned to ultrasound guidance in May 2014. The total operative time and clinical outcomes were examined. Costs were extracted from the institution accounting systems and given a uniform multiplier to protect institutional financial reporting confidentiality. Comparisons were made using the Student t test and the chi-squared test., RESULTS: After excluding outliers, 71 PCNL procedures were included in the analysis. Demographic data and stone characteristics were not different between ultrasound-guided and fluoroscopy-guided groups. However, the mean operative time for ultrasound-guided PCNL was significantly shorter (99.8 +/- 27.0 vs 144.9 +/- 55.1 minutes, P < .05). When capital equipment costs were included, the mean total cost per case of ultrasound-guided PCNL was approximately 30% less than fluoroscopy-guided PCNL (simulated costs with a uniform multiplier; $5258.90 +/- 957.12 vs $7508.60 +/- 1163.83, P < .05). Postoperative clinical outcomes were comparable between the 2 groups., CONCLUSION: When capital costs are included, ultrasound-guided PCNL can produce comparable clinical outcomes to fluoroscopy-guided procedures at a lower cost to the institution. Shorter operative time drives significant savings with the adoption of ultrasound guidance, which may be magnified with increasing case volume. Using ultrasound imaging during PCNL may be more cost-effective compared to fluoroscopy and warrants further study. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
3430,"Microgeographic prediction of polygyny in the lark bunting Field experiments on breeding populations of lark buntings (Calamospiza melanocorys) in South Dakota support the hypothesis that polygyny is promoted by a high variance in quality among male territories. Among these birds protection of the nest site from solar radiation is the major indicator of quality: nestling survival was significantly correlated with nest-site cover, and experimental increase of shading resulted in higher reproductive success. Males with superior territories attracted two mates, whereas those with poor territories failed to attract any. Secondary females had fledging success at least equal to that of contemporaneous monogamous pairs. On the sole basis of a shading score for each territory, the mating status of males (polygynous, monogamous, or bachelor) was predicted accurately in new areas of Colorado and North Dakota before females arrived.",Excluded
2906,"Expandable metallic stent placement for malignant venous stenosis The expandable metallic stent (EMS) is used to dilate narrowed vascular or ductal lumina. We used EMS in patients with venous stenosis caused by maligant tumor. EMS were applied in 8 patients. The venogram demonstrated stenosis of vein, and the stenotic ratio were ranged 67-100%. After stent placement, all patients obtained symptomatic relief, and the stenotic ratio improved 20-60% in 7 patients. In one patient, EMS did not expand, but symptom relieved 4 days after stent placement, and following X-ray film showed expansion of EMS. One patient had recurrence of symptom 10 days after stent placement due to dislodgement of EMS. Additional EMS was placed, and symptom improved again. All 8 patients did not suffer recurrence of symptom from 3 weeks to 18 months. We conclude that EMS appears to be useful in patients with venous stenosis caused by malignant tumor.",Excluded

3187,"INTESTINE MICROBIOME ASPIRATION (IMBA) CAPSULE: A NEW AUTONOMOUS AND MINIMALLY-INVASIVE DEVICE FOR WHOLE GUT MICROBIOME SAMPLING AND MAPPING BACKGROUND. Intestinal microbiota is closely related to human health. However, our current understandings about intestine microbiota are limited due to its inaccessibility. Invasive and expensive catheter-based sampling methods are not suitable for large-scale studies. So, a reliable, inexpensive and convenient capsule device to collect intestinal microbiome is demanded. Here, we report the Intestine Microbiome Aspiration (IMBA) which aims to collect intestine fluid sample autonomously. Without using expensive MEMS technologies, IMBA utilizes controlled-release technology equipped with an novel sampling mechanism to achieve precise and regional sampling in intestine. METHODS. Three healthy volunteers and three IBS-D volunteers ingested the IMBA capsule with distilled water in their empty stomach in the morning. As shown in Fig. 1, Each capsule has an outer hard gelatin shell with an small intestine (SI)-targeted coating (Eudragit L100-55) that kept the main capsule body intact in the acidic stomach. Once the outer shell dissolved in SI, the capsule body was exposed to the luminal environment, and intestinal fluid flowed into a compartment via four wide channels on the capsule wall. The compartment contained 50mg hydrophilic fibers to wick and retain the fluidic luminal sample. A piston was fixed by a dissolvable spring-loaded latch to keep the channels open initially. The latch gradually dissolved in its thickness until its structure collapsed to release the spring, which pushed the piston to close the channels and seal the samples. The subjects underwent a low-dose X-ray scan every 30 minutes after oral intake of the capsule to monitor the sampling status until the spring was released. Capsules and swabbed fecal samples were collected by the volunteer after their bowel movements in the following 1-2 days, and sent for 16s rRNA analysis. RESULTS. All six capsules completed sampling in the small intestine within 3 hours after oral intake. Each capsule collected 74mg of small intestine luminal contents on average. The microbiota composition was different not only between intestines and feces, but also between healthy volunteers and IBS-D volunteers. Intestinal samples were characterized by increased abundance of Gammaproteobacteria, Pseudomonadales and Proteobacteria and reduction of Peptostreptococcaceae and Janthinobacterium (Fig. 2). CONCLUSION. The IMBA prototype has proven the concept of ""MEMS-free"" intestine-targeted microbiome sampling technology, a critical step towards personalized whole gut microbiota mapping. The technology offers a safe and reliable solution of capsule-based GI contents sampling while significantly reducing the costs per operation. New designs of large-scale human studies become possible to reveal temporal and spatial variation of gut microbiota for better understanding of its roles in various diseases.

2784,"Parotid gland-recovery after radiotherapy in the head and neck region - 36 months follow-up of a prospective clinical study Background: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the recovery potential of the parotid glands after using either 3D-conformal-radiotherapy (3D-CRT) or intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) by sparing one single parotid gland. Method(s): Between 06/2002 and 10/2008, 117 patients with head and neck cancer were included in this prospective, non-randomised clinical study. All patients were treated with curative intent. Salivary gland function was assessed by measuring stimulated salivary flow at the beginning, during and at the end of radiotherapy as well as 1, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after treatment. Measurements were converted to flow rates and normalized relative to rates before treatment. Mean doses (Dmean) were calculated from dose-volume histograms based on computed tomographies of the parotid glands. Result(s): Patients were grouped according to the Dmean of the spared parotid gland having the lowest radiation exposure: Group I - Dmean < 26 Gy (n = 36), group II - Dmean 26-40 Gy (n = 45), and group III - Dmean > 40 Gy (n = 36). 15/117 (13%) patients received IMRT. By using IMRT as compared to 3D-CRT the Dmean of the spared parotid gland could be significantly reduced (Dmean IMRT vs. 3D-CRT: 21.7 vs. 34.4 Gy, p < 0.001). The relative salivary flow rates (RFSR) as a function of the mean parotid dose after 24 and 36 months was in group I 66% and 74%, in group II 56% and 49%, and in group III 31% and 24%, respectively. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that the parotid gland dose and the tumor site were the independent determinants 12 and 36 months after the end of RT. Patients of group I and II parotid gland function did recover at 12, 24, and 36 months after the end of RT. Conclusion(s): If a Dmean < 26 Gy for at least one parotid gland can be achieved then this is sufficient to reach complete recovery of pre-RT salivary flow rates. The radiation volume which depends on tumor site did significantly impact on the Dmean of the parotids, and thus on the saliva flow and recovery of parotid gland.Copyright © 2011 Hey et al.",Excluded

3422,"Impact of various parameters in detecting chromosomal aberrations by FISH to describe radiosensitivity BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Analysis of radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations is regarded as the ""gold standard"" for classifying individual radiosensitivity. A variety of different parameters can be used. The crucial question, however, is to explore which parameter is suited best to describe the differences between patients with increased radiosensitivity and healthy individuals., PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, five patients with severe radiation-induced late effects of at least grade 3, classified according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG), and eleven healthy individuals were examined retrospectively. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were irradiated in vitro with 0.7 Gy and 2.0 Gy prior to cultivation and stained by means of three-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The detailed analysis was focused on the number of breaks per metaphase, on breaks from complex chromosomal rearrangements per metaphase, as well as on the percentage of translocations, dicentric chromosomes, breaks, and excess acentric fragments-each in comparison with the total number of mitoses analyzed., RESULTS: Using the number of breaks from complex chromosomal rearrangements after 2.0 Gy, radiosensitive patients as endpoint were clearly to be distinguished (p = 0.001) from healthy individuals. Translocations (p = 0.001) as well as breaks per metaphase (p = 0.002) were also suitable indicators for detecting differences between patients and healthy individuals. The parameters ""percentage of dicentric chromosomes"", ""breaks"", and ""excess acentric fragments"" in comparison to the total number of mitoses analyzed could neither serve as meaningful nor as significant criteria, since they showed a strong interindividual variability., CONCLUSION: To detect a difference in chromosomal aberrations between healthy and radiosensitive individuals, the parameters ""frequency of breaks per metaphase"", ""complex chromosomal rearrangements"", and ""translocations"" are most suitable.",Excluded

3704,"Use of intensity-modulated radiation therapy for nasopharyngeal cancer in Japan: analysis using a national database BACKGROUND: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) yields better outcomes and fewer toxicities for radiation therapy (RT) of head and neck cancers (HNCs), including nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC). IMRT is the standard RT treatment and has been widely adopted in Western countries to treat HNCs. However, its uptake in clinical practice among NPC patients has never been studied., METHODS: We investigated the use of IMRT for NPC using data from a nationwide cancer registry to describe the use of IMRT among NPC patients in Japan. We analyzed the data of patients with HNC, including NPC, who underwent IMRT between 2012 and 2014, as recorded in the hospital-based cancer registries linked with insurance claims. We calculated the proportion of patients with NPC who underwent IMRT at each hospital. To evaluate the use of IMRT for NPC, the IMRT use for NPC was compared with the proportion of patients with prostate cancer who underwent IMRT., RESULTS: Among 508 patients with NPC who underwent RT at one of 87 hospitals, 348 (69%) underwent IMRT. This proportion gradually increased between 2012 and 2014 (62%, 64% and 77%). Meanwhile, 4790 patients with prostate cancer (90%) underwent IMRT. Although some hospitals where IMRT was performed treated many patients with NPC, the proportion of patients with NPC who were treated with IMRT was low., CONCLUSIONS: IMRT has not been widely adopted in Japan for treating NPC.

We investigated whether DECT parameters can predict the vascularity of meningiomas., METHOD: We acquired DECT and perfusion CT (PCT) images in 24 patients with histologically diagnosed meningioma. Regions of interest (ROIs) were placed at the tumor in iodine, ED, and Zeff maps derived from DECT and in a blood volume (BV) map derived from PCT. To normalize these parameters' values, we divided them by the values of contralateral normal-appearing white matter, i.e., the relative (r)ED, rZeff, and rBV. The vascular density of the tumor specimens was immunohistochemically analyzed by calculating the von Willebrand factor-positive vessel wall. We calculated Pearson's correlation coefficients to determine the correlation with PCT/DECT parameters and an immunohistopathological index., RESULTS: Contrast rZeff (r = 0.7020, p = 0.0001) and iodine (r = 0.5814, p = 0.0029) both had positive correlations with rBV derived from PCT. The rED values were negatively correlated with the rBV values (r = -0.4735, p = 0.0194), and the vascular density results confirmed positive correlations with rBV (r = 0.6909, p = 0.0002) and contrast rZeff (r = 0.4982, p = 0.0132) and a negative correlation with rED (r = -0.4265, p = 0.0377).

3516,"Increased susceptibility to ionizing radiation in mice with ST6Gal-1 deficiency Sporadic reports have associated the degree of N-linked alpha2,6 sialylation, mediated by the sialyltransferase ST6Gal-1, with increased chemo-and radio-resistance of tumor cells, therapeutic failures in colorectal cancers, and protection against Fas-mediated apoptosis. Radiation exposure, whether iatrogenic or accidental, is a significant health concern. ST6Gal-1 has been suggested as a candidate biomarker for exposure to ionizing radiation; both enzyme expression and the level of protein sialylation increase following radiation exposure in a dose dependent manner. Here we report a striking sensitivity of animals with non-functional ST6Gal-1 to ionizing radiation. We attempted to rescue st6gal1-KO and wild-type C57BL/6J mice that were subjected to 12 Gy full body irradiation by bone marrow transplantation with congenic wild-type marrow cells. While the wild-type, st6gal1-normal animals uniformly survived the procedure, st6gal1-KO mice suffered 100% morbidity within 8 days of irradiation. There was comparable homing and retention of donor cells to the marrow of st6gal1-KO and wild-type recipients, and failure of hematopoietic cell engraftment was unlikely as a cause for morbidity. However, st6gal1-KO recipients suffered heavy damage to the gastrointestinal tract resulting in an almost complete loss of absorptive tissue and integrity of the gastrointestinal architecture. This damage was far less severe in the wild-type recipients. Damage to the gastrointestinal tract is an especially frequent and detrimental complication of radiation used in cancer therapy. Our data indicate a critical role for ST6Gal-1 in the maintenance of radioresistance in the gastrointestinal tract.",Included

2965,"Characterization of biological peculiarities of the radioprotective activity of double-stranded RNA isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae The purpose of the article: Protection from ionizing radiation is the most important component in the curing malignant neoplasms, servicing atomic reactors, and resolving the situations associated with uncontrolled radioactive pollutions. In this regard, discovering new effective radioprotectors as well as novel principles of protecting living organisms from high-dose radiation is the most important factor, determining the new approaches in medical and technical usage of radiation. Material(s) and Method(s): Experimental animals were irradiated on the gamma-emitter (Cs137) with a dose of 9.4 Gy. Radioprotective properties of several agents (total RNA, single-stranded RNA, double-stranded RNA and B-190) were estimated by the survival/death rates of experimental animals within 30-90 d. Pathomorphological examination of internal organs end electron microscope assay was done on days 9-12 after irradiation. Cloning and other molecular procedures were performed accordingly to commonly accepted protocols. For assessment of the internalization of labeled nucleic acid, bone marrow cells were incubated with double-stranded RNA labeled with 6-FAM fluorescent dye. Cells with internalized double-stranded RNA were assayed using Axio Imager M1 microscope. In the other experiment, bone marrow cells after incubation with double-stranded RNA were stained with Cy5-labeled anti-CD34 antibodies and assayed using Axioskop 2 microscope. Result(s): In this study, several biological features of the radioprotective action of double-stranded RNA are characterized. It was shown that 160 microg of the double-stranded RNA per mouse protect experimental animals from the absolutely lethal dose of gamma-radiation of 9.4 Gy. In different experiments, 80-100% of irradiated animals survive and live until their natural death. Radioprotective properties of double-stranded RNA were found to be independent on its sequence, but strictly dependent on its double-stranded form. Moreover, double-stranded RNA must have 'open' ends of the molecule to exert its radioprotective activity. Conclusion(s): Experiments indicate that radioprotective effect of double-stranded RNA is tightly bound to its internalization into hematopoietic stem cells, which further repopulate the spleen parenchyma of irradiated mice. Actively proliferating progenitors form the splenic colonies, which further serve as the basis for restoration of hematopoiesis and immune function and determine the survival of animals received the lethal dose of radiation.© Copyright © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group LLC.",Excluded

This prolonged survival was observed for each of several minor histocompatibility (H) antigens and is antigen-specific. Gamma radiation (3300 rads) abolished the ability of male spleen cells infused i.v. to delay the rejection of male skin grafts (H-Y antigen) on female recipients. However, depletion of Thy-1+ cells from the i.v. infusion failed to abolish the ability to prolong male skin graft survival. Furthermore, the prolonged survival accorded to B6 (H-2b) male skin grafts on CB6F1 (H-2b/H-2d) female recipients given i.v. infusions of B6 male spleen cells extended to BALB/c (H-2d) male skin grafts as well, indicating a lack of MHC restriction. Thus, prolongation of minor allograft survival by i.v. infusion of minor H antigen-bearing spleen cells appears not to depend on veto T cells that others have found to be responsible for the suppression of CTL generation (2, 3, 5).",Excluded

To compare radiation dose and image quality using predefined narrow phase window versus complete phase window with dose modulation during R-R using 320-row MDCTA. Methods. 114 patients underwent coronary CTA study using 320-row MDCT scanner. 87 patients with mean age (61 + 13 years), mean BMI (29 + 6), and mean heart rate (HR) (58 + 7 bpm) were imaged at predefined 66-80% R-R interval and then reconstructed at 75% while 27 patients with mean age (63 + 16 years), mean BMI (28 + 5), and mean HR (57 + 7 bpm) were scanned throughout the complete R-R interval with tube current modulation. The effective dose (ED) was calculated from dose length product (DLP) and conversion k (0.014 mSv/mGy/cm). Image quality was assessed using a three-point ordinal scale (1 = excellent, 2 = good, and 3 = nondiagnostic). Results. Both groups were statistically similar to each other with reference of HR (P=0.59), BMI (P=0.17), and tube current mAs (P=0.68). The median radiation dose was significantly higher in those scanned with complete R-R phase window versus narrow phase window (P<0.0001). Independently of patient and scan parameters, increased phase window was associated with higher radiation dose (P<0.001). Image quality was better among those scanned with narrow phase window versus complete phase window (P<0.0001). Conclusion. Our study supports that good HR control and predefined narrow window acquisition result in lower radiation dose without compromising diagnostic image quality for coronary disease evaluation. © 2013 Faisal Khosa et al.",Excluded

Furocoumarin derivatives constitute a class of compounds widely investigated for the development of photo-chemotherapeutic drugs and effective in treating many diseases. The interest inside this research field originated from the effectiveness of PUVA therapy, realized by oral or topical administration of a linear furocoumarin (psoralen) followed by irradiation with UVA light, for the treatment of psoriasis and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Furocoumarins are also present in Psoralea plants elected to be also used as alternative feed for animals considering that it's a perennial leguminous and, more important, it's green during the summer time. In the present study we report the preliminary results obtained using the SCE-test in river buffalo cells exposed in vitro to furocoumarin extracts from a Sardinian population of Posoralea morisana (L.) Stirton (Punta Giglio,). Peripheral blood samples from five young river buffaloes (2 males and 3 females) were incubated at 38 degreeC for 72 h in presence of different quantities of furocoumarin extracts: 0 (control), 50, 100, 200 and 400 mug/ml. Thirty cells for each cell culture (and furocoumarin dose) were analyzed. Although the cell growth appeared normal in both treated and untreated (control) cells, a significant (P<0.01) higher number of SCEs observed in treated cells, compared to those achieved in the control. On the basis of these results, cells from five river buffalo cows were treated with 0 (control), 100 and 200 mug/ml of furocoumarins for only 3 h after 24 h of incubation, in presence and absence of S9. No statistical differences were found between treated and untreated cells with furocoumarins both in presence and absence of S9.",Excluded
3088,"Partial-brain radiotherapy for primary central nervous system lymphoma: multi-institutional experience Whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) has been an important component of treatment for primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), but delayed neurotoxicity has been a matter of concern. We have employed partial-brain radiotherapy (PBRT) with wide margins for PCNSL patients with a single lesion or a few lesions. In this study, we evaluated the treatment outcome in PCNSL patients undergoing PBRT. Between 2003 and 2014, 24 patients were treated with PBRT; 16 received high-dose-methotrexate (MTX) -containing chemotherapy before PBRT. Conventional fractionation with a median dose of 54 Gy was used. For reference, 15 patients undergoing MTX-based chemotherapy and WBRT were also analyzed. The 3-year overall survival rate was 60% for all 24 patients undergoing PBRT and 68% for the 16 patients undergoing MTX-based chemotherapy plus PBRT. The 3-year progression-free survival rate was 41% for all 24 patients undergoing PBRT and 36% for the 16 patients undergoing MTX-based chemotherapy. The in-field recurrence rate was 26% and the out-of-field recurrence rate was 15% at 3 years for all 24 patients undergoing PBRT. The rates for in-field recurrence and the out-of-field recurrence were 27% and 21%, respectively, for the 16 patients undergoing MTX-based chemotherapy. CNS-recurrence rates were similar in patients undergoing MTX-based chemotherapy and PBRT to the rates in those undergoing MTX-based chemotherapy and WBRT. Neurocognitive dysfunction developed in 3 of the 16 patients undergoing MTX + PBRT and in 4 of 15 patients undergoing MTX + WBRT (P = 0.68). PBRT seems to be a feasible treatment option for solitary PCNSL. Further investigations are warranted to evaluate the advantages of PBRT over WBRT. Copyright © The Author 2015.

Result(s): A retrospective study on 14 patients with recurrent head and neck cancers undergone 125I seed implantation with different seed activities. The post-plan showed that the actuarial D90 of 125I seeds ranged from 90 to 218 Gy (median, 157.5 Gy). The follow-up was 3 to 60 months (median, 13 months). The median local control was 18 months (95% CI, 6.1-29.9 months), and the 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5- year local controls were 52%, 39%, 39%, and 39%, respectively. The 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5- survival rates were 65%, 39%, 39% and 39%, respectively, with a median survival time of 20 months (95% CI, 8.7-31.3 months). Of all patients, 28.6% (4/14) died of local recurrence, 7.1% (1/14) died of metastases, one patient died of hepatocirrhosis, and 8 patients are still alive to the date of data analysis.

2764,Role of the direct action of radiation in the mechanism of development of mammary gland tumors The role of the direct action of radiation in the genesis of mammary gland tumors in animals of both sexes was studied in experiments on noninbred albino rats. In two series of experiments the anterior or posterior half of the rat's body was irradiated with X rays in doses of 200 to 1000 rad. Tumors of the mammary glands appeared considerably earlier and were more numerous in the irradiated parts of the body of both females and males than in the unirradiated glands or in control animals. Females developed mammary gland tumors after exposure to smaller doses and in a higher proportion of cases than males.,Included

3657,"Prospective ECG-gated coronary 320-MDCT angiography with absolute acquisition delay strategy for patients with persistent atrial fibrillation OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to evaluate image quality and radiation dose when patients with atrial fibrillation undergo coronary CT angiography (CTA) using prospectively ECG-gated 320-MDCT technology with an absolute-delay strategy. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A cohort of 75 consecutive patients (60 men and 15 women; age (+/- SD), 71 +/- 10 years) who underwent prospectively ECG-gated coronary CTA using a 320-MDCT scanner during atrial fibrillation was matched with 75 control patients imaged in sinus rhythm. All coronary CTA for the atrial fibrillation cohort used absolute-delay strategy. Subjective image quality score and the dose-length product (DLP) were compared between the two cohorts and, for the atrial fibrillation cohort, among those patients imaged over a different number of heartbeats. The accuracy of stenosis detection was evaluated in 17 studies of the atrial fibrillation cohort using catheter angiography as a reference standard. RESULTS. For those patients imaged in atrial fibrillation, one- And two-beat acquisitions were performed in 26.7% (n = 20) and 40% (n = 30) of patients, respectively. There was no significant difference in image quality between the atrial fibrillation (2.9 +/- 0.4) and sinus rhythm (2.9 +/- 0.3) cohorts, nor was there a difference in image quality with respect to the number of heartbeats used in the acquisition. The atrial fibrillation cohort had an 80% higher DLP (680 +/- 470 vs 372 +/- 236 mGy x cm, p < 0.0001). The patient-based sensitivity and negative predictive value for stenosis detection were both 100%. CONCLUSION. Using an absolute-delay strategy, two thirds of patients who underwent prospectively ECG-gated coronary CTA using a 320-MDCT scanner were imaged within two heartbeats or fewer. Compared with patients imaged in sinus rhythm, the image quality was comparative and the radiation dose was 1.8-fold higher.",Excluded

We studied retrospectively the records of 232 patients with osteoarticular brucellosis who were admitted to the three teaching hospitals of Babol Medical Sciences University from April 2001 to September 2006. The distribution of osteoarticular involvement and their management were evaluated to determine if any cases had been misdiagnosed because of false negative serologic tests and who had, as a result, undergone inappropriate surgical interventions. Of 232 patients, 138 (59%) were male and 94 (41%) were female. Polyarthritis, monoarthritis, spondylitis and sacroilitis were seen in 91 (39%), 60 (26%), 43 (18.5%) and 38 (16.5%) patients, respectively. Two hundred and twenty-nine (98.7%) patients were diagnosed correctly and treated successfully; three (1.3%) were misdiagnosed and had been given inappropriate surgical interventions.

Objective(s): Parameters determining the individual protective effect of a pharmacological intervention were investigated. Design and Participants: Biokinetics of 123I was evaluated in 27 healthy volunteers (aged 22-46 yr, median 25 yr, in total 48 assessments) twice in a baseline measurement of the undisturbed kinetics and in an intervention assessment 48 h later. Intervention(s): Seven regimens using single doses of potassium iodide (KI) or sodium perchlorate (SP) at different times relative to exposure were compared: 100 mg KI (-24, 2, 8, 24 h), 100 mg SP (2 h), or 1 g SP (2, 8 h). Main Outcome Measure(s): Different drugs and dosages and the influence of individual parameters of iodine kinetics should be tested.

Method(s): From March 2009 to July 2011, 10 patients with 12 unresectable primary (n = 6) or recurrent (n = 6) cholangiocarcinoma lesions underwent abdominal SBRT. Sites treated included liver (n = 10), abdominal lymph nodes (n = 1), and adrenal gland (n = 1). SBRT was delivered in three (n = 2) or five (n = 10) consecutive daily fractions over one week. The median prescription dose was 55 Gy (range, 45-60). Treatment response was graded by RECIST v.1.1, and toxicities were scored by CTCAE v.4.0. Data was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method to determine rates of local control (LC), freedom from distant progression (FFDM) and overall survival (OS). Result(s): The median follow-up was 14 months (range, 2-26 months). LC, defined as freedom from progression within the SBRT field, was 100%, but four patients treated to intrahepatic sites experienced progression elsewhere in the liver. Estimates for FFDM at 6 and 12 months were 73% and 31%, respectively. Sites of disease relapse included liver (n = 3), liver and lymph nodes (n = 1), liver and lungs (n = 1), lymph nodes (n = 1), and mesentery (n = 1). OS estimates for the cohort at 6 and 12 months were 83% and 73%, respectively. The most common Grade >=2 early toxicities were Grade 2 nausea and vomiting (n = 5) and gastrointestinal pain (n = 2). Late >=2 toxicities included Grade 2 gastrointestinal pain (n = 3), Grade 3 biliary stenosis (n = 1), and Grade 5 liver failure (n = 1). Conclusion(s): SBRT shows promise as an effective local therapy for properly-selected patients with cholangiocarcinoma.

2518,"MRI-guided stereotactic biopsy in the diagnosis of glioma: comparison of biopsy and surgical resection specimen BACKGROUND: Although there has been a dramatic increase in the accessibility and utilization of high-resolution MRI techniques for the evaluation of brain tumors, there is currently only a single report comparing stereotactic brain biopsy specimen to subsequent resection specimen exclusively in the management of gliomas., METHODS: The diagnoses in 43 cases of astrocytic brain tumors were derived using MRI-guided stereotactic biopsy followed by open resection of the lesion. The histologic diagnoses yielded by biopsy were compared with subsequent histologic diagnosis after open tumor resection. All biopsies and histologic diagnoses were made by the same surgeon and pathologist, respectively., RESULTS: In 23 patients undergoing resection <60 days after biopsy, the biopsy diagnosis was consistent with resection diagnosis in 18 cases (79%) and led to the correct treatment in 22 cases (96%). Recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) was undergraded as anaplastic astrocytoma in 4 patients. GBM was misdiagnosed as radiation necrosis in 1 patient. MR-nonenhancing lesions [10/10 (100%)] yielded histology that correlated with subsequent craniotomy, while only 8/13 (61%) MR-enhancing lesions yielded histology that was consistent with that at craniotomy (p < 0.05). In 20 patients undergoing resection because of radiologic tumor progression (mean 7 months after biopsy), 6/6 (100%) biopsy diagnoses of a specific glioma grade correlated with resection diagnosis, while only 6/14 (43%) biopsy diagnoses of radiation effect correlated with resection diagnosis (p < 0.01)., CONCLUSION: MRI-guided stereotactic brain biopsy specimen accurately represents the grade of the larger glioma mass sufficiently to guide subsequent therapy. Enhancement on MR may be a negative prognostic indicator of biopsy accuracy.",Excluded

2749,"Facilitation of somatic calcium channels can evoke prolonged tail currents in rat hypoglossal motoneurons Voltage-dependent persistent inward currents (PICs) make an important contribution to the input-output properties of alpha motoneurons. PICs are thought to be mediated by membrane channels located primarily on the dendrites as evidenced by prolonged tail currents following the termination of a voltage step and by a clockwise hysteresis in the whole cell inward currents recorded in response to depolarizing then repolarizing voltage ramp commands. We report here, however, that voltage-clamp currents with these same features can be generated in isolated somatic membrane patches from rat hypoglossal motoneurons. Long-lasting (200-800 ms) tail currents after 1-s voltage-clamp pulses were observed in nucleated patches from 16 of 23 cells. Further, these somatic PICs display ""facilitation"" in response to conditioning depolarization as previously observed in whole cell recordings from intact neurons. Pharmacological tests suggest that the PICs were primarily mediated by Cav1 channels. Our results show that many of the features of persistent calcium currents recorded from intact motoneurons do not necessarily reflect a remote dendritic origin but can also be ascribed to the intrinsic properties of their Cav1 channels.",Excluded

Method(s): A retrospective chart review was performed. Result(s): Between March 2006 and December 2013, 122 consecutive patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma were treated by surgery followed by postoperative intensity-modulated radiotherapy. In regard to the site of the primary tumor, 59 (48%) patients had cancer of the oral cavity, 31 (26%) patients had cancer of the hypopharynx, 14 (11%) patients had cancer of the oropharynx, 10 (8%) patients had cancer of the larynx and 8 (7%) patients had cancer of unknown primary. The median follow-up period of the surviving patients was 54 months (range, 25-115). Concurrent chemotherapy was administered in 76 patients (62%). The median prescribed radiation dose was 66 Gy. The 3-year overall survival, progression-free survival, distant metastasis free survival and loco-regional control rates were 59%, 48%, 52.4% and 71%, respectively. Of the 122 patients, 32 developed loco-regional recurrence as the initial recurrence, including in-field recurrence in 26 patients, marginal recurrence in five patients and out-field recurrence in seven patients. Of the five patients with marginal recurrence, four have had two or more surgeries before the intensity-modulated radiotherapy and three had oral cavity cancer. Severe adverse events were not frequent, occurring at a frequency of <5%, except for mucositis. No severe toxicities associated with the flap reconstruction were observed either.

3381,"Identification of circulating tumor cells using 4-color fluorescence in situ hybridization: Validation of a noninvasive aid for ruling out lung cancer in patients with low-dose computed tomography-detected lung nodules Background: Approximately one third of needle biopsies that are performed to rule out malignancy of indeterminate pulmonary nodules detected radiologically during lung cancer screening are negative, thus exposing cancer-free patients to risks of pneumothorax, bleeding, and infection. A noninvasive confirmatory tool (eg, liquid biopsy) is urgently needed in the lung cancer diagnosis setting to stratify patients who should receive biopsy versus those who should be monitored. Method(s): A novel antigen-independent, 4-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)-based method was developed to detect circulating tumor cells (CTCs) with abnormalities in gene copy numbers in mononuclear cell-enriched peripheral blood samples from patients with (n = 107) and without (n = 100) lung cancer. Result(s): Identification of CTCs using FISH probes at 10q22.3/CEP10 and 3p22.1/3q29 detected lung cancer cases with 94.2% accuracy, 89% sensitivity, and 100% specificity compared with biopsy.

METHOD(S): Ninety-three potential liver donors who underwent preoperative contrast-enhanced 64 multidetector CTA and CTC were retrospectively divided into 2 groups: at 80 and at 120 kVp. An institutional review board waiver was obtained. Signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio of the hepatic artery and common bile duct were obtained. The dose-length product was recorded. Image quality and visibility of hepatic artery and biliary tract anatomy were evaluated. Mann-Whitney U test was used for statistical evaluation. RESULT(S): Mean hepatic artery/common bile duct signal-to-noise ratio was 28.9/28.6 (SD, 14.2/10.0) at 80 kVp and 27.6/25.8 (SD, 8.0/6.2) at 120 kVp (P = 0.61/0.099).

Material(s) and Method(s): Multicenter prospective observational study. Patient eligibility: pathologically proven stage I-III non-small cell lung cancer planned for definitive radiotherapy (minimum 50 Gy in 20 fractions) using CT-based contouring. Volumes of the primary tumor and enlarged nodes were measured according to a standardized protocol. Survival was adjusted for the effect of T and N stage. Result(s): There were 509 eligible patients. Five-year survival rates for tumor volume grouped by quartiles were, for increasing tumor volume, 22%, 14%, 15% and 21%. Larger primary tumor volume was associated with shorter survival (HR = 1.060 (per doubling); 95% CI 1.01-1.12; P = 0.029). However, after adjusting for the effects of T and N stage, there was no evidence for an association (HR = 1.029, 95% CI, 0.96-1.10, P = 0.39). There was evidence, however, that larger primary tumor volume was associated with an increased risk of dying, independently of T and N stage, in the first 18 months but not beyond. Conclusion(s): In patients treated by non-surgical means we were unable to show that lung tumor volume, overall, provides additional prognostic information beyond the T and N stage (TNM, 6th edition). There is evidence, however, that larger primary tumor volume adversely affects outcome only within the first 18 months.

3496,"Kruppel-like Factor 5 Regulates Stemness, Lineage Specification, and Regeneration of Intestinal Epithelial Stem Cells Background & Aims: Self-renewal and multipotent differentiation are cardinal properties of intestinal stem cells (ISCs), mediated in part by WNT and NOTCH signaling. Although these pathways are well characterized, the molecular mechanisms that control the 'stemness' of ISCs are still not well defined. Here, we investigated the role of Kruppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) in regulating ISC functions. Method(s): We performed studies in adult Lgr5EGFP-IRES-creERT2;Rosa26LSLtdTomato (Lgr5Ctrl) and Lgr5EGFP-IRES-creERT2;Klf5fl/fl;Rosa26LSLtdTomato (Lgr5DELTAKlf5) mice. Mice were injected with tamoxifen to activate Cre recombinase, which deletes Klf5 from the intestinal epithelium in Lgr5DELTAKlf5 but not Lgr5Crtl mice. In experiments involving irradiation, mice were subjected to 12 Gy total body irradiation (TBI). Tissues were collected for immunofluorescence (IF) analysis and next generation sequencing. Oganoids were derived from fluoresecence activated cell sorted- (FACS-) single cells from tamoxifen-treated Lgr5DELTAKlf5 or Lgr5Crtl mice and examined by immunofluorescence stain. Result(s): Lgr5+ ISCs lacking KLF5 proliferate faster than control ISCs but fail to self-renew, resulting in a depleted ISC compartment. Transcriptome analysis revealed that Klf5-null Lgr5+ cells lose ISC identity and prematurely differentiate. Following irradiation injury, which depletes Lgr5+ ISCs, reserve Klf5-null progenitor cells fail to dedifferentiate and regenerate the epithelium. Absence of KLF5 inactivates numerous selected enhancer elements and direct transcriptional targets including canonical WNT- and NOTCH-responsive genes. Analysis of human intestinal tissues showed increased levels of KLF5 in the regenerating epithelium as compared to those of healthy controls. Conclusion(s): We conclude that ISC self-renewal, lineage specification, and precursor dedifferentiation require KLF5, by its ability to regulate epigenetic and transcriptional activities of ISC-specific gene sets. These findings have the potential for modulating ISC functions by targeting KLF5 in the intestinal epithelium.Copyright © 2020 The Authors",Excluded
2621,"Multiple sclerosis, brain radiotherapy, and risk of neurotoxicity: The Mayo Clinic experience Purpose: The aim of this study was a retrospective assessment of neurotoxicity in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) receiving external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) to the brain. Methods and Materials: We studied 15 consecutively treated patients with MS who received brain EBRT. Neurologic toxicity was assessed with the Common Toxicity Criteria v.3.0. Result(s): Median follow-up for the 5 living patients was 6.0 years (range, 3.3-27.4 years). No exacerbation of MS occurred in any patient during EBRT. Five patients had Grade 4 neurologic toxicity and 1 had possible Grade 5 toxicity. Kaplan-Meier estimated risk of neurotoxicity greater than Grade 4 at 5 years was 57% (95% confidence interval, 27%-82%). Toxicity occurred at 37.5 to 54.0 Gy at a median of 1.0 year (range, 0.2-4.3 years) after EBRT. Univariate analysis showed an association between opposed-field irradiation of the temporal lobes, central white matter, and brainstem and increased risk of neurotoxicity (p < 0.04). Three of 6 cases of toxicity occurred in patients treated before 1986. Conclusion(s): External beam radiotherapy of the brain in patients with MS may be associated with an increased risk of neurotoxicity compared with patients without demyelinating illnesses. However, this risk is associated with treatment techniques that may not be comparable to modern, conformal radiotherapy. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
3257,"Argon plasma coagulation for the treatment of hemorrhagic radiation proctitis BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Chronic radiation proctitis is a complication of radiotherapy for malignant pelvic diseases. Rectal bleeding caused by radiation proctitis is difficult to manage. Argon plasma coagulation (APC) is an electrocoagulation technique that appears to be an effective and low-cost alternative to the use of lasers in gastrointestinal endoscopy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of APC, as well as patients' tolerance of the procedure, in the treatment of bleeding radiation-induced proctitis., PATIENTS AND METHODS: The charts of 16 patients with chronic radiation proctitis were analyzed retrospectively. Their average age was 73.5 (range 62-80). Fifteen patients had prostate cancer, and one had uterine cancer. The average time to onset of symptoms after radiotherapy was 15 months (range 6-36 months). All patients had intermittent or daily rectal bleeding, and three patients needed blood transfusions. The severity of bleeding was graded from 0 to 4. APC treatment was administered every month; the argon gas flow was set at 0.6 l/min with an electrical power setting of 40 W., RESULTS: All patients were improved with APC treatment. A mean of 3.7 sessions was necessary to relieve symptoms. APC therapy resulted in a reduction in the mean severity score from 2.4 to 0.6. Seven patients had no recurrent rectal bleeding, and the bleeding was significantly reduced to occasional and negligible spotting (less than one bleeding episode per week) in nine patients. None of the patients required transfusions after treatment. During the follow-up period (average 10.7 months, range 8-28 months), one patient had a recurrence of rectal bleeding that required two repeat sessions. The tolerance was good, with no long-term treatment-related complications., CONCLUSIONS: APC is an effective, safe and well-tolerated treatment for rectal bleeding caused by chronic radiation proctitis. It should be considered as a first-line therapy for radiation proctitis.",Excluded

Radiotherapy, combined with effective concomitant chemotherapy, may improve clinical treatment outcomes. We conducted a phase II randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of intensity-modulated radiotherapy with concomitant weekly cisplatin on locally recurrent NPC., METHODS: Between April 2002 and January 2008, 69 patients diagnosed with non-metastatic locally recurrent NPC were randomly assigned to either concomitant chemoradiotherapy group (n = 34) or radiotherapy alone group (n = 35). All patients received intensity-modulated radiotherapy. The radiotherapy dose for both groups was 60 Gy in 27 fractions for 37 days (range 23-53 days). The concomitant chemotherapy schedule was cisplatin 30 mg/m(2) by intravenous infusion weekly during radiotherapy., RESULTS: The median follow-up period of all patients was 35 months (range 2-112 months). Between concomitant chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy groups, there was only significant difference in the 3-year and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates (68.7% vs. 42.2%, P = 0.016 and 41.8% vs. 27.5%, P = 0.049, respectively). Subgroup analysis showed that concomitant chemoradiotherapy significantly improved the 5-year OS rate especially for patients in stage rT3-4 (33.0% vs. 13.2%, P = 0.009), stages III-IV (34.3% vs. 13.2%, P = 0.006), recurrence interval >30 months (49.0% vs. 20.6%, P = 0.017), and tumor volume >26 cm(3) (37.6% vs. 0%, P = 0.006)., CONCLUSION: Compared with radiotherapy alone, concomitant chemoradiotherapy can improve OS of the patients with locally recurrent NPC, especially those with advanced T category (rT3-4) and stage (III-IV) diseases, recurrence intervals >30 months, and tumor volume >26 cm(3).",Excluded
3039,"Long term outcome after combined modality treatment for anal cancer Background. The aim of the retrospective study was to evaluate the effectiveness and toxicity of radiochemotherapy in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal treated at a single institution.Patients and methods. Between 1/2003 and 9/2010, 84 patients were treated with radical radiochemotherapy at the Institute of Oncology Ljubljana, Slovenia. The treatment consisted of 3-dimensional conformal external beam radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil and mytomycin C), followed by brachytherapy or external beam boost. The toxicity of therapy and its effectiveness were assessed.Results. The treatment was completed according to the protocol in 79.8% of patients. The median follow-up time of 55 survivors was 53 months (range: 16-105 months). The 5-year locoregional control (LRC), disease-free survival (DFS), disease-specific survival (DSS), overall survival (OS) and colostomy-free survival (CFS) rates were 71%, 68%, 81%, 67% and 85%, respectively. No treatment-related mortality was observed. The most frequent acute side-effect of the treatment was radiodermatitis (grade 3-4 in 58.2% of patients). LENT-SOMA grade 3-4 late radiation side effects were observed in 15 (18%) patients. In patients with brachytherapy boost a trend of less late side effects was observed compared to patients with external beam boost (P=0.066). On multivariate analysis, complete clinical disease response was identified as an independent prognostic factor for LRC, DFS and DSS, the salvage surgery for LRC and DFS, whereas Hb below 120 g/l retained its independent prognostic value for OS.Conclusions. Radiochemotherapy provides an excellent disease control and the survival with preserving anal sphincter function in majority of patients. Surgical salvage with abdominoperineal resection for persistent or recurrent disease has curative potential.",Excluded
3537,"Vertebral bone attenuation on low-dose chest CT: quantitative volumetric analysis for bone fragility assessment This study evaluated the use of low-dose chest computed tomography (LDCT) for detecting bone fragility. LDCT-measured vertebral bone attenuation by volumetric methods showed good correlation with bone mineral density (BMD) measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA, and good diagnostic performance for identifying osteoporosis and compression fractures. The results of this study suggest the feasibility of obtaining comprehensive information on bone health in subjects undergoing LDCT., INTRODUCTION: Osteoporosis is a prevalent but underdiagnosed disease that increases fracture risk. This study evaluated the utility of vertebral attenuation derived from low-dose chest computed tomography (LDCT) compared to dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) for detecting bone fragility., METHODS: A total of 232 subjects (78 men and 154 women) aged above 50 years who underwent both LDCT and DXA within 30 days were evaluated. LDCT-measured bone attenuation in Hounsfield units (HU) of four vertebrae (T4, T7, T10, and L1) was evaluated using volumetric methods for correlation with DXA-measured bone mineral density (BMD) and for the diagnosis of compression fractures, osteoporosis, and low BMD (osteoporosis or osteopenia) in men and women, with DXA measurements as the reference standard., RESULTS: The average attenuation of the four vertebrae showed strong correlation with DXA-measured BMD of the lumbar spine (r = 0.726, p < 0.05). In receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, the area under the curve (AUC) across LDCT-measured thresholds of the average attenuation to distinguish compression fractures was 0.827, and a threshold of 129.5 HU yielded 90.9 % sensitivity and 64.4 % specificity. Similarly, average attenuation showed high AUCs and good diagnostic performance for detecting osteoporosis and low BMD in both men and women. Among 44 subjects with compression fractures, the average bone attenuation showed strong negative correlation with both the worst fracture grade (r = -0.525, p < 0.05) and cumulative fracture grade score (r = -0.633, p < 0.05)., CONCLUSION: LDCT-measured bone attenuation by volumetric methods showed good correlation with BMD measured by DXA and good diagnostic performance for identifying bone fragility.",Excluded
2726,"Carotid Artery Stenting With Proximal Embolic Protection via a Transradial or Transbrachial Approach: Pushing the Boundaries of the Technique While Maintaining Safety and Efficacy PURPOSE: To compare the feasibility and safety of proximal cerebral protection to a distal filter during carotid artery stenting (CAS) via a transbrachial (TB) or transradial (TR) approach., METHODS: Among 856 patients who underwent CAS between January 2007 and July 2015, 214 (25%) patients (mean age 72+/-8 years; 154 men) had the procedure via a TR (n=154) or TB (n=60) approach with either Mo.MA proximal protection (n=61) or distal filter protection (n=153). The Mo.MA group (mean age 73+/-7 years; 54 men) had significantly more men and more severe stenosis than the filter group (mean age 71+/-8 years; 100 men). Stent type and CAS technique were left to operator discretion. Heparin and a dedicated closure device or bivalirudin and manual compression were used in TR and TB accesses, respectively. Technical and procedure success, crossover to femoral artery, 30-day major adverse cardiovascular/cerebrovascular events (MACCE; death, all strokes, and myocardial infarction), vascular complications, and radiation exposure were compared between groups., RESULTS: Crossover to a femoral approach was required in 1/61 (1.6%) Mo.MA patient vs 11/153 (7.1%) filter patients mainly due to technical difficulty in engaging the target vessel. Five Mo.MA patients developed acute intolerance to proximal occlusion; 4 were successfully shifted to filter protection. A TR patient was shifted to filter because the Mo.MA system was too short. CAS was technically successful in the remaining 55 (90%) Mo.MA patients and 142 (93%) filter patients. The MACCE rate was 0% in the Mo.MA patients and 2.8% in the filter group (p=0.18). Radiation exposure was similar between groups. Major vascular complications occurred in 1/61 (1.6%) and in 3/153 (1.96%) patients in the Mo.MA and filter groups (p=0.18), respectively, and were confined to the TB approach in the early part of the learning curve. Chronic radial artery occlusion was detected by Doppler ultrasound in 2/30 (6.6%) Mo.MA patients and in 4/124 (3.2%) filter patients by clinical assessment (p=0.25) at 8.1+/-7.5-month follow-up., CONCLUSION: CAS with proximal protection via a TR or TB approach is a feasible, safe, and effective technique with a low rate of vascular complications.

3178,"Is the modified Mann Assessment of Swallowing Ability useful for assessing dysphagia in patients with mild to moderate dementia? Dysphagia is an important causative factor of aspiration pneumonia among the elderly, particularly in patients with dementia. The modified Mann Assessment of Swallowing Ability (mMASA) is commonly used as a physician-administered screening protocol for assessing dysphagia due to its merits as a clinical test that does not involve special equipment or radiation exposure. The present study investigated whether the mMASA would reflect the dysphagia state as estimated by videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) findings and cognitive function in patients with dementia. This study included 25 subjects with mild to moderate dementia. In all subjects, swallowing function was evaluated with the mMASA and VFSS and cognitive function was evaluated using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Global Deterioration Scale (GDS), and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scales. The Spearman correlation and linear regression tests were conducted with the mMASA values and other tests for swallowing and cognition. The mMASA values were correlated with the Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS) of the VFSS as well as scores on the MMSE, MoCA, GDS, and CDR. In addition, the Judgment and Problem Solving and Community Affairs subscales of the CDR were correlated with mMASA values. The assessments of dysphagia using the mMASA were consistent with the VFSS findings and were reflected by cognitive function. Taken together, the present findings suggest that the mMASA would be useful for the routine evaluation of swallowing function in patients with mild to moderate dementia for the detection of dysphagia.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
3415,"Gamma knife surgery for refractory postherpetic trigeminal neuralgia: Targeting in one session both the retrogasserian trigeminal nerve and the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus Object. The authors tested the hypothesis that two targets are needed to treat postherpetic trigeminal neuralgia (TN): one in the trigeminal nerve for the direct sharp pain and one in the thalamus for the diffuse burning pain. Methods. Three patients with refractory postherpetic TN were treated with gamma knife surgery (GKS) through a novel two-target approach. In a single treatment session, both the trigeminal nerve and centromedian nucleus were targeted. First, the trigeminal nerve, ipsilateral to the facial pain, was treated with 60 to 80 Gy. Second, the centromedian nucleus was localized using standard coordinates and by comparing magnetic resonance images with a stereotactic atlas. A single dose of 120 to 140 Gy was delivered to the target point with a single 4-mm isocenter. Patients were followed clinically and with neuroimaging studies. Pain relief was scored as excellent (75-100%), good (50-75%), poor (25-50%), or none (0-25%). Follow up ranged from 6 to 53 months. There were no GKS-related complications. Two patients died of unrelated medical illnesses but had good or excellent pain relief until death. One patient continues to survive with 44 months follow up and no decrease in pain intensity, but with a decreased area of pain. Conclusions. Combined GKS of the centromedian nucleus and trigeminal nerve in a single treatment session is feasible and safe, and the effect was promising. A larger study is required to confirm and expand these results.",Excluded
3230,"Diagnostic Accuracy of Fluoroscopy, Radiography, and Computed Tomography in Detecting Cement Leakage in Kyphoplasty Purpose Cement leakage is a typical complication of kyphoplasty for vertebral fractures. It is unclear if cement application intraoperatively can be improved by using other techniques of visualization and which kind of postoperative imaging should be recommended to detect cement extravasation accurately. Objective To compare the rates of cement leakage detected by intraoperative fluoroscopy, postoperative radiography, and postoperative computed tomography (CT) in a retrospective study. Patients and Methods The study included 78 patients (60 women and 18 men; 115 vertebral bodies) who were treated with two kinds of kyphoplasty. The patients underwent intraoperative fluoroscopy and postoperative radiography and CT. After surgery, the images were evaluated to compare cement leakage rates and locations in the three visualization techniques. Leakage locations were described as epidural, intradiskal, extravertebral, or intravascular. Results Compared with CT, intraoperative fluoroscopy regularly detected intradiskal leakage (75%) but had a considerably lower sensitivity for visualizing epidural (21%), extravertebral (31%), and intravascular (51%) cement leakages. A comparison of radiography and CT showed that radiography had a high sensitivity for detecting intradiskal (82%) and intravascular (70%) cement extrusions but a lower sensitivity in identifying epidural (42%) and extravertebral (50%) leaks. Therefore, the CT scan overall was best in detecting location and accuracy. Conclusion CT detected more cement leaks than any of the other investigated techniques, especially epidural, extravertebral, and intravascular cement leakages. To achieve the best accuracy, only CT provides complete information.Copyright © 2018 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart - New York.",Excluded

Forty-three patients were examined at 100 kVp with filtered back projection after 60 mL of 370 mg I/mL contrast material was administered. Another 39 patients were examined at 80 kVp with IR after 30 mL of 270 mg I/mL contrast material was administered. Subjective and objective image quality was evaluated for each patient. Radiation doses were estimated and compared., RESULTS: Mean attenuation, noise and signal-to-noise ratio in 80 kVp group were significantly lower than in 100 kVp group (all P < 0.05), while there was no significant difference in contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), although a trend towards a lower CNR in 80 kVp group was observed (P = 0.099). The subjective image quality between the two groups was not significantly different (P = 0.905). The effective dose and iodine load in 80 kVp group were reduced by 54% and 64%, respectively, when compared with 100 kVp group., CONCLUSION: Prospectively ECG-triggered high-pitch CCTA at 80 kVp with 30 mL of 270 mg I/mL contrast material and IR is feasible for patients with BMI less than 25 kg/m(2) and reduces radiation dose and iodine load when compared with the standard CCTA protocol.

We did this trial to assess the impact of short schedule radiotherapy in patients aged 60 years and older with glioblastoma. Patients & Methods: Fifty patients aged 60 years or older with a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) greater than or equal to 70 were treated with postoperative hypofractionated radiotherapy (34Gy administered in 3.4Gy fractions over 2 weeks). The primary endpoint of the study was overall survival. The secondary endpoints were progression-free survival, and tolerance to treatment. Result(s): The median age at surgery was 71 years (range 60-81). No patient received prior or concomitant chemotherapy. At a median follow-up of 12.5 months, the median progressionfree survival and overall survival were 5.8 months (95% CI, 4.1-7.9) and 10 months (95% CI, 8.9-11.1) respectively. Type of surgery (total resection vs. subtotal vs. biopsy) remained a prognostic factor (p=0.034). Tolerance appeared acceptable in terms of KPS changes and corticosteroid use during radiation therapy.

2783,"Effect of Cisplatin on parotid gland function in concomitant radiochemotherapy PURPOSE: To determine the influence of concomitant radiochemotherapy with cisplatin on parotid gland tissue complication probability., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients treated with either radiotherapy (n = 61) or concomitant radiochemotherapy with cisplatin (n = 36) for head-and-neck cancer were prospectively evaluated. The dose and volume distributions of the parotid glands were noted in dose-volume histograms. Stimulated salivary flow rates were measured before, during the 2(nd) and 6(th) weeks and at 4 weeks and 6 months after the treatment. The data were fit using the normal tissue complication probability model of Lyman. Complication was defined as a reduction of the salivary flow rate to less than 25% of the pretreatment flow rate., RESULTS: The normal tissue complication probability model parameter TD(50) (the dose leading to a complication probability of 50%) was found to be 32.2 Gy at 4 weeks and 32.1 Gy at 6 months for concomitant radiochemotherapy and 41.1 Gy at 4 weeks and 39.6 Gy at 6 months for radiotherapy. The tolerated dose for concomitant radiochemotherapy was at least 7 to 8 Gy lower than for radiotherapy alone at TD(50)., CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the concomitant radiochemotherapy tended to cause a higher probability of parotid gland tissue damage. Advanced radiotherapy planning approaches such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy may be particularly important for parotid sparing in radiochemotherapy because of cisplatin-related increased radiosensitivity of glands.",Excluded

3218,"Severity of radiation pneumonitis, from clinical, dosimetric and biological features: a pilot study Background and objective: Radiation pneumonitis (RP) could be a lethal complication of lung cancer treatment. No reliable predictors of RP severity have been recognized. This prospective pilot study was performed to identify early predictors of high grade lung toxicity and to evaluate clinical, biological or dosimetric features associated with different grades of toxicity. Method(s): Sixteen patients with non-small cell lung cancer with indication of concurrent chemoradiotherapy using 60 Gy/2 Gy/fraction starting at cycle one of platinum based chemotherapy were included. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), pulmonary function testing (PFT), and 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron-emission tomography was performed before radiotherapy (RT), after three weeks of treatment, and two months post-RT. For analysis, patients were grouped by grade (low [G1-G2] vs. high [G3-G5]). The two groups were compared to identify predictors of RP. Protein expression BAL and lung tissue metabolism was evaluated in two patients (RP-G1 vs. RP-G3). Categorical variables such as comorbidities, stages and locations were summarized as percentages. Radiation doses, pulmonary function values and time to RP were summarized by medians with ranges or as means with standard deviation. Longitudinal analysis PFT was performed by a T-test. Result(s): All 16 patients developed RP, as follows: G1 (5 pts; 31.3%); G2 (5 pts; 31.3%); G3 (5 pts; 31.3%); and G5 (1 pts; 6.1%). Patients with high grade RP presented significant decrease (p = 0.02) in diffusing lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) after three weeks of RT. No correlation between dosimetric values and RP grades was observed. BAL analysis of the selected patients showed that CXCL-1, CD154, IL-1ra, IL-23, MIF, PAI-1 and IFN-gamma were overexpressed in the lungs of the RP-G3 patient, even before treatment. The pre-RT SUVmax value in the RP-G3 patient was non-significantly higher than in the patient with RP-G1. Conclusion(s): RT induces some degree of RP. Our data suggest that decrease in DLCO% is the most sensitive parameter for the early detection of RP. Moreover, we detect biological differences between the two grades of pneumonitis, highlighting the potential value of some cytokines as a prognostic marker for developing high grade lung toxicity. Further multicenter studies with larger sample size are essential to validate these findings.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): We analyzed 10 patients with hemangioma of the cavernous sinus who were treated with conventional radiotherapy between January 2000 and December 2016. The median patient age was 54 years (range, 31-65 years), and 8 patients (80.0%) were female. The mean hemangioma volume was 34.1 cm3 (range, 6.8-83.2 cm3), and fractionated radiation was administered to a total dose of 50-54 Gy with a daily dose of 2 Gy. Result(s): The median follow-up period was 6.8 years (range, 2.2-8.8 years). At last follow-up, the volume of the tumor had decreased in all patients. The average tumor volume reduction rate from the initial volume was 72.9% (range, 18.9-95.3%). All 10 of the cranial neuropathies observed before radiation therapy had improved, with complete symptomatic remission in 9 cases (90%) and partial remission in 1 case (10%). No new acute neurologic impairments were reported after radiotherapy. One probable compressive optic neuropathy was observed at 1 year after radiotherapy.

2990,"New effective dose estimates for Rubidium-82 based on dynamic PET/CT imaging in humans Objectives Published radiation dose estimates for Rubidium-82 vary widely, and no comprehensive study in man has yet been conducted. With the increasing use of Rb-82 PET for myocardial perfusion imaging, improved dosimetry information is needed for accurate risk assessment. The purpose of this study was to measure Rb-82 internal organ and effective doses with PET/CT in humans. Methods We recruited 26 cardiac patients and 4 normal subjects with no cardiac history. Dynamic 3D PET scans were acquired (GE Discovery RX/VCT) over 10 minutes following IV injection of 10 MBq/kg Rb-82. Images were reconstructed using FORE-OSEM and 8 mm Hann filter. Cardiac scans of the chest were acquired at rest for all 30 subjects, plus one additional scan of the Head, Neck, Abdomen, Pelvis, or Thighs. Mean Rb-82 residence times were determined in 22 source organs using volumes-of-interest (VOI) drawn on the fused PET/CT images. For large organs a small VOI was used to avoid partial volume losses. For small organs the average activity above 80% threshold was multiplied by the volume at 40% of the peak value within the organ VOI. Target organ doses and the effective dose estimate were calculated using OLINDA/EXM 1.0 according to ICRP 60, and recalculated according to ICRP 103. Results A total of 283 organs were measured across the 60 scans, with at least 4 samples obtained in each source organ. The average 'adult' effective dose for Rubidium-82 was found to be 0.00074 mSv/MBq using ICRP 60. Using ICRP 103, the male and female effective doses were 0.00074 and 0.00092 mSv/MBq respectively. The highest absorbed organ dose was to the kidneys. Conclusions These dose estimates for Rubidium-82 are the first to be measured directly with PET/CT in humans, and are 4 to 4.5 times lower than previous ICRP 60 values based on a theoretical blood flow model. The new values derived from human studies suggest a typical effective dose of 0.6 mSv per scan with 3D PET.",Excluded
3661,"Oral green tea catechin metabolites are incorporated into human skin and protect against UV radiation-induced cutaneous inflammation in association with reduced production of pro-inflammatory eicosanoid 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid Green tea catechins (GTC) reduce UV radiation (UVR)-induced inflammation in experimental models, but human studies are scarce and their cutaneous bioavailability and mechanism of photoprotection are unknown. We aimed to examine oral GTC cutaneous uptake, ability to protect human skin against erythema induced by a UVR dose range and impact on potent cyclo-oxygenase- and lipoxygenase-produced mediators of UVR inflammation, PGE2 and 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE), respectively. In an open oral intervention study, sixteen healthy human subjects (phototype I/II) were given low-dose GTC (540 mg) with vitamin C (50 mg) daily for 12 weeks. Pre- and post-supplementation, the buttock skin was exposed to UVR and the resultant erythema quantified. Skin blister fluid and biopsies were taken from the unexposed and the UVR-exposed skin 24 h after a pro-inflammatory UVR challenge (three minimal erythema doses). Urine, skin tissue and fluid were analysed for catechin content and skin fluid for PGE2 and 12-HETE by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem MS. A total of fourteen completing subjects were supplement compliant (twelve female, median 42.5 years, range 29-59 years). Benzoic acid levels were increased in skin fluid post-supplementation (P= 0.03), and methylated gallic acid and several intact catechins and hydroxyphenyl-valerolactones were detected in the skin tissue and fluid. AUC analysis for UVR erythema revealed reduced response post-GTC (P= 0.037). Pre-supplementation, PGE2 and 12-HETE were UVR induced (P= 0.003, 0.0001). After GTC, UVR-induced 12-HETE reduced from mean 64 (sd 42) to 41 (sd 32) pg/mul (P= 0.01), while PGE2 was unaltered. Thus, GTC intake results in the incorporation of catechin metabolites into human skin associated with abrogated UVR-induced 12-HETE; this may contribute to protection against sunburn inflammation and potentially longer-term UVR-mediated damage.",Excluded

In 12 rats, 3D AR visualization of preprocedural MR images was performed before embolization. Procedural metrics including catheterization time and radiation exposure were compared vs a prospective cohort of 16 rats in which embolization was performed without AR. An additional cohort of 15 retrospective cases was identified and combined with the prospective control cohort (n = 31) to improve statistical power., RESULTS: A 37% reduction in fluoroscopy time, from 11.7 min to 7.4 minutes, was observed with AR when compared prospectively, which did not reach statistical significance (P = .12); however, when compared with combined prospective and retrospective controls, the reduction in fluoroscopy time from 14.1 min to 7.4 minutes (48%) was significant (P = .01). A 27% reduction in total catheterization time, from 42.7 minutes to 31.0 minutes, was also observed with AR when compared prospectively, which did not reach statistical significance (P = .11). No significant differences were seen in dose-area product or air kerma prospectively., CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensional AR visualization of preprocedural imaging may aid in the reduction of procedural metrics in a preclinical model of transarterial embolization. These data support the need for further studies to evaluate the potential of AR in endovascular oncologic interventions. Copyright © 2020 SIR. Published by Elsevier Inc.

3393,"Relationships between ionizing radiation, bone marrow transplantation and leukemogenesis Studies of the relationships between ionizing radiation, bone marrow transplantation and leukemogenesis were carried out in 343 LACA mice. The recipients (female) were given whole-body irradiation with 7 or 8 Gy of Co-60 gamma-rays, while the donors (male) were given whole-body irradiation with 3, 1.5, 0.5, 0.1, 0.05 and 0 Gy of Co-60 gamma-rays. Each recipient was intravenously infused with 1-3 X 10(7) of the mixed marrow cells of donors. In the result, the average incidence of surviving over 1 month was 86% in the recipients. Myelocytic leukemia developed in all the transplanted groups, the average incidence being 88.5%. Leukemia was observed in 1.5-2.5 months after transplantation in the recipients receiving marrow cells from donors exposed to 3 Gy, but in 5-8 months in other groups. It was demonstrated by the analysis of Y-chromosome that the leukemic cells were derived from the donor's marrow cells. The results suggest that marrow transplantation for the mice irradiated by Co-60 gamma-rays of lethal dose can protect them from death, but promote the development of leukemia. Radiation can induce production of factors which lead to leukemic transformation of engrafted normal marrow cells in the irradiated mice; the direct damage of DNA caused by radiation is not the unique factor that gives rise to leukemia.",Excluded
3254,"The interdependence between clinical features of rheumatoid arthritis, thyroid gland function, and the anti-hormonal antibodies Background: According to the common notions, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an immunopathological condition with complex autoimmune response, directed presumably to synovial tissue. Besides that, there are some organ involvements in RA, that can strongly affect the extent of the autoimmune reactions. One of this organs is thyroid gland, because changes of its function, either increase or decrease, modulate activity of immune cells and inflammation level on the whole. Production of antibodies, directed to T3 and T4, is a candidate mechanism of the thyroid involvement. Objective(s): The objectives of our study are detection of different thyroid conditions in RA including determination of lesion type and function assessment, as well as searching for interdependence between the clinical features of RA, type of thyroid involvement, and the level of the anti-hormonal antibodies. Method(s): The research was carried out in agreement with the principles of the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki (1997). Approval for the investigation was got from the Regional Medical Ethics Committee. We enrolled adult patients with RA, verified using ACR/EULAR criteria (2010). RA activity was determined by means of DAS28 index. Thyroid involvement was detected by clinical, ultrasound, and laboratory assessment, including TSH, free T3, free T4, and anti-TPO. Anti-T3 and anti-T4 antibodies were measured using ELISA and calculated in terms of optical density units (ODU). The positive cutoff values, 0.098 ODU for anti-T3 and 0.093 ODU for anti-T4, have been found using healthy controls (n=39). Results were expressed as means+/-standard errors, the differences were considered significant at p<0.05. Result(s): 75 patients with RA have been enrolled, including 61 (81.4%) women and 14 (18.6%) men, their age was from 25 to 78 years. Mean RA activity was 3.2+/-1.4 DAS28 points. Different visceral involvements were detected in 20 (26.7%) cases, and 5 (6.7%) of them had an overt clinical picture of thyroid lesions. The signs and symptoms for 4 of them were similar to Hashimoto's thyroiditis with hyperfunction, the remaining one was complied to the mixed toxic goiter. All these 5 patients had low TSH and quite high DAS28 score (4.8+/-1.9). However, the prevalence of subclinical thyroid disorders in RA was considerably higher. Virtually all the patients (n=73) have been revealed anti-T3 (0.128+/-0.047 ODU) and/or anti-T4 antibodies (0.152+/-0.050 ODU). There was no relationship between these antibodies and organ involvement, other than thyroid gland; RF titers also had no significant influence. We found some rather unexpected dependencies of these markers with X-ray RA stages, as well as with RA activity. There was a clear trend of elevation of mean anti-T4 concentration together with higher Steinbrocker stage (p=0.034, ANOVA), the inverse tendency have been observed for anti-T3 (p=0.047, ANOVA). Correlations of DAS28 score with anti-T4 (r=0.525, p=0.031) and anti-T3 (r=-0.391, p=0.040) were also opposite. There was another significant inverse correlation of DAS28 score and TSH concentration (r=-0.330, p=0.046). Conclusion(s): Our data suggest that though anti-T4 concentration is tended to be elevated, high RA activity can promote hyperthyroidism. This is probably due to either influence of these antibodies to T4 and T3 production, or immune disturbances caused by thyroid hyperfunction itself.",Excluded
3386,"Photoprotective herbal extract loaded nanovesicular creams inhibiting ultraviolet radiations induced photoaging Botanical photochemopreventives are used to fight against the adverse effects of ultra violet rays on skin which leads to photoaging. Phytoconstituents present in Punica granatum extract have antioxidant, anti-carcinogenic and photoprotective properties which was proved by estimation of phenolic content, sun protection factor and antioxidant effect determination of the alcoholic extract. Extract loaded nanotransfersomes were prepared, evaluated for size, entrapment efficiency and incorporated into the cream. The presence of vesicles in the cream was confirmed by the transmission electron microscopy and the efficacy of the formulated creams by the physicochemical parameters. The nanotransfersomal and conventional cream formulations were in vivo tested for change in skin hydration (Corneometer), viscoelasticity (Cutometer) and sebum content (Sebumeter). The photoprotective effect of formulations was further confirmed by biochemical studies. Improved skin properties (viscoelasticity, skin hydration, sebum content) and biochemical parameters (superoxide dismutase, catalase, total protein and ascorbic acid level) with decreased malondialdehyde level was observed with nanotransfersomal cream formulations as compared to conventional creams. The efficacy was in the order nanotransfersomal creams > Conventional creams> Empty nanotransfersomal cream > Base cream.",Excluded
3104,"The effect of electromagnetic field emitted by a mobile phone on the inhibitory control of saccades OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether exposure to a pulsed high-frequency electromagnetic field (pulsed EMF) emitted by a mobile phone has short-term effects on the inhibitory control of saccades., METHODS: A double-blind, counterbalanced crossover study design was employed. We assessed the performance of 10 normal subjects on antisaccade (AS) and cued saccade (CUED) tasks as well as two types of overlap saccade (OL1, OL2) task before and after 30 min of exposure to EMF emitted by a mobile phone or sham exposure., RESULTS: After EMF or sham exposure, we observed a slight but significant shortening of latency in the CUED and OL2 tasks. AS amplitude decreased as well as the saccade velocities in the AS, CUED, and OL1 tasks after exposure. These changes occurred regardless of whether exposure was real or sham. The frequencies of pro-saccades in the AS task, saccades to cue in the CUED task, and prematurely initiated saccades in the overlap (OL2) task did not change significantly after real or sham EMF exposure., CONCLUSIONS: Thirty minutes of mobile phone exposure has no significant short-term effect on the inhibitory control of saccades., SIGNIFICANCE: The cortical processing responsible for saccade inhibition is not affected by exposure to EMF emitted by a mobile phone.

3300,"A novel screw guiding method with a screw guide template system for posterior C-2 fixation: Clinical article Object. Accurate insertion of C-2 cervical screws is imperative; however, the procedures for C-2 screw insertion are technically demanding and challenging, especially in cases of C-2 vertebral abnormality. The purpose of this study is to report the effectiveness of the tailor-made screw guide template (SGT) system for placement of C-2 screws, including in cases with abnormalities. Methods. Twenty-three patients who underwent posterior spinal fusion surgery with C-2 cervical screw insertion using the SGT system were included. The preoperative bone image on CT was analyzed using multiplanar imaging software. The trajectory and depth of the screws were designed based on these images, and transparent templates with screw guiding cylinders were created for each lamina. During the operation, after templates were engaged directly to the laminae, drilling, tapping, and screwing were performed through the templates. The authors placed 26 pedicle screws, 12 pars screws, 6 laminar screws, and 4 C1-2 transarticular screws using the SGT system. To assess the accuracy of the screw track under this system, the deviation of the screw axis from the preplanned trajectory was evaluated on postoperative CT and was classified as follows: Class 1 (accurate), a screw axis deviation less than 2 mm from the planned trajectory; Class 2 (inaccurate), 2 mm or more but less than 4 mm; and Class 3 (deviated), 4 mm or more. In addition, to assess the safety of the screw insertion, malpositioning of the screws was also evaluated using the following grading system: Grade 0 (containing), a screw is completely within the wall of the bone structure; Grade 1 (exposure), a screw perforates the wall of the bone structure but more than 50% of the screw diameter remains within the bone; Grade 2 (perforation), a screw perforates the bone structures and more than 50% of the screw diameter is outside the pedicle; and Grade 3 (penetration), a screw perforates completely outside the bone structure. Results. In total, 47 (97.9%) of 48 screws were classified into Class 1 and Grade 0, whereas 1 laminar screw was classified as Class 3 and Grade 2. Mean screw deviations were 0.36 mm in the axial plane (range 0.0-3.8 mm) and 0.30 mm in the sagittal plane (range 0.0-0.8 mm). Conclusions. This study demonstrates that the SGT system provided extremely accurate C-2 cervical screw insertion without configuration of reference points, high-dose radiation from intraoperative 3D navigation, or any registration or probing error evoked by changes in spinal alignment during surgery. A multistep screw placement technique and reliable screw guide cylinders were the key to accurate screw placement using the SGT system. ©AANS, 2014.",Excluded
3308,"Radiation Exposure to the Surgeon, Surgical Assistant, and Scrub Nurse during Closed Intramedullary Nailing of Long Bones-Does It Vary Depending on the Experience of the Surgeon? Objectives:To assess radiation exposure (RE) to the surgical team and fluoroscopy time (FT) during closed nailing of long bone fractures performed under fluoroscopic guidance with regard to surgeon's experience. Design(s):Prospective observational study. Setting(s):Level-1 trauma center. Participant(s):Surgical team, comprising a surgeon, a surgical assistant, and a scrub nurse, for closed nailing procedures performed in 202 consecutive closed tibial and femoral diaphyseal fractures. Intervention(s):Dosimeter provided to each member of surgical team. Surgeon experience level (trainee, senior registrar, and consultant).Main Outcome Measurements:RE (microsieverts) to the surgical team and FT (minutes) were recorded from the dosimeter and fluoroscopic unit, respectively, and correlated with surgeon's experience. Result(s):In tibial nailing, mean RE (in Sv) per procedure to surgeon, surgical assistant, and scrub nurse was 15.2, 9.2, and 2.0 for trainees, 14.5, 8.1, and 1.6 for senior registrars, and 13.6, 7.4, and 1.5 for consultants, respectively. In femoral nailing, mean RE per procedure to surgeon, surgical assistant, and scrub nurse was 181.6, 113.6, and 37.1 for trainees, 110.1, 66.7, and 20.4 for senior registrars, and 79.9, 30.9, and 12.5 for consultants, respectively. RE to the surgeon was highest followed by surgical assistant and scrub nurse irrespective of operating surgeon's experience in both tibial and femoral nailing (P < 0.001). In tibial nailing, there was a significant difference in FT only for the stage of guide wire passage (P = 0.041), whereas in femoral nailing, total FT (P < 0.001), nail entry verification (P = 0.02), guide wire passage (P = 0.013), nail introduction (P = 0.006), and distal locking (P < 0.001) showed a significant difference. Conclusion(s):RE was maximum for operating surgeon and least for scrub nurse irrespective of operating surgeon's experience in both femoral and tibial nailing. FT and RE to the surgical team decreased with increasing experience of the surgeon in femoral nailing. Level of Evidence:Prognostic Level II.

Patients underwent dosimetry (day -21) with 5 mCi (185 MBq) 111In- ibritumomab tiuxetan following 250 mg/m2 rituximab, followed a week later by 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan to deliver a target dose of 1000 cGy to highest normal organ. Bone marrow biopsy was done on day -7 to estimate radiation dose and stem cells were reinfused when the radiation dose was estimated to be less than 5 cGy. The median 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan dose was 71.6 mCi (2649.2 MBq; range, 36.6-105 mCi; range, 1354.2-3885 MBq). Histology included follicular lymphoma (n = 12), diffuse large B-cell (n = 14), and mantle cell (n = 5). The median number of prior chemotherapy treatments was 2. The treatment was well tolerated. The median times to reach an absolute neutrophil count greater than 500/muL and platelet count more than 20 000/muL were 10 days and 12 days, respectively. There were 2 deaths and 5 relapses.

In this study treatment results were retrospectively analyzed and the prognostic factors related to survival were identified. From March 1999 to January 2004, 102 patients with stage IIIA/IIIB non-small-cell lung cancer received definitive radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. Radiotherapy involved a daily dose of 1.8-2.0 Gy five times a week; 60 Gy was set as the total dose. Maximal chemotherapy was given to patients with normal kidney, liver, and bone marrow functions. The 5-year overall survival rate was 22.2%; the median survival was 18 months. The median follow-up of surviving patients was 53 months. The complete or partial response rate was 85%. At the time of the last follow-up, 21 patients were alive and 81 patients had died, including 5 patients who had died due to radiation pneumonitis.

2652,"Implications of somatic mutations in the AML1 gene in radiation-associated and therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia Somatically acquired point mutations of AML1/RUNX1 gene have been recently identified in rare cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Moreover, germ line mutations of AML1 were found in an autosomal dominant disease, familial platelet disorder with predisposition to AML (FPD/AML), suggesting that AML1 mutants, as well as AML1 chimeras, contribute to the transformation of hematopoietic progenitors. In this report, we showed that AML1 point mutations were found in 6 (46%) of 13 MDS patients among atomic bomb (A-bomb) survivors in Hiroshima. Unlike acute or chronic leukemia patients among A-bomb survivors, MDS patients exposed relatively low-dose radiation and developed the disease after a long latency period. AML1 mutations also were found in 5 (38%) of 13 therapy-related AML/MDS patients who were treated with alkylating agents with or without local radiation therapy. In contrast, frequency of AML1 mutation in sporadic MDS patients was 2.7% (2 of 74). Among AML1 mutations identified in this study, truncated-type mutants lost DNA binding potential and trans-activation activity. All missense mutations with one exception (Gly42Arg) lacked DNA binding ability and down-regulated the trans-activation potential of wild-type AML1 in a dominant-negative fashion. The Gly42Arg mutation that was shared by 2 patients bound DNA even more avidly than wild-type AML1 and enhanced the trans-activation potential of normal AML1. These results suggest that AML1 point mutations are related to low-dose radiation or alkylating agents and play a role distinct from that of leukemogenic chimeras as a result of chromosomal translocations caused by sublethal radiation or topoisomerase II inhibitors.",Excluded
3471,"Fluoroscopic Sacroiliac Joint Injection: Is Oblique Angulation Really Necessary? BACKGROUND: The conventional technique for sacroiliac (SI) joint injection involves aligning the anterior and posterior aspects of the SI joint under fluoroscopic guidance and then entering the SI joint in the most caudal aspect., OBJECTIVE: We wish to highlight that there is no added advantage to aligning both the anterior and posterior joint lines of the SI joint as it is time consuming, associated with additional radiation exposure, and may make the entry into the posterior SI joint technically more difficult., STUDY DESIGN: Observational study., SETTING: Pain Clinic, Department of Anesthesiology., METHODS: With the patient lying prone on fluoroscopy table, SI joint injection is performed with a 22 G, 10 cm spinal needle in a true anteroposterior (AP) view, where anterior and posterior SI joint spaces are seen as separate entities, where the medial joint space represents the posterior SI joint and the lateral joint space represents the anterior SI joint. The distal 1 cm of the medial joint space is entered under AP view. If the SI joint is seen as a straight line rather than 2 joint spaces in the AP view then the image intensifier of the fluoroscope was tilted cranially to elongate the image of the lower part of the posterior SI joint, thus facilitating entry into this part of the joint which was confirmed by administering 0.3 to 0.5 mL of radiopaque contrast medium., RESULT: Sixty SI joints of 58 patients were injected under an AP fluoroscopic view. Forty-two (70%) SI joints were seen as 2 separate medial and lateral joint spaces and were entered in distal 1 cm of the medial joint space. In 18 (30%) joints seen as a straight line rather than 2 separate spaces, the image intensifier of the fluoroscope was tilted cranially to elongate the image of the lower part of the posterior SI joint and then the SI joint was entered in its distal 1 cm. Confirmation of entry into the SI joint was confirmed by with 0.3 to 0.5 mL of radiopaque contrast medium. In 4 cases the joints did not show the correct radiopaque contrast spread (3/42 and 1/18) although the needle seemed to be in the joint space., LIMITATIONS: Small sample size., CONCLUSION: Aligning the anterior and posterior aspects of SI joint for fluoroscopic guided SI joint injection is not necessary for the success of the block.Key words: Sacroiliac joint, injection, anteroposterior view, oblique angulation, fluoroscopic technique.",Excluded

3541,"Radiation Exposure and Operation Time in Percutaneous Endoscopic Lumbar Discectomy Using Fluoroscopy-Based Navigation System Objective: This study evaluated radiation exposure and operation time of percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy (PELD) by using a fluoroscopy-based navigation system for access and localization. Method(s): Eighty-six PELDs performed by a single surgeon were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were separated into 2 groups: group A (using a three-dimensional [3D]-printed navigation instrument and fluoroscopy-based navigation system) and group B (with conventional fluoroscopy and standard instrumentation). The operation, fluoroscopy, and total access time were collected, as well as fluoroscopy and access times. Result(s): The operative time for group A was 59 minutes (standard deviation [SD], 6 minutes) and 106 minutes (SD, 15 minutes) in group B (P < 0.001). In group A, fluoroscopy was used an average of 5 times (SD, 0.7) and 29 times (SD, 8) in group B (P < 0.001). The fluoroscopy time was 9 minutes (SD, 2 minutes) in group A and 40 minutes (SD, 8 minutes) in group B (P < 0.001). The number of access attempts was 1.3 (SD, 0.5) in group A and 8 (SD, 2 times) in group B (P < 0.001). The total access time was 11 minutes (SD, 2 minutes) in group A and 28 minutes (SD, 5 minutes) in group B (P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): PELD using the fluoroscopy-based navigation system showed lower operative, fluoroscopy, and access time compared with conventional techniques. In addition, fewer fluoroscopy images and access attempts were made in the navigation group. These data suggest that this novel technique reduces fluoroscopy and operation time and may reduce risks of repeated surgical access attempts.Copyright © 2019",Excluded

Method Patients with localised gastric MALT lymphoma persisting after H. pylori eradication were offered moderate-dose RT (30 Gy, 2 Gy/fraction) and followed with annual endoscopies. All biopsies before and after RT were reviewed by a committee of pathologists. Results From 1995 to 2011, out of the 232 patients followed prospectively, 53 received RT for persistence of lymphoma after H. pylori eradication: either macroscopic ulcer (n = 31), or microscopic lymphomatous infiltrate (n = 22), after a mean follow-up of 12 and 31 months, respectively. All lymphomas were localised (45 stage IE and 8 stage IIE) and 38 (72%) were H. pylori-positive. The mean clinical and endoscopic follow-up from diagnosis was 7.6 years (2.2-19.1). No acute or late toxicity occurred. A complete remission was achieved in all patients but one (98%) with no relapse after a median follow-up of 4.9 years (1.3-16.6) after completion of RT. Overall survival and 5-year disease specific survival were 94% and 100%, respectively. One patient died of gastric adenocarcinoma.

Materials/Methods: 13 patients with HNSCC underwent CT-simulations with neutral tongue position and stick-out tongue for planning IMRTs (IMRT-N and IMRT-S, respectively). Planning objectives were to deliver 70 Gy, 63 Gy, and 56 Gy in 35 fractions to 95% of PTVs using simultaneously integrated boost technique, with mean radiation doses (Dmean) of < 26 Gy to the parotid gland, < 30 Gy to the submandibular gland, and < 36 Gy to OC. For other organs at risk (OARs), Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) recommended dose constraints were applied. Planning was optimized to minimize doses to OARs without compromising coverage of PTVs. Radiation doses to OC in IMRT-N and IMRT-S was compared. Data are presented as mean >= standard deviation. Result(s): OC volumes were similar in IMRT-N and IMRT-S (129 >= 34.0 cm3 and 130.8 >= 38.8 cm3, respectively, P = 0.25). Tongue volume in outside of mouth was 7.1 >= 3.8 cm3 (5.4 >= 2.6% of entire OC and 7.8 >= 3.1% of oral tongue) in IMRT-S. Anterior tip of lips to gingiva was 0.9 >= 0.4 cm in IMRT-S and 0.1 >= 0.2 cm in IMRT-N (P<0.001). Distance from base of tongue (BOT) to pharyngeal constrictor (PC) was 1.5 >= 0.5 cm in IMRT-N and 2.0 >= 0.6 cm in IMRT-S (p<0.001). IMRT-N and IMRT-S showed equivalent radiation targets coverages with sparing OARs, except OC. Dmean of OC was 34.9 >= 8.0 Gy and 31.4 >= 8.7 Gy with IMRT-N and IMRT-S, respectively (P<0.001). OC volume receiving >= 36 Gy (V36) was 40.6 >= 16.9% using IMRT-N compared to 33.0 >= 17.0% with IMRT-S (P<0.001). Dmean of oral tongue was 38.1 >= 7.9 Gy and 32.8 >= 8.8 Gy in IMRT-N and IMRT-S, respectively (P<0.001). Dmean of lips was 16.0 >= 3.7 Gy in IMRT-N and 13.5 >= 4.0 Gy in IMRT-S (p<0.001). Conclusion(s): IMRT-S for patients with HNSCC has significant decreased radiation dose to OC and increased distance from BOT to PC and from dorsal surface of tongue to palate than IMRT-N. The use of IMRT-S rather than IMRT-N can significantly decrease radiation dose to OARs in OC or pharynx, which may potentially reduce RT related toxicity in OC or pharynx in patients RT for HNSCC.",Excluded

Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), angiography, and follow-up investigations of pulmonic stenosis (PS) with R2A CA were carried out to compare different diagnostic methods., RESULTS: Based on the TTE morphology, PS with an aberrant CA was suspected in all dogs (n = 22) and later confirmed by angiography in 18 cases (18/22), and necropsy in two cases (2/22). In 12 cases (12/22), TEE and angiography were both performed and confirmed the diagnosis of an R2A anomaly. Two cases (2/22) were diagnosed only with TEE., CONCLUSIONS: Transesophageal echocardiography may be considered an effective tool to diagnose CA abnormalities, in particular when TTE is inconclusive. Transesophageal echocardiography offers detailed and easily reproducible views of coronary ostia, and the spatial relationship between the right common CA and the great arteries. Although it is not possible to define the course of the more distal coronary branches, TEE has proven reliable in recognizing those elements that can constitute a risk for the execution of a balloon valvuloplasty (BV). Therefore, TEE can be used to confirm this type of CA anomaly and prevent a BV, which is contraindicated in these cases. In addition, TEE avoids any further vascular access, radiation exposure, and contrast medium injection. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded
3021,"Influence of preoperative femoral orientation on radiographic measures of femoral head height in total hip replacement Background: In total hip arthroplasty the surgeon aims to restore the biomechanics of the joint. Femoral height has the greatest influence on restoring limb length and contributes equally to the restoration of femoral head centre. On X-ray, the level of femoral neck resection is most often referenced off the upper border of lesser trochanter. Less frequently, femoral head centre is referenced from the tip of the greater trochanter. The error in measurement of femoral height resulting from unknown femoral rotation is crucially important and can result in inappropriate surgical planning for implant selection and placement. It is unknown which reference produces lower error. Method(s): A sample of femoral shapes was generated using a femoral statistical shape model. These were placed in a range of orientations in terms of external rotation and flexion, at intervals of 10degree. Simulated X-rays were then produced and the distances from the tip of either greater or lesser trochanter to femoral head centre were measured. Finding(s): Although using greater trochanter as a reference demonstrated greater errors at the extremes, both techniques resulted in errors of 7-8 mm with 20degree of both femoral external rotation and flexion. Interpretation(s): Moderate degrees of femoral external rotation combined with flexion can result in unsatisfactory errors when templating limb length. There should be greater focus and an agreed definition for femoral height. There is a clinical need for a method with a lower error in determining true femoral height and the level of neck resection.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
3637,"Dose selection for radioiodine therapy of borderline hyperthyroid patients with multifocal and disseminated autonomy on the basis of 99mTc-pertechnetate thyroid uptake The aim of this study was to optimise radioiodine therapy of diffuse and nodular toxic goitre by calculation of the radiation dose delivered to the thyroid on the basis of the pretreatment technetium-99m pertechnetate thyroid uptake under thyrotropin suppression (TcTU(s)). The TcTU(s) value serves as a substitute for the non-suppressible iodine turnover and the functional autonomous mass. Marinelli's formula was used to calculate tissue absorbed doses of 150 Gy, 200 Gy, 250 Gy and 300 Gy to the thyroids of 438 patients with multifocal and disseminated autonomy. The mean age of patients was 70+/-9 years, and the mean thyroid volume was 54+/-26 ml. Two hundred and sixty-one of the patients had at least one documented previous episode of overt hyperthyroidism. Tissue absorbed doses were adapted to the pretreatment TcTU(s): 150 Gy for a TcTU(s) of 1.5%-2.49%, 200 Gy for a TcTU(s) of 2.5%-3.49%, 250 Gy for a TcTU(s) of 3.5%-4.49% and 300 Gy for a TcTU(s) of > or =4.5%. Normalisation of TcTU(s) and thyrotropin (TSH), thyroid volume reduction and frequency of hypothyroidism and recurrent hyperthyroidism were evaluated 1 year after a single radioiodine therapy. The presented dose strategy resulted in normalisation of TcTU(s) in 96% and an increase in TSH to the normal range in 92%. Recurrent hyperthyroidism was observed in only five patients. Thyroid volume decreased from 54+/-26 before treatment to 34+/-20 ml, a mean reduction of 37%. The frequency of hypothyroidism, at 0.9%, was encouragingly low. Dose selection in accordance with pretreatment TcTU(s) can be recommended for elimination of functional autonomous tissue with a single radioiodine therapy in patients of advanced age with enlarged thyroid glands and relevant autonomous masses who are at risk of developing iodine-induced hyperthyroidism.",Excluded
2730,"Less is More: The Impact of Multidisciplinary Thyroid Conference on the Treatment of Well-Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma BACKGROUND: In 2006, a multidisciplinary thyroid conference (MDTC) was implemented to better plan management of thyroid cancer patients at our institution. This study assessed the clinical impact of a MDTC on radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment patterns., METHODS: A prospective database (2003-2014) collected patient and tumor characteristics, RAI doses, and tumor recurrences. Patients treated with total thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid carcinoma >=1 cm were stratified based on American Thyroid Association (ATA) risk classification. RAI regimens were compared before initiation of MDTC (2003-2005, n = 88), after establishment of MDTC (2007-2009, n = 95), and after the release of 2009 ATA guidelines (2011-2014, n = 181). RAI doses were defined as low (<=75 mCi), intermediate (76-150 mCi), and high (>150 mCi)., RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in the number of patients who received high-dose RAI after implementation of MDTC compared to before initiation of MDTC in the intermediate and high-risk patient groups (p = 0.04 and p < 0.01) without an associated increase in tumor recurrence (11 vs. 7%, p = 0.74). On multivariable analysis, presentation of a patient at MDTC was a negative predictor for receiving high-dose RAI (p = 0.002). As might be expected, there was also a significant decrease in use of RAI after the 2009 ATA guidelines were issued compared to after implementation of MDTC (p < 0.01)., CONCLUSION: In conjunction with implementation of a thyroid malignancy multidisciplinary conference, we observed significantly decreased postoperative dosing of RAI without increased tumor recurrence. The 2009 ATA guidelines were associated with a further decrease in RAI administration. Treatment for patients with thyroid carcinoma is optimized by a multidisciplinary approach.",Excluded
3641,"Non-small cell lung cancer in surgically treated women Aim and background. To determine whether female patients operated on for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have a survival advantage compared to male patients. Methods and study design. We analyzed data from 1,426 prospectively collected patients submitted to lung resection for NSCLC between 1999 and 2008. Results. Two groups, including 1,014 male and 412 female patients, were compared. Female patients were significantly younger, were more frequently asymptomatic, were less likely to be smokers, had better preoperative respiratory function, had a lower frequency of COPD, and were less commonly affected by cardiovascular comorbidity than men. Adenocarcinoma was more frequently present and early pathological stage (stage IA) more frequently detected in women at diagnosis. The operative mortality was significantly lower among women (1.6% vs 4.6%) (P = 0.012), and women underwent significantly more segmentectomies and fewer pneumonectomies (P = 0.001). The disease-related 5-year survival rate was significantly higher in women (66% vs 51%) (P = 0.0008). At univariate analysis the absence of symptoms at presentation, lower pathological stage, squamous cell type, and female gender were positive factors influencing long-term survival. At multivariate analysis low pathological stage, squamous cell type and female gender were confirmed as independent positive prognostic predictors. Women had a significant survival advantage irrespective of the histological subtype at pathological stage IA, IB, IIB and IIIA disease (P <0.05). Conclusions. Female gender was confirmed to be a particular subset amongst patients affected by NSCLC and exerted a positive effect on disease-related survival of patients submitted to surgical resection. This important effect of gender should be cautiously kept in mind in analyzing the results of current and future trials for lung cancer therapy.",Excluded
2768,"Benefits and challenges in bowel MR imaging at 3.0 T Abdominal imaging at 3.0 T has shown to be challenging because of a number of artifacts and effects related to the physics at higher field strength. For bowel imaging at 3.0 T, artifacts due to magnetic field inhomogeneities, standing waves, increased susceptibility, and greater chemical shift effects are of particular concern because they are likely to affect the assessment of relevant structures and counterbalance the benefits of higher signal-to-noise ratio. Regarding small- and large-bowel magnetic resonance imaging, the benefits of higher field strengths translate mainly in better contrast-to-noise ratio of contrast-enhanced T1-weighted gradient echo and T2-weighted imaging, whereas steady-state free precession sequences seem to suffer from serious degradation of image quality. The present article summarizes the technical challenges in bowel imaging at 3.0 T, provides an overview of performance compared with 1.5 T in small- and large-bowel diseases including the rectum, and revises the current literature.",Excluded
2967,"Tissue microarray constructs to predict a response to chemoradiation in rectal cancer PURPOSE: To identify, using tissue microarray (TMA), an immunohistochemical panel predictive of response to ionizing radiation (IR) in rectal cancer., METHODS: TMA constructs were prepared from archived stage II/III rectal tumors and matching adjacent mucosa (n=38) from patients treated with pre-operative chemoradiation. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed for MIB, Cyclin E, p21, p27, p53, survivin, Bcl-2, and BAX. Immunoreactivity along with clinical variables was subjected to univariate and forward stepwise logistic regression analyses., RESULTS: Pathological complete response (pCR) was 23.9%. The number of positive lymph nodes obtained in the resected specimen was associated with pCR. Immunoreactivity for MIB (Sn 15%, Sp 65%, OR 0.33), p53 (Sn 3%, Sp 84%, OR 0.16), Bcl-2 (Sn 11%, Sp 74%, OR 0.35), and BAX (Sn 92%, Sp 80%, OR 46) was associated with pathological response (all p's<0.001). Forward stepwise logistic regression analysis demonstrated that MIB was an independent predictor of a response to chemoradiation (p=0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: A combined panel of mediators of apoptosis alone or combined with clinical factors is a feasible approach that can be applied to rectal tumor biopsies to predict a response to chemoradiation. The most sensitive factor was BAX; while MIB independently predicted a response to chemoradiation. Copyright Published by Elsevier Ltd.",Excluded
2719,"Assessment of radiation exposure in balloon kyphoplasty using a new navigation system Study design: Randomized controlled trials of conventional and laser-navigated technology techniques for balloon kyphoplasty were carried out. Objective(s): To evaluate the effectiveness of a new laser navigation system in reducing the radiation dose in balloon kyphoplasty procedures. Material(s) and Method(s): Sixty-seven randomized controlled trials involving a total of 75 lumbar vertebrae were treated. Thirty-four vertebrae were treated by regular fluoroscopic imaging alone, and the other 41 vertebrae were treated using the new laser navigation system. For each procedure the fluoroscopy dosage was documented using a Hitachi-Aloka Medical external dosimeter. The operation time was recorded. Result(s): The amount of radiation exposure in the control group was 870.59 +/- 134.27 muSv. A significant reduction of the fluoroscopy usage in the navigated group was detected (503.5 +/- 70.0 muSv (p <.0001)). In the control group, the average procedure time was 51.47 +/- 8.30 minutes. The average procedure time in the navigated group was significantly reduced (39.26 +/- 5.87 minutes (p <.0001)). Conclusion(s): The laser positioning and navigation system is an effective solution for reducing radiation exposure in balloon kyphoplasty.

3569,"Relative dose and vascular response after drug-eluting stent implantation: A dosimetric 3D-intravascular ultrasound study Background In drug-eluting stents (DESs), the theoretical drug dose exposed to the vessel wall per stent surface area may vary due to the fixed loading dose and differences in the stent surface area once expanded in varying vessel sizes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential effects of different dose intensities, as estimated by 3D-IVUS dosimetry, on vascular response after DES implantation. Methods Follow-up (6-9 months) 3D-IVUS was performed in 840 coronary lesions treated with a single DES of the following types: sirolimus (SES, n = 148), paclitaxel (PES, n = 162), Endeavor zotarolimus (E-ZES, n = 233), Resolute zotarolimus (R-ZES, n = 147), and everolimus (EES, n = 150). Volume index (volume/length, mm3/mm) was obtained for vessel, lumen, plaque, stent, and neointima. In each lesion, exposed dose intensity was calculated as known loading dose divided by measured luminal surface area of the stented segment. Lesions were divided into tertiles based on the exposed dose intensity: high, medium, and low dose groups. Results The exposed dose intensity ranged 0.74-1.76 mug/mm2 for SES, 0.41-1.18 mug/mm2 for PES, 0.71-1.57 mug/mm2 for E-ZES, 0.72-1.63 mug/mm2 for R-ZES, and 0.40-0.99 mug/mm2 for EES. All types of DES showed no significant difference in neointimal hyperplasia among the 3 groups, except that E-ZES showed significantly less neointimal hyperplasia in the high dose group. Conclusions Detailed 3D-IVUS revealed significant lesion-to-lesion variability in dose intensity exposed to the vessel wall following DES implantation. However, the major types of DES appear to yield equally effective neointimal suppression, despite the varying dose intensity, except for E-ZES.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

3584,"Ultraviolet polarisation sensitivity in the stomatopod crustacean Odontodactylus scyllarus The ommatidia of crustacean eyes typically contain two classes of photoreceptors with orthogonally oriented microvilli. These receptors provide the basis for two-channel polarisation vision in the blue-green spectrum. The retinae of gonodactyloid stomatopod crustaceans possess a great variety of structural specialisations for elaborate polarisation vision. One type of specialisation is found in the small, distally placed R8 cells within the two most ventral rows of the mid-band. These ultraviolet-sensitive photoreceptors produce parallel microvilli, a feature suggestive for polarisation-sensitive photoreceptors. Here, we show by means of intracellular recordings combined with dye-injections that in the gonodactyloid species Odontodactylus scyllarus, the R8 cells of mid-band rows 5 and 6 are sensitive to linear polarised ultraviolet light. We show that mid-band row 5 R8 cells respond maximally to light with an e-vector oriented parallel to the mid-band, whereas mid-band row 6 R8 cells respond maximally to light with an e-vector oriented perpendicular to the mid-band. This orthogonal arrangement of ultraviolet-sensitive receptor cells could support ultraviolet polarisation vision. R8 cells of rows 5 and 6 are known to act as quarter-wave retarders around 500 nm and thus are the first photoreceptor type described with a potential dual role in polarisation vision.",Excluded
2723,"Clinical features and prognostic factors in patients with bone metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma after liver transplantation BACKGROUND: Little is known about the clinical features and prognostic factors of bone metastases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following liver transplantation (LT)., METHODS: All adult patients undergoing LT from 2001 to 2010 were reviewed. Patients with HCC bone metastases after LT received external beam radiotherapy(EBRT) during this period. Demographic variables, laboratory values, and tumor characteristics were determined before LT and EBRT. Total radiation dose ranged from 8 to 60 Gy(median dose 40.0 Gy)., RESULTS: The trunk was the most common site of bone metastases with finding of expansile soft-tissue masses in 23.3% of patients. Overall pain relief from EBRT occurred in 96.7% (29/30). No consistent dose-response relationship was found for palliation of with doses between 30 and 56 Gy (P = 0.670). The median survivals from the time of bone metastases was 8.6 months. On univariate and multivariate analyses, better survival was significantly associated with a better Karnofsky performance status (KPS) and well-controlled intrahepatic tumor, but not with lower alpha-fetoprotein levels. The median time from LT to bone metastases was 7.1 months. Patients exceeding the Shanghai criteria presented with bone metastases earlier than those within the Fudan criteria. Patients with soft-tissue extension always had later bone metastases. The majority of deaths were caused by liver failure due to hepatic decompensation or tumor progression., CONCLUSION: The prognostic factors of bone metastases of HCC following LT are KPS and well-controlled intrahepatic. Even though survival is shorter for these patients, EBRT provides effective palliation of pain.",Excluded
2545,"Low sensitivity of the sister chromatid exchange assay to detect the genotoxic effects of radioiodine therapy To assess the genotoxic risk associated with 131I therapy, sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and cells with unusually high SCE counts (HFC) were determined in a follow-up study performed with 46 hyperthyroidism and 39 thyroid cancer patients treated with 131I. In addition, a crosssectional study was also carried out with 78 control persons and 51 thyroid cancer patients that had completed radioiodine therapy from 1 to 6 years prior to the current investigation. In the follow-up analysis, the study was conducted over time and four blood samples were drawn from each patient: the first one prior to the radioiodine treatment, with the remaining three taken sequentially over the year after therapy. Concerning the results obtained for the whole population in the follow-up study, the SCE and HFC values found after radioiodine therapy did not show any significant increase, neither in the hyperthyroidism nor thyroid cancer groups. Unlike the results mentioned above, when the effect of smoking habit was considered, there was a slight but significant increase in SCE in the samples taken 3 months and 1 week after 131I therapy in the hyperthyroidism and thyroid cancer non-smokers, respectively. The data obtained in the cross-sectional study did not show differences in SCE and HFC between the control group and the cancer group treated with 131I. It is noteworthy that among the different parameters analysed, smoking habit is the only factor that showed a direct relationship with SCE and HFC and, as a consequence, smokers had significantly more SCE and HFC than nonsmokers. Taking into account our previous investigations showing a highly significant increase in the frequency of micronuclei for the same patients and sampling times, the outcomes obtained would suggest that the eventual genotoxic effect of 131I therapy could not be dearly detected by the SCE assay. This would reinforce the view that ionizing radiation appears to be a poor inducer of SCEs.",Excluded
2895,"Do radiation-induced bystander effects correlate to the intrinsic radiosensitivity of individuals and have clinical significance? It is well known that patients can vary in their normal tissue response to radiotherapy, and this can be problematic. As a result, radiobiologists have been using in vitro models to assess variation in response and elucidate the genetic determinants of this variation. However, the clinical relevance of these models is currently unknown. In this study, blood samples from healthy controls (n 20) and colorectal carcinoma patients (n 60) were cultured in vitro to assess two radiobiological end points in parallel: intrinsic radiosensitivity assayed by chromosomal aberrations (G2 scores) and radiation-induced bystander effects assayed by viability testing. Increased intrinsic radiosensitivity was observed in colorectal carcinoma donors (55) compared to the healthy donors (5) (P < 0.005). Similarly, more pronounced radiation-induced bystander effects were observed in the colorectal carcinoma donors compared to the healthy donors after 24 h exposure but not after 96 h exposure to donor irradiated cell conditioned medium (ICCM) (P < 0.05). All scores were tested for correlation with the age, sex and clinical stage of the colorectal carcinoma patients. The only statistically significant correlation was found in samples from severe Dukes D patients (P < 0.005), which had low/radioresistant G2 scores. No correlation was found between radiation-induced intrinsic sensitivity and bystander effects, which suggests that they may have separate underlying molecular mechanisms, but they both show clinical relevance in individual patient samples. © 2009 The Radiation Research Society.",Included
3234,"Safety and Feasibility of Performing Fenestrated Endovascular Abdominal Aneurysm Repair Using a Portable C-arm Without Fusion Technology: A Single-Center Experience Objective Most centers performing fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (F-EVAR) use hybrid rooms with fusion technology for mapping. We present our experience of successfully performing F-EVAR using C-arm without fusion technology. Methods During the period of January 2016 to October 2018, data were collected from a prospectively maintained F-EVAR database at our tertiary care institute. The primary endpoint was technical success, and the secondary outcomes measured were short- and midterm clinical success (both defined by the Society for Vascular Surgery reporting standards), blood loss, radiation dose, operative time, postoperative endoleaks, aneurysm rupture, endograft patency, and complications. Results We performed 11 F-EVARs during the study period in five (45.5%) males and six (54.5%) females, with a mean age of 75+8 years. All procedures were performed under general anesthesia using OEC 9900 Elite Mobile C-arm (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) without the use of fusion technology. Three patients had planned preoperative open procedures for access due to prior cutdown or bypass. Technical success was achieved in all 11 (100%) cases. The mean length of stay was 5+2 days, and the mean follow-up was 7.5+6.5 months. The mean procedure time was 301+167 minutes, and the mean blood loss was 361+233 mL. Mean fluoroscopy time was 72+31 minutes, and the mean radiation exposure time was 2,160+930 mGy. No patients required intraoperative transfusion. Thirty-day (short term) clinical success was achieved in 10 (90.0%), cases whereas six-month (midterm) clinical success was achieved in 7 (77.7%) patients. Branch vessel patency was 11 (100%) at 30 days and 9 (81.8%) at six months, and primary endograft patency was 100% (11) at six months. We had no perioperative mortality or major adverse cardiac event at 30 days. Thirty-day postoperative morbidity included readmission for pulmonary edema from cardiac failure in one patient. Two patients had clinically insignificant silent cardiac enzyme elevation. Three patients had re-interventions performed during the mean follow-up period. Two patients developed renal stent thrombosis resulting in renal insufficiency, which is defined as an increase in creatinine concentration >=0.5 mg/dL, without the need for dialysis. One type II endoleak was identified postoperatively that required trans-lumbar embolization. No type I or III endoleaks were identified during the study period. Asymptomatic common femoral artery thrombosis was seen on follow-up imaging in one patient. Conclusions We conclude that F-EVAR can be safely performed using C-arm without the use of fusion technology. Its utility can be expanded to centers with appropriate skill set but no hybrid technology. Copyright © 2020, Juneja et al.",Excluded
3181,"Radiosurgery Ablation of Medial Branch Nerves of the Lumbar Spine for Facetogenic Back Pain: A Dosimetric Evaluation of Targeting and Safety Purpose/Objective(s): Low back pain is a common problem across the population and is often multifactorial in etiology. Pain may originate from the facet in 15-40% of cases. Invasive nerve ablation techniques with interventional radiology (IR) targeting the medial branches of the primary dorsal ramus can be effective tools for pain alleviation, though the response may not be durable. Ablative therapies such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and stereotactic ablative radiosurgery (SABR) can be used for nerve ablation in settings such as trigeminal neuralgia. Robotic arm radiosurgery facet rhizotomy has been tested in a pilot series of patients with safe results. We hypothesize that LINAC-based SABR may be a non-invasive option for delivering ablative radiation dose to the medial branch nerves of the lumbar spine, with the goal of prolonged pain control while maintaining low doses to surrounding organs at risk (OARs). Materials/Methods: Anonymized CT images of the lumbosacral spine were obtained from 5 patients immobilized and scanned at our facility with 1.25mm slice thickness and treated for issues unrelated to back pain. With the assistance of an interventional radiologist who regularly performs medial branch nerve blocks and RFA, the branch nerves were contoured for the L2 and L3 levels bilaterally. Four non-coplanar dynamic conformal arcs were used to target the nerves, with both nerves as PTV. We attempted to spare the motor nerve roots and other OARs. In addition, we ran an eight-beam IMRT comparison plan targeting the L2 to L3 facet with a 1mm expansion as PTV. Single fraction SABR was planned with 50Gy dose to the isocenter for each treatment plan. The PTV dose coverage and dose to the OARs were tabulated and compared. Result(s): The following table shows the relevant treatment volumes and OAR doses. We avoided excessive doses to the surrounding structures in the plans for all 5 patients bilaterally. Coverage was acceptable with an average of 45 Gy covering the 90% IDL. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates the feasibility of delivering ablative doses of SABR to the medial branch nerves of the lumbar spine below the level of the cord. OARs received acceptable doses, with lower values obtained from the plans with targeted radiation to the nerves when compared with plans involving radiation to the entire facet. PTV coverage was not compromised. Though efficacy would require in vivo testing, with accurate targeting and the assistance of IR in selecting appropriate patients, SABR may provide a noninvasive, reasonable, and effective treatment option for facetogenic low back pain.

3444,"Image quality and radiation dose of dual-energy CT of the head and neck compared with a standard 120-kVp acquisition BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: DECT offers additional image datasets with potential benefits, but its use for H&N imaging is not justified unless image quality is preserved without increased radiation dose. The aim of this work was to compare image quality and radiation dose between a DE-derived WA image dataset and a standard SECT acquisition of the H&N. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two patients underwent DECT of the H&N (tube voltages 80 and Sn140 kVp) and were compared with the last 32 patients who underwent standard SECT (120 kVp) on the same dual-source scanner. WA images from the 2 DE tubes were compared with images obtained with an SE mode. Radiation doses and attenuation measurements of the internal jugular vein, submandibular gland, and sternomastoid and tongue muscles were compared. Objective image noise was compared at 5 anatomic levels. Two blinded readers compared subjective image quality by using 5-point grading scales. RESULT(S): CTDIvol was 12% lower with DE than with SECT, a difference of 1.5 mGy, (P < .0001). Objective noise was not significantly different between DE and SECT at any of the anatomic levels (P > .05). No significant differences in attenuation measurements were observed between DE and SECT (P > .05). No significant differences in subjective image quality scores were observed between DE and SECT at any of the 5 anatomic levels (P > .05). CONCLUSION(S): DE-derived WA images of the H&N are equivalent to standard SE acquisitions and thus can be used for routine diagnostic purposes. Multiple additional image datasets can be obtained with no radiation dose penalty.",Excluded
3146,"Long-term outcomes of fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for intracranial skull base benign meningiomas in single institution Objective: To investigate the outcome of linac-based fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy over the last 10 years for intracranial skull base benign meningiomas in patients who were inoperable, who had residual tumors with some components of high mitotic index after surgery and who experienced relapse of the tumor. Method(s): Twenty-seven patients with intracranial skull base benign meningiomas treated with fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy were retrospectively reviewed. Twenty-seven cases were diagnosed as benign meningiomas on pathological (17 cases) or radiological (10 cases) examination. The median follow-up time was 90 months after initial treatment and 63 months after fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy. The median biological equivalent dose calculated using an alpha/beta ratio of 2.0 Gy was 82.0 Gy (range, 60-106 Gy). Result(s): The 5-year overall survival was 95.7 (95% confidence interval: 87.3-100)% after initial treatment and 96.2 (88.8-100)% after fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy. The 5-year overall survival and local control rate of patients who received4/8/2011 fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy alone were both 100%. The 5-year progression-free survival and local control rate after fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy were all 100% with a tumor volume of <9.1 cc and 68.2 (37.2-99.2) and 75.8 (45.2-100)% for the tumors 9.1 cc, respectively. The difference was significant in progression-free survival (P = 0.022) and local control rate (P = 0.044). The local control rate was significantly worse in patients who received fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for relapsed tumors (P = 0.01). No late radiation damage was observed in the follow-up period. Conclusion(s): The long-term outcome suggests that fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy is a safe and effective treatment for intracranial skull base benign meningioma, especially for those who have tumors <9.1 cc or would receive fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy with or without surgery as the initial treatment. © The Author (2010).

3655,"Cerebrospinal fluid dissemination of high-grade gliomas following boron neutron capture therapy occurs more frequently in the small cell subtype of IDH1R132H mutation-negative glioblastoma We have used boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) to treat patients in Japan with newly diagnosed or recurrent high-grade gliomas and have observed a significant increase in median survival time following BNCT. Although cerebrospinal fluid dissemination (CSFD) is not usually seen with the current standard therapy of patients with glioblastoma (GBM), here we report that subarachnoid or intraventricular CSFD was the most frequent cause of death for a cohort of our patients with high-grade gliomas who had been treated with BNCT. The study population consisted of 87 patients with supratentorial high-grade gliomas; 41 had newly diagnosed tumors and 46 had recurrent tumors. Thirty of 87 patients who were treated between January 2002 and July 2013 developed CSFD. Tumor histology before BNCT and immunohistochemical staining for two molecular markers, Ki-67 and IDH1R132H, were evaluated for 20 of the 30 patients for whom pathology slides were available. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed on 3 IDH1R132H-positive and 1 control IDH1R132H-negative tumors in order to determine chromosome 1p and 19q status. Histopathologic evaluation revealed that 10 of the 20 patients' tumors were IDH1R132H-negative small cell GBMs. The remaining patients had tumors consisting of other IDH1R132H-negative GBM variants, an IDH1R132H-positive GBM and two anaplastic oligodendrogliomas. Ki-67 immunopositivity ranged from 2 to 75%. In summary, IDH1R132H-negative GBMs, especially small cell GBMs, accounted for a disproportionately large number of patients who had CSF dissemination. This suggests that these tumor types had an increased propensity to disseminate via the CSF following BNCT and that these patients are at high risk for this clinically serious event.Copyright © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Excluded

Patients with NSCLC treated with induction CCRT (chemotherapy: cisplatin and docetaxel; radiotherapy: 2.0 Gy fractions once daily for a total of 46 Gy) before surgery were reviewed. We calculated the percentage of lung volume receiving at least 20 Gy (V20) and the mean lung dose (MLD) for the total lung volume and the lung remaining after resection. Factors affecting the incidence of RP at grade 2 or higher (>= G2 RP) were analyzed. Eighteen of 49 patients (37%) experienced >=G2 RP. The V20 and MLD for the lung remaining after resection (V20r and MLDr) were significant predictors according to the multivariate analysis (p=0.007 and 0.041, respectively). The incidence of >=G2 RP was 8% in patients with V20r<10%, and 13% in patients with MLDr<5.6 Gy, respectively. The optimal approach to reduce the rate of postoperative RP in patients with induction CCRT for NSCLC is to keep the V20r below 10% and/or the MLDr below 5.6 Gy in the radiotherapy planning.",Excluded

This study was performed to evaluate its efficacy and safety., METHODOLOGY: Thirteen patients with 17 nodules of unresectable HCC were subjected to PMCT under ultrasonic guidance. The tumors ranged from 1.2-4.4 cm in size. Assessment of the efficacy of PMCT was made by follow-up with dynamic computed tomography (CT)., RESULTS: In the patients with small HCC ( or = 2.1 cm), 5 out of 7 nodules developed local recurrence after PMCT. Regarding assessment of the necrotic area after PMCT, dynamic CT revealed enhancement that was possibly caused by congestion of the liver parenchyma surrounding the area of necrosis due to PMCT in the early phase of the treatment. Therefore, the necrotic area must be assessed carefully. Although a slight heat sensation and/or pain during microwave irradiation (a common effect of PMCT) occurred in all patients, there were no serious adverse effects., CONCLUSIONS: Complete remission of small HCC ( or = 2.1 cm). There were no serious adverse effects from PMCT and the therapy can be safely carried out even in patients with poor liver function.",Excluded
2532,"The benefits of psychosocial interventions for cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy Background: Many patients with cancer experience depression and anxiety, and an associated decrease in quality of life (QOL) during radiation therapy (RT). The main objective of the study was to determine the benefits of psychosocial interventions for cancer patients who received RT. Method(s): Patients with cancer (n = 178) who agreed to participate in the study were randomized to the intervention arm (n = 89) or the control arm (n = 89). Patients in the intervention group received psychosocial care during RT, whereas the control group received RT only. The benefits of the intervention were evaluated using the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) to measure depression, the Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) to assess anxiety, and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) to survey health-related QOL. The association between intervention and survival was also assessed. Result(s): Patients randomly assigned to the intervention arm showed significant improvements on symptoms of depression (p < 0.05) and anxiety (p < 0.05), health-related QOL (p < 0.05) (i.e. better global health status, and physical and emotional functioning, and less insomnia) when compared with controls. In the subset analysis, female patients, those that received high dose irradiation, and those that underwent adjuvant chemotherapy could benefit more from psychosocial intervention. There was no difference between the two groups in disease-free survival (DFS) (2-year DFS 79.8% in the intervention arm and 76.4% in the control arm; p = 0.527) and overall survival (OS) (2-year OS 83.1% in the intervention arm and 84.3% in the control arm; p = 0.925). Conclusion(s): Psychosocial intervention is a cost-effective approach that can improve a patient's mood and QOL both during and after RT. However, the intervention was not found to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence and death. © 2013 Guo et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded

2802,"Mechanism of low-level microwave radiation effect on nervous system The aim of this study is to explain the mechanism of the effect of low-level modulated microwave radiation on brain bioelectrical oscillations. The proposed model of excitation by low-level microwave radiation bases on the influence of water polarization on hydrogen bonding forces between water molecules, caused by this the enhancement of diffusion and consequences on neurotransmitters transit time and neuron resting potential. Modulated microwave radiation causes periodic alteration of the neurophysiologic parameters and parametric excitation of brain bioelectric oscillations. The experiments to detect logical outcome of the mechanism on physiological level were carried out on 15 human volunteers. The 450-MHz microwave radiation modulated at 7, 40 and 1000 Hz frequencies was applied at the field power density of 0.16 mW/cm2. A relative change in the EEG power with and without radiation during 10 cycles was used as a quantitative measure. Experimental data demonstrated that modulated at 40 Hz microwave radiation enhanced EEG power in EEG alpha and beta frequency bands. No significant alterations were detected at 7 and 1000 Hz modulation frequencies. These results are in good agreement with the theory of parametric excitation of the brain bioelectric oscillations caused by the periodic alteration of neurophysiologic parameters and support the proposed mechanism. The proposed theoretical framework has been shown to predict the results of experimental study. The suggested mechanism, free of the restrictions related to field strength or time constant, is the first one providing explanation of low-level microwave radiation effects.",Excluded
3510,"The influence of low-level laser therapy on biomodulation of collagen and elastic fibers The study of low-level laser therapy upon extracellular matrix elements is important to understand the wound healing process under this agent. However, little is known about the interference of laser light in relation to collagen and elastic fibers. Cutaneous wounds were performed on the back of 72 Wistar rats and a Ga-Al-As low-level laser was punctually applied with different energy densities. The animals were killed after 24, 48, 72 hours and 5, 7 and 14 days. Tissues were stained with hematoxilin-eosin, sirius red fast green and orcein and then analyzed. It was observed that the treated group exhibited larger reduction of edema and inflammatory infiltrate. The treated animals presented a larger expression of collagen and elastic fibers, although without statistical significance (p > 0.05). Treatment with a dosage of 4 J/cm(2) exhibited more expressive results than that with 8 J/cm(2). In this study, the authors concluded that low-level laser therapy contributed to a larger expression of collagen and elastic fibers during the early phases of the wound healing process.",Excluded
3633,"Outcome analysis of adjuvant chemoradiation after incomplete resection for pancreatic adenocarcinoma Purpose/Objective(s): To analyze the outcome of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma who underwent incomplete resection, and to identify the prognostic factors for these patients. Materials/Methods: Data from 41 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma who underwent R1 or R2 resection followed by adjuvant chemoradiotherapy from January 1987 to March 2010 was collected. There were 27 men and 14 women, and the median age was 60 years (range, 40-84). The adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) was delivered to the tumor bed and regional lymph nodes. Radiation dose was less than 50 Gy for 22 patients and at least 50 Gy for 19 patients. The chemotherapy during radiotherapy was either 5-fluorouracil (n = 37) or capecitabine (n = 4). The median follow-up duration was 15.8 months (range 4.5 -53.4). Result(s): The median survival was 13.2 months and the 2-year overall survival (OS) was 17% ; the median time to failure was 7.5 months and 2-year progression free survival (PFS) rate was 9% ; the median time to distant metastasis was 9.2 months and the 2- year distant metastasis free survival (DMFS) rate was 27% ; the median time to locoregional failure was 10.8 months and the locoregional failure free survival (LRFFS) rate was 16%. On univariate analysis, nodal involvement (p = 0.046), post-operative CA 19-9 (<=37 U/mL vs>37 U/mL,p=0.027) and post-RT CA 19-9 (<=37 U/mL vs.37 U/mL, p<0.001) were associated with OS. Nodal involvement (p = 0.053 for PFS, p = 0.029 for LRFFS), initial CA 19-9 (<=1000 U/mL vs .1000 U/mL, p = 0.029 for PFS,p=0.003 for LRFFS), post-operative CA 19-9 (p=0.03 for PFS,p= 0.035 for LRFFS) and post-RT CA 19-9 (p<0.001 for PFS and LRFFS) were statistically significant prognosticators for PFS and LRFFS. For DMFS, nodal involvement (p=0.054) and post-RT CA 19-9 (p<0.001) were significant prognosticators. On multivariate analysis, only post-RT CA 19-9 showed statistical significance for all outcomes. There was no difference in all outcomes between R1 resection and R2 resection. RT dose was not a significant prognostic factor for all outcomes. However, in a subgroup analysis of 21 patients who had pancreatic head cancer and underwent 3-dimensional conformal RT, lower radiation dose was related with inferior PFS and DMFS (p = 0.085 and p = 0.068, respectively). Conclusion(s): Patients with pancreatic cancer after incomplete resection have poor outcomes even after adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Nodal involvement and CA 19-9 were prognostic factors, whereas increased radiation dose showed marginal significance.",Excluded

3026,"Feasibility of wide detector CT perfusion imaging performed during routine staging and restaging of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility of CT perfusion performed during routine multiphase contrast-enhanced CT on a 160 mm wide-coverage 256-slice scanner in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Method(s): Fifty-seven patients had a CT perfusion acquisition during their routine multiphase CT. Perfusion was performed 5 to 42.5 s (15 passes at 2.5 s intervals) after intravenous contrast administration (4.2-5 ml/s), followed by pancreatic parenchymal and portal venous phases for clinical interpretation. Perfusion maps were generated and blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV), and permeability surface area product (PS) for tumor and uninvolved pancreas were calculated using deconvolution algorithms and compared to existing similar publications. Radiation dose information was recorded and size-specific dose estimate (SSDE) was calculated using body dimensions. Result(s): Diagnostic quality of standard images was unaffected by performing the perfusion acquisition. Average tumor center BF was 20.8 +/- 12.1 ml/100 g/min, BV 2.5 +/- 2.1 ml/100 g and PS 15.5 +/- 39.4 ml/100 g/min. Average pancreas BF was 90.8 +/- 50.2 ml/100 g/min, BV 11.9 +/- 4.3 ml/100 g and PS 33.6 +/- 27.7 ml/100 g/min. For the perfusion acquisition, mean SSDE was 57 +/- 11 mGy, CTDIvol 43 +/- 6 mGy and DLP 685 +/- 100 mGy-cm. Conclusion(s): Adding a perfusion CT acquisition to standard pancreatic CT protocol is feasible using a wide-detector 256-slice CT scanner and adds quantitative information while maintaining diagnostic quality of the standard of care examination. This novel protocol adds no time or cost to the examination and yields perfusion parameters that are comparable to existing literature using a separate dedicated perfusion protocol.

3265,"Self-awareness of computed tomography ordering in the emergency department OBJECTIVES: Physician variation in the use of computed tomography (CT) is concerning due to the risks of ionizing radiation, cost, and downstream effects of unnecessary testing. The objectives of this study were to describe variation in CT-ordering rates among emergency physicians (EPs), to measure correlation between perceived and actual CT-ordering rates, to assess attitudes that influence decisions to order imaging tests, and to identify EP attitudes associated with higher CT utilization., METHODS: This study was a retrospective review of imaging and administrative billing records at two emergency department sites of a tertiary care adult teaching hospital. The study also included a cross-sectional survey of EPs at this hospital. We asked physicians about their perceived ordering behaviour, and what factors influenced their decision to order a CT. We examined correlations between perceived and actual CT-ordering rates. We adjusted ordering rates for shift distribution using a logistic regression model and identified outlier physicians whose ordering rate was significantly lower or higher than expected. We used multivariable regression analysis to determine which survey responses predicted higher CT utilization., RESULTS: During the study period, 59 EPs saw 45,854 patients, and ordered 6,609 CTs - a mean ordering rate of 14.4% (standard deviation (SD)=4.3%). The ordering rate for individual physicians ranged from 5.9% to 25.9%. Of the 59 EPs, 13 EPs were low-ordering outliers; 12 were high-ordering outliers. Forty-five EPs (76.3%) completed the survey. Mean perceived ordering rate was 12.6%, and was weakly correlated with actual ordering (r=0.19, p=0.21). 42 EPs (93.3%) believed they ordered ""about the same"" or ""fewer"" CTs than their peers. Of the 17 EPs in the two highest ordering quintiles, only 3 (18%) knew they were high orderers. In the multivariable analysis, higher ordering was associated with increasing strength of response to the following predictors: medico-legal risk (relative risk [RR]=1.18, 95% CI: 1.03-1.21), risk of contrast (RR=1.14, 95% CI: 1.07-1.22), what colleagues would do (RR=1.09, 95% CI: 0.99-1.19), risk of missing a diagnosis (RR=1.08, 95% CI: 0.98-1.21), and patient wishes (RR=1.07, 95% CI: 0.97-1.17)., CONCLUSIONS: There is large variation in CT ordering among EPs. Physicians' self-reported ordering rate correlates poorly with actual ordering. High CT orderers were rarely aware that they ordered more than their colleagues. Higher rates of ordering were observed among physicians who reported increased concern with 1) risk of missing a diagnosis, 2) medico-legal risk, 3) risk of contrast, 4) patient wishes, and 5) what colleagues would do.",Excluded
3378,"Diagnosis and treatment of lumbosacral plexopathies in patients with cancer Eleven patients were diagnosed as having lumbosacral plexopathy at M. D. Anderson Hospital, Houston, from August 1981 through July 1982. Four causes were documented: plexopathy secondary to metastatic disease (six cases); radiation-induced plexopathy (two cases); plexopathy secondary to intra-arterial chemotherapy (two cases); and plexopathy as the result of a second primary tumor (one case). Patients with plexopathies secondary to tumor or irradiation complained of pain in the ipsilateral lower extremity. Computed tomography of the pelvis was the most accurate method of documenting tumor in the region of the lumbosacral plexus. Radiation therapy records of patients with cervical carcinoma were reviewed with respect to positioning of intracavitary radium, which was thought to be responsible for the development of radiation-induced plexopathies. Radiation therapy and/or systemic chemotherapy provided relief of pain and improvement of neurologic deficits in three patients with metastatic involvement.",Excluded
3426,"Medically inoperable peripheral lung cancer treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the most frequent cause of cancer-related death in North America. There is wide variation between patients who are medically inoperable and those managed surgically. The use of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has narrowed the gap in survival rates between operative and non-operative management for those with early stage disease. This retrospective study reports outcomes for the treatment of peripheral non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) with SBRT from a single community practice., METHODS: Sixty-seven consecutive patients (pts) with inoperable, untreated peripheral lung tumors were treated from 2010 through 2012 and included in this study. Stereotactic targeting was facilitated by either spine or lung-based image guidance, either with or without fiducial marker tracking with a frameless robotic radiosurgery system. Peripheral tumors received a median biological effective dose (BED) of 105.6 Gy10 or in terms of a median physical dose, 48 Gy delivered over 4 daily fractions. Survival was measured using the Kaplan-Meier method to determine rates of local control, progression of disease and overall survival. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to study the effects of tumor size, stage, histology, patient age, tumor location (lobe), tracking method, and BED on the survival distributions., RESULTS: The median follow-up for this cohort was 24.5 months (range: 2.4-50.3) with an overall (OS) 3-year survival of 62.4 % (95 % CI: 74.3-47.3). The median progression-free survival was 28.5 months (95 % CI: 15.8 months to not reached). Local control (LC), defined as a lack of FDG uptake on PET/CT or the absence of tumor growth was achieved in 60 patients (90.9 %) at the time of first follow-up (median 3 months, range: 1-6). Local control at one year for the entire cohort was 81.8 % (95 % CI, 67.3-90.3). The one-year OS probability among those who achieved local control at first follow-up was 86.2 % (95 % CI, 74.3-92.9) but no patients who did not achieve LC at first follow-up survived one year. Of the 60 pts that achieved initial LC, 16 have died. The rates of local control, progression-free survival and overall survival were not statistically different for patients treated using a fiducial target tracking system versus non-invasive guidance. (p = 0.44, p = 0.97 and p = 0.66, respectively). No National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE-4) grade 3 or greater toxicity was observed., CONCLUSION: SBRT is an effective treatment for medically inoperable NSCLC patients with peripherally located tumors. This therapy appears to be well tolerated with low toxicity, and patient outcomes when using non-invasive tumor tracking systems are not inferior to traditional fiducial-based techniques.",Excluded
2862,"Predictors of Radiotherapy Induced Bone Injury (RIBI) after stereotactic lung radiotherapy Background: The purpose of this study was to identify clinical and dosimetric factors associated with radiotherapy induced bone injury (RIBI) following stereotactic lung radiotherapy. Method(s): Inoperable patients with early stage non-small cell lung cancer, treated with SBRT, who received 54 or 60 Gy in 3 fractions, and had a minimum of 6 months follow up were reviewed. Archived treatment plans were retrieved, ribs delineated individually and treatment plans re-computed using heterogeneity correction. Clinical and dosimetric factors were evaluated for their association with rib fracture using logistic regression analysis; a dose-event curve and nomogram were created. Result(s): 46 consecutive patients treated between Oct 2004 and Dec 2008 with median follow-up 25 months (m) (range 6 - 51 m) were eligible. 41 fractured ribs were detected in 17 patients; median time to fracture was 21 m (range 7 - 40 m). The mean maximum point dose in non-fractured ribs (n = 1054) was 10.5 Gy +/- 10.2 Gy, this was higher in fractured ribs (n = 41) 48.5 Gy +/- 24.3 Gy (p < 0.0001). On univariate analysis, age, dose to 0.5 cc of the ribs (D0.5), and the volume of the rib receiving at least 25 Gy (V25), were significantly associated with RIBI. As D0.5 and V25 were cross-correlated (Spearman correlation coefficient: 0.57, p < 0.001), we selected D0.5 as a representative dose parameter. On multivariate analysis, age (odds ratio: 1.121, 95% CI: 1.04 - 1.21, p = 0.003), female gender (odds ratio: 4.43, 95% CI: 1.68 - 11.68, p = 0.003), and rib D0.5 (odds ratio: 1.0009, 95% CI: 1.0007 - 1.001, p < 0.0001) were significantly associated with rib fracture.Using D0.5, a dose-event curve was constructed estimating risk of fracture from dose at the median follow up of 25 months after treatment. In our cohort, a 50% risk of rib fracture was associated with a D0.5 of 60 Gy. Conclusion(s): Dosimetric and clinical factors contribute to risk of RIBI and both should be included when modeling risk of toxicity. A nomogram is presented using D0.5, age, and female gender to estimate risk of RIBI following SBRT. This requires validation. © 2012 Taremi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
3411,"Cerebral embolism in cancer patients Sudden neurological deterioration suggesting embolism in a patient with a history of cancer should alert the physician to the possibility of a non-metastatic, and therefore potentially reversible, cause of cerebral embolism before cerebral metastasis is implicated. During a four year period, we have observed eight cases of acute cerebral embolism among 3000 cancer patients seen in a department of medical oncology. Five patients had features post mortem of non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis, and in one, the diagnosis had been made antemortem, but treatment with heparin did not prevent further emboli. Two patients had radiation related carotid vascular disease, and one patient post lymphangiographic embolism. The literature reporting these uncommon causes of cerebral embolism is reviewed. Post-lymphangiographic embolism carries a uniformly good prognosis. In selected cases of post-irradiation cerebral embolism, surgical intervention may prevent a neurological catastrophe. Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis and mucin embolism are of uncertain aetiology and natural history; long-term survival is uncommon, and treatment does not appear to influence the clinical course or outcome.",Excluded
2537,"Results of phase i study of a multi-modality treatment for newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme using local implantation of concurrent BCNU wafers and permanent I-125 seeds followed by fractionated radiation and temozolomide chemotherapy Previously we demonstrated median survival of 69 weeks after combination therapy of permanent, lowactivity I-125 seeds and BCNU wafers for recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). We designed this prospective phase I trial to assess efficacy of this combination treatment for newly diagnosed GBM. Patients with newly diagnosed GBMs deemed amenable to gross total resection were included. This dose-escalation study of I-125 seeds included three 6-patient cohorts, receiving increasing doses of 3000, 6000, and 9000 cGy, and a maximal number of BCNU wafers placed surgically. Postoperatively patients underwent standard fractionated radiation to 5,940 cGy followed by temozolomide chemotherapy. During enrollment of the first 6-patient cohort, the trial was stopped when 3 of 5 patients developed radiation toxicity. Five patients (median age 55 years, range 46-64 years) completed postoperative radiation; Karnofsky Performance Status ranged from 70 to 90. This lowest-dose cohort received I-125 seeds at 3,000 cGy and maximal BCNU wafer placement, and reached endpoint (median 26 weeks follow-up). Two patients developed local disease progression (median 34.4 weeks). The 3 patients who developed radiation toxicity, which was documented on follow-up MRI and confirmed by MRI spectroscopy (median 20 weeks), underwent treatment with steroids and bevacizumab. Our phase I study was closed during enrollment of the first 6-patient cohort because of the high incidence (60 %) of early radiation toxicity.

Flap necrosis was correlated with body mass index >25 (P = 0.022), with smoking (P = 0.04 9) and with radiation therapy at the recipient site (P = 0.020). The long-term morbidity at the donor-site was low, except for scar appearance (17.24%), thigh contour deformity (58.62%), and hypoesthesia (17.24%). Significant age and gender differences were seen for ranking of scar ugliness, with females (P = 0.0061) and younger patients (age <=55) (P = 0.046) assigned higher values. Significant age differences were seen for ranking of thigh contour deformity, with younger patients assigned higher values (P = 0.0012). In conclusion, patient overweight, smoking, and previous radiation therapy at the recipient site may be the ""potential risk factors"" for flap necrosis. The long-term morbidity at the donor-site was low, which was in agreement with previous reported studies. A larger series would be the subject of a future study.

Methods Physical examinations, laboratory tests, structural neuroimaging studies, and exome sequence analysis were carried out. Results The 3 patients exhibited intellectual disability and progressive intellectual decline accompanied by psychiatric symptoms. Gait difficulty with spasticity and pyramidal weakness appeared at the ages of 20s-30s. Brain MRI revealed TCC with atrophic changes in the frontotemporal lobes, caudate nuclei, and cerebellum. Exome sequence analysis revealed a novel homozygous c.2654C>A (p.

3473,"Glypican-3-mediated inhibition of CD26 by TFPI: a novel mechanism in hematopoietic stem cell homing and maintenance Directional migration determines hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) homing, which depends upon the interaction between the chemokine CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4. CD26 is a widely expressed membrane-bound ectopeptidase that cleaves CXCL12 thereby depleting its chemokine activity. We identified tissue-factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) as a biological inhibitor of CD26 in murine and human HSPCs. We observed low-level TFPI expression in endothelial cells in the bone marrow (BM), which did not increase following radiation injury. Treatment of HSPCs with TFPI in vitro led to enhanced HSPC migration toward CXCL12, as well as homing and engraftment in the BM upon transplantation. We found that Glypican-3 (GPC3), a heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed on murine as well as human HSPCs, mediated this effect. TFPI did not affect CD26 activity, migration, or homing of GPC3(-/-) HSPCs, while it affected GPC1(-/-) HSPCs similar to wild-type HSPCs. Moreover, proliferation of GPC3(-/-) but not GPC1(-/-) BM HSPCs was significantly increased, which was associated with a decrease in the primitive HSC pool in BM and an increase in proportion of the circulating HSPCs in the peripheral blood. Hence, we present a novel role for TFPI and GPC3 in regulating HSC homing as well as retention in the BM.",Excluded

Patients and Methods: A total of 317 consecutive and nonselected patients treated with definitive external-beam radiotherapy between November 1962 and February 1995 participated in this study. The median doses to the nasopharynx and upper neck were 71 Gy (range, 55-86 Gy) and 61 Gy (range, 34-72 Gy), respectively. Conventional fractionation was used in 287 patients (90.5%). Forty-five patients (14.2%) received chemotherapy. Result(s): The median follow-up was 11.4 years (range, 5.1-38.0 years). Ninety-eight patients (30.9%) developed CNP, with a median latent period of 7.6 years (range, 0.3-34 years). Patients had a higher rate of CNP (81 cases, 25.5%) in lower-group cranial nerves compared with upper group (44 cases, 13.9%) (chi2 = 34.444, p < 0.001). Fifty-nine cases experienced CNP in more than one cranial nerve. Twenty-two of 27 cases (68.8%) of intragroup CNP and 11 of 32 cases (40.7%) of intergroup CNP occurred synchronously (chi2 = 4.661, p = 0.031). The cumulative incidences of CNP were 10.4%, 22.4%, 35.5%, and 44.5% at 5, 10, 15, and 20 years, respectively. Multivariate analyses revealed that CNP at diagnosis, chemotherapy, total radiation dose to the nasopharynx, and upper neck fibrosis were independent risk factors for developing radiation-induced CNP. Conclusion(s): Radiation-induced fibrosis may play an important role in radiation-induced CNP. The incidence of CNP after definitive radiotherapy for NPC remains high after long-term follow-up and is dose and fractionation dependent. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
3691,"Radiosurgery with flattening-filter-free techniques in the treatment of brain metastases : Plan comparison and early clinical evaluation BACKGROUND: Radiosurgical treatment of brain metastases is well established in daily clinical routine. Utilization of flattening-filter-free beams (FFF) may allow for more rapid delivery of treatment doses and improve clinical comfort. Hence, we compared plan quality and efficiency of radiosurgery in FFF mode to FF techniques., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between November 2014 and June 2015, 21 consecutive patients with 25 brain metastases were treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in FFF mode. Brain metastases received dose-fractionation schedules of 1 x 20 Gy or 1 x 18 Gy, delivered to the conformally enclosing 80 % isodose. Three patients with critically localized or large (>3 cm) brain metastases were treated with 6 x 5 Gy. Plan quality and efficiency were evaluated by analyzing conformity, dose gradients, dose to healthy brain tissue, treatment delivery time, and number of monitor units. FFF plans were compared to those using the FF method, and early clinical outcome and toxicity were assessed., RESULTS: FFF mode resulted in significant reductions in beam-on time (p < 0.001) and mean brain dose (p = 0.001) relative to FF-mode comparison plans. Furthermore, significant improvements in dose gradients and sharper dose falloffs were found for SRS in FFF mode (-1.1 %, -29.6 %; p <= 0.003), but conformity was slightly superior in SRS in FF mode (-1.3 %; p = 0.001). With a median follow-up time of 5.1 months, 6-month overall survival was 63.3 %. Local control was observed in 24 of 25 brain metastases (96 %)., CONCLUSION: SRS in FFF mode is time efficient and provides similar plan quality with the opportunity of slightly reduced dose exposure to healthy brain tissue when compared to SRS in FF mode. Clinical outcomes appear promising and show only modest treatment-related toxicity.",Excluded

Emphysema was estimated by using the MR imaging apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and the relative area of the CT attenuation histogram with attenuation of 2950 HU or less (RA950). Airway disease was measured by using the CT airway wall thickness of airways with an internal perimeter of 10 mm and total airway count. Ventilation defect percentage at 3He MR imaging was used to measure ventilation. Multivariable regression models for the 6MWD and SGRQ symptom subscore were used to evaluate the relationships between physiologic and imaging measurements. Result(s): Multivariate modeling for the 6MWD in 80 patients with GOLD grade U-II COPD showed that ADC (b = 0.34, P = .04), diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (b = 0.60, P = .0008), and residual volume/total lung capacity (b = 20.26, P = .02) were significant variables, while forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and airway disease measurements were not. In 36 patients with GOLD grade III or IV disease, FEV1 (b = 0.48, P = .01) was the only significant contributor in a multivariate model for 6MWD. MR imaging emphysema measurements also made the greatest relative contribution to symptoms in patients with milder (GOLD grade U-II) COPD (ADC: b = 0.60, P = .005; RA950: b = 20.52, P = .02; FEV1: b = 20.45, P = .0002) and in grade III or IV disease (ADC: b = 0.95, P = .01; RA950: b = 20.62, P = .07; airway count: b = 20.49, P = .01). Conclusion(s): In patients with mild-to-moderate COPD, MR imaging emphysema measurements played a dominant role in the expression of exercise limitation, while both CT and MR imaging measurements of emphysema explained symptoms.Copyright © RSNA, 2015.",Excluded
3251,"Narrow-band ultraviolet B radiation induces the expression of beta-endorphin in human skin in vivo BACKGROUND: Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) from the sun and solaria has addictive properties that may develop into dependence. In mice, UVR addiction was connected to beta-endorphin (beta-END) formed in the skin after UVR exposure. In humans, the formation of beta-END in skin keratinocytes has not been confirmed in vivo., OBJECTIVE: To determine with immunohistochemistry if sub-erythematous narrow-band UV-B (NB-UV-B) exposures stimulate p53 mediated expression of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), beta-END and alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) in human skin keratinocytes in vivo., METHODS: Within 12 healthy volunteers, 7 received a single 1 standard erythema dose (SED) of NB-UV-B on their whole body, and 5 volunteers received a cumulative dose of 3 SED delivered on two subsequent days i.e., 1+2 SED. Skin biopsies were taken immediately before the first exposure and at 24h from the last UV-B exposure to assess p53, beta-END, POMC, and alpha-MSH expression., RESULTS: Nuclear p53 expression increased in all samples taken at 24h after NB-UV-B exposure. UV-B irradiation also increased epidermal beta-END expression in 11 out of 12 samples taken at 24h after UV-B exposure. The brownish staining was localized in the cytoplasm of keratinocytes and around the nuclei, being more pronounced in the basal cell layers. POMC and alpha-MSH staining showed no obvious meaningful increase since only one section of each showed any change compared with basal levels., CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to show that UV-B exposures increase beta-END expression in epidermal keratinocytes of human skin in vivo, which could be the link to proposed UVR addiction.

2550,"Outcomes of stereotactic radiosurgery for foramen magnum meningiomas: an international multicenter study OBJECTIVE Meningiomas are the most common benign extramedullary lesions of the foramen magnum; however, their optimal management remains undefined. Given their location, foramen magnum meningiomas (FMMs) can cause significant morbidity, and complete microsurgical removal can be challenging. Anterior and anterolateral FMMs carry greater risks with surgery, but they comprise the majority of these lesions. As an alternative to resection, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has been used to treat FMMs in small case series. To more clearly define the outcomes of SRS and to delineate a rational management paradigm for these lesions, the authors analyzed the safety and efficacy of SRS for FMM in an international multicenter trial. METHODS Seven medical centers participating in the International Gamma Knife Research Foundation (IGKRF) provided data for this retrospective cohort study. Patients who were treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery and whose clinical and radiological follow-up was longer than 6 months were eligible for study inclusion. Data from pre- and post-SRS radiological and clinical evaluations were analyzed. Stereotactic radiosurgery treatment variables were recorded. RESULTS Fifty-seven patients (39 females and 18 males, with a median age of 64 years) met the study inclusion criteria. Thirty-two percent had undergone prior microsurgical resection. Patients most frequently presented with cranial neuropathy (39%), headache (35%), numbness (32%), and ataxia (30%). Median pre-SRS tumor volume was 2.9 cm3. Median SRS margin dose was 12.5 Gy (range 10-16 Gy). At the last follow-up after SRS, 49% of tumors were stable, 44% had regressed, and 7% had progressed. Progression-free survival rates at 5 and 10 years were each 92%. A greater margin dose was associated with a significantly increased likelihood of tumor regression, with 53% of tumors treated with > 12 Gy regressing. Fifty-two percent of symptomatic patients noted some clinical improvement. Adverse radiation effects were limited to hearing loss and numbness in 1 patient (2%). CONCLUSIONS Stereotactic radiosurgery for FMM frequently results in tumor control or tumor regression, as well as symptom improvement. Margin doses > 12 Gy were associated with increased rates of tumor regression. Stereotactic radiosurgery was generally safe and well tolerated. Given its risk-benefit profile, SRS may be particularly useful in the management of small- to moderate-volume anterior and anterolateral FMMs.",Excluded
2581,"Clinical experience with a 3D surface patient setup system for alignment of partial-breast irradiation patients Purpose: To assess the utility of surface imaging on patient setup for accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI). Methods and Material: A photogrammetry system was used in parallel to APBI setup by laser and portal imaging. Surface data were acquired after laser and port-film setup for 9 patients. Surfaces were analyzed in comparison to a reference surface from the first treatment session by use of rigid transformations. The surface model after laser setup was used in a simulated photogrammetry setup procedure. In addition, breathing data were acquired by surface acquisition at a frame rate of 7 Hz. Result(s): Mean 3D displacement was 7.3 mm (SD, 4.4 mm) and 7.6 mm (SD, 4.2 mm) for laser and port film, respectively. Simulated setup with the photogrammetry system yielded mean displacement of 1 mm (SD, 1.2 mm). Distance analysis resulted in mean distances of 3.7 mm (SD, 4.9 mm), 4.3 mm (SD, 5.6 mm), and 1.6 mm (SD, 2.4 mm) for laser, port film, and photogrammetry, respectively. Breathing motion at isocenter was smaller than 3.7 mm, with a mean of 1.9 mm (SD, 1.1 mm). Conclusion(s): Surface imaging for PBI setup appears promising. Alignment of the 3D breast surface achieved by stereo-photogrammetry shows greater breast topology congruence than when patients are set up by laser or portal imaging. A correlation of breast surface and CTV must be quantitatively established. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
2872,"CT Angiography in the Lower Extremity Peripheral Artery Disease Feasibility of an Ultra-Low Volume Contrast Media Protocol Purpose: The ALARA principle is not only relevant for effective dose (ED) reduction, but also applicable for contrast media (CM) management. Therefore, the aim was to evaluate the feasibility of an ultra-low CM protocol in the assessment of peripheral artery disease (PAD). Material(s) and Method(s): Fifty PAD patients were scanned on third-generation dual-source computed tomography, from diaphragm to the forefoot, as follows: tube voltage: 70 kV, reference effective tube current: 90 mAs, collimation: 192 x 2 x 0.6 mm, with individualized acquisition timing. The protocol ED (mSv) was quantified with dedicated software. CM protocol consisted of 15 ml test bolus and 30 ml main bolus (300 mgI/ml) injected at 5 ml/s, followed by a 40 ml saline chaser at the same flow rate. Aorto-popliteal bolus transit time was used to calculate the overall acquisition time and delay. Objective (hounsfield units-HU; contrast-to-noise ratio-CNR) and subjective image quality (four-point Likert score) were assessed at different anatomical regions from the aorta down to the forefoot. Result(s): Mean attenuation values were exceeding 250 HU from aorta down to the anterior tibial artery with CNR < 13. However, decline in attenuation was observed in more distal region with mean values of 165 and 199 HU, in left and right dorsalis pedis artery, respectively. Mode subjective image quality from the level of aorta down to the popliteal segment was excellent; below the knee mode score was good. The mean ED per protocol was 1.1 +/- 0.5 mSv. Conclusion(s): Use of an ultra-low CM volume protocol at 70 kV is feasible in the evaluation of PAD, resulting in good to excellent image quality with mean ED of 1.1 +/- 0.5 mSv.

3344,"Irradiation-resistance conferred by superoxide dismutase: possible adaptive role of a natural polymorphism in Drosophila melanogaster The toxic effects of ionizing radiation to DNA are thought to be due to the generation of the superoxide radical, 02-. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), which scavenges 02-., has been invoked as a protecting enzyme against ionizing radiation in viruses, bacteria, mammalian cells in culture, and live mice. We now demonstrate that SOD is involved in the resistance of Drosophila melanogaster against irradiation. The protection is greatest when flies carry the S form of the enzyme (which exhibits highest in vitro specific activity), intermediate when they carry the F form of the enzyme, and lowest when they are homozygous for N, an allele that reduces the amount of the enzyme to 3.5% of the normal level. Natural selection experiments show that the fitness of the high-activity S allele is increased in an irradiated population relative to the nonirradiated control. These results point towards a possible adaptive function of the S/F polymorphism found in natural populations of D. melanogaster.",Included
3250,"Assessment of intraocular foreign bodies by helical-CT multiplanar imaging The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of helical CT in the assessment of intraocular foreign bodies, evaluating two protocols with different collimation. We performed helical-CT studies in 30 patients. Fifteen patients were examined with 1.5-mm collimation and the other 15 patients with 3.0-mm collimation. All other imaging parameters were identical in both protocols. Multiplanar images were reconstructed. The examinations were reviewed for presence, localization and size of intraocular foreign bodies. We compare our results with the surgical data. We estimate the required examination time. In the first group (collimation 1.5 mm) an intraorbital foreign body was detected in 8 of 15 patients. In 3 of 8 patients an intraocular foreign body (all were metallic) was detected. In the second group (collimation 3.0 mm) an intraorbital foreign body was detected in 9 of 15 patients. In 8 of 9 patients an intraocular foreign body (all were metallic) was detected. Our results were confirmed by surgery in all cases. Examination time was 36 s in the first group and 18 s in the second group. Computed tomography should be considered the imaging modality of choice in the assessment of metallic intraocular foreign bodies and 3.0-mm collimation is optional, because of reduced examination time and radiation exposure.",Excluded

Although the usage of smart devices was progressively increased in developing technologies, more awareness and knowledge is essential among people. The aim of the present study was to study the knowledge and awareness of visual fatigue due to usage of high resolution display technologies like retina display and OLED display. A Questionnaire consisting of 13 questions were framed regarding the usage of retina display and oled display online using google forms. The link was sent to 75 subjects who are using devices with retina display and oled display. The questions were carefully studied and corresponding answers were marked by 135 subjects in the age group of 17-45 years and the results were analyzed using SPSS software. Descriptive statistics were done which were represented in the pie chart. Correlation was done by chi-square test and represented as a bar graph. The level of knowledge and awareness of visual fatigue on usage of retina display and OLED display was generally low which was analysed from the survey.64.71% of participants reported that the major cause of visual fatigue was prolonged use of gadgets and 57.35% of participants reported that OLED displays cause visual fatigue more than retina display. Majority of participants reported red light causes eye damage which shows lack of awareness among participants. Although the usage of smart devices was progressively increased in developing technologies, more awareness and knowledge is essential among people. This study concluded that usage of both retina display and OLED display cause visual fatigue but comparatively former retina display reported less occurrence of visual fatigue.Copyright © 2020, Advanced Scientific Research.

3522,"Comparison of outcomes after atlantoaxial fusion with transarticular screws and screw-rod constructs Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare the radiological and neurological outcomes between two atlantoaxial fusion method for atlantoaxial stabilization; C1 lateral mass-C2 pedicle screws (screw-rod constructs, SRC) versus C1-2 transarticular screws (TAS). Method(s): Forty-one patients in whom atlantoaxial instability was treated with atlantoaxial fixation by SRC group (27 patients, from March 2005 to May 2011) or TAS group (14 patients, from May 2000 to December 2005) were retrospectively reviewed. Numeric rating scale (NRS) for pain assessment, Oswestry disability index (ODI), and Frankel grade were also checked for neurological outcome. In radiologic outcome assessment, proper screw position and fusion rate were checked. Perioperative parameters such as blood loss during operation, operation time, and radiation exposure time were also reviewed. Result(s): The improvement of NRS and ODI were not different between both groups significantly. Good to excellent response in Frankel grade is shown similarly in both groups. Proper screw position and fusion rate were also observed similarly between two groups. Total bleeding amount during operation is lesser in SRC group than TAS group, but not significantly (p=0.06). Operation time and X-ray exposure time were shorter in SRC group than in TAS group (all p<0.001). Conclusion(s): Both TAS and SRC could be selected as safe and effective treatment options for C1-2 instability. But the perioperative result, which is technical demanding and X-ray exposure might be expected better in SRC group compared to TAS group.Copyright © 2014 The Korean Neurosurgical Society.",Excluded
3405,"The predictive role of abdominal fat parameters and stone density on swl outcomes Background: Our aim was to detect the role of radiological abdominal fat parameters by tomography and stone density by plain X-ray on extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy (SWL) stone-free rate. Method(s): The patients who had undergone SWL for a single opaque renal stone < 2 cm in diameter and proximal ureteric stone < 1 cm in diameter were collected retrospectively. The characteristics of patients and stones were recorded. The stone attitude, HU, abdominal fat parameters, para-perirenal fat area, perirenal infiltration and severity of hydronephrosis with pre-treatment NonContrast Computed Tomography (NCCT) and stone density with radiography were evaluated by a radiologist. Four weeks after the last SWL; all patients were evaluated by plain X-ray and categorized as Stone Free (SF) and Residual Fragment (RF) group. Result(s): 51 patients with renal stones and 88 patients with proximal ureteral stones were included in the study. 24 (47%) and 63 (71%) patients were classified as SFfor renal and ureteral stones respectively. Only stone size was an independent predictor for stone-free rates after SWL for renal and proximal ureteral stones on multivariate analysis. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves for renal calculi revealed that creatinine level, stone size, stone attitude, Houns-Field Unit (HU) and Skin-to-Stone Distance (SSD) were the predictive factors for the SWL outcome (p< 0.05). The ROC curve for ureteral calculi demonstrated that HU, stone size and attitude were the predictive factors (p< 0.05). Conclusion(s): All abdominal fat parameters and the stone density were not related to SWL failure.

Patients and Methods: Eighty consecutive patients with 326 melanoma brain metastases receiving SRS in combination with ipilimumab or nivolumab were identified from an institutional database and retrospectively evaluated. Patients started systemic treatment with intravenous nivolumab or ipilimumab within one week of receiving SRS. Nivolumab was given at doses of 3 mg/kg every two weeks. Ipilimumab was administered up to four doses of 10 mg/kg, one every 3 weeks, then patients had a maintenance dose of 10 mg/kg every 12 weeks, until disease progression or inacceptable toxicity. Primary endpoint of the study was intracranial progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints were extracranial PFS, overall survival (OS), and neurological toxicity. Result(s): Eighty patients were analyzed. Forty-five patients received SRS and ipilimumab, and 35 patients received SRS and nivolumab. With a median follow-up of 15 months, the 6-month and 12-month intracranial PFS rates were 69% (95%CI,54-87%) and 42% (95%CI,24-65%) for patients receiving SRS and nivolumab and 48% (95%CI,34-64%) and 17% (95%CI,5-31%) for those treated with SRS and ipilimumab (p = 0.02), respectively. Extracranial PFS and OS were 37 and 78% in SRS and nivolumab group, respectively, and 17 and 68% in SRS and ipilimumab group, respectively, at 12 months. Sub-group analysis showed significantly better intracranial PFS for patients receiving multi-fraction SRS (3 x 9 Gy) compared to single-fraction SRS (70% versus 46% at 6 months, p = 0.01), especially in combination with nivolumab. Grade 3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 11 (24%) patients treated with SRS and ipilimumab and 6 (17%) patients who received SRS and nivolumab. Radiation-induced brain necrosis (RN) occurred in 15% of patients. Conclusion(s): Concurrent SRS and ipilimumab or nivolumab show meaningful intracranial activity in patients with either asymptomatic and symptomatic melanoma brain metastases, although a subset of patients may develop symptomatic RN. The combination of nivolumab with SRS is associated with better intracranial control.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).",Excluded
3575,"Defining Radioiodine-Refractory Differentiated Thyroid Cancer: Efficacy and Safety of Lenvatinib by Radioiodine-Refractory Criteria in the SELECT Trial Background: While there is a clear consensus for defining radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (RR-DTC), it is unknown whether these criteria are equally valid for determining when radioiodine (RAI) therapy is no longer beneficial and systemic treatment should be considered. Lenvatinib, a multikinase inhibitor, significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) compared to placebo in a Phase 3 trial in RR-DTC (SELECT; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.21 [99% confidence interval (CI) 0.14-0.31]; p < 0.001). This sub-analysis compared clinical outcomes of lenvatinib-treated patients in SELECT stratified by RR-DTC inclusion criteria. Method(s): In SELECT, patients with measurable RR-DTC and radiologic evidence of disease progression <=13 months prior to study entry were randomized 2:1 to lenvatinib (24 mg/day; 28-day cycle) or placebo. In this analysis, patients were stratified based on the following RR-DTC inclusion criteria: no RAI uptake, disease progression within 12 months of RAI therapy despite RAI avidity at the time of treatment, and extensive (>600 mCi) cumulative RAI exposure. All had disease progression as an inclusion criterion for SELECT. Result(s): Of 392 patients (261 lenvatinib; 131 placebo) enrolled, 275, 235, and 73 patients met the inclusion criteria for no RAI uptake, disease progression despite RAI avidity, and extensive RAI exposure, respectively. There was significant overlap between the patient groups, with 167 (42.6%) patients meeting more than one inclusion criterion. Lenvatinib improved median PFS compared to placebo in all groups (""no RAI uptake"": lenvatinib not quantifiable [NQ; CI 14.8-NQ] vs. placebo, 3.7 months [CI 2.5-5.3]; ""disease progression despite RAI avidity"": lenvatinib 16.5 months [CI 12.8-NQ] vs. placebo, 3.7 months [CI 1.9-5.4]; ""extensive RAI exposure"": lenvatinib 18.7 months [CI 10.7-NQ] vs. placebo, 3.6 months [CI 1.9-5.5]). Objective response rates were 71.8%, 60.0%, and 56.0% for patients with no RAI uptake, disease progression despite RAI avidity, and extensive RAI exposure, respectively. Lenvatinib-related adverse events were similar across groups. Conclusion(s): Comparable efficacy and safety profiles were observed in lenvatinib-treated patients regardless of RR-DTC criteria, possibly because of a large overlap among patients fulfilling each criterion. However, differing definitions for RR-DTC may be equally valid because both lenvatinib and placebo arms exhibited similar PFS outcomes across groups.© Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Excluded

All patients underwent colonoscopy. Smoking, alcohol drinking, drug exposure, and the Charlson comorbidity index score were assessed before colonoscopy. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) of LGIB were estimated., RESULTS: LGIB was significantly associated with older age, higher comorbidity index, and NSAID, aspirin, clopidogrel, or warfarin use. PPI use was significantly associated with older age, male sex, being a current alcohol drinker, higher comorbidity index, and NSAID, aspirin, clopidogrel, warfarin, acetaminophen, or corticosteroid use. Multivariate analysis adjusted by the confounding factors revealed LGIB was not significantly associated with PPI use (AOR 0.87; 95 % confidence interval 0.68-1.13; p = 0.311), or specifically with omeprazole (AOR 1.18; p = 0.408), esomeprazole (AOR 0.76; p = 0.432), lansoprazole (AOR 0.93; p = 0.669), or rabeprazole (AOR 0.63; p = 0.140).

While MTG16 loss renders mice sensitive to chemicalcolitis, the role of MTG16 in the small intestine is unknown. Histologicalexamination revealed that Mtg16-/- mice have increasedenterocyte proliferation and goblet cell deficiency. After exposure toradiation, Mtg16-/- mice exhibited increased crypt viability anddecreased apoptosis compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Flow cytometricand immunofluorescence analysis of intestinal epithelial cellsfor phospho-histone H2A.X also indicated decreased DNA damageand apoptosis in Mtg16-/- intestines. To determine if Mtg16 deletionaffected epithelial cells in a cell-autonomous fashion, intestinal cryptswere isolated from Mtg16-/- mice. Mtg16-/-and WT intestinalcrypts showed similar enterosphere forming efficiencies when culturedin the presence of EGF, Noggin, and R-spondin. However, whenMtg16-/- crypts were cultured in the presence of Wnt3a, theydemonstrated higher enterosphere forming efficiencies and delayedprogression to mature enteroids. Mtg16-/- intestinal crypts isolatedfrom irradiated mice exhibited increased survival compared with WTintestinal crypts. Interestingly, Mtg16 expression was reduced in astem cell-enriched population at the time of crypt regeneration. Thisis consistent with MTG16 negatively regulating regeneration in vivo.Taken together, our data demonstrate that MTG16 loss promotesradioresistance and impacts intestinal stem cell function, possibly dueto shifting cellular response away from DNA damage-induced apoptosisand towards DNA repair after injury.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.",Included

3110,"Which is the preferred modality of renal access for a trainee urologist: Ultrasonography or fluoroscopy? results of a prospective randomized trial Background and Purpose: In percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), placement of the access tract into the kidney is an important aspect of the procedure and is responsible for the steep learning curve associated with the operation. The aim of the current prospective randomized trial was to assess the duration of radiation exposure along with the safety and efficacy of PCNL done by a trainee, utilizing either ultrasonography (US) or fluoroscopic guidance to obtain access., Patients and Methods: Sixty-four patients with <=3cm renal calculi undergoing single-tract PCNL by trainee urologists (experience of <25 PCNL's) were randomized into US-and fluoroscopic-guided access groups (32 in each). In Group 1 (US guided), puncture was done using a 3.5/5MHz US probe with a puncture attachment, whereas the triangulation technique with biplanar C-arm fluoroscopy was utilized in group 2 (fluoroscopic guided). Patient demographics, stone parameters, intraoperative characteristics, fluoroscopy durations, and postoperative outcomes were analyzed., Results: Both groups were comparable as far as patient and stone characteristics were concerned. The fluoroscopy exposure during the puncture phase (T2) and overall (T) was significantly lower in the US group at 9.0+/-20.8 vs 43.8+/-34.8, (p<0.0001) and 204.3+/-84 vs 239.9+/-77.5, (p=0.04). Six patients in group1 required fluoroscopic adjustment (p=0.03). All other intra-and postoperative parameters were similar in both the groups. Conclusion(s): Both ultrasound and fluoroscopic guidance for renal access are equally safe and feasible in the hands of a trainee urologist. Total fluoroscopy duration and exposure time during puncture were both significantly less in the ultrasound group.

3347,"Effect of intraocular scattering in macular pigment optical density measurements Fundus reflectometry is a common in-vivo, noninvasive method to estimate the macular pigment optical density (MPOD). The measured density, however, can be affected by the individual's intraocular scattering. Scattering causes a reduction in the contrast of the fundus image, which in turn leads to an underestimation of the measured density. Intraocular scattering was measured optically in a group of seven young, healthy subjects using the method of optical integration and was subsequently used to correctly estimate the MPOD from fundus images. It was shown that when scattering is not considered, the measured optical density using fundus reflectometry can be underestimated by as high as 16% for our group of subjects.Copyright (2018) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).",Excluded
3132,"Treatment of metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma with image-guided high-dose rate, interstitial brachytherapy as second-line or salvage therapy PURPOSE We aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of image-guided high-dose rate interstitial brachytherapy (iBT) for the treatment of patients with hepatic, lymphatic, and pancreatic metastases originating from gastric cancer, an entity rarely surgically treatable with curative intent. METHODS Twelve patients with a cumulative number of 36 metastases (29 liver, 2 pancreatic, 5 lymph node) from histologically proven gastric adenocarcinoma received iBT between 2010 and 2016 and were retrospectively analyzed. Every patient underwent palliative chemotherapy prior to iBT. The iBT procedure employs a temporarily, intratumorally placed iridium-192 source in a single fraction with the goal of tumor cell eradication. Effectiveness was assessed clinically and by radiologic imaging every three months. RESULTS Local tumor control was achieved in 32 of all treated metastases (89%). Four lesions showed a local recurrence after 7 months. Lesion sizes varied from 9 to 102 mm with a median of 20 mm. The median progression-free survival was 6.6 months (range, 1.8-46.8 months). The median overall survival was 11.4 months (range, 5-47 months). One patient suffered a major complication following iBT, hepatic hematoma and abscess (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 3), successfully dealt with by transcutaneous drainage. CONCLUSION iBT is an overall safe procedure, which facilitates high rates of local tumor control in treatment of metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma. Compared with surgical metastasectomy, similar overall survival rates could be achieved in our patient collective after iBT application.Copyright © Turkish Society of Radiology 2019.",Excluded

We performed a retrospective study to identify the optimal radiation dose for 3D airway CT during peripheral bronchoscopy. Method(s): In total, 91 patients with peripheral lung lesions underwent 3D airway CT (both standard dose CT as a reference and ultra-low dose CT [LDCT]). The patients were randomly assigned to one of four groups according to the ultra-LDCT parameters: group 1 = 120 kVp, 25 mAs; group 2 = 100 kVp, 15 mAs; group 3 = 120 kVp, 5 mAs; and group 4 = 100 kVp, 5 mAs. Two radiologists and two pulmonary physicians analyzed both the standard CT and ultra-LDCT scans independently. Result(s): The effective doses (EDs) of ultra-LDCT significantly differed among the four groups (median EDs were 0.88, 0.34, 0.19, and 0.12 mSv for groups 1-4, respectively; P < 0.001). Median differences in peripheral airway wall thickness were higher in group 4 than in other groups. Bronchus signs on ultra-LDCT in groups 1 and 2 were well correlated with those of the standard dose CT (accuracies of two radiologists and two pulmonary physicians were 95-100%) Conclusion(s): Our results indicate that ultra-LDCT with ED of > 0.34 mSv (ED of group 2) is feasible for peripheral bronchoscopy.",Excluded
2773,"Reducing computed tomography utilization in the evaluation of renal colic in the emergency department Study Objective: Evaluation of suspected kidney stones make up more than 1 million visits to emergency departments (ED) annually. Renal colic is frequently evaluated with the use of computed tomography (CT), the use of which has greatly increased in recent years. CT for suspected kidney stone has not been shown to improve patient outcomes but is associated with increased exposure to radiation, increased cost and increased ED length of stay. Method(s): In this project, a two-hospital community-based emergency medicine group and the local Regional Collaborative Care Organization (RCCO) began a joint project with the intent to improve the delivery of care to all patients. The goal of our project was to reduce CT imaging in the evaluation of renal colic in the ED to reduce costs, reduce exposure to radiation, and make CT imaging more available for emergent conditions. An educational program was used to support providers in the ED in reduction of total use of CT in the evaluation of patients. This included ultrasound education along with understanding of the cost, radiation exposure and use model for evaluation of suspected renal colic. A monitoring and feedback system was implemented. A care pathway was developed to help with the decisionmaking process and to facilitate a more standardized approach to care. Result(s): All patients seen and evaluated at the two sites were included in the data set. A baseline in utilization was established for all patients from 7/1/14 to 12/31/14. Education and pathways were introduced in the first half of 2015. Data was collected in the same manner for 7/1/15 to 12/31/15. The data was reviewed for individual providers as well as a department as a whole. Data is reported as a number of studies performed per 1000 patients seen for all complaints. The baseline data demonstrated utilization at site #1 at 21.60 and site #2 at 16.45 per 1000 patients. The post implementation data for site #1 is 13.01 and site #2 is 10.40 per 1000 patients. This represents areductionof 40%atsite #1 and 37% at site #2. The combinedresult of the two sites was a reduction from 17.17 to 10.94 per 1000 patients seen or a reduction of 38%. The overall reduction in the six months of data collection was from 1208 total scans to 753 or a change of 455 scans for essentially the same volume of total patients seen in the ED (68,196 base versus 68,804 after). There was a 32% decrease in variability in practice looking at the individuals from baseline to post intervention. RCCO noted a decrease in their financial burden of their patients. In review of the RCCO supported patients comparing the full 2014 year to 2015 there was a reduction in exams for their patient population from 3493 to 2111 or a difference of 1382 (40% decrease). The cost savings to RCCO was $978,602 for that same period. Conclusion(s): The patients received more consistent goal-directed evaluation and care. Patients had a decrease in radiation. The financial burden was decreased. The facility was able to utilize the CT equipment for more timely care of critical patients. The physicians received education and support that will continue to assist in their delivery of care.",Excluded
2628,"Effect of chemoradiotherapy vs chemotherapy on survival in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer controlled after 4 months of gemcitabine with or without erlotinib the LAP07 randomized clinical trial Importance In locally advanced pancreatic cancer, the role of chemoradiotherapy is controversial and the efficacy of erlotinib is unknown. OBJECTIVES To assess whether chemoradiotherapy improves overall survival of patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer controlled after 4 months of gemcitabine-based induction chemotherapy and to assess the effect of erlotinib on survival. DESIGN, SETTING,ANDPARTICIPANTS InLAP07, an international, open-label, phase3randomized trial, 449 patientswere enrolled between 2008and 2011. Follow-up ended in February 2013. INTERVENTIONS In the first randomization, 223 patients received 1000mg/m2 weekly of gemcitabine alone and 219 patients received 1000mg/m2 of gemcitabine plus 100mg/d of erlotinib. In the second randomization involving patients with progression-free disease after 4 months, 136 patients received 2 months of the same chemotherapy and 133 underwent chemoradiotherapy (54 Gy plus capecitabine). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomewas overall survival from the date of the first randomization. Secondary outcomeswere the effect of erlotinib and quality assurance of radiotherapy on overall survival, progression-free survival of gemcitabine-erlotinib and erlotinib maintenance with gemcitabine alone at the second randomization, and toxic effects. RESULTS A total of 442 of the 449 patients (232 men; median age, 63.3 years) enrolled underwent the first randomization. Of these, 269 underwent the second randomization. Interim analysis was performed when 221 patients died (109 in the chemoradiotherapy group and 112 in the chemotherapy group), reaching the early stopping boundaries for futility. With a median follow-up of 36.7 months, the median overall survival from the date of the first randomization was not significantly different between chemotherapy at 16.5 months (95%CI, 14.5-18.5 months) and chemoradiotherapy at 15.2 months (95%CI, 13.9-17.3 months; hazard ratio [HR], 1.03; 95%CI, 0.79-1.34; P =.83). Median overall survival from the date of the first randomization for the 223 patients receiving gemcitabine was 13.6 months (95%CI, 12.3-15.3 months) and was 11.9 months (95%CI, 10.4-13.5 months) for the 219 patients receiving gemcitabine plus erlotinib (HR, 1.19; 95%CI, 0.97-1.45; P =.09; 188 deaths vs 191 deaths). Chemoradiotherapy was associated with decreased local progression (32%vs 46%, P =.03) and no increase in grade 3 to 4 toxicity, except for nausea. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this open-label, randomized trial involving patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer with disease controlled after 4 months of induction chemotherapy, there was no significant difference in overall survival with chemoradiotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone and there was no significant difference in overall survival with gemcitabine compared with gemcitabine plus erlotinib used as maintenance therapy.Copyright © 2016 American Medical Association.

2742,"Preoperative isolated limb infusion of doxorubicin and external irradiation for limb-threatening soft tissue sarcomas Background: At present, limb-sparing surgery is the most appropriate and acceptable treatment option for soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities. To increase the number of limb-sparing resections in the treatment of locally advanced soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities, preoperative radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy are often used. Isolated limb perfusion of cytostatic agents is an effective alternative option but technically complex. Isolated limb infusion, essentially a low-flow isolated limb perfusion without oxygenation via a percutaneous catheter, had been developed as a simple alternative. Objective(s): The objective of this study was to achieve limb-sparing surgery in patients with locally advanced soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities that would otherwise have required an amputation or a functionally mutilating surgery by performing preoperative isolated limb infusion with doxorubicin and external beam irradiation to obtain local control and make limb-sparing surgery feasible. Method(s): A total of 40 patients with locally advanced soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities were evaluated between 2002 and 2005. Tumors were located in the lower limb in 28 patients (70%) and in the upper limb in 12 patients (30%). All of these patients were felt to be unresectable and were referred because amputation was considered the only available treatment option. They underwent preoperative isolated limb infusion with doxorubicin (0.7 and 1.4 mg/kg for the upper and lower limbs, respectively). Preoperative external beam radiotherapy started within 3-7 days after isolated limb infusion was administered. The total dose was 35 Gy in ten fractions. After 3-7 weeks, surgery was performed aiming at limb preservation. Result(s): Tumor response was seen in 85% of patients, rendering these large sarcomas resectable in most cases. The mean values of pretreatment tumor volume and post-treatment volume were 2797 cm3 and 1781 cm3, respectively, with a significant p value of 0.0001. Histologic response was seen in 80% of patients. At a median followup of 15 months (range = 5-35), limb salvage was achieved in 82.5%. Procedure-related complications were limited and easily managed. Conclusion(s): Isolated limb infusion with doxorubicin is a simple and safe method of regional chemotherapy. The addition of preoperative external beam irradiation helped to increase the rate of limb salvage in patients with large and/or high-grade soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities. © 2006 Society of Surgical Oncology.",Excluded
3547,"Protein expression of nucleophosmin, annexin A3 and nm23-H1 correlates with human nasopharyngeal carcinoma radioresistance in vivo Radioresistance is a significant obstacle in the treatment of endemic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The present study aimed to identify proteins associated with radioresistance in NPC in vitro and in vivo. Proteomics analyses were conducted to screen for differentially-expressed proteins (DEPs) in parental CNE-2 cells and CNE-2R cells. Using proteomics approaches, 16 DEPs were identified. Of these DEPs, nucleophosmin (NPM1), annexin A3 and nm23-H1, were verified using western blot analyses. The tumorigenicity was investigated using mouse xenograft tumorigenicity assays, and tumor growth curves were generated. The protein expression of NPM1, annexin A3 and nm23-H1 was examined by immunohistochemically staining tumor tissues. NPM1 and annexin A3 protein levels were downregulated in the CNE-2R cells, whereas nm23-H1 expression was upregulated. In vivo tests showed that compared with the CNE-2 tumors, CNE-2R tumor growth was significantly retarded (P<0.05). CNE-2 tumor progression was inhibited by irradiation, but CNE-2R tumor progression was not, indicating that the CNE-2R cells were also radioresistant in vivo. NPM1 and annexin A3 expression was significantly lower in non-irradiated (NIR)-CNE-2R tumors compared with NIR-CNE-2 tumors (P<0.01). However, Nm23-H1 protein levels were significantly higher (P<0.05). Overall, the present study established comparable radioresistant and radiosensitive tumor models of human NPC, and identified candidate biomarkers that may correlate with radioresistance. The data showed that dysregulation of NPM1, annexin A3 and nm23-H1 expression correlated with the cellular and tumor radioresponse. These proteins are involved in the regulation of intracellular functions, including stress responses, cell proliferation and DNA repair. However, further clinical evaluations are required.Copyright © 2016, Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.",Included
3389,"Reirradiation of Head and Neck Cancers With Proton Therapy: Outcomes and Analyses PURPOSE: Reirradiation of head and neck (H&N) cancer is a clinical challenge. Proton radiation therapy (PRT) offers dosimetric advantages for normal tissue sparing and may benefit previously irradiated patients. Here, we report our initial experience with the use of PRT for H&N reirradiation, with focus on clinical outcomes and toxicity., METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients who received H&N reirradiation with PRT from April 2011 through June 2015. Patients reirradiated with palliative intent or without prior documentation of H&N radiation therapy were excluded. Radiation-related toxicities were recorded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0., RESULTS: The conditions of 60 patients were evaluated, with a median follow-up time of 13.6 months. Fifteen patients (25%) received passive scatter proton therapy (PSPT), and 45 (75%) received intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT). Thirty-five patients (58%) received upfront surgery, and 44 (73%) received concurrent chemotherapy. The 1-year rates of locoregional failure-free survival, overall survival, progression-free survival, and distant metastasis-free survival were 68.4%, 83.8%, 60.1%, and 74.9%, respectively. Eighteen patients (30%) experienced acute grade 3 (G3) toxicity, and 13 (22%) required a feeding tube at the end of PRT. The 1-year rates of late G3 toxicity and feeding tube independence were 16.7% and 2.0%, respectively. Three patients may have died of reirradiation-related effects (1 acute and 2 late)., CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy can be a safe and effective curative reirradiation strategy, with acceptable rates of toxicity and durable disease control.

We evaluated the efficacy of beta-endovascular brachytherapy using the CORONA centering catheter in patients with SFA restenosis in a single-arm Phase II trial., METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 28 patients (mean age 70 years; 16 female, 12 male) with recurrent SFA stenosis were treated, and in-stent restenosis was present in 17 patients (61%). Brachytherapy was performed with strontium-90 beta source using a 7-French CO(2)-filled one-segment centering catheter. New stents had to be applied in two cases. Mean interventional length was 129 mm (range 20-240 mm). A dose of 14 Gy in vessel radius (postinterventional) plus 2 mm was applied in 24 patients and 18.4 Gy in four patients. Treatment time was 7 min 32 s per radiation segment. No major adverse events occurred. Patients were followed by ankle-brachial index and duplex sonography for a median of 42 months. Cumulative restenosis rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 9%, 28%, and 40%, respectively. Target vessel revascularization was performed in seven cases (25%)., CONCLUSIONS: In comparison to literature data, the treatment of SFA restenosis with beta brachytherapy may improve long-term patency.",Excluded

However, it has been suggested that they could be involved in the aetiology of some types of brain tumours. Objective(s): The objective was to analyse the association between mobile phone exposure and primary central nervous system tumours (gliomas and meningiomas) in adults. Method(s): CERENAT is a multicenter case-control study carried out in four areas in France in 2004-2006. Data about mobile phone use were collected through a detailed questionnaire delivered in a face-to-face manner. Conditional logistic regression for matched sets was used to estimate adjusted ORs and 95% CIs. Result(s): A total of 253 gliomas, 194 meningiomas and 892 matched controls selected from the local electoral rolls were analysed. No association with brain tumours was observed when comparing regular mobile phone users with non-users (OR=1.24; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.77 for gliomas, OR=0.90; 95% CI 0.61 to 1.34 for meningiomas).

2926,"Surgical Selection of Unstable Intertrochanteric Fractures: PFNA Combined with or without Cerclage Cable Due to the instability of unstable intertrochanteric fractures, the selection of a suitable internal fixation has always been a challenge for orthopedic surgeons. This study is aimed at comparing the clinical efficacy of PFNA combined with cerclage cable and without cerclage cable and finally recommend a stable internal fixation method to provide the basis for clinical therapy. From January 2014 to January 2018, we retrospectively analyzed all cases of unstable intertrochanteric fractures who received treatment in the Orthopedics Department of our hospital and finally screened 120 cases, 51 of whom were treated with cerclage cable, 69 without cerclage cable. The follow-up period was one year. HHS, BI, and RUSH scores were given within the specified time. We divided the patients into the PFNA+cable (PFNA combined with cerclage cable) group and the PFNA group. The time of fracture healing and weight-bearing in the PFNA+cable group was shorter than that in the PFNA group. With regard to HHS, BI, and RUSH, the PFNA+cable group was higher than the PFNA group at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after operation. For HHS rating, the PFNA+cable group has a higher excellent rate than the PFNA group, which was 96.1% and 84.1%, respectively. All the results mentioned above were statistically significant. Compared with the group without cerclage cable, the application of cerclage cable can reduce the incidence of complications. From the comparison between the two groups, it can be seen that the surgical method of PFNA combined with cerclage cable can not only help to improve the stability of fracture reduction, shorten the time of fracture healing and postoperative weight-bearing, and significantly improve patients' self-care ability but also reduce the incidence of postoperative complications. Therefore, we think PFNA combined with cerclage cable is a good choice.Copyright © 2021 Chaoqing Huang and Xing Wu.",Excluded
2613,"High dose rate brachytherapy in the management of lung transplant airway stenosis BACKGROUND: Airway complications after lung transplantation remain a major cause of postoperative morbidity and mortality. Interventional bronchoscopic management continues to be the main modality in the management of these problems., METHODS: Four patients with airway stenoses after lung transplantation received high dose rate brachytherapy for management of recurrent stenosis. All 4 patients had been treated with various bronchoscopic interventions, including dilation and stenting, electrocautery ablation, and neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser therapy. High dose rate endobronchial brachytherapy was subsequently used in all 4 patients for management of recurrent airway obstruction. The radiation dose for all 4 patients was 3 Gy at a distance of 1 cm from the center of the catheter., RESULTS: All four patients have had routine follow-up after endobronchial brachytherapy treatments. Of the 4 patients, 2 treated with this modality showed a significant response to therapy in that the bronchus remained free of obstruction after treatment; 1 patient had partial improvement, and 1 patient failed to show significant improvement and expired from the sequelae of persistent airway obstruction., CONCLUSIONS: Endobronchial brachytherapy can be an effective modality for managing recurrent stenoses caused by hyperplastic granulation tissue at the bronchial anastomosis. The optimal timing and ideal candidate for intraluminal radiation therapy for this problem remains a challenge and warrants further investigation.",Excluded

A single radiologist with more than 15 years of experience in chest-imaging evaluated the presence and extent of alveolar opacities, reticulations, and/or pleural effusion. The percentage of lung involvement (range <25 % to 75-100 %) was also calculated. We stratified patients in groups according to the time interval between symptoms onset and X-ray imaging (<= 5 and > 5 days) and according to age (<= 50 and > 50 years old)., RESULTS: A total of 518 patients were enrolled. Overall 314 patients had negative and 204 had positive RT-PCR results. Lung lesions in patients with SARS-Cov2 pneumonia primarily manifested as alveolar and interstitial opacities and were mainly bilateral (60.8 %). Lung abnormalities were more frequent and more severe by symptom duration and by increasing age. The sensitivity and specificity of chest X-ray at admission in the overall cohort were 57 % (95 % CI=47-67) and 89 % (83-94), respectively. Sensitivity was higher for patients with symptom onset > 5 days compared to <= 5 days (76 % [62-87] vs 37 % [24-52]) and in patients > 50 years old compared to <= 50 years (59 % [48-69] vs 47 % [23-72]), at the expense of a slightly lower specificity (68 % [45-86] and 82 % [73-89], respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: Overall chest X-ray sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia was 57 %.

2781,"How are patients influenced when counseled for minimally invasive lumbar spine surgeries? A stepwise model assessing pivotal information for decision-making Background Context Although minimally invasive surgery (MIS)-transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) has many evidence-based short-term benefits over open TLIF, both procedures have similar long-term outcomes. Patients' preference for MIS over open TLIF may be confounded by a lack of understanding of what each approach entails. Purpose The study aimed to identify the various factors influencing patients' choice between MIS and open TLIF. Study Design/Setting This is a cross-sectional study conducted at a tertiary health-care institution. Patient Sample Patients, for whom TLIF procedures were indicated, were recruited over a 3-month period from specialist outpatient clinics. Outcome Measure The outcome measure was patients' choice of surgical approach (MIS or open). Methods All patients were subjected to a stepwise interviewing process and were asked to select between open and MIS approaches at each step. Further subgroup analysis stratifying subjects based on stages of decision-making was performed to identify key predictors of selection changes. No sources of funding were required for this study and there are no conflicts of interests. Results Fifty-four patients with a mean age of 55.8 years participated in the study. Thirteen (24.1%) consistently selected a single approach, whereas 31 (57.4%) changed their selection more than once during the interviewing process. Overall, 12 patients (22.2%) had a final decision different from their initial choice, and 15 patients (27.8%) were unable to decide. A large proportion of patients (65.0%) initially favored the open approach's midline incision. This proportion dropped to 16.7% (p<.001) upon mention of the term MIS. The proportion of patients favoring MIS dropped significantly following discussion on the pros and cons (p=.002) of each approach, as well as conversion or revision surgery (p=.017). Radiation and cosmesis were identified as the two most important factors influencing patients' final decisions. Conclusions The longer midline incision of the open approach is cosmetically more appealing to patients than the paramedian stab wounds of MIS. The advantages of the MIS approach may not be as valued by patients as they are by surgeons. Given the equivalent long-term outcomes of both approaches, it is crucial that patients are adequately informed during preoperative counseling to achieve the best consensus decision.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
2797,"Dosimetric analysis and clinical outcomes in CT-based mould brachytherapy in early oral cancers in patients unfit for surgery Purpose: Brachytherapy in the oral cavity is an important alternative to conventional treatment, and provides a high localized dose and short overall treatment time. A rapid fall of dose beyond radioactive source makes it possible for increased tumour control and sparing surrounding tissue, while short overall treatment duration reduces risk of tumour repopulation. Moulds are fabricated to hold the catheters in position as closely as possible to tumour surface to provide adequate dose coverage of tumour volume and increase distance to other normal surrounding structures. Image based planning and dose optimisation help in better defining target volume and dose coverage. Material(s) and Method(s): A retrospective analysis of patients of early squamous cell carcinomas of lip and buccal mucosa from September 2011 to June 2014 to study response to mould brachytherapy. Double plane moulds were prepared for all lip cancer cases and single plane for buccal mucosa cases. Patients are being followed up till disease recurrence. In this study evaluation was done of the technique used, planning details, response to therapy, and reactions encountered. Result(s): Nine patients treated by mould therapy were reviewed; seven cases were of lip and two of buccal mucosal cancers. Dose delivered ranged from 12.5-48 Gy in fraction sizes of 2.5-3.5 Gy. Equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions (EQD2) ranged from 18-64 Gy. Maximum dose to organs at risk (OAR) was 91% of prescribed dose. Local mucositis was only reaction in all cases, which resolved in 3-6 weeks. Median follow-up was 19 months. Eight out of nine patients are in remission at a minimum of 7 months (1 case, rest over 14 months) post therapy and only one patient had nodal recurrence at 18 months. Conclusion(s): Mould therapy is an effective treatment method for selected early and superficial squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity, although indications are limited.Copyright © 2015, Termedia Publishing House Ltd.

3191,"The thermal effects of therapeutic lasers with 810 and 904 nm wavelengths on human skin OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of therapeutic infrared class 3B laser irradiation on skin temperature in healthy participants of differing skin color, age, and gender., BACKGROUND: Little is known about the potential thermal effects of Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) irradiation on human skin., METHODS: Skin temperature was measured in 40 healthy volunteers with a thermographic camera at laser irradiated and control (non-irradiated) areas on the skin. Six irradiation doses (2-12 J) were delivered from a 200 mW, 810 nm laser and a 60 mW, 904 nm laser, respectively., RESULTS: Thermal effects of therapeutic LLLT using doses recommended in the World Association for Laser Therapy (WALT) guidelines were insignificant; below 1.5degreeC in light, medium, and dark skin. When higher irradiation doses were used, the 60 mW, 904 nm laser produced significantly (p < 0.01) higher temperatures in dark skin (5.7, SD +/- 1.8degreeC at 12 J) than in light skin, although no participants requested termination of LLLT. However, irradiation with a 200 mW, 810 nm laser induced three to six times more heat in dark skin than in the other skin color groups. Eight of 13 participants with dark skin asked for LLLT to be stopped because of uncomfortable heating. The maximal increase in skin temperature was 22.3degreeC., CONCLUSIONS: The thermal effects of LLLT at doses recommended by WALT-guidelines for musculoskeletal and inflammatory conditions are negligible (<1.5degreeC) in light, medium, and dark skin. However, higher LLLT doses delivered with a strong 3B laser (200 mW) are capable of increasing skin temperature significantly and these photothermal effects may exceed the thermal pain threshold for humans with dark skin color.",Excluded
2572,"Combined modality therapy including intraoperative electron irradiation for locally recurrent colorectal cancer Purpose: To evaluate survival, relapse patterns, and prognostic factors in patients with colorectal cancer relapse treated with curative-intent therapy, including intraoperative electron radiation therapy (IOERT). Methods and Materials: From April 1981 through January 2008, 607 patients with recurrent colorectal cancer received IOERT as a component of treatment. IOERT was preceded or followed by external radiation (median dose, 45.5 Gy) in 583 patients (96%). Resection was classified as R0 in 227 (37%), R1 in 224 (37%), and R2 in 156 (26%). The median IOERT dose was 15 Gy (range, 7.5-30 Gy). Result(s): Median overall survival was 36 months. Five- and 10-year survival rates were 30% and 16%, respectively. Survival estimates at 5 years were 46%, 27%, and 16% for R0, R1, and R2 resection, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that R0 resection, no prior chemotherapy, and more recent treatment (in the second half of the series) were associated with improved survival. The 3-year cumulative incidence of central, local, and distant relapse was 12%, 23%, and 49%, respectively. Central and local relapse were more common in previously irradiated patients and in those with subtotal resection. Toxicity Grade 3 or higher partially attributable to IOERT was observed in 66 patients (11%). Neuropathy was observed in 94 patients (15%) and was more common with IOERT doses exceeding 12.5 Gy. Conclusion(s): Long-term survival and disease control was achievable in patients with locally recurrent colorectal cancer.

3589,"Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy may increase the risk of severe anastomotic complications after esophagectomy with cervical anastomosis PURPOSE: Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) improves long-term survival for patients with esophageal cancer. On the other hand, there are indications that nCRT may increase the risk for postoperative morbidity. The aims of this study were to estimate the radiation exposure to the site of anastomosis on the gastric fundus and to assess whether nCRT affected the incidence or severity of cervical anastomotic complications., METHODS: A retrospective cohort of patients with cancer of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction, who were reconstructed with cervical anastomosis. The planned radiation dose to the site of the cervical anastomosis on the gastric fundus was estimated for each patient., RESULTS: The analysis of the dose plans showed that 20 out of 22 (93 %) available patients received radiotherapy toward the planned site of the anastomosis in the region of the gastric fundus with doses ranging from 6 to 40 Gy. In the nCRT group, 12 out of 28 patients (43 %) had anastomotic complications compared to 16 out of 42 (38 %) in the non-RT group (p = 0.69). In the nCRT group, 39 % had anastomotic complications that led to a Clavien-Dindo grade of IVa or higher compared to 17 % in the non-RT group (p = 0.03). The OR for Clavien-Dindo grade IVa or worse was 6.0 (95 % CI 1.52-23.50)., CONCLUSION: This small retrospective study suggests that nCRT exposes the future anastomotic site to doses of radiation that may impair healing of the subsequent cervical anastomosis. Our data further suggest that nCRT may increase the severity of cervical anastomotic complications, and this hypothesis needs to be tested in a large prospective study.",Excluded
2931,"EUS-guided portal pressure gradient measurement with a simple novel device: a human pilot study Background and Aims Portal hypertension (PH) is a serious adverse event of liver cirrhosis. The hepatic venous pressure gradient or portal pressure gradient (PPG) accurately reflects the degree of PH and is the single best prognostic indicator in liver disease. This is usually obtained by interventional radiology (IR), although it is not routinely performed. Recently, we developed a simple novel technique for EUS-guided PPG measurement (PPGM). Our animal studies showed excellent correlation between EUS-PPGM and IR-PPGM. We present the first human pilot study of EUS-PPGM in patients with liver disease. Methods EUS-PPGM was performed by experienced endosonographers using a linear echoendoscope, a 25-gauge fine-needle aspiration needle, and a novel compact manometer. The portal vein and hepatic vein (or inferior vena cava) were targeted using a transgastric-transduodenal approach. Clinical parameters of PH were evaluated in each patient. Feasibility was defined as successful PPGM in each patient. Safety was based on adverse events captured in a postprocedural interview. Results Twenty-eight patients underwent EUS-PPGM with 100% technical success and no adverse events. PPG ranged from 1.5 to 19 mm Hg and had excellent correlation with clinical parameters of portal hypertension including the presence of varices (P = .0002), PH gastropathy (P = .007), and thrombocytopenia (P = .036). PPG was increased in patients with high clinical evidence of cirrhosis (P = .005). Conclusion This novel technique of EUS-PPGM using a 25-gauge needle and compact manometer is feasible and appears safe. Given the availability of EUS and the simplicity of the manometry setup, EUS-guided PPG may represent a promising breakthrough for procuring indispensable information in the management of patients with liver disease.Copyright © 2017",Excluded
3687,"A deep learning tool for fully automated measurements of sagittal spinopelvic balance from X-ray images: performance evaluation Purpose: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of a novel deep learning (DL) tool for fully automated measurements of the sagittal spinopelvic balance from X-ray images of the spine in comparison with manual measurements. Method(s): Ninety-seven conventional upright sagittal X-ray images from 55 subjects were retrospectively included in this study. Measurements of the parameters of the sagittal spinopelvic balance, i.e., the sacral slope (SS), pelvic tilt (PT), spinal tilt (ST), pelvic incidence (PI) and spinosacral angle (SSA), were obtained manually by identifying specific anatomical landmarks using the SurgiMap Spine software and by the fully automated DL tool. Statistical analysis was performed in terms of the mean absolute difference (MAD), standard deviation (SD) and Pearson correlation, while the paired t test was used to search for statistically significant differences between manual and automated measurements. Result(s): The differences between reference manual measurements and those obtained automatically by the DL tool were, respectively, for SS, PT, ST, PI and SSA, equal to 5.0degree (3.4degree), 2.7degree (2.5degree), 1.2degree (1.2degree), 5.5degree (4.2degree) and 5.0degree (3.5degree) in terms of MAD (SD), with a statistically significant corresponding Pearson correlation of 0.73, 0.90, 0.95, 0.81 and 0.71. No statistically significant differences were observed between the two types of measurement (p value always above 0.05). Conclusion(s): The differences between measurements are in the range of the observer variability of manual measurements, indicating that the DL tool can provide clinically equivalent measurements in terms of accuracy but superior measurements in terms of cost-effectiveness, reliability and reproducibility.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
2667,"Low-dose radiotherapy for lymphoid lesions of the orbit and ocular adnexa Purpose: There is no agreement within the radiation oncology and ophthalmic communities regarding the treatment of lymphoid lesions of the orbit and ocular adnexa. The authors report their experience with the use of low-dose radiation therapy for malignant and benign lymphoid masses of the orbital region in a series of 54 patients treated between 1985 and 1993. Method(s): All patients received 2 Gy per day for a total of 24 Gy, except when the lesion was extensive, in which case the therapy was 1.5 Gy per day for a total of 25.5 Gy. A diagnosis was established by incisional surgical biopsy in 26 patients and aspiration cytology in 28 patients. Those with a malignant or an indeterminate diagnosis were evaluated with a modified Ann Arbor staging system. Result(s): Low-dose radiation therapy produced a complete response in 100% of the orbital lymphoid lesions. This local control was maintained in 52 patients (96%) for the first year and in 51 patients (95%) for 5 or more years with a mean follow-up of 7 years. One patient died of causes unrelated to the malignant lymphoma after the first year of observation. The mean age of the 54 patients was 67 years, and the range was 37 to 90 years. The mean ages of presentation for each location were: orbit, 67 years; conjunctiva, 68 years; lacrimal gland, 66 years; and eyelids, 72 years. The female-to-male ratio was 1.25:1 (34 women and 20 men). In this series, 9 patients had benign processes, 38 patients had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 7 patients had abnormalities of indeterminate cause. All histologic subtypes of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma involving the orbit responded equally well to therapy. Forty-five patients had clinically staged disease as follows: stage I, 21 patients; stage II, 4 patients; stage III, 2 patients; and stage IV, 18 patients. Benign disease, diagnosed in 9 patients, was not staged. Conclusion(s): Low-dose radiation therapy proved effective in treating lymphoid lesions of the orbital area. No treatment-limiting complications occurred. The only early side effects were mild xerophthalmia and chemosis in 50% of patients, and the only chronic side effect was mild xerophthalmia in 33% of patients. Cataracts, corneal ulcerations, and retinal injury were not observed.",Excluded

Dynamic 64-detector-row CT and balanced steady-state free precession-based non-contrast-enhanced 3-T MR imaging were performed. RAV visualization based on a four-point score was documented. Both anatomical location and variation on cross-sectional imaging were evaluated, and the findings were compared with catheter venography as the gold standard., RESULTS: The RAV was visualized in 93.2% by CT and 84.8% by MR imaging (p = 0.02). Positive predictive values of RAV visualization were 100% for CT and 95.2% for MR imaging. Imaging score was significantly higher in CT than MR imaging (p < 0.01). The RAV formed a common trunk with an accessory hepatic vein in 16% of patients. The RAV orifice level on cross-sectional imaging was concordant with catheter venography within the range of 1/3 vertebral height in >70% of subjects. Success rate of AVS was 99.2%., CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic CT is a reliable way to map the RAV prior to AVS. Non-contrast-enhanced MR imaging is an alternative when there is a risk of complication from contrast media or radiation exposure., KEY POINTS: Dynamic CT and non-contrast-enhanced MR imaging detect the right adrenal vein (RAV). Dynamic CT can visualize the RAV more than non-contrast-enhanced MR imaging. Mapping the RAV helps to achieve successful adrenal venous sampling. Sixteen per cent of RAVs share the common trunk with accessory hepatic veins.",Excluded

Method(s): The 2016 Medicare Physician Compare National Downloadable and the 2016 Medicare Part D Prescriber Data files were cross-linked to identify RO-written opioid prescriptions. Result(s): Of 4,627 identified ROs, 1,360 (29.3%) wrote >10 opioid prescriptions. The average number of opioid prescriptions written was significantly (P <=.05) associated with the following RO characteristics: sex [13.1 +/- 36.5 male vs 7.5 +/- 16.9 female]; years since medical school graduation [4.5 +/- 11.5 1-10 years vs 12.6 +/- 26.0 11-24 years vs 13.3 +/- 40.9 >=25 years]; practice size [15.5 +/- 44.6 size <=10 vs 13.3 +/- 25.9 size 11-49 vs 8.5 +/- 12.7 size 50-99 vs 8.8 +/- 26.9 size >=100]; Medicare Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS) participation [12.6 +/- 31.8 yes vs 7.0 +/- 35.4 no]; and practice location [17.4 +/- 47.0 South vs 10.6 +/- 29.4 Midwest vs 8.1 +/- 13.9 West vs 6.9 +/- 15.2 Northeast].

2984,"How far can the radiation dose be lowered in head CT with iterative reconstruction? Analysis of imaging quality and diagnostic accuracy Objective: To evaluate the imaging quality of head CT at lowered radiation dose by combining filtered back projection (FBP) and iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms. Method(s): Experimental group A (n = 66) underwent CT with 43 % tube current reduction, and group B (n = 58) received an equivalent reduced dose by lowering the tube voltage. An age- and sex-matched control group (n = 72) receiving the conventional radiation dose was retrospectively collected. Imaging for the control group was reconstructed by FBP only, while images for groups A and B were reconstructed by FBP and IR. The signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs), sharpness, number of infarcts and severity of subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy (SAE) were compared to assess imaging quality and diagnostic accuracy. Result(s): There were no significant differences in SNRs and CNRs between group A and the control group. There were significantly decreased SNRs and increased CNRs in group B. Image sharpness decreased in both groups. Correlations between detected infarcts and severity of SAE across FBP and IR were high (r = 0.73-0.93). Head diameter was the only significant factor inversely correlated with infratentorial imaging quality. Conclusion(s): Head CT with 43 % reduced tube current reconstructed by IR provides diagnostic imaging quality for outpatient management. Key Points: * Cranial CT using iterative reconstruction provides diagnostic images with 43 % mAs reduction. * Blurring of infratentorial images becomes evident using low-radiation head CT. * Head diameter was inversely correlated with imaging quality in the infratentorium. * Lowering tube kilovoltage requires a higher radiation dose to maintain image quality. © 2013 European Society of Radiology.",Excluded
3091,"Graft versus host disease-related secretory immunoglobulin A deficiency in bone marrow transplant recipients. Findings in labial saliva Graft versus host disease-dependent decreases in salivary IgA levels were sought in labial gland saliva samples from bone marrow transplant recipients. Transplantation-associated, irradiation-related effects were also present, but these could be avoided if analyses were performed at 1 year or later after transplantation. Sampling of minor gland saliva eliminated the possibility of contamination with IgA-rich serum transudates arising from gingival or mucosal pathways which obscured results from previous studies using whole saliva samples. Patients with active extensive clinical disease had significantly depressed levels of salivary IgA. Since labial saliva is a principal source of total salivary IgA, the present findings may explain why patients with graft versus host disease are susceptible to infection via the sinobronchial portal.",Excluded
2600,"Comparative stochastic effects of inhaled alpha- and beta-particle- emitting radionuclides in beagle dogs The stochastic effects of inhaled, insoluble particles of alpha- or beta- particle-emitting radionuclides were compared in dogs. Male and female beagle dogs were exposed briefly by nasal inhalation to relatively insoluble aerosols of 239PuO2 or 144Ce in fused aluminosilicate particles (FAP) and observed for cancer for their lifetimes. The initial lung burden and retention of each radionuclide was determined by whole-body counting of the emissions from 144Ce-144Pr- or 169Yb-labeled 239PuO2. Lung doses were calculated for each dog from these data. The lung doses ranged from 0.21 to 1200 Gy for 144Ce FAP and 1.6 to 58 Gy for 239PuO2. Dogs with doses to the lung of about 60 Gy or greater from 144Ce or about 2 Gy or greater from 239PuO2 had an increased incidence of lung carcinomas. In dogs exposed to 144Ce FAP, three organs were targets for neoplasia: lung, tracheobronchial lymph nodes, and heart. The insoluble FAP carried to the lymph nodes draining the lung delivered high radiation doses to the nodes and adjacent heart, resulting in hemangiosarcomas of these organs. In the lung, high radiation doses induced hemangiosarcomas and carcinosarcomas. At lower doses, carcinomas of various histological patterns were induced in the lung. In dogs exposed to 239PuO2, the lung was the sole target organ for neoplasia. Nearly all of these neoplasms were carcinomas of various histological patterns. These results indicated that relatively low doses of alpha-particle radiation can induce pulmonary cancers, but relatively large doses of beta-particle radiation are required. In addition, inhaled beta-particle emitters can also induce cancers in lung-associated lymph nodes and heart at these larger absorbed radiation doses.",Included
2868,"Carbon ion radiotherapy for oligo-recurrent lung metastases from colorectal cancer: A feasibility study Background: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) for oligo-recurrent lung tumors from colorectal cancer (CRC). Method(s): From May 1997 to October 2012, 34 consecutive patients with oligo-recurrent pulmonary metastases from CRC were treated with CIRT. The patients were not surgical candidates for medical reasons or patient refusal. Using a respiratory-gated technique, carbon ion therapy was delivered with curative intent using 4 coplanar beam angles. A median dose of 60 GyE (range, 44-64.8 GyE) was delivered to the planning target volume (PTV), with a median daily dose of 15 GyE (range, 3.6-44 GyE). Treatment outcome was analyzed in terms of local control rate (LCR), survival rate, and treatment-related complications. Result(s): In total, 34 patients with 44 oligo-recurrent pulmonary lesions were treated with CIRT. Median follow-up period was 23.7 months. The 2- and 3-year actuarial LCRs of the treated patients were 85.4% +/- 6.2% and 85.4% +/- 6.2%, respectively. Overall survival was 65.1% +/- 9.5% at 2 years, and 50.1% +/- 10.5% at 3 years. Although survival rates were relatively worse in the subsets of patients aged < 63 years or with early metastasis (< 36 months after resection of primary site), these factors were not significantly correlated with overall survival (P = 0.13 and 0.19, respectively). All treatment-related complications were self-limited, without any grade 3-5 toxicity. Conclusion(s): CIRT is one of the most effective nonsurgical treatments for colorectal lung metastases, which are relatively resistant to stereotactic body radiotherapy. CIRT is considered to be the least invasive approach even in patients who have undergone repeated prior thoracic metastasectomies. © 2014 Takahashi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded

3632,"Dose-volume relationship for laryngeal substructures and aspiration in patients with locally advanced head-and-neck cancer Background: Literature has shown a significant relationship between radiation dose to the larynx and swallowing disorders. We prospectively studied the dose-volume relationship for larynx substructures and aspiration. Method(s): Forty nine patients with stage III/IV head-and-neck (H&N) squamous cell carcinoma were prospectively enrolled in this IRB-approved, federally funded study. All patients received IMRT-based chemoradiation therapy (CRT) and were scheduled for videofluorography (VFG) prior to CRT and at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months post-CRT. Twelve laryngeal substructures were contoured in each patient: thyroid cartilage, cricoid cartilage, total epiglottis, suprahyoid epiglottis, infrahyoid epiglottis, total larynx, supraglottic larynx, subglottic larynx, glottic larynx, arytenoids, aryepiglottic (AE) folds, and glossoepiglottic fold. After exclusions, 29 patients were included in the final analysis. Incidence of aspiration at 1 year following CRT was correlated with dose-volume data to laryngeal substructures using logistic regression. Result(s): The median age was 54 years with 79% being non-smokers. Tumor sites included oropharynx (22), unknown primary (6), and hypopharynx (1). One year following CRT, 10/29 (34%) showed aspiration on VFG. Dose to the AE folds showed the highest correlation with aspiration at 12 months and was significant on multivariate analysis (p = 0.025). A mean dose cutpoint of 6500 cGy or higher to the AE folds was associated with an increased risk of aspiration at 1 year [positive likelihood ratio (+LR) 2.81, positive predictive value (PPV) 60%, negative predictive value (NPV) 92.9%, relative risk (RR) 8.4]. Conclusion(s): In this analysis, mean dose to the AE folds was associated with an increased risk of aspiration at 1 year.

All patients had previously undergone external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) with a median dose of 56 Gy (range, 30-70 Gy). The median HDREB dose applied was 15 Gy (range, 5-29 Gy). The median time interval between primary EBRT and reirradiation was 9 months (range, 2-54 months)., RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 6.7 months, the 6-, 12-, and 24-month overall survival rates were 58%, 18%, and 7%, respectively. The median overall survival time was 6.7 months. Local remission was achieved in 73% of patients (n = 30). A total of 24% of patients (n = 10) showed no response or progressive disease within 8 weeks after treatment. In 1 patient, treatment response was not documented. The 6-, 12-, and 24-month local control rates were 38%, 17%, and 3%, respectively. The median local progression-free survival time was 4 months (range, 1-23 months). Prognostic factors were a total dose of >or=15 Gy of HDREB (p = 0.029) and a Karnofsky performance score of >or=80% (p = 0.0012). The cause of death was locoregional progression in 27% of patients (n = 11), distant metastases in 24% of patients (n = 10), fatal hemorrhage in 15% of patients (n = 6), and other causes in 29% of patients (n = 12). None of the patients with locally controlled disease showed grade 3 or 4 late effects., CONCLUSIONS: Palliative treatment of symptomatic, locally recurrent bronchial carcinoma with HDREB can effectively relieve symptoms in the majority of patients while causing only few complications.

Therapeutical effect was explained by capacity of the preparation to defend the hemopoietic organs from the radiation and to stimulate hemopoiesis. Leucynferon hindered the development of acute radiation sickness symptoms. Immunoreactivity of dogs and guinea pigs in experimental group was more complete and restored faster.

Images acquired during the arterial phase of contrast enhancement were evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively for image noise and intraluminal contrast enhancement., RESULTS: Thirty adult patients were prospectively enrolled. Statistically significantly higher attenuation values were measured in the low-dose acquisition protocol compared to the standard protocol, from the suprarenal abdominal aorta to the common femoral artery (p<0.0001; all vascular segments). Qualitatively, image quality was judged significantly (p=0.0002) better with the standard protocol than with the low-dose protocol. However, no significant differences were found between the two protocols in terms of contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) (13.63+/-6.97 vs. 11.48+/-8.13; p=0.1058). An overall dose reduction of up to 74% was observed for the low-dose protocol compared with the standard protocol., CONCLUSION: In repeat follow-up examinations of patients undergoing EVAR for abdominal aortic aneurysm, a low-dose radiation exposure acquisition protocol provides substantially reduced radiation exposure while maintaining a constant CNR and good image quality.

The results were collected prospectively within a randomized controlled trial of induction chemotherapy., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned between doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine and one of two prespecified multidrug regimens. At least six cycles of chemotherapy were planned, with up to eight for patients showing slower response. Involved-field RT was recommended for incomplete response to chemotherapy or bulk disease at presentation. The primary outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS), landmarked from the end of chemotherapy., RESULTS: Among 807 patients randomly assigned, 702 achieved objective response. Postchemotherapy RT for consolidation was reported in 300 (43%). With median follow-up of 6.9 years, 161 PFS events and 83 deaths were reported. Baseline characteristics showed more patients with bulk disease having RT (190 [63%] v 111 [28%]) and only partial response after chemotherapy (150 [50%] v 36 [9%]). Other baseline characteristics were similar. PFS was superior for patients having RT (hazard ratio [HR], 0.43; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.60) with 5-year PFS 71% without RT, 86% with RT. A similar advantage was seen for overall survival (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.77). There was no evidence of heterogeneity of treatment effect across subgroups., CONCLUSION: Patients who received consolidation RT apparently had better outcomes, consistently across all prognostic groups which persisted in multivariate analysis. This suggests that RT contributes significantly to the cure rate for advanced HL, although patient selection for combined modality treatment requires better definition in prospective trials.",Excluded

Among radiation-naive patients, when compared with 3-dimensional conformal proton technique, IMPT significantly improved LC (91% vs 72%; P <.01) and independently predicted LC (hazard ratio, 0.14; P =.01). Sixteen radiation-naive patients (24%) experienced acute grade 3 toxicities; 4 (6%) experienced late grade 3 toxicities (osteoradionecrosis, vision loss, soft-tissue necrosis, and soft tissue fibrosis) (grading was performed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [version 5.0]). Slightly inferior LC was noted for patients undergoing reirradiation with higher complications: 11% experienced late grade 3 toxicities (facial pain and brain necrosis). Patients treated with reirradiation had more grade 1 to 2 radionecrosis than radiation-naive patients (brain: 33% vs 7% and osteoradionecrosis: 17% vs 3%). Conclusion(s): PT achieved remarkable LC for patients with nasal cavity and paranasal sinus cancers with lower grade 3 toxicities relative to historical reports. IMPT has the potential to improve the therapeutic ratio in these malignancies and is worthy of further investigation.Copyright © 2020 American Cancer Society",Excluded
3555,"Ocular arterial blood flow of choroidal melanoma eyes before and after stereotactic radiotherapy using Leksell gamma knife: 2 year follow up Aims - To evaluate the effect of high dose stereotactic radiotherapy on the ocular blood flow of patients with uveal melanoma. Methods - Colour Doppler imaging (CDI) was used to measure blood flow velocity and vascular resistance in the ophthalmic, short posterior, and central retinal arteries of nine patients suffering from uveal melanoma. The measurements were taken before, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after stereotactic radiotherapy. Irradiation was performed with the Leksell gamma knife with the 59 (41-66.5) Gy total marginal dose divided in two equal fractions. CDI results were compared with age and sex matched healthy control eyes. Results - At each time of measurement, blood flow velocity in the central retinal artery of the affected eyes was significantly reduced whereas vascular resistance was only increased at the 2 year follow up. Blood flow velocity and vascular resistance in the short posterior arteries of melanoma eyes were also only significantly altered at the 2 year follow up. Blood flow velocity and vascular resistance in the ophthalmic artery of melanoma eyes were not changed at all follow ups. Conclusions - In the melanoma eyes, blood flow velocity in the central retinal artery is reduced. High dose stereotactic radiotherapy with the Leksell gamma knife and a 59 (41-66.5) Gy total marginal dose in two fractions leads to a significant reduction of blood flow and a significant increase in resistance variables in the small ocular arteries within 2 years.",Excluded
2922,"Is it necessary to approach the severe osteoporotic vertebral biconcave-shaped fracture bilaterally during the process of pkp? Purpose: The goal of this study was to explore the outcomes of unilateral and bilateral approach percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) using CT-guidance in the treatment of severe osteoporotic single-level vertebral biconcave-shaped fracture. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed 89 patients with severe osteoporotic single-level vertebral biconcave-shaped fracture who had undergone unilateral and bilateral PKP surgeries using CT-guidance at our hospital between June 2013 and June 2019, and followed for at least 1 year. All patients were divided into unilateral (the transverse process-pedicle approach, n = 49) and bilateral (the pedicle approach, n = 40) groups. We collected the clinical and radiological evaluation results during postoperative and last follow-up periods. Result(s): Our findings revealed that the surgery time for the unilateral group was significantly shorter than that of the bilateral group at P < 0.05. The amount of bone cement and radiation exposure of the unilateral group were significantly lesser than that of the bilateral group (P < 0.05). Relative to preoperative data, the values of the VAS score and Oswestry disability index (ODI) were significantly improved at 1 day after surgery and the last followup in the two groups (P < 0.05). Notably, the median height of vertebra at 1 day after surgery and the last follow-up in the unilateral group was significantly restored than that of preoperative data (P < 0.05). However, the median height of vertebra at the same time intervals in the bilateral group showed no significant change compared with preoperative data (P > 0.05). Furthermore, the rate of bone cement leakage and incidence of adjacent-level vertebra fracture were not significantly different in the two groups (P > 0.05). Finally, both groups can obtain an asymmetrical distribution of bone cement in the vertebra. Conclusion(s): Compared to the bilateral PKP, unilateral PKP using CT-guidance in the treatment of the sOVBFs exhibits significantly shorter operation time, lesser radiation dose, and complications. Moreover, unilateral PKP can restore the median height of the vertebral body and eventually obtain a symmetrical distribution of bone cement in the vertebra.Copyright © 2021 Tan et al.",Excluded

2534,"Validation of the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay for use as a triage biological dosimetry tool Traditionally, the dicentric chromosome assay (DCA) has been used to derive biological dose estimates for unknown radiological exposures. While sensitive, this assay requires highly trained evaluators and is extremely time consuming. The cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay has been suggested as an alternative to the DCA, as it is much faster to evaluate samples and requires less technical expertise. In order to validate this assay for triage biodosimetry, dose-response curves were generated for six donors at eight doses of gamma-radiation (0-4.0 Gy). Each sample was evaluated by 12 individuals, among three different laboratories and the incidence of micronuclei was determined after counting 50-500 binucleated cells. This study demonstrated that the CBMN assay was capable of detecting radiation doses >or=1 Gy after scoring only 200 binucleated cells. As such, the CBMN assay may provide a sensitive and reliable technique for deployment as an initial screening tool in a large-scale radiological emergency where large numbers of biological dose estimates are required.",Included
3099,"Safety and efficacy of a novel high-intensity focused electromagnetic technology device for noninvasive abdominal body shaping BACKGROUND: Thermal fat reduction technologies are leading the market for nonsurgical abdominal contouring. However, they are ideal principally for patients with fat bulges., OBJECTIVES: Our study investigates the effects of a novel nonthermal technology affecting the abdominal musculature and subcutaneous adipose tissue., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 22 patients (avg. BMI 23.8 kg m-2 ) underwent 4 treatments on abdomen with high-intensity focused electromagnetic (HIFEM) field device. Treatments took 30 minutes and were spaced apart by 2-3 days. Photographs, weight, and waist measurements were taken at the baseline, after the last treatment, and at month 3 follow-up. Patient satisfaction was noted. Photographs were evaluated by blinded evaluators., RESULTS: The study protocol was completed by 19 patients. At month 3, the average waist size reduction was 4.37 +/- 2.63 cm (P < 0.01). The evaluators identified the before image from the 3-month image 89.47% of the time. About 91% of patients reported their abdominal appearance improved, and 92% stated they are satisfied with treatment results at month 3. No adverse events occurred., CONCLUSION: Observed waist size reduction and aesthetic improvement appear to be a combination of fat reduction and increased muscle definition of abdominal wall. In lower BMI patients, the increased abdominal muscle definition was largely responsible for the improvement. This novel energy device provides an additional tool for body contouring with primary application for lower and medium BMI patients.

3002,"Image quality of iterative reconstruction in cranial CT imaging: comparison of model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) and adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASiR) Objectives: The purpose of this study was to compare cranial CT (CCT) image quality (IQ) of the MBIR algorithm with standard iterative reconstruction (ASiR)., Methods: In this institutional review board (IRB)-approved study, raw data sets of 100 unenhanced CCT examinations (120 kV, 50-260 mAs, 20 mm collimation, 0.984 pitch) were reconstructed with both ASiR and MBIR. Signal-to-noise (SNR) and contrast-to-noise (CNR) were calculated from attenuation values measured in caudate nucleus, frontal white matter, anterior ventricle horn, fourth ventricle, and pons. Two radiologists, who were blinded to the reconstruction algorithms, evaluated anonymized multiplanar reformations of 2.5 mm with respect to depiction of different parenchymal structures and impact of artefacts on IQ with a five-point scale (0: unacceptable, 1: less than average, 2: average, 3: above average, 4: excellent)., Results: MBIR decreased artefacts more effectively than ASiR (p < 0.01). The median depiction score for MBIR was 3, whereas the median value for ASiR was 2 (p < 0.01). SNR and CNR were significantly higher in MBIR than ASiR (p < 0.01)., Conclusions: MBIR showed significant improvement of IQ parameters compared to ASiR. As CCT is an examination that is frequently required, the use of MBIR may allow for substantial reduction of radiation exposure caused by medical diagnostics.Copyright © 2014, European Society of Radiology.",Excluded
3268,"Impact of the radiation dose and completion of palliative radiotherapy on survival in patients treated for locally advanced lung cancer Aim: To compare three total radiation dose levels for their impact on survival in patients receiving palliative radiotherapy (RT) for locally advanced lung cancer. Patients and Methods: Radiation dose (equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions=EQD2: 31-40 Gy vs. 41-46 Gy vs. 47-52 Gy), completion of RT as planned, plus nine factors were analyzed for survival in 125 patients. Result(s): On multivariate analysis, EQD2 47-52 Gy (p=0.018), completion of planned RT (p=0.002), lower T-category (p=0.027) and lower Ncategory (p=0.008) were positively associated with survival.

OBJECTIVE: We report our own experience with the use of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) for the management of postradiation hemorrhagic cystitis., METHODS: We reviewed retrospectively 14 patients from 2001 to 2007 with different pelvic organ malignancies who developed radiation cystitis after irradiation. Patients received 100% oxygen in a hyperbaric chamber at a pressure of 2.5 atmospheres absolute, 60 min bottom time, once a day, 7 days a week for at least 1 month. In principle, 30 HBO treatments per course were performed. After every course of HBO treatments, therapeutic effect was evaluated. The mean duration of follow-up of all patients was 18 months (range: 1-6 years)., RESULTS: Patients were divided into 2 groups, group 1 (treatment group, n = 10) and group 2 (without treatment, n = 4). The mean duration between the onset of hematuria and the beginning of HBO therapy was 8.9 months (range: 3-34). Group 2 did not receive HBO because they were not healthy enough. Only 2 patients (20%) of group 1 recovered from their hemorrhagic cystitis. Group 1 had a significantly lower cure rate of postirradiation hemorrhagic cystitis in comparison to group 2., CONCLUSIONS: Our experience with the use of HBO did not yield favorable results.

The aims of this study were to test the influence of XRCC1 rs25487, XRCC3 rs861539, XRCC3 rs1799794, RAD51 rs1801320 and GSTP-1 rs1695 single nucleotide polymorphisms on progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in GBM patients treated with radiotherapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ). Fifty GBM patients treated with upfront radio-chemotherapy (RT 60 Gy/30 sessions; TMZ 75 mg/m2 during RT and 200 mg/m2 days 1 -> 5 every 28 days) were enrolled. Survival curves were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the log-rank test was used to evaluate differences between curves. A trend to a statistically significant association with PFS in univariate and multivariate COX regression analysis was found with GSTP-1 rs1695 polymorphism (p = 0.087 and p = 0.097 on univariate and multivariate analyses, respectively). Conversely, the same GSTP-1 rs1695 SNP revealed a statistically significant association with OS (p = 0.007 and p = 0.042 on univariate and multivariate analysis, respectively).

Between August 1994 and December 1999, 63 patients with stage IIIA and stage IIIB non-small-cell lung cancer were treated with RT to a dose of 69.6 Gy at 1.2 Gy twice daily with daily cisplatin at 6 mg/m. Thirty-seven patients elected to receive consolidation carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy. Recurrence and survival outcomes were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Acute and late side effects were scored by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grading system. Radiographic complete or partial tumor response was achieved in 34 of 63 (54%) of cases. Median absolute survival was 20.1 months. Median time to local recurrence and distant metastases were 10.6 and 8.6 months, respectively.

The clinical and therapeutic characteristics, and the technical parameters of the procedures, were collected. The dose area product (DAP) and the maximum skin dose (MSD) were measured by an ionisation chamber (Diamentor; Philips, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and radiosensitive film (Gafchromic; International Specialty Products Advanced Materials Group, Wayne, NJ). Multivariate analyses were used to assess the effects of the factors of interest on dose., RESULTS: The mean MSD and DAP were respectively 389 mGy and 65 Gy cm(-2) for CAs, and 916 mGy and 69 Gy cm(-2) for PTCAs. For 8% of the procedures, the MSD exceeded 2 Gy. Although a linear relationship between the MSD and the DAP was observed for CAs (r=0.93), a simple extrapolation of such a model to PTCAs would lead to an inadequate assessment of the risk, especially for the highest dose values. For PTCAs, the body mass index, the therapeutic complexity, the fluoroscopy time and the number of cine frames were independent explanatory factors of the MSD, whoever the practitioner was. Moreover, the effect of technical factors such as collimation, cinematography settings and X-ray tube orientations on the DAP was shown., CONCLUSION: Optimising the technical options for interventional procedures and training staff on radiation protection might notably reduce the dose and ultimately avoid patient skin lesions.",Excluded
3498,"A new recombined double low restorer line for the Ogu-INRA cms in rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) A major objective of breeders using the Ogu-INRA cytoplasmic male sterility (cms) system in rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) is to obtain double low restorer lines with a shorter introgression and a good agronomic value. The development of low glucosinolate content (low GC) restorer lines often occurs through the deletion of a part of the introgression. One of these lines has lost the radish Pgi-2 allele expression, without recovering that of the rapeseed Pgi-2 allele. This line shows a defect in the meiotic transmission of the restorer gene Rfo and a very poor agronomic value. We initiated a programme to force non-spontaneous recombination between this Rfo-carrying introgression and the rapeseed homologous chromosome from a low GC B. napus line. Gamma ray irradiation was used to induce chromosome breakage just prior meiosis aiming at just such a recombination. Low GC cms plants were crossed with the pollen of irradiated plants that were heterozygous for this introgression. The F 2 families were scored for their vigour, transmission rate of Rfo and female fertility. One family of plants, R2000, showed an improved behaviour for these three traits. This family presented a unique combination of molecular markers when compared to other rapeseed restorers analysed, which suggests that the recombination event allowed the recovery of B. oleracea genetic information that was originally replaced by the radish introgression in the original restorers. This resulted in a duplicated region (originating from radish and B. oleracea) on the chromosome carrying the introgression in the R2000 family. © Springer-Verlag 2005.",Excluded

The aim was to ascertain tumor response and assess prognostic factors., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between May 2002 and June 2011, 37 consecutive patients with esophageal cancer underwent chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery. The numbers of patients in clinical stages IIA/IIIA/IIIB/IIIC were 2/24/7/4, respectively. All were given a dose of 30 Gy in 15 fractions, with concurrent chemotherapy using cisplatin and fluorouracil. Curative surgery was performed a median of 1.2 months after completion of chemoradiotherapy., RESULTS: Based on the findings from surgery, 26 patients (70%) achieved a stage reduction and six patients (16%) had a complete pathological response. The numbers of patients undergoing resections microscopically complete, with microscopically positive margins, and macroscopically positive margins were 33, 3, and 1, respectively.

2901,"Transgenerational effects of preconception paternal contamination with (55)Fe The conjecture that germline mutations induced by radiation exposure before conception may predispose subsequent offspring to cancer remains contentious. Previous experimental studies have shown that preconception paternal irradiation with (239)Pu induces perturbations in the hemopoietic systems of offspring and influences sensitivity to a secondary carcinogen. In the present study, male DBA2 mice were injected intravenously with the Auger electron emitter (55)Fe (4 kBq g(-1)) 18 or 84 days before mating with normal females. Comet analysis showed an increased incidence of DNA strand breaks in sperm from contaminated animals after 84 days, but not after 18 days, indicating spermatogonial rather than spermatid damage. Offspring were either assayed for changes in bone marrow stem cells and committed progenitors or challenged with the chemical carcinogen methyl nitrosourea (MNU, 50 mg/kg) at 10 weeks of age and monitored for the onset of malignancy. Offspring from irradiated fathers had normal peripheral blood profiles, although the stem cell population was amplified in offspring arising from those exposed to (55)Fe at 84 days before conception. Exposure to MNU significantly increased the incidence of lympho-hemopoietic malignancies in offspring from the 84-day group, but not in those from the 18-day group. These findings support the hypothesis that aberrations that are potentially leukemogenic may be transmitted to offspring after radiation damage to the paternal germline.",Excluded
3323,"Proctitis 1 week after stereotactic body radiation therapy for prostate cancer: Implications for clinical trial design Background: Proctitis following prostate cancer radiation therapy is a primary determinant of quality of life (QOL). While previous studies have assessed acute rectal morbidity at 1 month after stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), little data exist on the prevalence and severity of rectal morbidity within the first week following treatment. This study reports the acute bowel morbidity 1 week following prostate SBRT. Material(s) and Method(s): Between May 2013 and August 2014, 103 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer were treated with 35-36.25 Gy in five fractions using robotic SBRT delivered on a prospective clinical trial. Bowel toxicity was graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAEv.4). Bowel QOL was assessed using the EPIC-26 questionnaire bowel domain at baseline, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months. Time-dependent changes in bowel symptoms were statistically compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Clinically significant change was assessed by the minimally important difference (MID) in EPIC score. This was defined as a change of 1/2 standard deviation (SD) from the baseline score. Result(s): One-hundred and three patients with a minimum of 3 months of follow-up were analyzed. The cumulative incidence of acute grade 2 gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity was 23%. There were no acute >= grade 3 bowel toxicities. EPIC bowel summary scores maximally declined at 1 week after SBRT (-13.9, p < 0.0001) before returning to baseline at 3 months after SBRT (+0.03, p = 0.94). Prior to treatment, 4.9% of men reported that their bowel bother was a moderate to big problem. This increased to 28.4% (p < 0.0001) 1 week after SBRT and returned to baseline at 3 months after SBRT (0.0%, p = 0.66). Only the bowel summary and bowel bother score declines at 1 week met the MID threshold for clinically significant change. Conclusion(s): The rate and severity of acute proctitis following prostate SBRT peaked at 1 week after treatment and returned to baseline by 3 months. Toxicity assessment at 1 week can therefore minimize recall bias and should aid in the design of future clinical trials focused on accurately capturing and minimizing acute morbidity following SBRT.Copyright © 2016 Paydar, Cyr, Yung, Lei, Collins, Chen, Suy, Dritschilo, Lynch and Collins.",Excluded

2918,"Stereotactic body radiation therapy for lung metastases from soft tissue sarcoma Purpose: To appraise the role of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in patients with lung metastasis from primary soft tissue sarcoma. Method(s): Twenty-eight patients (51 lesions) were analysed. All patients were in good performance status (1-2 eastern cooperative oncology group (ECOG)), unsuitable for surgical resection, with controlled primary tumour and the number of lung metastases was <=4. In a risk adaptive scheme, the dose prescription was: 30 Gy/1 fr, 60 Gy/3 fr, 60 Gy/8 fr and 48 Gy/4 fr. Treatments were performed with Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy. Clinical outcome was evaluated by thoracic and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan before SBRT and than every 3 months. Toxicity was evaluated with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) scale version 4.0. Result(s): Leiomyosarcoma (36%) and synovial sarcoma (25%) were the most common histologies. Five patients (18%) initially presented with pulmonary metastasis, whereas 23 (82%) developed them at a median time of 51 months (range 11-311 months) from the initial diagnosis. The median follow-up time from initial diagnosis was 65 months (5-139 months) and from SBRT was 21 months (2-80 months). No severe toxicity (grades III-IV) was recorded and no patients required hospitalisation. The actuarial 5-years local control rate (from SBRT treatment) was 96%. Overall survival at 2 and 5 years was 96.2% and 60.5%, respectively. At last follow-up 15 patients (54%) were alive. All other died because of distant progression. Conclusion(s): SBRT provides excellent local control of pulmonary metastasis from soft tissue sarcoma (STS) and may improve survival in selected patients. SBRT should be considered for all patients with pulmonary metastasis (PM) and evaluated in a multidisciplinary team.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2606,"Compartments and cell flows within the mouse haemopoietic system. II. Estimated rates of interchange Part-body irradiated CBA mice were injected with CBA-T6 bone marrow. In this way a predominantly donor population was established in the femora while the marrow of the humeri remained largely (average 94%) of host origin. In animals examined cytologically up to 2 years later, no tendency was observed for the proportion of donor cells in the humeri to increase. Splenectomy had no effect on this. When femoral bone marrow from the experimental mice was injected into lethally (whole-body) irradiated recipients, cells originating from the primary host repopulated the lymph nodes to a disproportionate extent. Equilibration between the cell populations of femora and humeri occurred after re-exposure to 600 rad whole-body irradiation, but not after 100 rad or 350 rad; thus, regeneration of damaged bone marrow involved a significant contribution from extrinsic stem cells only after the highest dose of radiation. The data are compatible with an inflow of at most ten effective stem cells per humerus per day from the blood, and suggest a much lower figure. This means that few if any of the stem cells of peripheral blood enter the bone marrow and found haemopoietic clones. Evidence is adduced for the existence of a proliferating lymphoid sub-population in the bone marrow, contributing some 5-10% of the observed mitoses. The mitotic cells in the lymph nodes are replaced from marrow-derived progenitors at an estimated rate of 4-5%/day. The relevant data for the thymus are more variable, but suggest an average figure of 8-11%/day. Earlier data from mouse parabionts suggest a lower rate of inflow to the thymus.",Excluded

Risk was related strongly to lifetime solar radiation (odds ratio [OR] = 13.5 for highest quartile of exposure, 95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 4.5-40.6, P trend < 0.0001) and time spent outdoors (OR = 4.7 for highest quartile of average yearly hours, CI = 1.9-12.1, P trend = 0.01). Further, among women with high lifetime solar-radiation exposure, those who used lip protection once a day or less had twice the risk of lip cancer than women who used lip protection more than once a day (OR = 7.3, CI = 1.9-27.2 cf OR = 3.2, CI = 1.1-9.2). These findings show that solar radiation is a major risk factor for lip cancer and suggest that lip sunscreening is protective, thereby supporting the hypothesis that use of lipstick and other sunscreening agents by women has contributed to their lower incidence of this disease.",Excluded
3166,"Significant correlations between human cortical bone mineral density and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) obtained with 3D Cones ultrashort echo time magnetic resonance imaging (UTE-MRI) PURPOSE: Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) MRI is a tool that can characterize changes in susceptibility, an intrinsic property which is associated with compositional changes in the tissue. Current QSM estimation of cortical bone is challenging because conventional clinical MRI cannot acquire signal in cortical bone. This study aimed to implement Cones 3D ultrashort echo time MRI (UTE-MRI) for ex vivo QSM measurements in human tibial cortical bone, investigating the correlations of QSM with volumetric intracortical bone mineral density (BMD)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine tibial midshaft cortical bone specimens (25mm long specimens cut at the mid-point of tibial shaft, 67+/-20years old, 5 women and 4 men) were scanned on a clinical 3T MRI scanner for QSM measurement. The specimens were also scanned on a high-resolution micro-computed tomography (muCT) scanner for volumetric BMD estimation. QSM and muCT results were compared at approximately nine regions of interest (ROIs) per specimen., RESULTS: Average 3D UTE-MRI QSM showed significantly strong correlation with volumetric BMD (R=-0.82, P<0.01) and bone porosity (R=0.72, P<0.01). Combining all data points together (77 ROIs), QSM showed significant moderate to strong correlation with volumetric BMD after correction for interdependencies in specimens (R=-0.70, P<0.01). The corrections were required because the data points were not independent in each specimen. Similarly, the correlation between QSM and porosity was significant (R=0.68, P<0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the Cones 3D UTE-MRI QSM technique can potentially serve as a novel and accurate tool to assess intracortical bone mineral density whilst avoiding ionizing radiation.

The method of hypoxic radiotherapy of stomach cancer is described. The authors present some data on radiation reactions, tumor regression, the condition of tumorous and normal tissue after radiotherapy under the conditions of hypoxia which permitted an increase in a tumor radiation dose and a decrease in the number and gravity of radiation reactions. The above method of large field preoperative irradiation made it possible to improve short-term results of combined therapy of stomach cancer patients.",Excluded
2842,"Associations between urologist financial incentives and imaging use INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Diagnostic imaging use has risen over the last decade contributing to health care costs, as well as patient exposure to ionizing radiation. While studies have examined the role of patient factors in these imaging trends, little is known about how physician financial incentives influence imaging use. Motivated by this, we investigated associations between urologists' imaging use and factors on which their compensation is based. METHOD(S): We analyzed data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. Through specialty codes, we identified those visits to urology clinics. Using explicit codes from the patient record form, we determined the proportion of urology visits at which imaging was ordered. During their induction interview, participating providers indicate if they are full-or part-owners, employees or independent contractors at the office location where they see the most ambulatory patients. Physicians are also asked if their clinical productivity, patient satisfaction or quality of care is taken into account for their compensation (e.g., bonuses). We performed multivariable regression to determine if a patient's receipt of imaging was associated with these financial incentives. RESULT(S): Between 2006 and 2007, over 37 million outpatient visits were made to urologists, during 22.4% (95% CI, 19.0-26.2%) of which imaging was ordered. Imaging was ordered at 24.2% (95% CI, 20.8 - 28.1%) of visits to owners, compared to 13.2% (95% CI, 9.2 - 18.6%) of visits to nonowners (P<0.001). Imaging was ordered at a higher proportion of visits to urologists with clinical productivity incentives vs. those without (27.3% [95% CI, 22.4 - 32.7%] vs. 20.8% [95% CI, 16.8 - 25.4%], P=0.049). The odds of having an imaging study ordered were 2-fold greater at an owner's office (p = 0.001). Visits to urologists with productivity incentives had a 43% higher odds of imaging (p = 0.05). These associations persisted after adjusting for patient characteristics (age, sex, race, comorbidity, urban/rural residence) and geographic region (Table). No association was found for financial incentives related to patient satisfaction or clinical quality. CONCLUSION(S): Independent of patient characteristics, imaging use at ambulatory urology visits is associated with provider financial incentives. (Table Presented).",Excluded
2633,"Occupational exposure to electromagnetic field and breast cancer risk in a large, population-based, case-control study in the United States OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate women who were occupationally exposed to electromagnetic fields (EMF) and breast cancer risk. METHOD(S): Women diagnosed with breast cancer (n = 6213) and randomly selected age-matched control subjects (n = 7390) provided breast cancer risk factor information and occupational history. A qualified industrial hygienist classified each job for EMF exposure as background, low, medium, or high. RESULT(S): When compared with the referent of background exposure, the odds ratio adjusted for age and state of residence was 1.06 (95% CI = 0.99-1.14) for low exposure, 1.09 (95% CI = 0.96-1.23) for medium exposure, and 1.16 (95% CI = 0.90-1.50) for high exposure. CONCLUSION(S): Our findings, taken together with previous epidemiological studies, suggest that exposure to EMF in the workplace may be associated with a slight elevation in breast cancer risk. ©2007The American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine.",Excluded
3065,"Preoperative oxaliplatin, capecitabine, and external beam radiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed, primary operable, cT3NxMo, low rectal cancer: A phase II study Purpose: In patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC), preoperative chemoradiation is known to improve local control, and down-staging of the tumor serves as a surrogate for survival. Intensification of the systemic therapy may lead to higher down- staging rates and, thus, enhance survival. This phase II study investigated the efficacy and safety of preoperative capecitabine and oxaliplatin in combination with radiotherapy. Patients and Methods: Patients with LARC of the mid and lower rectum, T3NxM0 staged by MRI received radiotherapy (total dose 45 Gy) in combination with oral capecitabine (825 mg/m2 twice a day on radiotherapy days; weeks 1-4) and oxaliplatin 50 mg/m2 intravenously (days 1, 8, 15, and 22). Efficacy was evaluated as rate of tumor down-categorization at the T level. Result(s): A total of 59 patients were enrolled (19 women, 40 men; median age of 61 years) and all were evaluable for efficacy and toxicity. Down-categorization at the T level was observed in 53% with pathological complete response in 6 patients (10%). Actual total radiotherapy, oxaliplatin and capecitabine doses received were 97%, 90%, and 93% of the protocol-specified preplanned doses, respectively. Grade 3/4 toxicity was observed in 15 patients (25%). The most frequent was diarrhea (12%). Conclusion(s): Preoperative chemoradiation with capecitabine and oxaliplatin is feasible in patients with MRI-proven cT3 LARC. The only clinically relevant toxicity was diarrhea. Overall, efficacy of the multimodality treatment was good, but not markedly exceeding that of 5-FU- or capecitabine-based chemoradiation approaches. © Urban & Vogel.",Excluded

In this clinical trial, 150 consecutive patients were randomized into three groups: (a) Dose escalation, 1500 SW at 18 kV, followed by 1500 SW at 20 kV then 1500 SW at 22 kV. (b) Constant dose, 4500 SW at 20 kV. All patients undergo plain X-ray film of the urinary tract at day 1, 14, and 90 to assess stone-free rate (SFR) which was defined as no stones or painless fragments less than 4 mm. (c) Dose reduction, 1500 SW at 22 kV, followed by 1500 SW at 20 kV and then 1500 SW at 18 kV. The three treatment groups were comparable in terms of age, sex, stone size and distribution of the kidneys, and the need for Double J stent use. On day 90, the SFR achieved was 82, 90, and 84 % in the escalating, constant, and reduction energy groups, respectively. However, this rate was not statistically significant (x 2 = 1.38, p level = 0.28). At a slow rate of 60 shocks, there was no difference in stone-free rate between different voltages at 1, 14, and 90 days.

Method(s): Adult patients with isolated fresh unstable metacarpal and phalangeal fractures who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled into this prospective study from July 2013. Patients were divided into ATLPS or AIM groups when they were admitted to our department after considering their work requirement, fracture complexity, and surgeon's experience and were then treated accordingly. Relevant demographic, clinical and preoperative clinical data were collected and analyzed. Clinical examination and radiograph evaluation were performed 1 week and 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively. Outcome measures were visual analog scale (VAS) scores for pain, total range of motion (ROM) of the injured digit, Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand scores (Quick-DASH) and grip strength (percentage of the contralateral corresponding digit). Result(s): From July 2013 to September 2014, 76 patients were treated by AIM and 71 by ATLPS. Age, sex, time from injury to operation, dominant hand, injury mechanism, fracture location, fracture type and participant occupation were similar in both groups (P > 0.05). Operations were all performed well and followed by uneventful postoperative functional recoveries. At 3-month follow-up, all clinical outcomes were significantly better in the AIM than ATLPS group (P < 0.05) except for VAS pain scores. However, at 6-month follow-up, the differences were no longer significant, indicating similar results for both types of fixation. Patients in the AIM group developed significantly more complications (P = 0.037). Sick leave was significantly longer in the AIM group (P = 0.02). Conclusion(s): AIM outperforms ATLPS in the treatment of unstable metacarpal and phalangeal fractures in the early, but not the later, postoperative period; the latter is associated with significantly more complications. Patients treated by ATLPS require shorter sick leave, which is of particular benefit to workers with specialized manual skills.Copyright © 2016 Chinese Orthopaedic Association and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",Excluded
2538,"Stereotactic body radiation therapy with concurrent full-dose gemcitabine for locally advanced pancreatic cancer: A pilot trial demonstrating safety Background: Concurrent chemoradiation is a standard option for locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC). Concurrent conventional radiation with full-dose gemcitabine has significant toxicity. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) may provide the opportunity to administer radiation in a shorter time frame with similar efficacy and reduced toxicity. This Pilot study assessed the safety of concurrent full-dose gemcitabine with SBRT for LAPC. Method(s): Patients received gemcitabine, 1000 mg/m2 for 6 cycles. During week 4 of cycle 1, patients received SBRT (25 Gy delivered in five consecutive daily fractions of 5 Gy prescribed to the 75-83% isodose line). Acute and late toxicities were assessed using NIH CTCAE v3. Tumor response was assessed by RECIST. Patients underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy at baseline, 2, and 6 months to assess the duodenal mucosa. Quality of life (QoL) data was collected before and after treatment using the QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PAN26 questionnaires. Result(s): Between September 2009 and February 2011, 11 patients enrolled with one withdrawal during radiation therapy. Patients had grade 1 to 2 gastrointestinal toxicity from the start of SBRT to 2 weeks after treatment. There were no grade 3 or greater radiation-related toxicities or delays for cycle 2 of gemcitabine. On endoscopy, there were no grade 2 or higher mucosal toxicities. Two patients had a partial response. The median progression free and overall survival were 6.8 and 12.2 months, respectively. Global QoL did not change between baseline and immediately after radiation treatment. Conclusion(s): SBRT with concurrent full dose gemcitabine is safe when administered to patients with LAPC. There is no delay in administration of radiation or chemotherapy, and radiation is completed with minimal toxicity. © 2013 Gurka et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded

Our report presents a 7-year update on treatment toxicity and quality of life (QOL) from 515 patients treated with prostate SBRT. Method(s): From 2006 to 2009, 515 patients with clinically localized, low-, intermediate-, and high-risk prostate cancer were treated with SBRT using Cyberknife technology. Treatment consisted of 35-36.25 Gy in 5 fractions. Seventy-two patients received hormone therapy. Toxicity was assessed at each follow-up visit using the expanded prostate cancer index composite (EPIC) questionnaire and the radiation therapy oncology group urinary and rectal toxicity scale. Result(s): Median follow-up was 72 months. The actuarial 7-year freedom from biochemical failure was 95.8, 89.3, and 68.5% for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, respectively (p < 0.001). No patients experienced acute Grade 3 or 4 acute complications. Fewer than 5% of patients had any acute Grade 2 urinary or rectal toxicity. Late toxicity was low, with Grade 2 rectal and urinary toxicity of 4 and 9.1%, respectively, and Grade 3 urinary toxicity of 1.7%. Mean EPIC urinary and bowel QOL declined at 1 month post-treatment, returned to baseline by 2 years and remained stable thereafter. EPIC sexual QOL declined by 23% at 6-12 months and remained stable afterwards. Of patients potent at baseline evaluation, 67% remained potent at last follow-up. Conclusion(s): This study suggests that SBRT, when administered to doses of 35-36.25 Gy, is efficacious and safe. With long-term follow-up in our large patient cohort, we continue to find low rates of late toxicity and excellent rates of biochemical control.Copyright © 2014 Katz and Kang.",Excluded

2893,"Change in fibroblast growth factor 2 expression as an early phase radiotherapy-responsive marker in sequential biopsy samples from patients with cervical cancer during fractionated radiotherapy Background: The authors previously demonstrated that fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) expression levels in tumor cells (FGF2-T) may be an indicator of the efficacy of radiotherapy in patients with cervical cancer (CC). In the current study, this finding was extended in newly enrolled patients and was investigated further in stromal FGF2 (FGF2-S) expression. Method(s): Sixty-nine patients with CC were recruited as a validation set for the immunohistochemical detection of FGF2-T from biopsy samples that were taken before (pretreatment) or 1 week after the initiation of radiotherapy (midtreatment). The authors also investigated the expression of FGF2 in tumor FGF2-S and investigated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31) (also called platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule) in these patients and in an additional 35 patients from a previous study. Result(s): FGF2 expression was detected in tumor cells from all patients and in stromal cells from 87% of patients. FGF2-T was significantly higher in midtreatment samples (P =.0002), and a high ratio of midtreatment/pretreatment FGF2-T was related significantly to a better prognosis (P =.025). Increased VEGF expression after the initiation of radiotherapy was related significantly to positive FGF2-S in pretreatment samples (P =.035); however, it was not related to prognosis or microvessel density detected by CD31 expression. Conclusion(s): Radiation causes a response in tumor cells and adjacent normal cells and changes the extracellular matrix environment. In this study, the authors confirmed their previous findings and demonstrated that changes in FGF2-T expression may be used as a marker to monitor the effectiveness of radiotherapy in patients with CC. These findings should improve patient selection for molecular targeted therapies, such as cytokine inhibitors, after standard-of-care treatment. © 2010 American Cancer Society.",Excluded

Methods and Materials: Between January 1970 and August 1982, 45 patients with locally advanced carcinoma of the larynx were treated with primary radiation using a unique hypofractionated schedule of 2 fractions of 11 Gy separated by 21 days, with concomitant HBO-4 during each radiotherapy session. To avoid seizures, discomfort and other complications of HBO-4, each session was performed under general anesthesia. All patients had pathologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of the glottic (23) or supraglottic larynx (22) and were staged as follows: T2-5, T3-24, T-4-16; N0-26, N1-4, N2-13, N3-1. Patients were treated with opposed lateral wedged fields of 4-6MV photons, with a median field size of 5.5 x 9.75 to a total median dose of 22.5 Gy. Result(s): As of February 1998, follow-up was complete on all but one patient, who relocated to another country after 8 years. Complete clinical responses were observed in 39 (87%) of the cases. The 10-year local control rate for all 45 patients was 58%, and local control for the complete responders was 69%. Three patients underwent laryngectomy for complications and were found to have no pathological evidence of disease in the laryngectomy specimen. The 10-year survival of the overall population was 27%. The 10-year voice preservation rate for the the 39 complete responders was 55%. Acute mucosal and skin reactions were modest and acceptable. Significant late complications occurred in 14 patients consisting of severe fibrosis, necrosis, pharyngeal fistula, with 3 patients requiring laryngectomy for complications. The actuarial rate of severe complications at 5 years was 42%. Conclusion(s): The response rate and long-term tumor control rate obtained with this treatment program were comparable to more protracted radiation schedules with or without systemic chemotherapy. The complication rate was high resulting in an adverse therapeutic ratio. The radiobiologic interpretation of this clinical data, and implications for hypoxia directed therapy, are discussed.",Excluded

After the first sign of corneal angiogenesis was noted, the corneal region was irradiated with a dose of 10 Gy or 20 Gy. The control rabbits received no irradiation. The eyes were examined by slitlamp biomicroscopy and photographed, over a period of 28 days. The maximum length and total surface area of corneal angiogenesis were quantified by computerized image analysis., RESULTS: Corneal angiogenesis was noted on day 3 following implantation of the hydrogel sheet. In the rabbits irradiated with 10 Gy, the maximum length and total surface area of corneal angiogenesis were both significantly lower on day 4 and 7 following irradiation, compared to the respective measurement in the controls. In the rabbits irradiated with 20 Gy, the maximum length and total surface area of corneal angiogenesis were significantly lower between days 4 and 21, and between days 4 and 14, respectively, compared to the respective measurement in the controls., CONCLUSIONS: Focal X-ray irradiation to the corneal region suppressed corneal angiogenesis in a dose-dependent manner.

2577,"Accelerated hyperfractionated radiotherapy combined with induction and concomitant chemotherapy for inoperable non-small-cell lung cancer: Impact of total treatment time Tumour cell proliferation during conventionally fractionated radiotherapy (RT) can negatively influence the treatment outcome in patients with unresectable non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Accelerated and hyperfractionated RT may therefore have an advantage over conventional RT. Moreover, earlier studies have suggested improved survival with addition of cisplatin-based chemotherapy (CT). We present here the results of combined treatment with induction and concomitant CT and accelerated hyperfractionated RT in a retrospective series of patients with advanced NSCLC. Between August 1990 and August 1995, 90 consecutive patients, aged 42-77 years (median 63 years), with locally advanced unresectable or medically inoperable NSCLC and good performance status were referred for treatment: stage: I 23%, IIIa 37%, IIIb 40%. Patients histologies included: squamous cell carcinoma 52%, adenocarcinoma 34% and large cell carcinoma 13%. The treatment consisted of two courses of CT (cisplatin 100 mg/m2 day 1 and etoposide 100 mg/m2 day 1- 3 i.v.), the second course given concomitantly with RT. The total RT dose was 61.2-64.6 Gy, with two daily fractions of 1.7 Gy. A one-week interval was introduced after 40.8 Gy to reduce acute toxicity, making the total treatment time 4.5 weeks. Concerning toxicity, 33 patients had febrile neutropenia, 10 patients suffered from grade III oesophagitis and 7 patients had grade III pneumonitis. There were two possible treatment-related deaths, one due to myocardial infarction and the other due to a pneumocystis carinii infection. The 1-, 2- and 3-year overall survival rates were 72%, 46% and 34%, respectively; median survival was 21.3 months. Fifty-one patients had progressive disease: 21 failed locoregionally, 29 had distant metastases and 9 patients had a combination of these. Pretreatment weight loss was the only prognostic factor found, except for stage. However, the results for stage IIIb were no different from those for stage IIIa.

METHOD(S): Twenty-two patients (6 men, 16 women - mean age 77.6+/-2), previously operated for pancreatic adeno-carcinoma with suspected disease recurrence (increased CA19.9 > 40U/ml) were enrolled. Both PET and CT were performed in all cases. After visual analysis, maximum Standardized Uptake Values (SUVmax) of PET focal uptakes were calculated. PET data were compared to CT findings. The value of serum CA19.9 was also compared with the SUVmax obtained from each patient (in case of a patient with multiple lesions we considered the one with greater SUV max). RESULT(S): Out of 22 patients enrolled, 5 (22.7%) negative results at both PET and CT. In the 17 positive cases (77.3%) PET overall showed 26 areas of focal uptake divided as follow: 3 in pancreatic bed, 9 hepatic, 2 pulmonary, 9 nodal (7 sub diaphragmatic, 2 supra diaphragmatic) and 3 peritoneal. On the other hand CT overall showed 50 areas of contrast enhancement divided as follow: 1 in pancreatic bed, 6 in bone, 19 hepatic, 5 pulmonary, 17 nodal (12 sub diaphragmatic, 5 supra diaphragmatic), 1 peritoneal and 1 in adrenal gland. From the comparison between CA19.9 and SUVmax obtained for each patients, in 12 out of 17 positive PET cases we observed a statistically significant correlation (p<0, 05) between CA 19.9 trend and SUVmax. Five patients (22, 7%) with positive PET showed a not significant correlation between CA19.9 and SUVmax trend. The five cases with negative both PET and CT showed lower CA 19.9 levels than patients with positive PET. CONCLUSION(S): In patients with suspected pancreatic adeno-carcinoma relapse after surgery, PET reliably detected local and peritoneal recurrences, whereas CT seemed to be more sensitive for the detection of hepatic, bone, nodal and lung metastases. Although less reliable in the identification of lymph nodes, PET is able to clearly highlight mediastinal lymph nodes. Furthermore, PET does not appear to be advantageous for the detection of non locoregional and extra-abdominal recurrences. Our experience showed a significant direct correlation between CA 19.9 increase and SUVmax. Negative PET and CT cases with positive CA19.9 are probably due to the small size of recurrent disease. To confirm our data an improvement in casuistry is required.",Excluded

Measured values were compared to data from a prospective study performed at the same center in the years of 2012 and 2013 before a dose reduction program had been implemented. Result(s): A total of 181 consecutive patients underwent an endovascular procedure in the hybrid operating room. The mean unprotected eye lens dose of the main operator was 0.119 muSv for EVAR (n=30), 0.118 muSv for TEVAR (n=23), 0.312 muSv for more complex aortic procedures (F/BrEVAR; n=15) and 0.046 muSv for peripheral interventions. Compared to the control period, EVAR had 75% lower, TEVAR 79% lower and more complex aortic procedures 55% lower radiation exposure unprotected eye lens of the operator. The 0.75mm lead equivalent glasses led to a median reduction of the exposure to the eye lens by the factor 3.43. Behind the lead glasses at the level of the eye lens, radiation exposure exceeding the detection limit of 0.042 muSv was measured only in 22 of 181 cases. There was a significant correlation between DAP between both protected and unprotected eye lens dose (p<0.0001, r2 = 0.512 and 0.282). DAP correlated significantly with patients' body mass index, operating time, fluoroscopy time and digital subtraction angiography time. Conclusion(s): The dose reduction program at our institution has led to a relevant reduction of the radiation dose to the head and the eye lens of the main operator in endovascular procedures. With optimum radiation protection measures including a ceiling-mounted shield and 0.75mm lead equivalent glasses, more than 440 EVARs, 280 TEVARs or 128 FEVARs could be performed per year until the dose limit for the eye lens of 20 muSv would be reached.",Excluded
2505,"A clinical and proteomics approach to predict the presence of obstructive peripheral arterial disease: From the Catheter Sampled Blood Archive in Cardiovascular Diseases (CASABLANCA) Study BACKGROUND: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a global health problem that is frequently underdiagnosed and undertreated. Noninvasive tools to predict the presence and severity of PAD have limitations including inaccuracy, cost, or need for intravenous contrast and ionizing radiation., HYPOTHESIS: A clinical/biomarker score may offer an attractive alternative diagnostic method for PAD., METHODS: In a prospective cohort of 354 patients referred for diagnostic peripheral and/or coronary angiography, predictors of >=50% stenosis in >=1 peripheral vessel (carotid/subclavian, renal, or lower extremity arteries) were identified from >50 clinical variables and 109 biomarkers. Machine learning identified variables predictive of obstructive PAD; a score derived from the final model was developed., RESULTS: The score consisted of 1 clinical variable (history of hypertension) and 6 biomarkers (midkine, kidney injury molecule-1, interleukin-23, follicle-stimulating hormone, angiopoietin-1, and eotaxin-1). The model had an in-sample area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.85 for obstructive PAD and a cross-validated area under the curve of 0.84; higher scores were associated with greater severity of angiographic stenosis. At optimal cutoff, the score had 65% sensitivity, 88% specificity, 76% positive predictive value (PPV), and 81% negative predictive value (NPV) for obstructive PAD and performed consistently across vascular territories. Partitioning the score into 5 levels resulted in a PPV of 86% and NPV of 98% in the highest and lowest levels, respectively. Elevated score was associated with shorter time to revascularization during 4.3 years of follow-up., CONCLUSIONS: A clinical/biomarker score demonstrates high accuracy for predicting the presence of PAD.

3040,"An analysis of anatomy image information on slice thickness variation in orbital CT scan examination Background: In contrast to the literature, orbital CT scans at the hospital used a 1.25 mm thick slice, then reconstructed with a slice thickness according to the clinical setting. Aim(s): This research aimed to determine the anatomical image of orbital CT scan in slice thickness variations and determine the value of slice thickness, which produced optimal anatomical image information. Method(s): It was experimental research. There were 15 patients with orbital CT scans whose slice thickness was made into a 1.25 mm data row. The data row was then reconstructed with slice thickness variations into 1.25 mm, 2 mm, 2.5 mm, 3 mm, 4 mm, and 5 mm. Information clarity about anatomical imagery was assessed, including Nasal Bone, Optic Nerve, Sinus Ethmoidalis, Sinus Sphenoidalis, Lacrimal Bone, Cornea, Lens, Globe, and Sclera. Data analysis with Spearman test and Friedman test showed a = 5%. Result(s): There is a difference in information on anatomical images of orbital CT scan in Slice thickness variations with p-value <0.023. 2.5 mm slice thickness results in the most optimal anatomical image information with mean rank = 5.50. Slice thick 3 mm can be used as an alternative to getting the same anatomical image information with a smaller radiation dose.Copyright © 2021 Lahore Medical And Dental College.

3189,"Radiation therapy for intrahepatic recurrence after hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma BACKGROUND: The intrahepatic recurrence rate after curative hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is high, and management of recurrence is thus important for long-term survival. The use of radiation therapy has been relatively uncommon in the treatment of recurrent HCC., METHODS: Eight patients underwent radiation therapy for recurrent HCC 12-98 months after hepatectomy. Five of them were treated with protons (250 MeV; 68.8-84.5 Gy), and three were treated with X-rays (6 MV; 60 or 70 Gy). One patient received radiation therapy twice for another lesion with a 79-month interval. The target tumors were 1.2-4.5 cm. All patients also underwent transcatheter arterial embolization or other regional therapy., RESULTS: Although transient ascites was found in three patients after radiation therapy, no patient died as a result of the irradiation. Seven patients died 9 months to 4 years (median 1 year 6 months) after radiation therapy. Re-recurrence was observed in the irradiated liver in two patients (local control 78%). Four patients died of lung metastasis after radiation therapy. The median survival time was 3 years 3 months (range 1 year 1 month to 8 years 6 months) after recurrence., CONCLUSION: Multimodality therapy is necessary for the management of recurrence. Radiation therapy could be beneficial when other therapies present some difficulty regarding application or are performed incompletely. It must be emphasized that radiation therapy should be considered in addition to other regional therapies for the treatment of recurrent or re-recurrent HCC, and that radiation therapy can be repeated in selected patients.",Excluded
2977,"Skull-base invasion of nasopharyngeal carcinoma: Magnetic resonance imaging findings and therapeutic implications Purpose: To evaluate the value of skull-base abnormality on MRI for predicting local recurrence in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Material(s) and Method(s): Between November 1988 and February 1997, 48 patients with NPC were examined with both MRI (1.5 T) and CT prior to radiation therapy. T classification (1987 UICC) based on physical examination and CT findings were T1 in 3 cases, T2 in 22, T3 in 9, and T4 in 14. On MRI, low-intensity tissue with Gd enhancement in the marrow of the skull was considered to be a suspicious finding of skull-base invasion. CT simulation was performed in all patients. The total dose to the primary tumor was 60-75 Gy (mean, 67 Gy). The mean follow-up period was 42 months. Result(s): All 14 T4 patients had abnormal tissue in the marrow of the skull base on MRI. Thirty-eight percent (13 of 34) of T1-3 patients were suspected to have skull-base invasion based on MRI (0% for T1, 27% [6 of 22] for T2, and 78% [7 of 9] for T3). The 5-year local control rate was significantly different between T1-3 and T4 tumors (97% vs. 69%, p < 0.025) but was not different by the presence of the MRI abnormality in the skull base. Conclusion(s): Skull-base invasion suspected solely by MRI does not relate to local recurrence provided that careful treatment planning is performed with the aid of MRI and CT simulator.

3116,"Clinical and radiological manifestations of pleural effusion at the UMAE No. 34, Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Mexico Introduction: Many benign and malignant diseases can cause pleural effusion. Symptoms depend on the amount of accumulated fluid and the underlying cause. Imaging studies are useful in the detection and management of pleural effusions. Objective(s): To determine the radiological characteristics of pleural effusion and its relationship with clinical and biochemical manifestations and histological markers. Method(s): From March 2011 to March 2012, an observational, descriptive, prolective analytical study was performed. Chest X-rays of 138 patients > 15 years of age with pleural effusion during the study period were reviewed. Radiological studies were interpreted by three pulmonologists blinded to the underlying pathology (kappa. 95). We used the statistical package SPSS 19.0. Statistical significance was considered when p value was < 0.05. Result(s): The mean age of the study group was 56.1 +/- 15.8 years; 93 (67.4%) were males. The most common signs and symptoms regardless of the etiology were dyspnea, 108 cases (78.2%) (p = 0.033); cough, 96 (69.5%); weight loss, 82 (59.4%) (p = 0.042); and pain, 79 (57.2%). The most common X-ray pattern was massive effusion in 46 (33%) followed by loculated effusion in 33 (24%). There was a unilateral predominance in 119 (86%) patients, with greater frequency in those with infectious (p = 0.012) and neoplastic etiology (p = 0.006).

2949,"Low-dose computed tomography versus plain abdominal radiography in the investigation of an acute abdomen Background: To compare low-dose abdominal computed tomography (LDCT) with plain abdominal radiography (AR) in the primary investigation of acute abdominal pain to determine if there is a difference in diagnostic yield, the number of additional investigations required and hospital length of stay (LOS). Method(s): This randomized controlled trial was approved by the institutional review board, and informed consent was obtained. Patients presenting to the emergency department with an acute abdomen and who would normally be investigated with AR were randomized to either AR or LDCT. The estimated radiation dose of the LDCT protocol was 2-3mSv compared to 1.1mSv for AR. Pearson's chi-square and the independent samples t-test were used for the statistical analysis. Result(s): A total of 142 patients were eligible, and after exclusions and omitting those with incomplete data, 55 patients remained for analysis in the AR arm and 53 in the LDCT arm. A diagnosis could be obtained in 12 (21.8%) patients investigated with AR compared to 34 (64.2%) for LDCT (P < 0.001). Twenty-eight (50.9%) patients in the AR group required further imaging during their admission compared to 14 (26.4%) in the LDCT group (P= 0.009). There was no difference in the median hospital LOS (3.84 days for AR versus 4.24 days for LDCT, P= 0.83). Conclusion(s): LDCT demonstrates a superior diagnostic yield over AR and reduces the number of subsequent imaging tests for a minimal cost in radiation exposure.

The endpoint was equivalence between PET/MRI and PET/CT in correctly defining the revised Ann Arbor staging system. Seventy consecutive patients with classical-HL were prospectively investigated for nodal and extra-nodal involvement during pretreatment staging with same-day PET/CT and PET/MRI. Findings indicative of malignancy with the imaging procedures were regarded as lymphoma infiltration; in case of discrepancy, positive-biopsy and/or response to treatment were evidenced as lymphoma. Sixty of the 70 (86%) patients were evaluable having completed the staging program. Disease staging based on either PET/MRI or PET/CT was correct for 54 of the 60 patients (90% vs. 90%), with difference between proportions of 0.0 (95% CI, -9 to 9%; P=0.034 for the equivalence test). As compared with reference standard, invasion of lymph nodes was identified with PET/MRI in 100% and with PET/CT in 100%, of the spleen with PET/MRI in 66% and PET/CT in 55%, of the lung with PET/MRI in 60% and PET/CT in 100%, of the liver with PET/MRI in 67% and PET/CT in 100%, and of the bone with PET/MRI in 100% and PET/CT in 50%. The only statistically significant difference between PET/MRI and PET/CT was observed in bony infiltration detection rates.

3289,"Detection of renal dysfunction by point-of-care creatinine testing in patients undergoing peripheral MR angiography OBJECTIVE. The objective of our study was to analyze the effectiveness of prestudy questionnaires in identifying at-risk patients and estimate the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), nephrogenic systemic fibrosis risk factors, and other comorbidities in patients scheduled to undergo lower extremity MR angiography (MRA) studies using gadoliniumbased contrast agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Patent demographics, comorbidities, contrast type, and point-of-care (POC) serum creatinine values were recorded from the medical records of consecutive patients undergoing lower extremity MRA examinations in a single year. Patients were divided into groups by CKD stage (non-CKD, stage III, stage IV, or stage V) on the basis of estimated glomerular filtration rate values determined from POC creatinine results. Patient awareness of a history of CKD was noted if patients admitted to any form of CKD on prestudy questionnaires. RESULTS. Of 199 patients, 72 patients (36.2%) had stage III CKD, six patients (3.0%) had stage IV CKD, and seven patients (3.5%) had stage V CKD. Comorbidities - including smoking status, transplant status, and presence of diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease - as well as administered contrast type and dosage showed significant differences among the CKD groups (p < 0.05). Only five stage III patients (7%) were aware of any history of renal dysfunction, whereas three stage IV patients (50%) and seven stage V patients (100%) admitted any history of renal dysfunction via questionnaires. CONCLUSION. Compared with POC creatinine testing, a prestudy questionnaire used alone is ineffective in identifying all patients with histories of CKD who are scheduled to undergo gadolinium-based peripheral MRA studies. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded
3705,"Alveolar hemorrhage (AH) in ANCA-associated vasculitis: Characteristics and prognostic factors in 65 patients AH can be a mild or a life-threatening sign of ANCA-associated vasculitis, but its prognostic impact and specific characteristics have not been determined. To do so, we retrospectively analyzed AH episodes that occurred, between 1991 and 2010, in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis entered in the FVSG database. Patients and Methods: We selected confirmed AH cases, as assessed by the presence of hemoptysis and ground-glass images on X-rays or CT scans and/or bloody bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Renal insufficiency was defined as creatininemia >150 mmol/l. Severity criteria were: hypoxia, Hb decline >1 g/dl over 48 h after AH occurred and requiring mechanical ventilation. Result(s): For the 65 cases (35 men and 30 women) analyzed, their mean age at the 1stAH episode was 53 years. ANCA-associated vasculitis diagnoses were: 55% Wegener's granulomatosis (WG), 34% microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and 9% Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS). Pre-AH hemoptysis occurred in 41 (63%) patients: 39% the week preceding, 29.3% 2-4 weeks before and 19.5% >1 month prior to AH diagnosis, which led to ANCA-associated vasculitis diagnosis for 45 (69.2%) patients. Among 10 (15.4%) patients (4 WG, 4 MPA, 2 CSS) requiring mechanical ventilation, 4 had hemoptysis previously. Twenty-three (35%) patients were hypoxic and 23 (35%) had major Hb decreases; 36 (55%) had concomitant renal insufficiency (pulmo-renal syndrome): 18 WG (51% of all WG) and 18 MPA (81% of all MPA). Paucimmune glomerulonephritis was seen in 31/33 kidney biopsies. Intriguingly, no CSS patient had renal impairment when AH occurred. Treatments included a combination of corticosteroids and intravenous cyclophosphamide (CYC) for 55 (85%) patients; oral CYC was used in 5, methotrexate in 4 and plasma exchange in 7. Rituximab and remicade were prescribed to 1 patient each. Mean time between AH and treatment onset was 5.87 (range 0-60) days. Mean follow-up was 8.3 years (range 1 month-19 years). Follow-up information was not available for 8 patients. A total of 38 (58%) patients relapsed: 7 with AH and other organ involvement, 21 with non-AH manifestation(s) and 10 with AH alone. Three patients underwent kidney transplantation. The 13 (20%) deaths (6 WG and 7 MPA) were attributed to: septic shock for 4, lung cancer for 2, and 1 each of the following: bladder cancer, AH, sudden death, hemorrhagic stroke, ARDS due to misplaced nasogastric tube and probably drug-related (methotrexate). Although 9/13 patients with pulmo-renal syndrome died, no death resulted directly from the initial AH. Conclusion(s): These findings highlight the importance of recognizing premonitory hemoptysis as an early sign of AH in ANCA-associated vasculitides, since 63% of the cohort patients had bloody sputum before AH was diagnosed. Also, patients with AH and renal insufficiency have poorer survival prognoses. As demonstrated by the five-factor score, AH alone is not predictive poor prognosis; conversely, kidney involvement dictates a poor outcome.",Excluded

2810,"Leukopenia is a biomarker for effective temozolomide dosing and predicts overall survival of patients with glioblastoma The median survival time of patients with glioblastoma is 14-16 months with a 5-year overall survival rate of 9.8%. Standard of care treatment includes radiation with concomitant temozolomide followed by cyclic temozolomide. If the patient develops myelosuppression (thrombocytopenia, leukopenia or anemia), the dose of temozolomide is reduced or stopped to avoid bleeding or infections. Recent studies have demonstrated that mild leukopenia is associated with increased overall survival in patients with glioblastoma. To confirm prior results showing that leukopenia is associated with increased overall survival as a primary outcome in patients with glioblastoma, the present study retrospectively collected complete blood counts from 141 patients with glioblastoma treated at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Boston, USA) between January 2012 and December 2017. According to Kaplan-Meier analysis with a log-rank test, the presence of leukopenia was associated with increased overall survival (P=0.008). Furthermore, patients with grade 2 leukopenia (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0) survived longer than those without myelosuppression (P=0.024). There was no difference in overall survival between patients with grade 1, 3 or 4 leukopenia and those without myelosuppression. Leukopenia was associated with longer survival independent of age or extent of surgery in Cox proportional hazards regression modeling (P=0.00205). A possible interpretation is that grade 2 leukopenia is a biomarker of adequate temozolomide dosing in a population with diverse DNA repair function, which may be the consequence of variable O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase activity. A prospective dose escalation trial is necessary to determine if treatment-induced leukopenia is beneficial for all patients receiving temozolomide.Copyright © 2020, Spandidos Publications.

Eight of these patients had been previously treated for cancer of the female breast by mastectomy and irradiation or by irradiation alone (in one instance). Of these 8, 6 had progressive ulceration of the chest wall consistent with radiation necrosis and three had residual carcinoma within the ulcer. One patient had melanoma of the chest wall still persistent after surgical resection and irradiation.

In five patients the omentum was transposed directly on the pleura and lung or chest wall. In three patients prolene mesh was interposed to stabilize the chest wall. In two patients the defect attendant upon a Halsted mastectomy was ameliorated by a one-stage reconstruction using transposed omentum to cover a silastic gel prosthesis and to support an overlying skin graft. In three patients there were mild transient symptoms of gastric outlet obstruction postoperatively.

Hepatic microarray analyses at postnatal day 21 revealed 147 transcripts were significantly (+/-1.8-fold, p < 0.05) altered by maternal OW, including expression of 20 known SREBP-1-regulated transcripts. Expression of SREBP-1 mRNA and lipogenic transcripts was confirmed using real-time PCR. Increased nuclear levels of SREBP-1 and recruitment to the FASN promoter were confirmed via ELISA and ChIP analyses, respectively. Decreased expression of 10 PPARalpha regulated genes including FGF21 was also uncovered. FGF21 serum levels were lower (p< 0.05) in OW dam offspring. Further serum levels of high mol wt adiponectin (p < 0.05) were decreased in OW dam offspring at weaning. While no changes in %fat mass or adipose tissue adiponectin mRNA were observed, hepatic expression of AdipoR1 and R2 were lower in OW dam offspring. Finally, phosphorylation of the adiponectin target AMPK was significantly decreased in livers of OW dam offspring. Our data suggest that maternal OW at conception leads to increased lipogenic gene expression in concert with decreased PPARalpha-adiponectin-AMPK signaling in the liver of young offspring.",Excluded

3646,"A randomized double blind placebo controlled multicenter study of mesalazine for the prevention of acute radiation enteritis BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Symptoms of acute radiation enteritis (ARE), dominated by diarrhea, occur in more than 70% of patients receiving pelvic irradiation. Eicosanoids and free radicals release have been implicated in the pathogenesis. Mesalazine (5-ASA) is a potent inhibitor of their synthesis in the mucosa and could therefore be of some interest in preventing ARE., PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was performed in six radiotherapy units in France who agreed on standardized irradiation procedures. One hundred and fifty-three patients planned for external beam radiotherapy to the pelvis > or = 45 Gy for prostate (n = 97) or uterus (n = 54) cancer were randomized on a double blind basis to receive prophylactic 5-ASA (4 g/day Pentasa) or placebo. Patients with concomitant chemotherapy were excluded. Prostate and uterus cancers were chosen since these centropelvic tumors require a similar radiotherapy protocol during the first step of treatment and involve a comparable volume of small intestine. The symptoms of ARE and their severity were assessed every week during irradiation, and 1 and 3 months after its end. All patients followed a low fiber and low lactose diet. End points were diarrhea, use of antidiarrheal agents, abdominal pain, and body weight. Effficacy was evaluated using intention to treat., RESULTS: (means +/- SD) Groups did not differ for age (mean 64 +/- 9 years), sex, tumor site, or irradiation procedure. During irradiation, diarrhea occurred in 69% and 66% of the 5-ASA and placebo groups, respectively (chi2, P = 0.22). Curves of survival without diarrhea did not differ between groups (logrank P = 0.09). Severity of diarrhea did not differ between groups except at d15 where it was significantly more severe in the 5-ASA group (ANOVA P = 0.006). Duration of diarrhea did not differ (22 +/- 15 days in both groups, P = 0.88). Abdominal pain was less frequently reported in the 5-ASA group at d28 (34% vs. 51%, P = 0.048).

2643,"Low-dose radiation exposure and protection against atherosclerosis in ApoE(-/-) mice: the influence of P53 heterozygosity We recently described the effects of low-dose gamma-radiation exposures on atherosclerosis in genetically susceptible (ApoE(-/-)) mice with normal p53 function. Doses as low as 25 mGy, given at either early or late stage disease, generally protected against atherosclerosis in a manner distinctly nonlinear with dose. We now report the influence of low doses (25-500 mGy) on atherosclerosis in ApoE(-/-) mice with reduced p53 function (Trp53(+/-)). Single exposures were given at either low or high dose rate (1 or 150 mGy/min) to female C57BL/6J ApoE(-/-) Trp53(+/-) mice. Mice were exposed at either early stage disease (2 months of age) and examined 3 or 6 months later, or at late stage disease (7 months of age) and examined 2 or 4 months later. In unirradiated mice, reduced p53 functionality elevated serum cholesterol and accelerated both aortic root lesion growth and severity in young mice. Radiation exposure to doses as low as 25 mGy at early stage disease, at either the high or the low dose rate, inhibited lesion growth, decreased lesion frequency and slowed the progression of lesion severity in the aortic root. In contrast, exposure at late stage disease produced generally detrimental effects. Both low-and high-dose-rate exposures accelerated lesion growth and high dose rate exposures also increased serum cholesterol levels. These results show that at early stage disease, reduced p53 function does not influence the protective effects against atherosclerosis of low doses given at low dose rate. In contrast, when exposed to the same doses at late stage disease, reduced p53 function produced detrimental effects, rather than the protective effects seen in Trp53 normal mice. As in the Trp53 normal mice, all effects were highly nonlinear with dose. These results indicate that variations in p53 functionality can dramatically alter the outcome of a low-dose exposure, and that the assumption of a linear response with dose for human populations is probably unwarranted.",Excluded
3654,"Association between SNPs in defined functional pathways and risk of early or late toxicity as well as individual radiosensitivity BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine the impact of functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) pathways involved in the ROS pathway, DNA repair, or TGFB1 signaling on acute or late normal toxicity as well as individual radiosensitivity., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients receiving breast-conserving surgery and radiotherapy were examined either for erythema (n = 83), fibrosis (n = 123), or individual radiosensitivity (n = 123). The 17 SNPs analyzed are involved in the ROS pathway (GSTP1, SOD2, NQO1, NOS3, XDH), DNA repair (XRCC1, XRCC3, XRCC6, ERCC2, LIG4, ATM) or TGFB signaling (SKIL, EP300, APC, AXIN1, TGFB1). Associations with biological and clinical endpoints were studied for single SNPs but especially for combinations of SNPs assuming that a SNP is either beneficial or deleterious and needs to be weighted., RESULTS: With one exception, no significant association was seen between a single SNP and the three endpoints studied. No significant associations were also observed when applying a multi-SNP model assuming that each SNP was deleterious. In contrast, significant associations were obtained when SNPs were suggested to be either beneficial or deleterious. These associations increased, when each SNP was weighted individually. Detailed analysis revealed that both erythema and individual radiosensitivity especially depend on SNPs affecting DNA repair and TGFB1 signaling, while SNPs in ROS pathway were of minor importance., CONCLUSION: Functional pathways of SNPs may be used to form a risk score allowing to predict acute and late radiation-induced toxicity but also to unravel the underlying biological mechanisms.",Excluded
2759,"Minimal erythema dose after multiple UV exposures depends on pre-exposure skin pigmentation BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Phototherapy consists of multiple ultraviolet (UV) exposures. Most previous studies have focused on erythema following a single UV exposure in fair-skinned persons. Although it is well known that phototherapy lowers the daily UV-threshold dose for erythema in clinical practice, this is insufficiently documented under controlled experimental conditions. The purpose of this study was to quantify the change in the daily threshold for a dose specific erythema grade after 1-4 consecutive daily UV exposures., METHODS: Forty-nine healthy volunteers (skin type II-V) with varying pigmentation quantified by skin reflectance. Two UV sources were used: a narrowband UVB (Philips TL01) and a Solar Simulator (Solar Light Co.). Just perceptible erythema after 24 h was chosen as the minimal erythema dose (+); besides + and ++ were assessed., RESULTS: We found a positive and significant exponential relationship between skin pigmentation and UV dose to elicit a specific erythema grade on the back after 1-4 UV exposures. After repetitive UV exposures the UV dose had to be lowered more in dark-skinned persons compared with fair-skinned persons to elicit a certain erythema grade. This applied to both UV sources and all erythema grades., CONCLUSION: In the dark-skinned persons the daily UV dose after the 4 days UV exposure should be lowered by 40-50% to avoid burns compared with the single UV exposure. For the most fair-skinned persons essentially no reduction in the daily UV dose was needed. Our results indicate that the pre-exposure pigmentation level can guide the UV dosage in phototherapy.",Excluded
3579,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for medically refractory multiple sclerosis-related tremor OBJECTIVE Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease that can lead to severe intention tremor in some patients. In several case reports, conventional radiotherapy has been reported to possibly exacerbate MS. Radiosurgery dramatically limits normal tissue irradiation to potentially avoid such a problem. Gamma Knife thalamotomy (GKT) has been established as a minimally invasive technique that is effective in treating essential tremor and Parkinson's disease- related tremor. The goal in this study was to analyze the outcomes of GKT in patients suffering from medically refractory MS-related tremor. METHODS The authors retrospectively studied the outcomes of 15 patients (mean age 46.5 years) who had undergone GKT over a 15-year period (1998-2012). Fourteen patients underwent GKT at a median maximum dose of 140 Gy (range 130-150 Gy) using a single 4-mm isocenter. One patient underwent GKT at a dose of 140 Gy delivered via two 4-mm isocenters (3 mm apart). The posteroinferior region of the nucleus ventralis intermedius (VIM) was the target for all GKTs. The Fahn-Tolosa-Marin clinical tremor rating scale was used to evaluate tremor, handwriting, drawing, and drinking. The median time to the last follow-up was 39 months. RESULTS After GKT, 13 patients experienced tremor improvement on the side contralateral to surgery. Four patients noted tremor arrest at a median of 4.5 months post-GKT. Seven patients had excellent tremor improvement and 6 had good tremor improvement. Four patients noted excellent functional improvement, 8 noted good functional improvement, and 1 noted satisfactory functional improvement. Three patients experienced diminished tremor relief at a median of 18 months after radiosurgery. Two patients experienced temporary adverse radiation effects. Another patient developed a large thalamic cyst 60 months after GKT, which was successfully managed with Ommaya reservoir placement. CONCLUSIONS Gamma Knife thalamotomy was found to be a minimally invasive and beneficial procedure for medically refractory MS tremor.Copyright © AANS 2018.",Excluded
3350,"Outcome and complications of distal tibia fractures treated with intramedullary nails versus minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis and the role of fibula fixation Introduction: Distal tibia fractures have been managed conservatively as well surgically. A large number of implants have been used for surgical management of these fractures. No treatment method or implant has been proven to be superior to others. In this prospective comparative study, the complications and outcome of distal tibia fractures managed with intramedullary nails and minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis has been compared. Further, the role of fibula fixation in these fractures has been evaluated. Material(s) and Method(s): One hundred and fifty-four patients of distal tibia fractures with concomitant fibula fractures were randomized into 4 treatment groups based on predetermined inclusion criteria. Functional outcome in these groups was compared based on AOFAS score at 1 year. Intra-operative, post-operative parameters as well as radiological alignment, complications and the need for reoperation were also compared in these groups. Result(s): The functional outcome in all four treatment groups was similar. The duration of surgery and radiation exposure was higher with minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis. There was no improvement in outcome with plating of fibula. However, fixation of fibula improved the rotational alignment in distal tibia fractures. Conclusion(s): Although there is no difference in outcome of distal tibia fractures with either nailing or minimally invasive plating, nailing is recommended for closed displaced extraarticular fractures. Fixation of fibula should not be done routinely but should be reserved only for a few specific fracture patterns.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
2970,"Initial SRS for Patients With 5 to 15 Brain Metastases: Results of a Multi-Institutional Experience Purpose: Several studies evaluating stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for patients with >4 brain metastases (BM) demonstrated similar outcomes after treatment of 1, 2 to 4, and 5 to 15 BM; others found clinically significant survival decrements in the latter group. In this review of 8 academic centers, we compared outcomes of patients undergoing initial SRS for 1, 2 to 4, and 5 to 15 BM. Methods and Materials: A total of 2089 patients treated with initial SRS for BM were included. Overall survival (OS) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. Patient and disease characteristics were evaluated for association with OS and cumulative incidence of distant brain failure (DBF) using stepwise multivariable Cox proportional hazards and competing risk regression modeling. Result(s): In this series, 989 (47%) patients had 1 metastasis, 882 (42%) had 2 to 4 metastases, and 212 (10%) had 5 to 15 metastases treated. Median OS for the 1, 2 to 4, and 5 to 15 BM groups was 14.6, 9.5, and 7.5 months, respectively (log-rank P < .01). Univariate and multivariable analyses revealed no difference in survival between 2 to 4 and 5 to 15 BM. DBF at 1 year was 30%, 41%, and 50%, respectively (Gray's P < .01). Two-year cumulative incidence of salvage SRS decreased with increasing number of BM (1: 21% vs 2-4: 19% vs 5-15: 13%; P < .01), but no difference in salvage whole brain radiation therapy was observed (1: 12% vs 2-4: 15% vs 5-15: 16%, P = .10). At the time of DBF, median brain metastasis velocity was 3.9, 6.1, and 11.7 new metastases per year in the 1, 2 to 4, and 5 to 15 BM groups, respectively (P < .01). Conclusion(s): Patients treated with initial SRS for 5 to 15 BM experienced survival similar to that in patients with 2 to 4 BM. Lower rates of salvage SRS were observed in the 5 to 15 BM group, with no difference in rates of salvage whole brain radiation therapy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

2693,"Survival in small cell lung cancer in India: Prognostic utility of clinical features, laboratory parameters and response to treatment BACKGROUND: Predictors of survival and response to treatment in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) are ill-defined and unclear. In an attempt to assess the impact of common presenting symptoms and laboratory values on survival, we undertook this retrospective review of patients with SCLC. To our knowledge, there is no study on survival in SCLC patients from the Indian subcontinent. DESIGN: Retrospective Cohort study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All newly diagnosed small cell lung cancer cases from December 2001 through December 2004, were identified and clinical data on presenting symptoms and laboratory findings from their hospital records, noted. The influence of various pretreatment factors on survival was investigated using Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox multivariate regression model. RESULT(S): 76 subjects were included (84% males, 91% smokers). 57% patients had five or more symptoms at presentation. Cumulative symptom burden was strongly associated with survival ( P =0.02). Survival was also significantly related with Karnofsky performance status (KPS) ( P =0.04), disease extent (P =0.03) and symptomatic response to treatment ( P< 0.001). Patients with higher hemoglobin ( P =0.02), serum sodium ( P =0.04) and serum globulin ( P =0.02), survived significantly longer. By multivariate regression analysis, hemoglobin, KPS and brain metastases, were significant predictors of survival ( P =0.01, P =0.02, P< 0.01 respectively). CONCLUSION(S): Cumulative symptom burden, KPS, disease extent and symptomatic assessment of improvement after treatment, are useful predictors of survival. This has important clinical implications, keeping in view, the infrastructure and cost involved in more objective tests like CT scan, for evaluation of disease extent and prognosis. These findings can provide a simple basis for predicting prognosis in small cell lung cancer, especially in developing countries like ours.",Excluded
3489,"The outcome of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients treated with R-CHOP is not predicted by interim evaluation of 18-FDG-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET) Background: In DLBCL patients PET evaluation has a defined role to assess the final response, but the predictive value of interim PET is contradictory. Standardized criteria of interpretation of Interim PET have not been well established yet and the visual analysis of PET results by dichotomous evaluation as positive or negative is difficult to apply. Aim of study. to determine the predictive value of interim (I-PET) and final PET (F-PET) on Progression Free Survival (PFS) in DLBCL patients treated with R-CHOP. Patients and Methods: From April 2004 to December 2008, 82 newly diagnosed DLBCL patients treated in five Hematology Departments were included. Clinical features were as follows: median age 56 years (19-81); 42 males and 40 females, 29 stage I-II and 53 stage III-IV; 47 L/LI and 35 I/IH IPI score. All patients were treated according to the planned therapy, not modified by I-PET results, with 6-8 RCHOP. IF-RT was planned to areas of bulky disease and given to 13 patients. All patients had PET scan performed at the diagnosis, during treatment (I-PET) and at the end of therapy (F-PET). All PET results were centrally reviewed and defined as positive or negative by visual dichotomous response criteria according to the First Consensus Conference (Deauville 2009). Result(s): All patients were evaluable for response. I-PET was performed after two R-CHOP in 46 pts, after three in 13 and after four in 23. At the end of therapy 73 pts (89%) achieved a CR and nine (11%) were non responders. Fifty-five patients (67%) were negative and 27 (33%) positive at the I-PET; 69 pts (84%) were negative and 13 (16%) positive at the F-PET. 15/27 (56%) I-PET positive patients became F-PET negative at the end of the therapy. The concordance between clinical CR and F-PET negativity was 99%: one CR pt was false F-PET positive due to parothid carcinoma. The prognostic impact of PET results on the outcome was evaluated. With a median FU of 18 months, Progression-free survival (PFS) was 80%. PFS did not correlate with I-PET results, 18-months PFS rates were: 84% in I-PET negative patients and 74%in I-PET positive patients (p.198) (Figure 1A). Conversely F-PET strongly predicted PFS (p.015): 84% in F-PET negative patients and 61% in F-PET positive patients. (Figure 1B). A further analysis for progression was performed to adjust the effect of I-PET analysis for other known risk factors (age >=60, stage, PS, IPI, LDH, bulky, number of extranodal sites, Bone Marrow involvement): only LDH (p.005) and IPI 0-2 vs. 3-5 (p.001) were confirmed as independent predictors for progression. The use of G-CSF during treatment did not influenced IPET results. Conclusion(s): Our results indicate that in DLBCL patients treated with R-CHOP a positive interim PET did not predict a worse outcome. Conversely, final PET results strongly correlate with PFS. A longer follow up is necessary to validate our data. Prospective larger studies and standarditation of criteria for interim PET are needed to assess the prognostic value of interim PET in DLBCL patients. (Graph presented).",Excluded
3225,"Solo sonographically guided PCNL under spinal anesthesia-results of 165 cases Aim: The well-known serious harms of radiation have encouraged surgeons to use it as low as necessary. Hence, sonography was brought in as an adjunct to X-Ray to restrict radiation exposure in PCNL. This study was designed to respond this question that is sonography proper enough to supersede X-Ray in PCNL? Methods: 165 consecutive cases were prospectively enrolled. All steps of access to the system, single shot tract dilatation and residue checking were performed solely under sonography guidance; i.e. without any usage of x-ray under spinal anesthesia. Decision to place a nephrostomy tube was made based on the surgeon's judgment on the system injury or bleeding. Result(s): male to female ratio was 5/3. Mean age was 46+/-15 years. Forty percent of kidneys showed hydronephrosis and 20 percent of stones were nonopaque. Mean stone burden was 504+/-350 mm2. Mean duration of surgery was 42+/-21 minutes. Stone free rate was 85% in patients with single pelvic stone and 75% in staghorn cases. Mean residual stone size was 15+/-9 mm. Admission time was 2 days on average. Fifteen percent of patients showed grade I or II complication and in six percent grade III complication occurred based on Clavien classification. There was no case organ injury or death. Complication rate was directly related to surgery duration. Conclusion(s): Sonographically guided PCNL is feasible with acceptable stone free rate and complication.",Excluded
3357,"Induction docetaxel-cisplatin followed by extended-field radiotherapy in patients with cervical metastases from unknown primary carcinoma Background: Cervical metastases from unknown primary tumors are rare and no clear therapeutic options are available. This retrospective analysis aimed to evaluate toxicity and activity of a sequential chemoradiation regimen consisting of induction chemotherapy followed by extendedfield radiotherapy in patients with cervical metastases from unknown primary tumors. Patients and Methods: Patients with cytological or histological diagnosis of latero-cervical lymph-node metastasis from carcinoma with unknown origin treated with sequential chemotherapy (3 cycles of docetaxel and cisplatin, each administered as intravenous infusion at the dose of 75 mg/m2 on day 1, every 21 days) and radiotherapy (cumulative dose of 70 Gy) were included in this study. The radiological response was assessed by central review according to the revised RECIST criteria. Result(s): Fifteen patients received three cycles of induction chemotherapy with the combination of docetaxel and cisplatin. Patients were subsequently treated with extendedfield radiotherapy. Three complete responses were observed after induction chemotherapy and 13 after the chemoradiation treatment. The overall response rate after chemoradiation, was 93.3% (14 of 15 evaluable patients). One year disease-free-survival was 83.3% (10 of 12 evaluable patients). Treatment was well-tolerated; two cases of grade 4 neutropenia, two of grade 3 mucositis and eight of grade 2 nausea were the worst, most clinically-relevant sideeffects. Conclusion(s): Induction chemotherapy followed by extended-field radiotherapy showed good activity and manageable toxicity in patients with cervical metastases from unknown primary tumors.",Excluded

3223,"Primary adenocarcinoma of the anus: A retrospective analysis Purpose: To report the clinical features and outcome of patients with primary adenocarcinoma of the anus following radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. Methods and Materials: A retrospective analysis was performed on 15 patients referred to Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute between 1981 to 1998 with primary adenocarcinoma of the anus. The median follow-up was 7.5 years. Six patients underwent treatment with curative intent - either chemoradiation or radiotherapy alone. Surgery was mainly limited to either incisional or excisional biopsy. The remaining nine patients were treated with palliative intent because of advanced age, advanced disease, or poor medical status. The biological equivalent doses were calculated for all patients and correlated with time to progression. Result(s): None of the curative group had relapsed after a median follow-up of 6.6 years. All except one were alive and well. No patient developed any serious long-term toxicity and all patients avoided colostomy. All patients managed with palliative intent died with persistent locoregional disease with a median survival of 0.8 year. Conclusion(s): Primary adenocarcinoma of the anus is a very rare disease that precludes a rigorous analysis. This study demonstrates that radiation and in particular chemoradiation are effective therapies consistent with other recent series and analogous to squamous cell carcinomas of the anus. It also emphasizes the poor prognosis of patients treated with palliative intent.",Excluded
2698,"Selective internal radiation therapy for liver malignancies BACKGROUND: Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) is a non-ablative technique for the treatment of liver primaries and metastases, with the intention of reducing tumour bulk. This study aimed to determine optimal patient selection, and elucidate its role as a downsizing modality., METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively on patients who underwent SIRT between 2011 and 2014. The procedure was performed percutaneously by an expert radiologist. Response was analysed in two categories, based on radiological (CT/MRI according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST)) and biological (alpha-fetoprotein, carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen 19-9, chromogranin A) parameters., RESULTS: Forty-four patients were included. Liver metastases from colorectal cancer (22 patients) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (9) were the most common pathologies. Radiological response data were collected from 31 patients. A reduction in sum of diameters (SOD) was observed in patients with HCC (median -24.1 (95 per cent c.i. -43.4 to -3.8) per cent) and neuroendocrine tumours (-30.0 (-45.6 to -7.7) per cent), whereas a slight increase in SOD was seen in patients with colorectal cancer (4.9 (-10.6 to 55.3) per cent). Biological response was assessed in 17 patients, with a reduction in 12, a mixed response in two and no improvement in three. Six- and 12-month overall survival rates were 71 and 41 per cent respectively. There was no difference in overall survival between the RECIST response groups (median survival 375, 290 and 214 days for patients with a partial response, stable disease and progressive disease respectively; P = 0.130), or according to primary pathology (P = 0.063). Seven patients underwent liver resection with variable responses after SIRT., CONCLUSION: SIRT may be used to downsize tumours and may be used as a bridge to surgery in patients with tumours deemed borderline for resection.

3441,"Usefulness of dual-source computed tomography for the evaluation of coronary arteries in heart transplant recipients BACKGROUND: Heart transplant recipients require serial assessment of coronary arteries due to a risk of cardiac allograft vasculopathy or atherosclerosis. Currently available non-invasive imaging methods are of a limited value for the detection of coronary stenoses, and thus invasive coronary angiography (ICA) is recommended., AIM: We evaluated diagnostic accuracy and clinical usefulness of dual-source computed tomography (DSCT) as a potential alternative to ICA for the detection of coronary stenoses., METHODS: DSCT was performed in 20 consecutive heart transplant recipients (15 males, mean age 47.5 years) who were scheduled for ICA. Exclusion criteria included renal dysfunction with creatinine clearance <45 mL/min and lack of patient consent. All examinations were performed using a first generation dual-source scanner and a retrospectively ECG-gated protocol. Data sets were routinely reconstructed in best-systolic and best-diastolic phases. We evaluated presence of a >50% stenosis in a vessel with a diameter of >1.0 mm, image quality of each segment, and radiation dose delivered to the patient. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and diagnostic accuracy were calculated in per segment, per vessel, and per patient analyses, with ICA considered the reference method., RESULTS: All DSCT and ICA examinations were diagnostic and performed without any complications. Mean heart rate was 85 bpm (range 63-114), and was stable in 85% of patients. Significant stenoses (>50%) were diagnosed by DSCT in 4 of the 287 segments, and these findings were confirmed by ICA in 2 segments. Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy were: (1) in the per segment analysis, 100%, 99%, and 99%, respectively, for the left coronary artery; and 100% each for the right coronary artery; (2) 100%, 97%, and 97%, respectively, in the per vessel analysis; and (3) 100%, 94%, 95%, respectively, in the per patient analysis. In diastolic reconstructions, right coronary segments were significantly more commonly nondiagnostic than left coronary segments (25% vs. 11.5%, p = 0.003). In contrast, right coronary segments showed better quality than left coronary segments in systolic reconstructions (63.5% vs. 42.2%, p <0.001). Mean effective radiation dose was 12.7 (range 5.4-18.7) mSv., CONCLUSIONS: DSCT is a clinically useful alternative to invasive coronary angiography for excluding significant coronary stenoses in heart transplant recipients. The negative predictive value of this modality is very high. Sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy is acceptably high. Imaging of coronary arteries in patients with high heart rates in technically feasible, but require modifications of routine exam protocol.

3130,"Horizontal angular VOR, nystagmus dumping, and sensation duration in spacelab SLS-1 crewmembers In 1G, the apparent time constant (Td) of postrotatory SPV decay with the head tilted face down is 55% of that with head erect (Te). This phenomenon is called ""nystagmus dumping"" and has been attributed to G effects on VOR velocity storage. Similarly, postrotatory sensation duration with head tilted (Dd) is 32% of that when head erect (De). In parabolic flight, Te and De are 70% of 1-G values, but a pitch back dumping movement produces no further change. Te, Td, and Dd have not previously been measured in orbital flight. VOR and sensation duration was tested in 4 crewmembers in 4 preflight, 1 inflight (days 4 or 5) and 4 post flight sessions. Bitemporal EOG was recorded with eyes open in darkness. Instructions were to ""gaze straight ahead,"" and indicate when ""rotation sensation disappears or becomes ambiguous"". Subjects were rotated CW and CCW head erect for 1 min at 120 degrees/s, stopped, and EOG was recorded for another 1 min. This procedure was then used to study dumping, except that immediately after chair stop, subjects pitched their head forward 90 degrees. SPV was calculated using order statistic filtering, and dropouts removed using an iterative model fitting method. Te and Td were determined by logarithmic linear regression of mean SPV for each subject. In orbit, 90 degrees pitch movement produced rapid subjective dumping, but not nystagmus dumping. Dd was noticeably shorter (""almost instantaneous"") compared to preflight Dd. Te and Td in orbit were similar to preflight Te for 3/4 subjects (rather than to preflight Td as expected). No consistent VOR gain changes were seen in orbit. Although Te is known to decrease acutely in parabolic flight, a longer time constant was measured in 3/4 subjects after 4-5 days adaptation to weightlessness, suggesting a return of angular velocity storage.",Excluded

The experience with high-dose rate brachytherapy (HDR BT) in this indication is limited. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the viability of perioperative hyperfractionated HDR BT for STS., METHODS: Forty-five patients with primary (17 cases) or recurrent (28 cases) STS were treated with resection and HDR BT between 1998 and 2007. Eleven patients were treated with HDR BT alone (mean dose 40 Gy; 30-54 Gy) and 34 were treated with a combination of HDR BT (mean dose 24 Gy; 15-30 Gy) and external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) (40-50 Gy). Hyperfractionation, 3 Gy twice daily, was used for HDR BT with plastic tubes. Adjuvant chemotherapy was indicated for patients with high risk of dissemination., RESULTS: Local control (LC) was achieved in 17 patients (100%) treated for primary tumor and in 18 of 28 patients (64%) treated for recurrence; this difference was statistically significant (p = 0.004). Distant metastases occurred in seven patients (15.6%). The 5-year overall survival was 70%; the 5-year local control was 74%. LC was significantly better for extremities sarcomas in comparison with trunk tumors, for patients treated with EBRT and BT in comparison with BT alone, and for doses >65 Gy., CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that perioperative HDR BT is a promising method for achieving high biological doses with good LC in the postoperative radiotherapy of STS and that combination of BT and EBRT provides better tumor control than BT alone.",Excluded

The aim of this retrospective study is to report oncologic outcome and toxicity of elective nodal radiotherapy (ENRT) in PCa patients affected by pelvic nodal oligorecurrence. Method(s): 41 consecutive patients were treated with salvage radiotherapy. At biochemical recurrence after primary treatment, oligorecurrent disease was detected by positron emission tomography (PET) in 94% of the patients. Image-guided intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) was delivered using tomotherapy. 83% of the patients received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in combination with ENRT. Survival analysis was performed with Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test was used to analyze associations between survival end-points and clinical parameters. Multivariate analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Toxicity was registered according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0. Result(s): The median at follow-up was 33.6 months. At 3 years, overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and biochemical progression-free survival (b-PFS) were 89%, 92%, and 53%, respectively. At univariate analysis, all survival end-points were correlated with the number of positive pelvic lymph nodes at oligorecurrence (<= 3 vs > 3). Biochemical-PFS was correlated with PSA (p = 0.034) and PSA doubling time (p = 0.004) at oligorecurrence. At multivariate analysis, no independent variable was statistically significant. No patient experienced grade >= 2 late toxicity after radiotherapy. Conclusion(s): The number of metastatic lymph nodes and PSA doubling time seems to be important prognostic factors in the pelvic oligorecurrent setting. Salvage radiotherapy combined with short-course ADT might be a valid treatment strategy.Copyright © 2020, Federacion de Sociedades Espanolas de Oncologia (FESEO).",Excluded
3079,"Relationship between prognosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma patient and age: a retrospective single-institution study Age is an important prognostic factor in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). In this study, we investigated the difference in prognosis of 7 subsets of PTC patients without distant metastasis at presentation or a history of radiation exposure (20 years or younger, 21-30 years, 31-40 years, 41-50 years, 51-60 years, 61-70 years, and older than 70 years). The lymph node recurrence rate was high in patients 20 years or younger and those older than 60 years. Distant recurrence and carcinoma death rates significantly elevated in patients older than 60 years. The incidence of significant extrathyroid extension markedly increased with age, although that of large node metastasis or extranodal tumor extension did not differ much among the 7 subsets. With the Kaplan-Meier method, lymph node recurrence rate was poor in patients 20 years or younger and in those older than 60 years. Poor distant recurrence-free and cause specific survivals of patients older than 60 years were identified in the series of PTC patients with and without these aggressive features. It is therefore suggested that 1) Lymph node recurrence rate was high in patients 20 years or younger and those older than 60 years and 2) prognosis, including distant recurrence-free survival and cause-specific survival, of patients older than 60 years was poor regardless of clinicopathological features of PTC at initial surgery.",Excluded
2548,"Comparison of V/Q SPECT and planar V/Q lung scintigraphy in diagnosing acute pulmonary embolism PURPOSE: Planar ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scintigraphy is currently the standard method for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) in most nuclear medicine centers. However, recent studies have shown a superior sensitivity and specificity when applying V/Q single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in diagnosing PE. This study evaluated the diagnostic performance of three-dimensional V/Q SPECT in comparison with planar V/Q scintigraphy., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients suspected of acute PE from June 2006 to February 2008 were referred to the Department of Nuclear Medicine at Frederiksberg Hospital, Denmark to a V/Q SPECT, as the first-line imaging procedure. Patients with positive D-dimer (>0.5 mg/l) or after clinical assessment with a Wells score of more than 2 were included and had a V/Q SPECT, low-dose CT, planar V/Q scintigraphy, and pulmonary multidetector computer tomography angiography performed the same day. Ventilation studies were performed using Kr. Patient follow-up was at least 6 months., RESULTS: A total of 36 patient studies were available for analysis, of which 11 (31%) had PE. V/Q SPECT had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 87%. Planar V/Q scintigraphy had a sensitivity of 64% and a specificity of 72%., CONCLUSION: We conclude that V/Q SPECT has a superior diagnostic performance compared with planar V/Q scintigraphy and should be preferred when diagnosing PE.",Excluded

3261,"Individual variations in the micronucleus assay for biological dosimetry after high dose exposure The micronucleus assay is widely used as a biological dosimeter. Due to an inhibitory effect of radiation on cell proliferation the assay yields satisfactory results only when the absorbed dose is below about 5Gy. In 2002 Muller and Rode suggested that a modified version of the test, based on the analysis of the ratio of trinucleated to tetranucleated cells and the frequency of micronuclei (Mn) in binucleated cells containing at least one Mn, can be applied to detect a dose reaching 15Gy (Mutat. Res. 502 (2002) 47-51). Their conclusion was based on the results of experiments with lymphocytes from one donor and nothing is known about the possible influence of individual variability on the applicability of the Mn test to detect high doses of radiation. The aim of the present study was to validate the modified micronucleus assay with lymphocytes of 5 donors. Their blood was exposed to 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20Gy of 60Co gamma rays. The levels of Mn and of cell proliferation were assessed using various approaches. A strong inter-individual variability was observed for all endpoints. The results clearly show that the assessment of cell proliferation is essential for the interpretation of results. Unfortunately, it was not possible to identify one single proliferation marker that gives all necessary information. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
2541,"Arthroscopic removal of arch-shaped rotator cuff calcifying tendinitis without rotator cuff repair and acromioplasty is an excellent treatment regarding pain relief and function Purpose: The aim of this study is to evaluate clinical outcome for arthroscopic removal of calcium deposit without acromioplasty and rotator cuff repair for patients with ultrasound-diagnosed arch-shaped calcifying tendinitis of the rotator cuff (type I), homogenic (x-ray) with chronic pain. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed 50 patients with homogenous, arch-shaped calcifying tendinitis, suffering from chronic pain and who underwent arthroscopic treatment and 50 patients with the same type of tendinitis treated conservatively. All patients had calcium deposit located in supraspinatus tendon, pre-operatively and post-operatively evaluated by ultrasound. Clinical outcome was assessed by using Quick DASH, UCLA, and VAS score. Result(s): There were 29 male and 71 female patients; none had bilateral involvement. We divided patients into group A-operatively treated-and group B-conservatively treated-by shock wave therapy. Patients from group A had higher improvement of all used tests, QDash (from 19.3 to 2.7), UCLA (from 10 to 34), and VAS score (from 3 to 0) when compared with group B. Conclusion(s): Patients with arch-shaped calcium deposits and acoustic shadow have better results after arthroscopic treatment than the conservative one. There was no need for acromioplasty or tendon repair. The lack of performing the same did not have any impact on the post-operative rehabilitation and recovery.Copyright © 2021, SICOT aisbl.",Excluded
3235,"Use of neuronavigated transcranial magnetic stimulation and diffusion tensor imaging to avoid motor cortex complications in robotic stereotactic radiation therapy planning Purpose/Objective(s): The purpose of this preliminary study was to find out if motor cortex and the motor tract can be avoided in robotic stereotactic radiation therapy/radiosurgery (RT/SRS) planning by using individually made maps from these areas. Materials/Methods: Before radiation therapy planning, the motor cortex was mapped from 2 meningioma patients using neuronavigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) combined with a neuronavigation system. In addition, the descending motor pathways were determined with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography. Planning CT and MRI scans were also taken. Images were registered in treatment planning software by using a mutual image information algorithm and, in the case of nTMS, map manual registration via external markers. Two RT plans were made both with and without using the motor cortex and descending motor pathways as organs at risk (OARs). Dosimetric analysis was conducted comparing these plans with a focus on target coverage and motor cortex sparing. Result(s): Individual anatomical information from the motor cortex and motor pathways were imported into the RT planning system. Dosimetric analysis is described in Table 1. (Table Presented) Conclusion(s): For the 2 patients, the motor cortex and descending motor pathways were mapped before robotic stereotactic RT for meningioma. These are both noninvasive procedures and easy for the patients. The new OARs were able to be spared without compromising target irradiation. Sparing of the motor cortex and descending motor pathways was noticeable in their 0.01 mL maximum doses, being respectively 11.4% and 6.3% for patient 1 and 54.4% and 16.1% for patient 2. There were no differences in mean values, due the large volume of these OAR structures and the high dose gradients of the robotic stereotactic RT. Target coverage and mean dose were not affected by sparing of the motor cortex with either patient. With using this individual functional information to avoid motor cortex areas in RT planning we were able to spare selected patients from possible adverse effects without compromising target dose coverage. As the study is in a preliminary stage, in the future, motor area information will be mapped from more intracranial RT patients, and this information will be used to spare the motor area better than has thus far been possible. The potential RT-induced aftereffects will be studied during a follow-up period.",Excluded
2618,"Acute and late toxicity of bilateral orbital irradiation in the management of primary intraocular lymphoma Purpose/Objective(s): Primary intraocular lymphoma (PIOL) is a rare malignancy with poor outcomes. Data suggest that a combination of chemotherapy and orbital radiation therapy (RT) results in better ocular disease control and improved survival, compared to treatment with either modality alone. However, some clinicians withhold RT out of concern for toxicity, particularly vision-threatening retinopathy. We aimed to quantify the ocular toxicity of RT in PIOL patients treated uniformly with chemoimmunotherapy and RT. We hypothesized that vision-threatening complications would be rare. Materials/Methods: Eleven patients were identified who received sequential R-MPV (rituximab, methotrexate, procarbazine, and vincristine), RT, and high-dose cytarabine. Clinical information was collected from the electronic medical record. Result(s): The median age was 66 years (range 48-72). Two patients had diabetes; 1 had unilateral grade 1 diabetic retinopathy at presentation. RT targeted the bilateral orbits to a median dose of 36 Gy (range 30.6-39.6 Gy) with opposed tangential 6 MV photon beams (18%), intensity modulated RT (27%), or appositional 12-16 MeV electron beams with custom skin collimation (55%). A multidisciplinary team, including an ocular oncologist, followed patients for a median of 42 months after RT (range 8-94). Common adverse events included dermatitis (100%), conjunctivitis (82%), exophthalmia (64%), and keratopathy (45%). All phakic eyes developed cataracts (100%); cases that underwent subsequent cataract extraction maintained good visual acuity. New, visually significant retinopathy was observed in only 1 eye (<5%) and affected the only patient with pre-existing diabetic retinopathy. There was no case of radiationinduced optic neuropathy. At diagnosis, visual acuity was 20/40 or better in 15/22 eyes (68%). In the patients who did not experience an intraocular disease relapse, visual acuity at last follow-up was 20/40 or better in 9/16 eyes (56%); of note, poor vision at last follow-up was attributed to uncorrected cataracts in 4 eyes and therefore was considered correctable. Conclusion(s): This report suggests that severe, vision-threatening complications are uncommon following orbital RT and chemo-immunotherapy for PIOL. In the absence of comorbidities, orbital RT should not be withheld due to fear of vision-threatening toxicity. The risk of toxicity may be augmented by comorbidities, so an individualized approach is recommended.",Excluded
3601,"Brugia malayi: effects of gamma radiation on adult worms and their intracellular Wolbachia bacteria Prior studies have shown that intracellular Wolbachia endobacteria are necessary for the normal development, reproduction, and survival of filarial nematodes. The purpose of this study was to examine effects of gamma radiation on Wolbachia and reproduction in Brugia malayi adult worms. Worms were exposed to 0, 10, 25, 45, 75, and 105 krad of gamma radiation from a 137cesium source and cultured in vitro for 10 days. Irradiation reduced production of microfilariae in a dose-dependent manner. Embryograms of irradiated female worms showed dose-related abnormalities with arrested development at the early embryo stage. Irradiation reduced the viability of adult worms in a dose-dependent manner, but no lethal effect was observed. Electron microscopy studies showed that irradiation cleared Wolbachia from worm tissues. Real-time polymerase chain reaction studies demonstrated greatly reduced Wolbachia DNA in irradiated worms. These effects are essentially the same as those observed in adult worms treated with doxycycline. These studies suggest that effects of irradiation on reproduction in Brugia malayi may be caused by effects of irradiation on Wolbachia.",Included
2934,"Effect of extracellular pH on GABA-activated current in rat recombinant receptors and thin hypothalamic slices We studied the effects of extracellular pH (pHo) on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated Cl- current in rat hypothalamic neurons and recombinant type-A GABA (GABA(A)) receptors stably expressed in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293), using whole cell and outside-out patch-clamp recordings. In alpha3beta2gamma2s receptors, acidic pH decreased, whereas alkaline pH increased the response to GABA in a reversible and concentration-dependent manner. Acidification shifted the GABA concentration-response curve to the right, significantly increasing the EC50 for GABA without appreciably changing the slope or maximal current induced by GABA. We obtained similar effects of pH in alpha1beta2gamma2 receptors and in GABA-activated currents recorded from thin hypothalamic brain slices. In outside-out patches recorded from alpha3beta2gamma2 recombinant receptors, membrane patches were exposed to 5 microM GABA at control (7.3), acidic (6.4), or alkaline (8.4) pH. GABA activated main and subconductance states of 24 and 16 pS, respectively, in alpha3beta2gamma2 receptors. Alkaline pH(o) increased channel opening frequency and decreased the duration of the long closed state, resulting in an increase in open probability (from 0.0801 +/- 0.015 in pH 7.3 to 0.138 +/- 0.02 in pH 8.4). Exposure of the channels to acidic pH(o) had the opposite effects on open probability (decreased to 0.006 +/- 0.0001). Taken together, our results indicate that the function of GABA(A) receptors is modulated by extracellular pH. The proton effect is similar in recombinant and native receptors and is dependent on GABA concentration. In addition, the effect appears to be independent of the alpha-subunit isoform, and is due to the ability of H+ to alter the frequency of channel opening. Our findings indicate that GABAergic signaling in the CNS may be significantly altered during conditions that increase or decrease pH.",Excluded
3343,"Overall and chemotherapy-free survival following stereotactic body radiation therapy for abdominopelvic oligometastases Introduction: Limited data establish the efficacy and safety of SBRT in the abdominopelvic (AP) space, where SBRT delivery is challenging due to the proximity of radiosensitive luminal gastrointestinal (GI) organs. The aim of this study was to assess clinical outcomes in patients with AP OM treated with SBRT. Method(s): Eligible patients were those with OM (defined as metastases in <=3 total sites) in the AP space (excluding liver) treated with SBRT. Descriptive statistics and Kaplan-Meier estimates of (LC), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and chemotherapy-free survival (CFS) were performed. Result(s): Fifty-one patients with 58 AP OM received SBRT between 2011 and 2015. Median follow-up was 21.9 months. All SBRT treatments were delivered in 5 fractions with a median dose of 35 Gy (25-40 Gy). Progression post-SBRT occurred in 38/51 patients (75%), with a median PFS of 4.9 months (95% CI: 2.5-7.5), and 2-year PFS of 29%. Rates of 2-and 4-year LC were 74% and 69%, respectively. Median OS was 42.6 months (95% CI: 31-55). Oligometastatic progression occurred in 21/38 patients, and of those, 48% (10/21) received further SBRT. Resulting 2- and 4-year CFS were 47% and 37%, respectively (median 15.1 months). Nineteen patients (37%) experienced a grade 1 or 2 acute toxicity. One grade 3 (acute) toxicity was observed. No grade 4 or 5 toxicities were detected. Conclusion(s): SBRT to AP OM was associated with sustained LC, excellent OS and minimal toxicity. The use of SBRT allowed for prolonged CFS and the salvage of limited-burden distant failures.Copyright © 2020 Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists",Excluded
3115,"Post-transplant pulmonary function abnormalities nadir at five years and then fully normalize by the second decade in allogeneic stem cell transplantation survivors Late onset non-infectious pulmonary injury complicates >10% of allogeneic stem cell transplants (SCT), particularly in subjects conditioned with high dose Total Body Irradiation (TBI), and contributes to transplant related mortality. To characterize the kinetics of recovery from pulmonary injury in long term survivors we collected data on 138 (78 male, 60 female) subjects surviving >5 years after SCT from their HLAmatched siblings. The median age at transplant was 36 years. Transplant indications were CML (63), AML (31), MDS (19), ALL (12) and others (14). 126 subjects received mu1200 cGy TBI-based conditioning with or without lung shielding, 3 received 400 cGy TBI-based conditioning and 9 patients received no irradiation. Ex vivo T cell depleted grafts were given to 131 recipients, except for six who received a nonmyeloablative SCT. Of the 138 long term survivors, 26 had no cGvHD, 70 had cGvHD lasting less than 3 years; and 42 had prolonged cGvHD requiring systemic immunosuppression for > 3 years. Among the 17 patients who died after 5 years, 4 died of pulmonary causes, including two with lung cancer. Pre-transplant abnormalities (< 80% predicted) in PFTs were found in 15.9% of subjects in the following declining frequency: FVC%, VC, TLC, FEV1, DLCO Adj (adjusted for hemoglobin and alveolar ventilation) Hb/VA and FEV1/FVC. Baseline (BL) PFTs served as the reference for all subsequent measurements at 3, 5, 10 and 15 years for each survivor. The only parameter showing a clinically significant decline post transplant was DLCO Adj which reached a nadir at 5 years, with subsequent normalization at the 10 year mark [paired ttest]. An abnormal (<80% of baseline) DLCO Adj was found in 19.6, 21.0, 0.7 and 0% of survivors at 3, 5, 10 and 15 years. The mean DLCO Adj at 3, 5, 10 and 15 years were 91% (P = .003), 88% (P < .001), 98% (p=NS) and 100% (p=NS) of BL, respectively. Multivariable modeling (forward-stepwise multiple regression) identified the presence of chronic GVHD (P = .017) and abnormal Baseline DLCO Adj (P = .023) as the only significant factors associated with the decline in DLCO Adj at 5 years but excluded smoking, conditioning intensity, baseline C-reactive protein level, TBI dose to the lungs and demographic variables. In conclusion, DLCO Adj is the only PFT marker associated with pulmonary injury in our TBI-conditioned transplant population. DLCO Adj nadirs at 5 years post-SCT, and normalizes by 10 years. Chronic GVHD and pre-transplant DLCO Adj are important contributory factors to the decline in DLCO Adj. (Figure presented).",Excluded
3151,"Early body weight loss during concurrent chemo-radiotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer Background and purpose: Radiation-esophagitis and weight loss are frequently observed toxicities in patients treated with concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (CT-RT) for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and might be related. The purpose was to investigate whether weight loss already starts early after initiation of CT-RT and precedes radiation-esophagitis. Material(s) and Method(s): In a retrospective cohort, weight and esophagitis grade >=2 were assessed during the first weeks of (CT-)RT in patients treated with concurrent (n = 102) or sequential (n = 92) therapy. In a prospective validation study, data on body weight, esophagitis grade >=2, nutritional intake and muscle strength were obtained before, during and following CT-RT. Result(s): In the retrospective cohort, early weight loss was observed in concurrently treated patients (p = 0.002), independent of esophagitis >= grade 2. Early weight loss was also observed in the prospective cohort (p = 0.003) and was not accompanied by decreases in nutritional intake. In addition lower limb muscle strength rapidly declined (p = 0.042). In the later weeks of treatment, further body weight loss occurred (p < 0.001) despite increased nutritional supplementation and body weight was only partly recovered after 4 weeks post CT-RT (p = 0.003). Conclusion(s): Weight loss during concurrent CT-RT for NSCLC starts early and prior to onset of esophagitis, requiring timely and intense nutritional rehabilitation. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded

2807,"Radiation necrosis versus glioma recurrence: conventional MR imaging clues to diagnosis BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Conventional MR imaging findings are considered to be inadequate for reliably distinguishing radiation necrosis from tumor recurrence in patients with glioma. Despite this belief, we hypothesized that certain conventional MR imaging findings, alone or in combination, though not definitive, may favor one or another of these diagnoses in proton beam-treated patients with new enhancing lesions on serial scanning. METHOD(S): MR imaging findings (axial T1-, T2-, and post-gadolinium T1-weighted) of 27 proton beam radiation therapy patients with high-grade gliomas were retrospectively reviewed. Entry criteria included new MR imaging enhancing lesions after treatment and histologically unequivocal biopsy proof of diagnosis. Readers rated corpus callosum involvement, midline spread, subependymal spread, new discrete multiple enhancing foci, a ""spreading wavefront"" appearance, and septum pellucidum involvement. Statistical analysis was by the Fisher exact test. RESULT(S): Corpus callosum involvement in combination with multiple other findings was highly associated with progressive glioma. These combinations included involvement of the corpus callosum with multiple enhancing foci (P = .02), involvement of the corpus callosum with crossing the midline and multiple enhancing lesions (P = .04), and involvement of the corpus callosum with subependymal spread and multiple enhancing lesions (P = .01). CONCLUSION(S): In proton beam-treated patients with glioma, corpus callosum involvement, in conjunction with multiple enhancing lesions with or without crossing of the midline and subependymal spread, favors predominant glioma progression. Overall, combinations of enhancement patterns were more likely than individual patterns to distinguish necrosis from predominant tumor progression. Together with clinical and functional imaging findings, these results may assist in determining the need for biopsy.",Excluded
2539,"Marked exacerbation of orthostatic intolerance after long- vs. short-duration spaceflight in veteran astronauts OBJECTIVE: The incidence of postflight orthostatic intolerance after short-duration spaceflight is about 20%. However, the incidence after long-duration spaceflight was unknown. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that orthostatic intolerance is more severe after long-duration than after short-duration flight., METHODS: We performed tilt tests on six astronauts before and after long-duration (129-190 days) spaceflights and compared these data with data obtained during stand tests before and after previous short-duration missions., RESULTS: Five of the six astronauts studied became presyncopal during tilt testing after long-duration flights. Only one had become presyncopal during stand testing after short-duration flights. We also compared the long-duration flight tilt test data to tilt test data from 20 different astronauts who flew on the short-duration Shuttle missions that delivered and recovered the astronauts to and from the Mir Space Station. Five of these 20 astronauts became presyncopal on landing day. Heart rate responses to tilt were no different between astronauts on long-duration flights and astronauts on short-duration flights, but long-duration subjects had lower stroke volumes and cardiac outputs than short-duration presyncopal subjects, suggesting a possible decrease in cardiac contractile function. One subject had subnormal norepinephrine release with upright posture after the long flight but not after the short flight. Plasma volume losses were not greater after long flights., CONCLUSION: Long-duration spaceflight markedly increases orthostatic intolerance, probably with multiple contributing factors.",Excluded
2839,"Rationale use of unenhanced multi-detector CT (CT KUB) in evaluation of suspected renal colic Objective: To assess the yield of non-contrast enhanced CT (CT KUB) across different ordering specialties and need of developing an algorithm for its rationale use. Material(s) and Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed 1550 consecutive CT KUB studies requested for suspected renal colic carried out at a single institution in a calendar year. The data was analyzed for demographic characteristics, referring clinician and final diagnosis. Only patients with CT as primary imaging for clinically suspected reno-ureteral colic were included. Departments ordering these CT KUB examinations were divided into three divisions: Urologist, emergency room (ER) physician and others. Result(s): Of 1550 CT KUB performed in the study period 766 met the inclusion criteria. Urologists (57%), followed by ER physicians (30%) mostly ordered the examination. The overall positive yield for urolithiasis was 64% (n = 490), rate of incidental/alternate findings was 15% (n = 116) and 21% (n = 160) were negative. Urologist has the highest positive yield of 67.4% (n = 295) followed by ER physician 67% (n = 152) and others 42.5% (n = 43); p < 0.001. Rate of incidental/alternate findings was highest in CT ordered by other specialties 23.7% (n = 24) followed by ER physician 17.6% (n = 40) and urologist 11.8% (n = 52); p = 0.005. Conclusion(s): There is statistically significant difference of yield across specialties. CT KUB as an initial imaging modality for suspected urolithiasis should be ordered in consultation with the urologist and ER physicians.

We report the treatment outcomes, adverse events (AEs), and dosimetric parameters in local-regional advanced (LRA) HNSCC patients treated with the WF S-IMRT technique., METHODS: The IRB approved this retrospective study. Patients received WF S-IMRT with or without concomitant chemotherapy. Three separate IMRT plans corresponding to 3 planning target volumes were generated. This study reports patient and tumor characteristics, treatment-induced acute AEs based on CTCAE version 3.0, chronic AEs according to RTOG scale and treatment outcomes, local-regional control (LRC), distant metastases (DM), relapse-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS)., RESULTS: Between January 2003 and December 2010, 103 patients with LRA HNSCC were treated either definitively or postoperatively with WF S-IMRT, with (99 patients) or without (4 patients) concurrent chemotherapy. The median age was 55 years (range, 30 to 89 y). The median cumulative target dose was 70 Gy (range, 60 to 75 Gy). At a median follow-up of 40 months (range, 4 to 95 mo), the 2- and 5-year rates of OS were 94% and 77%, RFS were 90% and 84%, LRC were 97% and 93%, and DM were 9% and 11%, respectively.

2583,"Variation in quantitative CT air trapping in heavy smokers on repeat CT examinations Objectives: To determine the variation in quantitative computed tomography (CT) measures of air trapping in lowdose chest CTs of heavy smokers. Method(s): We analysed 45 subjects from a lung cancer screening trial, examined by CT twice within 3 months. Inspiratory and expiratory low-dose CT was obtained using breath hold instructions. CT air trapping was defined as the percentage of voxels in expiratory CT with an attenuation below -856 HU (EXP-856) and the expiratory to inspiratory ratio of mean lung density (E/I-ratio MLD). Variation was determined using limits of agreement, defined as 1.96 times the standard deviation of the mean difference. The effect of both lung volume correction and breath hold reproducibility was determined. Result(s): The limits of agreement for uncorrected CT air trapping measurements were -15.0 to 11.7 % (EXP-856) and -9.8 to 8.0 % (E/I-ratioMLD). Good breath hold reproducibility significantly narrowed the limits for EXP -856 (-10.7 to 7.5 %, P=0.002), but not for E/I-ratioMLD (-9.2 to 7.9 %, P=0.75). Statistical lung volume correction did not improve the limits for EXP-856 (-12.5 to 8.8 %, P=0.12) and E/Iratio MLD (-7.5 to 5.8 %, P=0.17). Conclusion(s): Quantitative air trapping measures on lowdose CT of heavy smokers show considerable variation on repeat CT examinations, regardless of lung volume correction or reproducible breath holds. Key Points: * Computed tomography quantitatively measures small airways disease in heavy smokers. * Measurements of air trapping vary considerably on repeat CT examinations. * Variation remains substantial even with reproducible breath holds and lung volume correction. © The Author(s) 2012.",Excluded

All 17 patients received fractionated radiotherapy to the thorax with a large irradiated lung volume. The CT findings were variable; pulmonary infiltrates were homogeneous, patchy, or discrete. CT abnormalities were evident in 15 of 17 cases within 16 weeks after radiotherapy; in 13 of these it was detected within 4 weeks. In three of these 15 cases, no abnormality was detected on chest radiographs, and in three other cases, the change was observed much later on chest radiographs than on CT scans. In the other nine cases, abnormalities were detected simultaneously on CT scans and chest radiographs. In four cases, extensive radiation pneumonitis was observed on CT, but in two of these, the change was misdiagnosed on the chest radiograph. We conclude that CT is useful in the detection of acute radiation-induced pulmonary disease.",Excluded
2821,"Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy of rectal carcinoma: Baseline hematologic parameters influencing outcomes Background: The link between the blood count and a systemic inflammatory response (SIR) is indisputable and well described. Pretreatment hematological parameters may predict the overall clinical outcomes in many types of cancer. Thus, this study aims to systematically evaluate the relationship between baseline blood count levels and treatment response in rectal cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Patients and Methods: From 2009-2015, 173 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer were retrospectively enrolled in the study and analyzed. The baseline blood count was recorded in all patients 1 week before chemoradiation. Tumor response was evaluated through pathologic findings. Blood count levels which included RBC (red blood cells), Hb (hemoglobin), PLT (platelet count), neutrophil count, WBC (white blood cells), NLR (neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio), and PLR (platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio) were analyzed in relation to tumor downstaging, pCR (pathologic complete response), OS (overall survival), and DFS (disease-free survival). Result(s): Hb levels were associated with a response in logistic regression analysis: pCR (p = 0.05; OR 1.04, 95 % CI 1.00-1.07); T downstaging (p = 0.006; OR 1.03, 95 % CI 1.01-1.05); N downstaging (p = 0.09; OR 1.02, 95 % CI 1.00-1.04); T or N downstaging (p = 0.007; OR 1.04, 95 % CI 1.01-1.07); T and N downstaging (p = 0.02; OR 1.02, 95 % CI 1.00-1.04); Hb and RBC were the most significant parameters influencing OS; PLT was a negative prognostic factor for OS and DFS (p = 0.008 for OS); an NLR value of 2.8 was associated with the greatest significance for OS (p = 0.03) and primary tumor downstaging (p = 0.02).

3690,"Perception of radiation exposure and risk among patients, medical students, and referring physicians at a tertiary care community hospital BACKGROUND: It is important for physicians to be aware of the radiation doses as well as the risks associated with diagnostic imaging procedures that they are ordering., METHODS: A survey was administered to patients, medical students, and referring physicians from a number of specialties to determine background knowledge regarding radiation exposure and risk associated with commonly ordered medical imaging tests., RESULTS: A total of 127 patients, 32 referring physicians, and 30 medical students completed the survey. The majority of patients (92%) were not informed of the radiation risks associated with tests that they were scheduled to receive and had false perceptions about the use of radiation and its associated risks. Physicians and medical students had misconceptions about the use of ionizing radiation in a number of radiologic examinations; for example, 25% and 43% of physicians and medical students, respectively, were unaware that interventional procedures used ionizing radiation, and 28% of physicians were unaware that mammography used ionizing radiation. Computed tomographies and barium studies were thought to be associated with the least ionizing radiation among physicians., CONCLUSION: There is a need for educating the public, medical students, and referring physicians about radiation exposure and associated risk so that (1) patients receiving multiple medical imaging tests are aware of the radiation that they are receiving and (2) physicians and future physicians will make informed decisions when ordering such tests to limit the amount of radiation that patients receive and to promote informed consent among patients.

The difluoromethyl ketones were assembled in three synthetic steps using a trifluoroacetate-release aldol reaction. Following evaluation at clinically relevant GABA receptors, we have identified a difluoromethyl ketone that is a potent GABAB agonist, obtained its X-ray structure, and presented preliminary in vivo data in alcohol-preferring mice. The behavioral studies in mice demonstrated that this compound tended to reduce the acoustic startle response, which is consistent with an anxiolytic profile. Structure-activity investigations determined that replacing the fluorines of the difluoromethyl ketone with hydrogens resulted in an inactive analogue.

3459,"Indirect measurement of mitochondrial proton leak and its application In mitochondria, ATP synthesis is coupled to oxygen consumption by the proton electrochemical gradient established across the mitochondrial inner membrane in a process termed oxidative phosphorylation. It has long been known from stoichiometric studies that ATP synthesis is not perfectly coupled to oxygen consumption. The major inefficiency in the system is leakage of protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane driven by the proton electrochemical gradient. The kinetics of the proton leak can be determined indirectly, by measuring the oxygen consumption of mitochondria under non-phosphorylating conditions (plus oligomycin) as a function of the proton electrochemical gradient. This experimental system provides a convenient means to investigate inner membrane permeability to protons and the effect of factors that may effect that permeability. In this paper we review some results from our laboratory of indirect measurement of mitochondrial proton leak and how it has been applied to investigate the effect of aging, obesity and thyroid status on proton leak. The results show that (i) proton leak in isolated liver mitochondria is not significantly different in a comparison of young and old rats, in contrast (ii) there is an apparent increase in proton leak in in situ mitochondria in hepatocytes from old rats when compared to those from young rats, (iii) proton leak in neuronal mitochondria in situ in synaptosomes is not significantly different in young and old rats, (iv) proton leak is greater in isolated liver mitochondria from ob/ob mice compared to lean controls, (v) acute leptin (OB protein) administration restores the increased leak rate in isolated liver mitochondria from ob/ob mice to that of lean controls, (vi) administration of thyroid hormone (T3) increases proton leak in rat muscle mitochondria, and (vii) proton leak in muscle mitochondria is insensitive to the presence of GDP. It is proposed that the experimental system described here for measuring proton leak, is an ideal functional assay for determining whether the novel uncoupling proteins increase inner membrane permeability to protons.",Excluded
2812,"Effects of variable power on tissue ablation dynamics during magnetic resonance-guided laser-induced thermal therapy with the Visualase system Purpose: Magnetic resonance-guided laser-induced thermal therapy (MRgLITT) is a minimally invasive procedure used to treat various intracranial pathologies. This study investigated the effects of variable power on maximal estimated thermal damage during ablation and duration required to reach maximal ablation. Materials/Methods: All ablations were performed using the Visualase Thermal Therapy System (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, Minnesota), which uses a 980 nm diffusing tip diode laser. Cases were stratified into low, medium and high power. Maximal thermal damage estimate (TDEmax) achieved in a single plane and time to reach maximal damage (ttdemax) were measured and compared between groups using a 2x3 Fixed Factor Analysis of Covariance. Ablation area change for cases in which an initial thermal dose was followed by a subsequent dose, with increased power, was also assessed. Result(s): We used real-time ablation data from 93 patients across various intracranial pathologies. ttdemax (mean +/- SEM) decreased linearly as power increased (low: 139.2 +/- 10.4 s, medium: 127.5 +/- 4.3 s, high: 103.7 +/- 5.8 s). In cases where a second thermal dose was delivered at higher power, the TDE expanded an average of 51.4 mm2 beyond the initial TDE generated by the first ablation, with the second ablation approaching TDEmax at a higher rate than the initial ablation. Conclusion(s): Increased power results in a larger TDEmax and an increased ablation rate. In cases where an initial thermal dose does not fully ablate the target lesion, a second ablation at higher power can increase the area of ablation with an increased ablation rate.Copyright © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Excluded
2680,"Feasibility study of postoperative intraperitoneal hyperthermochemotherapy by radiofrequency capacitive heating system for advanced gastric cancer with peritoneal seeding Background: Gastric carcinoma patients with peritoneal dissemination have an extremely poor prognosis. Attempting to improve regional control and decrease the risk of complications related to hyperthermic chemotherapy, we applied a new treatment modality using a combination of gastrectomy with postoperative intraperitoneal hyperthermo-chemotherapy (PIHC) using Thermotron RF-8. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of PIHC in advanced gastric carcinoma patients with peritoneal seeding. Patients and Methods: Between March 2002 and April 2006, 20 gastric carcinoma patients with peritoneal dissemination were allocated to two groups in the patient's selection. The PIHC group (10 patients) received a 60-min PIHC with a cisplatin dose of 80 mg/m2 two weeks after surgery, and the control group (10 patients) received surgery alone. Thermotron RF-8 is a heating device that can raise temperatures in both superficial and deep-seated tumours using 8 MHz radiofrequency electromagnetic waves as a source of heat. Result(s): No patients in either group had life-threatening complications. The most frequent nonhaematologic toxicity (grade 3) was nausea. The one-, two-, and three-year cumulative survival rates for the PIHC group were 60%, 48%, and 36%, respectively, whereas those for the control group were 40%, 10%, and 0%, respectively. The survival rates for the PIHC group were significantly higher than those for the control group. Conclusion(s): Although this study was conducted non-randomly with a small number of patients, the PIHC group had a higher survival rate and better prognosis compared with the control group.",Excluded
2817,"Decline of natural killer cell activity in sublethally irradiated mice Spleen cells of (C57BL/6 X C3H/He)F1 mice were assayed for natural killer (NK) cell activity against YAC-1 and FBL-3 lymphoma targets at several intervals after total-body exposure to a high sublethal dose of 137Cs or 60Co gamma-rays. NK cell activity did not decline for the first 12 days but decreased sharply thereafter and remained low until day 24. The recovery of splenic NK cell activity was delayed. Beginning on day 28, the activity was slowly increased, reaching near-normal levels (80% of controls) 41-59 days after irradiation. Suppressor cells detectable during the period of lowest NK cell activity, i.e., on days 17 and 19, may have been responsible for the delayed and slow recovery. These studies indicated that a) mature effectors of natural cytotoxicity are relatively radioresistant renewable cells with a lifespan of about 2 weeks whose progenitors are radiosensitive cells b) the kinetics of decline and especially of recovery of NK cell activity may be influenced by suppressor cells. Should NK cell activity confer resistance to autochthonous lymphomas in vivo, it may be a significant consideration for strategies of tumor therapy by cytotoxic agents that reconstitution of the NK cell pool is a slow process and that suppressor cell function must be overcome for full recovery.",Included
2563,"Effect of selective inhibitors of inflammation on oral mucositis: preclinical studies OBJECTIVE: Oral mucositis is a severe, dose-limiting side effect of radio(chemo)therapy for head and neck tumors. The epithelial radiation response (ulceration) is accompanied by inflammatory changes. Their interaction with the epithelial processes remains unclear. The present study was initiated to determine the effect of inhibition of TNF-alpha or COX-2 on the epithelial radiation response in the mouse tongue model., METHODS: Daily fractionated irradiation was given with 5 x 3 Gy/week over one (days 0-4) or two weeks (days 0-4, 7-11). Each protocol was terminated by graded test doses (5 dose groups, 10 animals each) to a defined area of the lower tongue surface to generate full dose-effect curves for mucosal ulceration. A TNF-alpha inhibiting antibody (Infliximab) or a COX-2 inhibitor (Celecoxib) was administered., RESULTS: No effect of Infliximab or Celecoxib was found in any of the protocols. Isoeffective doses for ulcer induction were unchanged. Also, the time course of the response was largely unaffected., CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of TNF-alpha or COX-2, two dominating inflammatory pathways, did not result in modulation of the response of oral epithelium during fractionated irradiation. This suggests that the inflammatory changes mediated through TNF-alpha or COX-2 are not relevant for the epithelial radiation response of oral mucosa.",Excluded
2706,"Efficacy of three-dimensional road mapping by fusion of computed tomography angiography and fluoroscopy in endovascular treatment of aorto-iliac chronic total occlusion The efficacy of multimodality image fusion road-mapping technique for endovascular therapy has been reported recently. Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of endovascular therapy (EVT) with three-dimensional (3D) road mapping by fusing computed tomography (CT) and angiographical volumetric data for aorto-iliac chronic total occlusion (CTO). We retrospectively analyzed 36 patients with aorto-iliac CTO from June 2017 to November 2019 and classified them into two groups: EVT using a CT fused 3D roadmap (CTf3D-RM; 3D group, n = 14) and standard EVT (standard group, n = 22). Primary endpoint was wiring time and secondary endpoints were procedural success rate, number of guidewires, procedure time, radiation dose, contrast medium dose, and complications. Wiring time was significantly shorter in the 3D group than the standard group (3D, 15.6 +/- 10.23 min vs. standard, 44.6 +/- 35.3 min; p = 0.0052). Both groups had high procedural success rates (3D, 100% vs. standard, 100%) and low complication rates (3D, 0.0% vs. standard, 9.1%; p = 0.51). There were significantly fewer guidewires in the 3D group than the standard group (3D, 2.78 +/- 1.31 vs. standard, 4.36 +/- 2.01; p = 0.0138). The 3D group trended towards shorter procedural time (3D, 78.8 +/- 32.5 min vs. standard, 107.5 +/- 52.5 min; p = 0.076), lower radiation dose (3D, 28.6 +/- 18.9 Gycm2 vs. standard, 48.9 +/- 49.2 Gycm2; p = 0.15), and lower contrast medium dose (3D, 102.2 +/- 30.6 vs. standard, 127.5 +/- 51.3; p = 0.11) than the standard group. Therefore, we concluded that EVT with CTf3D-RM is effective for aorto-iliac CTO. This method may improve the quality of aorto-iliac CTO interventions.Copyright © 2020, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
2648,"Treatment results of alternating chemoradiotherapy followed by proton beam therapy boost combined with intra-arterial infusion chemotherapy for stage III-IVB tongue cancer Purpose: Proton beam therapy (PBT), compared with conventional radiotherapy, can deliver high-dose radiation to a tumor, while minimizing doses delivered to surrounding normal tissues. The better dose distribution of PBT may contribute to the improvement in local control rate and reduction in late adverse events. We evaluated therapeutic results and toxicities of PBT combined with selective intra-arterial infusion chemotherapy (PBT-IACT) in patients with stage III-IVB squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. Material(s) and Method(s): After 2 systemic chemotherapy courses and whole-neck irradiation (36 Gy in 20 fractions), we administered concurrent chemoradiotherapy comprising PBT for the primary tumor [28.6-33 Gy(RBE) in 13-15 fractions] and for the metastatic neck lymph node [33-39.6 Gy(RBE) in 15-18 fractions] with weekly retrograde intra-arterial chemotherapy by continuous infusion of cisplatin with sodium thiosulfate. Result(s): Between February 2009 and September 2012, 33 patients were enrolled. The median follow-up duration was 43 months. The 3-year overall survival, progression-free survival, local control rate, and regional control rate for the neck were 87.0, 74.1, 86.6, and 83.9 %, respectively. Major acute toxicities >grade 3 included mucositis in 26 cases (79 %), neutropenia in 17 cases (51 %), and dermatitis in 11 cases (33 %). Late grade 2 osteoradionecrosis was observed in 1 case (3 %). Conclusion(s): PBT-IACT for stage III-IVB tongue cancer has an acceptable toxicity profile and showed good treatment results. This protocol should be considered as a treatment option for locally advanced tongue cancer.Copyright © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
3539,"Feasibility and efficiency of double-agent versus single-agent concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma Purpose: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is the mainstay of treatment for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. It remains unclear whether double-agent CCRT (d-CCRT) is more effective than single-agent CCRT (s-CCRT). In this study, we compared the treatment efficiency and toxicity of d-CCRT with s-CCRT in NPC patients. Methods and materials: Patients with stage II-IV NPC treated with d-CCRT or s-CCRT were retrospectively reviewed. The d-CCRT group patients were compared with s-CCRT group patients for overall survival (OS), locoregional relapse-free survival (LRRFS), disease-free survival (DFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and toxicity. Differences in baseline characteristics were adjusted using the pair-matching method. Result(s): In this study, 933 patients who received CCRT for NPC between 2011 and 2014 were pair-matched at a 1:2 ratio (n = 311 for d-CCRT; n = 622 for s-CCRT). The d-CCRT treated patients showed no significant advantages in terms of 4-year OS (87.2% vs. 85.5%), DFS (84.1% vs. 79.5%), LRRFS (94.6% vs. 91.8%), DMFS (87.5% vs. 85.5%) compared with s-CCRT treated patients (P = 0.450, 0.106, 0.203, 0.366, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that CCRT regimen had no significant effects on survival. In the d-CCRT group, the incidence of grade 3-4 hematological toxicities was significantly higher. Conclusion(s): The d-CCRT regimen did not confer significant survival benefits compared with the s-CCRT regimen in the treatment of stage II-IV NPC patients. Furthermore, patients treated with the d-CCRT regimen experienced greater hematological toxicity.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
2745,"Neoadjuvant chemoradiation for esophageal cancer: Surgery improves locoregional control while response based on FDG-PET/CT predicts survival Introduction: To retrospectively analyze the outcome of patients with esophageal cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation. Method(s): A total of 41 patients received neoadjuvant intent chemoradiation for esophageal cancer. Most patients had a locally advanced disease (T3/4: 82%, N+: 83%, M0: 100%) and squamous cell carcinoma (83%). All patients received concurrent chemotherapy with cisplatin/5-fluorouracil or mitomycin/5-fluorouracil. Median radiation dose was 50.4Gy in the 25 patients who proceeded to surgery and 57.4Gy in 16 patients who did not undergo surgery. FDG-PET/CT was used for treatment planning in 24 patients. A second FDG-PET/CT was available for response evaluation in 18 patients. Result(s): Median follow-up was 16 months in all patients and 30 months in survivors. Radiotherapy was completed without interruptions >3 days in 90% of patients, and chemotherapy was carried out to >80% in 85% of patients. The 2-year locoregional control rate was 60%, distant control rate 54% and overall survival rate 50%. Hematological toxicity grade 3/4 was observed in 34%/10% of patients and non-hematological toxicity grade 3/4 in 46%/2% of patients. Perioperative 30-day mortality was 4%. Subgroup analyses revealed that surgery significantly improved locoregional control (74% vs. 39%, p= 0.034), but not the 2-year survival rate (54% vs. 43%, p= 0.246). In contrast, response based on FDG-PET/CT prior and after chemoradiation significantly predicted improved overall survival (2-year overall survival 61% vs. 40%, p= 0.048). Conclusion(s): Outcomes of our cohort were comparable to other series using similar treatments. Surgery significantly improved locoregional control but not survival. Response based on FDG-PET/CT predicted survival and might be used for treatment stratification.Copyright © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
2727,"3D deep learning angiography (3D-DLA) from C-arm Conebeam CT BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Deep learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that has demonstrated unprecedented performance in many medical imaging applications. Our purpose was to develop a deep learning angiography method to generate 3D cerebral angiograms from a single contrast-enhanced C-arm conebeam CT acquisition in order to reduce image artifacts and radiation dose. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A set of 105 3D rotational angiography examinations were randomly selected from an internal data base. All were acquired using a clinical system in conjunction with a standard injection protocol. More than 150 million labeled voxels from 35 subjects were used for training. A deep convolutional neural network was trained to classify each image voxel into 3 tissue types (vasculature, bone, and soft tissue). The trained deep learning angiography model was then applied for tissue classification into a validation cohort of 8 subjects and a final testing cohort of the remaining 62 subjects. The final vasculature tissue class was used to generate the 3D deep learning angiography images. To quantify the generalization error of the trained model, we calculated the accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and Dice similarity coefficients for vasculature classification in relevant anatomy. The 3D deep learning angiography and clinical 3D rotational angiography images were subjected to a qualitative assessment for the presence of intersweep motion artifacts. RESULT(S): Vasculature classification accuracy and 95% CI in the testing dataset were 98.7% (98.3%-99.1%). No residual signal from osseous structures was observed for any 3D deep learning angiography testing cases except for small regions in the otic capsule and nasal cavity compared with 37% (23/62) of the 3D rotational angiographies. CONCLUSION(S): Deep learning angiography accurately recreated the vascular anatomy of the 3D rotational angiography reconstructions without a mask. Deep learning angiography reduced misregistration artifacts induced by intersweep motion, and it reduced radiation exposure required to obtain clinically useful 3D rotational angiography.Copyright © 2018 American Society of Neuroradiology.

2748,"Computer-aided pulmonary nodule detection - performance of two CAD systems at different CT dose levels PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of dose reduction on the performance of computer-aided lung nodule detection systems (CAD) of two manufacturers by comparing respective CAD results on ultra-low-dose computed tomography (ULD-CT) and standard dose CT (SD-CT)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) data sets of 26 patients (13 male and 13 female, patients 31 - 74 years old) were retrospectively selected for CAD analysis. Indication for CT examination was staging of a known primary malignancy or suspected pulmonary malignancy. CT images were consecutively acquired at 5 mAs (ULD-CT) and 75 mAs (SD-CT) with 120 kV tube voltage (1 mm slice thickness). The standard of reference was determined by three experienced readers in consensus. CAD reading algorithms (pre-commercial CAD system, Philips, Netherlands: CAD-1; LungCARE, Siemens, Germany: CAD-2) were applied to the CT data sets., RESULTS: Consensus reading identified 253 nodules on SD-CT and ULD-CT. Nodules ranged in diameter between 2 and 41 mm (mean diameter 4.8 mm). Detection rates were recorded with 72 % and 62 % (CAD-1 vs. CAD-2) for SD-CT and with 73 % and 56 % for ULD-CT. Median false positive rates per patient were calculated with 6 and 5 (CAD-1 vs. CAD-2) for SD-CT and with 8 and 3 for ULD-CT. After separate statistical analysis of nodules with diameters of 5 mm and greater, the detection rates increased to 83 % and 61 % for SD-CT and to 89 % and 67 % for ULD-CT (CAD-1 vs. CAD-2). For both CAD systems there were no significant differences between the detection rates for standard and ultra-low-dose data sets (p > 0.05)., CONCLUSION: Dose reduction of the underlying CT scan did not significantly influence nodule detection performance of the tested CAD systems.",Excluded
2891,"Malignant melanoma in Connecticut and Denmark The rising incidence of malignant melanoma of the skin was reviewed using data from the Connecticut Tumor Registry (1935-1974) (Eisenberg et al., 1967) and the Danish Cancer Registry (1943-1972) (Clemmesen, 1965, 1974, 1977). A total of 7,530 cases were analyzed according to age, sex and anatomic site. The total age-adjusted incidence rates were similar for these two areas, despite geographic and demographic differences. However, the most rapid changes in melanoma incidence were observed in females from Denmark and males from Connecticut. In addition, the largest increases occurred for lower-extremity lesions in Danish middle-aged women and trunk-neck melanomas in Connecticut middle-aged men. Melanoma of the face was resistant to changing incidence and occurred in an older age group than melanoma of other skin sites. In general, birth cohort analysis confirmed that changing incidence began for persons born around 1900, but the rising incidence for lower-extremity melanomas in women and trunk-neck melanomas in males began earlier. In comparing incidence for anatomic sites by correcting for surface area and melanocyte density, higher than expected rates were seen for melanoma of the face in both sexes and trunk-neck melanomas in males. The data presented supported the concept that a cumulative exposure to solar radiation may be important in the etiology of melanoma of the face, but short, intense sun exposure is probably related to melanoma in other sun-exposed areas, and that melanoma in areas other than the face is responsible for the rising incidence of this disease.",Excluded

Survival rate, larynx preservation rate were calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analysis was conducted for significant prognostic factors with Cox-regression method., RESULTS: The median follow-up was 19.4 months for all patients, and 25.8 months for those alive. The 5-year overall survival rate was 33% and 44% for primary surgery and definitive CCRT, respectively (p = 0.788). The 5-year functional larynx-preservation survival after IMRT was 40%. Acute toxicities were common, but usually tolerable. The rates of treatment-related mucositis (> or = grade 2) and pharyngitis (> or = grade 3) were higher in the CCRT group. For multivariate analysis, treatment response and cricoid cartilage invasion strongly correlated with survival., CONCLUSIONS: IMRT plus concurrent chemotherapy may preserve the larynx without compromising survival.

2553,"The early causal influence of cell size upon synaptic number: the mutant gigas of Drosophila The number of synaptic contacts formed by a neuron is known to vary with its surface area. This could be because large neurons are able to establish more synaptic sites, or because those neurons that are able to establish more sites are subsequently able to enlarge. To test between these two possibilities clones of enlarged ommatidia were generated in the retina of the Drosophila mutant gigas, by mitotic recombination following gamma-irradiation in the third-instar larva. The numbers of afferent synaptic contacts formed by the photoreceptor terminals in the first optic neuropil, or lamina, were then counted in the adult. The terminals of mutant photoreceptors were also enlarged, but by varying degrees. The sizes of their profiles in single sections merged with the size distribution of terminals having a wild-type phenotype, lying outside the clone in the same lamina. A perimeter of 6.0 microns for the profiles of receptor terminal in cross section was established as a criterion for distinguishing between normal and mutant phenotypes. The mutant terminals had more presynaptic sites. Because only the gigas terminals are mutant and because they enlarged at a time long before synapse formation occurred in the lamina we may conclude that cell enlargement preceded elevated synaptic number. The increase in synaptic number roughly matched the increased membrane surface of the terminals, so as nearly to preserve a constant areal density of synaptic sites over a 5-fold range in synaptic frequency.",Excluded
3192,"Exposure to electromagnetic fields and risk of central nervous system disease in utility workers Occupational exposure to electromagnetic fields has been associated with neurological diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, senile dementia, Parkinson disease, and Alzheimer disease.

I linked the cohort to the nationwide, population-based Danish National Register of Patients and compared the numbers of cases of these diseases observed between 1978 and 1993 with the corresponding rates in the general population. In addition I fit to the data on utility workers a multiplicative Poisson regression model in relation to estimated levels of exposure to 50-Hz electromagnetic fields. Overall, there was an increase in risk for senile dementia and motor neuron diseases combined. The incidences of Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, and other diseases of the central nervous system were essentially unrelated to exposure to electromagnetic fields. A decreased risk of epilepsy compared with the general population probably reflects a healthy worker effect; I observed an increased risk of epilepsy based on internal comparisons. The increased risk for senile dementia and motorneuron diseases may be associated with above-average levels of exposure to electromagnetic fields.",Excluded

Methods and Materials Fifty-five patients with T2-T4aNx-2M0-1 bladder cancer not suitable for cystectomy or daily radiation therapy treatment were recruited. A ""plan of the day"" radiation therapy approach was used, treating the whole (empty) bladder to 36 Gy in 6 weekly fractions. Acute toxicity was assessed weekly during radiation therapy, at 6 and 12 weeks using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0. Late toxicity was assessed at 6 months and 12 months using Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grading. Cystoscopy was used to assess local control at 3 months. Cumulative incidence function was used to determine local progression at 1 at 2 years. Death without local progression was treated as a competing risk. Overall survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results Median age was 86 years (range, 68-97 years). Eighty-seven percent of patients completed their prescribed course of radiation therapy. Genitourinary and gastrointestinal grade 3 acute toxicity was seen in 18% (10/55) and 4% (2/55) of patients, respectively. No grade 4 genitourinary or gastrointestinal toxicity was seen. Grade >=3 late toxicity (any) at 6 and 12 months was seen in 6.5% (2/31) and 4.3% (1/23) of patients, respectively. Local control after radiation therapy was 92% of assessed patients (60% total population). Cumulative incidence of local progression at 1 year and 2 years for all patients was 7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 2%-17%) and 17% (95% CI 8%-29%), respectively. Overall survival at 1 year was 63% (95% CI 48%-74%).

2591,"Ionizing radiation causes a dose-dependent release of transforming growth factor alpha in vitro from irradiated xenografts and during palliative treatment of hormone-refractory prostate carcinoma PURPOSE: Characterize the radiation response for transforming growth factor (TGF) alpha shedding in vitro and in vivo. We also report the shedding of TGF alpha by patients undergoing irradiation for hormone-refractory prostate cancer., EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: TGF alpha levels were determined by ELISA. DU145 xenografts were established on the flanks of athymic nu/nu mice. Expression of phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 and phospho-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the DNA repair proteins XRCC1 and ERCC1 were determined by Western analyses., RESULTS: Exposure to ionizing radiation results in a dose-dependent release of TGF alpha. Once released, TGF alpha stimulates EGFR-ERK1/2 signaling in unirradiated cells. Blockade of the EGFR with the tyrphostin AG1478 eliminates the up-regulation XRCC1 and ERCC1 by TGF alpha or irradiation. After irradiation, cells are refractory to additional transactivation of EGFR by additional irradiation for 8 to 12 hours. Irradiation during this refractory period does not increase the expression of XRCC1 or ERCC1. Ligand activation of EGFR is maintained during the refractory period. Irradiation of DU145 xenografts also results in the activation of ERK1/2, release of TGF alpha, and a similar refractory period. Ionizing irradiation also results in the release of TGF alpha for patients undergoing radiation therapy for hormone-refractory prostate cancer., CONCLUSIONS: Irradiation results in a dose-dependent increase in TGF alpha capable of enhancing the growth of DU145 xenografts. TGF alpha is also shed following radiation therapy of patients treated for hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Radiation transactivation of the EGFR produces a radio-refractory period, which lasts for several hours. During this period, additional irradiation fails to induce XRCC1, ERCC1, or additional TGF alpha release.",Included

This study aimed to evaluate the clinical effects of carbon ion radiotherapy (C-ion RT) in locally advanced HCC (LAHCC). Method(s): The data of 11 consecutive patients with LAHCC who received C-ion RT were analyzed. The C-ion RT doses of 52.8 Gy (relative biological effectiveness [RBE]) and 60.0 Gy (RBE) were delivered in 4 fractions for standard cases, and the 60.0 Gy dose was delivered in 12 fractions for close-to-gastrointestinal-tract cases. Survival and local control probabilities were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): The median follow-up duration after C-ion RT was 36.4 months. The median age at the time of registration for C-ion RT was 76 years. The median tumor size was 53 mm. The numbers of treatment-naive and recurrent HCC patients were 1 and 10, respectively. Direct invasion of the major branch of the portal vein, hepatic vein, or both portal and hepatic veins was observed in three, five, and three patients, respectively.

In GOTHA I, three cycles of cisplatin, 60 mg/m2 day 1, mitomycin, 8 mg/m2 day 1, and vindesin 3 mg/m2 day 1 and the first day of the following week, were given during weeks 1, 5, and 9; in GOTHA II, cisplatin 70 mg/m2 day 1 and vinblastin 5 mg/m2 day 1 and the first day of the following week were given during weeks 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, and 21. Result(s): With a minimum follow-up of 3 years, the 1-, 2-, 5-, and 8-year overall survival probability was 56% (95% CI 47-64%), 27% (20-35%), 12% (7- 18%) and 9% (3-16%), respectively, with a median survival of 13.6 months (11.4-16.8). Median follow-up for survivors was 6 years (3.3-9.9). There were no survival differences between Stages IIIA and IIIB (p = 0.84), performance status 0, 1, 2 (p = 0.87), sex (p = 0.45) or between the two treatment protocols. At this time, 14 patients are alive, and 118 have died: 102 from NSCLC, 4 from acute toxicity, 2 from secondary surgery, 4 from other medical causes, and 6 from unknown causes. Correlation between response and long- term survival was poor, since of the 24 patients who survived 3 years or more, only 6 (25%) were classified as having a complete response; the remainder having either a partial response (11, 46%), no change (6, 25%), or 'progressive disease' (1,4%). First site of relapse was local in 31% of these cases, distant in 43%, local and distant in 15%, and unknown in 11%. Main grade 3-4 acute toxicities were nausea-vomiting (17%), mucositis (15%), leukopenia (41%), and thrombocytopenia (11%). Eight patients presented with grade 3-4 symptomatic lung radiation pneumopathy. Conclusion(s): Based on this experience with 132 patients, this combination of alternated RT and chemotherapy (CT) for inoperable Stage III NSCLC is feasible with acceptable toxicity, and long-term results suggest a gain in survival when compared to those obtained with conventional RT alone. However, the still high local and distant failure rates indicate that both local and systemic therapies need to be improved.",Excluded
3667,"A critical period for estrogen action on neurons of the song control system in the zebra finch The song nuclei of the male zebra finch (Poephila guttata) contain larger neurons than those of the female. This gender difference arises after hatching as a result of cell atrophy in the female and cell growth in the male. Implantation of estrogen in female chicks induces masculine differentiation of neurons in their song nuclei. The effects of estrogen on neuron size decline steeply after posthatching day 35 when neuronal atrophy begins. Estrogen loses its masculinizing effects completely after day 45 when the adult level of neuronal atrophy is reached. Thus, the end and the intensity of hormone action appear to be correlated with the timing of neuronal atrophy.",Excluded
3642,"Effect of age, different light conditions, melatonin, and epitalon on lysosomal proteinase activity in the liver and kidneys of rats Ageing, melatonin, epithalon (tetrapeptide Ala-Glu-Asp-Gly) and different light conditions effects on protein content and cathepsins B and D activities in rat liver and kidneys lysosomal fractions were studied. Ageing leads to decrease of cathepsins activity in rat liver lysosomal fractions. Constant light and darkness conditions result in earlier age decline of cathepsins activity. Absence of day and night succession in comparison with alternating light conditions causes decline of both general and specific cathepsin D activity. Melatonin and epithalon administration resulted in decrease of cathepsin D activity in liver only under control interchangeable light conditions. Cathepsin B activity in liver and kidneys lysosomal fractions declined in all experimental light conditions. Cathepsins activity decrease under the influence of epiphysial factors is evidently connected with their inhibitory effect on protein and general metabolism.",Excluded

2994,"Bone and joint modeling from 3D ankle MRI: Feasibility and comparisonwith radiographs and 2D MRI Purpose: To evaluate feasibility of creating segmented joint models (bone surface reconstructed x-ray) from 3D isotropic ankle MRI, assess various angular and joint space measurements on models and compare with corresponding radiographs and 2D MRI measurements, and determine differences in time consumption for performing the measurements. Material(s) and Method(s): Under HIPPAA compliance, consecutive series of 27 subjects with 3D ankle MRI isotropic data sets (0.65 mm voxel, fast spin echo, proton density weighted sequence) performed on 3 T scanners were used. Three subjects with incomplete x-ray series were excluded. Thus, a total of 24 subjects, 11 left and 13 right ankles, were included in the study, of which 8 were male and 16 females. Age ranged from 17 to 73 with mean of 46 years. Segmented joint models (bone surface reconstructed x-rays) were created on all isotropic MR data sets by one observer. Three readers independently performed various blinded angular and joint space measurements on the models, corresponding 2D MRI, and radiographs (XR) at study inception and 8 weeks later. Means and standard deviations were calculated. Paired t-tests were performed for each pair (XR vs. 2D, XR vs. 3D and 2D vs. 3D) within each parameter. P values less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant and box plots were generated. Spearman correlation coefficient between measurements was performed to assess Inter-reader agreement. Interclass correlation and time difference analysis was performed. Result(s): 3D segmentation models resembling x-ray were successfully created in all cases within 20 (+/-5) minutes. Good agreement (ICC > 0.65) between all reader measurements was noted across all modalities with the exception of measuring the Talocural angle (3D, 2D, XR), talar pitch (3D), and tibibofibular clear space (2D), which showed weak to poor correlation. Time consumption was significantly greater (p < 0.05) on 2D vs 3D for all measurements except lateral clear space and medial tibiotalar concavity assessments. Time consumption was noted to be significantly greater (p < 0.05) on XR as compared to 3D for nearly half the measurements (5 of 11) for each reader. Conclusion(s): 3D bone and joint segmentation models resembling x-ray are feasible from isotropic ankle MRI data sets, which might lead to possibility of automated measurements by computer in future. While good correlation was noted between all readers, absolute measurement values were significantly different between modalities. The differences in absolute values is likely related to positioning variances (rotated x-ray mortise causing varied joint width, non-angle corrected 2D images, weight bearing vs non weight bearing, and the optimal positioning of reconstructed 3D image). Tighter collimation, a protocol variation, also limited evaluation in some cases by non-inclusion of reference points normally used with XR imaging and contributed to variance. Very good (ICC > 0.7) intrareader agreement was noted for most measurements with a few measurements showing moderate to good correlation (ICC > 0.5 to 0.65), Measurements on the 3D model of joint spaces was significantly faster when compared to 2D and generally faster than XR.",Excluded

2514,"Brachytherapy in lip carcinoma: Long-term results Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of low-dose-rate brachytherapy for local control and relapse-free survival in squamous cell and basal cell carcinomas of the lips. We compared two groups: one with tumors on the skin and the other with tumors on the lip. Patients and Methods: All patients had been treated at Claudius Regaud Cancer Centre from 1990 to 2008 for squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma. Low-dose-rate brachytherapy was performed with iridium 192 wires according to the Paris system rules. On average, the dose delivered was 65 Gy. Result(s): 172 consecutive patients were included in our study; 69 had skin carcinoma (squamous cell or basal cell), and 92 had squamous cell mucosal carcinoma. The average follow-up time was 5.4 years. In the skin cancer group, there were five local recurrences and one lymph node recurrence. In the mucosal cancer group, there were ten local recurrences and five lymph node recurrences. The 8-year relapse-free survival for the entire population was 80%. The 8-year relapse-free survival was 85% for skin carcinoma 75% for mucosal carcinoma, with no significant difference between groups. The functional results were satisfactory for 99% of patients, and the cosmetic results were satisfactory for 92%. Maximal toxicity observed was Grade 2. Conclusion(s): Low-dose-rate brachytherapy can be used to treat lip carcinomas at Stages T1 and T2 as the only treatment with excellent results for local control and relapse-free survival. The benefits of brachytherapy are also cosmetic and functional, with 91% of patients having no side effects. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
3384,"Contrast harmonic imaging ultrasound and perfusion imaging for surveillance after endovascular abdominal aneurysm repair regarding detection and characterization of suspected endoleaks OBJECTIVE: Is Contrast Harmonic Imaging (CHI) comparable to computed tomography angiography (CTA) scan in detecting and characterizing suspected endoleaks after endovascular abdominal aneurysm repair in a non-selected group including reintervention procedure and branched endografts in daily practice?, MATERIAL/METHODS: In a prospective study computed tomography angiography (CTA) and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) were performed in 30 consecutive patients (26 males, 4 females, mean age: 72 years, range: 38-87) with suspected endoleaks in follow-up (mean 13 months, range: 1-95) after endovascular abdominal aneurysm repair or procedure in dissection or penetrated ulcer of the aorta (25 infrarenal, 5 suprarenal stent grafts, mean aortic diameter 56 mm, range: 27-98). CTA was supposed to be gold standard for determining the presence of endoleaks (multislice CT, collimation 16 x 0.75 mm, 100 ml of iodized contrast agent bolus). Ultrasonography used a multi-frequency probe (1-4 MHz) with the modalities of colour coded Doppler sonography (CCDS), power Doppler (PD) combined with contrast enhancement and the technique of contrast harmonic imaging (CHI) and low mechanical index (MI < 0.2). 2.4 ml of SonoVue (Bracco, Altana Pharma GmbH, Italy) were administered to each patient intravenously as a bolus injection., RESULTS: Out of 30 patients, 21 endoleaks were identified in CTA (6 type I or III, 15 type II), 22 in CHI. Thus, sensitivity for CHI was therefore 99%, its specificity 85% (Spearman correlation coefficient (CC) 0.92). In follow-up the localizations of endoleak type I or III exclusively detected by CHI were confirmed as true positive by angiography. Due to its dynamic characteristic CHI seemed to be more helpful in characterization of endoleaks than CTA. In case of a rupture after reintervention a type III endoleak leads to prompt intervention before receiving the result of the CT scan. Altogether, CHI failed to identify 1 combined type I and II endoleak (sensitivity 0.99). Both, CCDS and PD were positive only in 6/30 patients (CC 0.33 and 0.39). Interestingly the application of contrast agent doubles the detection rate of endoleaks (12/30) in CCDS and PD (CC 0.39)., CONCLUSION: Contrast harmonic imaging (CHI) compared to computed tomography angiography (CTA) accurately depicts endoleaks after endovascular abdominal aneurysm repair and stent-graft procedure in dissected and ulcerated aorta. It seems to be superior in characterization of the type of endoleaks and can be established in order to reduce iodized contrast agent and radiation exposure in follow-up. In contrast to CTA scan CHI can be offered to patients with chronic renal insufficiency and allows a dynamic examination and a perfusion analysis.",Excluded

The participants comprised 81 patients with OSCC, consisting of 29 patients with stage II disease, 12 patients with stage III disease and 40 patients with stage IV disease. All patients received a total radiation dose of 30 Gy in daily fractions of 2 Gy, 5 times a week, for 3 weeks, and the patients were concurrently administered S-1 at a dose of 80-120 mg, twice daily, over 4 consecutive weeks. Radical surgery was performed in all cases at 2-6 weeks subsequent to the end of pre-operative chemoradiotherapy. The most common adverse event was oropharyngeal mucositis, but this was transient in all patients. No severe hematological or non-hematological toxicities were observed. The clinical and histopathological response rates were 70.4 and 75.3%, respectively. Post-operatively, local failure developed in 6 patients (7.4%) and neck failure developed in 2 patients (2.5%). Distant metastases were found in 7 patients (8.6%). The overall survival rate, disease-specific survival rate and locoregional control rate at 5 years were 87.7, 89.9 and 90.6%, respectively. Locoregional recurrence occurred more frequently in patients that demonstrated a poor histopathological response compared with patients that demonstrated a good response (P<0.01). These results indicate that pre-operative S-1 chemotherapy with radiotherapy at a total dose of 30 Gy is feasible and effective for patients with locally advanced OSCC, and that little or no histopathological response may be a risk factor for locoregional recurrence in this treatment.Copyright © 2016, Spandidos Publications.

2861,"Measuring and assessing individual external doses during the rehabilitation phase in Iitate village after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident After the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident in 2011, Iitate village was placed under an evacuation order because the level of radioactive materials drifting from the nuclear plant to the village was above a government-set level for allowing residents to live in the area. The evacuation advisory for most of the village was lifted on 31 March 2017. For displaced residents deciding whether or not to return to their homes, it is important to correctly understand and estimate the realistic individual external doses they will receive after returning to the village. In this study, with the support of residents of the village, we used a personal dosimeter (D-Shuttle) coupled with a global positioning system device to measure and thus understand realistic individual external doses while the residents were in Iitate village and to project the individual external doses for different administrative districts as of 1 April 2017. The measured individual external doses measured by D-Shuttle for 38 study participants showed that the doses measured during time spent inside the village were higher and more widely distributed than the doses measured during time spent outside the village. The exposure ratio (ER) was defined as the ratio of additional individual external dose measured by D-Shuttle to the additional ambient dose based on an airborne monitoring survey. The medians of the average ERs were 0.13 (min-max 0.06-0.27) for time spent at home and 0.18 (min-max 0.08-0.36) for time spent outdoors. Projected additional annual individual external doses as of 1 April 2017 for different administrative districts in the village were calculated using ERs obtained in this study. Assuming that individuals spent 8 h per day on outdoor activities and 16 h on indoor activities, additional annual individual external doses were estimated to be below 3 mSv using the mean of the average ERs for most districts in the village, and these values were well below the individual external doses estimated using the approach taken by the central government. The results of this study provide valuable information both for understanding realistic radiological situations in the village and for those who want to know their future individual external dose in order to make a decision on whether or not to live in the village.",Excluded

However, the sequencing of the two modalities, as well as fractionation of RT, has been controversial. The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) Study 92-04 was a randomized Phase II study designed to evaluate further the toxicity and efficacy of 2 different strategies of chemoradiation evaluated in 2 prior RTOG Phase II studies., METHODS: Patients with Stage II or III medically inoperable or unresectable non-small-cell lung cancer, good performance status, and minimal weight loss were enrolled into a prospective randomized Phase II RTOG study. Arm 1 consisted of induction ChT (vinblastine 5 mg/m(2) i.v. bolus weekly for the first 5 weeks, and cisplatin, 100 mg/m(2) i.v. on Days 1 and 29) followed by concurrent ChT/RT (cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) i.v. on Days 50, 71, and 92) during thoracic radiotherapy (63 Gy in 34 fractions during 7 weeks starting on Day 50). Arm 2 was concurrent ChT and hyperfractionated RT starting on Day 1 with a total dose of 69.6 Gy in 58 fractions during 6 weeks, 1.2 Gy/fraction b.i.d. ChT consisted of cisplatin, 50 mg/m(2) i.v. on Days 1 and 8, and oral VP-16, 50 mg b.i.d. for 10 days only on the days of thoracic radiotherapy repeated on Day 29., RESULTS: A total of 168 patients were entered between 1992 and 1994, and 163 patients were eligible for analysis. Eighty-one patients were treated in Arm 1 and 82 patients in Arm 2. Pretreatment characteristics, including age, gender, Karnofsky performance status, histologic features, and stage, were similar. The incidence of acute esophagitis was significantly higher among patients treated in Arm 2 than among those treated in Arm 1 (p <0.0001). The incidence of acute hematologic toxicity was significantly higher among patients treated in Arm 1 (p = 0.01 for anemia and p = 0.03 for other hematologic toxicities) than among those treated in Arm 2. Analysis of late toxicity showed that chronic esophageal toxicity was significantly more frequent in Arm 2 than in Arm 1 (p = 0.003). The time to in-field progression was significantly different (p = 0.009), favoring Arm 2 compared with Arm 1 (26% vs. 45% with failure in 2 years and 30% vs. 49% with failure in 4 years, respectively). The median 2-year and overall 5-year survival rates were similar between the two arms., CONCLUSION: Concurrent ChT and hyperfractionated RT resulted in a significant prolongation of the time to in-field progression, but with higher acute and chronic esophagitis. No other significant differences were observed between the two groups. Investigation with a chemoradio-protector is under way.",Excluded
3101,"Effectiveness of gene expression profiling for response prediction of rectal cancer to preoperative radiotherapy Background: Our aim was to determine whether the expression levels of specific genes could predict clinical radiosensitivity in human colorectal cancer. Method(s): Radioresistant colorectal cancer cell lines were established by repeated X-ray exposure (total, 100 Gy), and the gene expressions of the parent and radioresistant cell lines were compared in a microarray analysis. To verify the microarray data, we carried out a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of identified genes in clinical samples from 30 irradiated rectal cancer patients. Result(s): A comparison of the intensity data for the parent and three radioresistant cell lines revealed 17 upregulated and 142 downregulated genes in all radioresistant cell lines. Next, we focused on two upregulated genes, PTMA (prothymosin alpha) and EIF5a2 (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A), in the radioresistant cell lines. In clinical samples, the expression of PTMA was significantly higher in the minor effect group than in the major effect group (P = 0.004), but there were no significant differences in EIF5a2 expression between the two groups. Conclusion(s): We identified radiation-related genes in colorectal cancer and demonstrated that PTMA may play an important role in radiosensitivity. Our findings suggest that PTMA may be a novel marker for predicting the effectiveness of radiotherapy in clinical cases. © Springer-Verlag Tokyo 2007.",Excluded

North Central Cancer Treatment Group Per protocol, patients with primary CNS non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in an intergroup phase II trial conducted by the North Central Cancer Treatment Group and the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group had their cognitive functions measured using the Folstein and Folstein Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) and their physical functions measured using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Score (PS) at study entry, at each treatment evaluation, and at quarterly intervals thereafter until disease progression or death. Of the 53 eligible participants who began therapy, 46 (87%) had baseline MMSE scores recorded, 36 (68%) had at least one follow-up MMSE, and 32 (60%) had both, while 52 (98%) had baseline PS, 49 (92%) had at least one follow-up PS, and 48 (91%) had both. Patterns of MMSE and PS values over time were studied in each individual, in the group as a whole, in the 20 patients who completed the study regimen, in the 23 who survived more than a year, and in patients who were classified as nonprogressors at each key evaluation. For each patient, all recorded values were plotted versus time, with dates of disease progression and death included, to look for signs of decline in cognitive or physical function preceding adverse events. Long-term declines in scores of both cognitive and physical function were observed in many treated patients with primary CNS non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Nearly all patients who were alive more than 52 weeks after study entry had a demonstrable decline in cognitive and physical functionality. Such declines may occur before disease progression is documented; they may also occur in some patients who have long-term follow-up without evidence of disease progression. Declining MMSE and PS was a poor predictor of disease progression. There was no association of PS and toxicity. The data from this study demonstrated the considerable difficulties we encountered conducting an ancillary study such as this within a multicenter clinical trial. Firstly, the test instruments written into the protocol were unable to tell if the declines seen were due to disease, treatment, co-morbidity, or other factors. Secondly, the missing data created difficulties in interpreting outcome.",Excluded

The decision to treat ipsilateral or bilateral draining lymph node is on physician discretion and guidelines do not have a defined indication regarding this. We aimed to analyze the failure patterns and survival in buccal mucosa cancers treated with adjuvant ipsilateral RT. Material(s) and Method(s): One hundred sixteen cases of post-operative buccal mucosa cancers-pT3 or more, node positive, close margins (1-5 mm), lymphovascular invasion positive, perineural invasion positive, depth of invasion >4 mm-treated with RT to primary and ipsilateral nodes from May 2013 to May 2019 were retrospectively analyzed.

2604,"Comparative efficacy of repetitive nerve stimulation, exercise, and cold in differentiating myotonic disorders The decremental response of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) to provocative tests is not characterized in genetically verified myotonic disorders. We therefore studied the relationship between decremental responses and mutation type in 10 patients with recessive myotonia congenita (rMC), two with paramyotonia congenita (PMC), nine with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), four with DM2, and 14 healthy people. CMAPs were measured at rest, just after a short exercise test (SET), and during short, 5- and 10-HZ, repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) trains at 32 degrees C and at 20 degrees C. The degree of decrement was not related to the severity of clinical myotonia. Controls and PMC patients had similar responses when warm, but with cooling PMC patients had a persistent decrement of CMAPs. In the rMC patients the decremental responses were related to the type of mutation of the CLCN1 gene, as a decrement was encountered in the T268M, R894X, IVS17+1 G>T, K248X, and 2149 del G, but not with the IVS1+3 A>T, F167L, or dominant A313T mutations. In DM1 patients there was no relationship between decrement and CTG repeats. The degree of partial inexcitability in myotonic muscle membrane therefore depends on the mutation type rather than degree of clinical myotonia. RNS at 10 HZ is more sensitive than SET for demonstrating abnormalities in rMC patients when warm; differences are less marked when cold, which is useful to diagnose PMC. Provocative tests are therefore useful in myotonias to demonstrate muscle inexcitability, which depends on the chloride or sodium channelopathy.",Excluded

In this study, the severity of allergic symptoms in the pollen season was compared between patients treated with early medication, non-treated patients and patients treated with preseasonal contact Nd: YAG laser surgery. Results suggests that laser surgery was effective in reducing the severity of symptoms in patients with cedar pollinosis. Symptoms were milder in the laser group than in the medication group and non-treated group for 3-4 weeks after the start of seasonal pollinosis, although no differences were noted in the early weeks. This may be explained by the fact that laser irradiation reduces the lamina propria of the nasal mucosa, the site of allergic reactions. This also suggests that allergic pollen can't penetrate the mucosal surface which shows squamous epithelization after laser irradiation.",Excluded
3339,"Conservative treatment by irradiation of epidermoid cancers of the anal canal: prognostic factors of tumoral control and complications UNLABELLED: We analyzed in a retrospective series of patients treated by conservative irradiation for an epidermoid cancer of the anal canal (ECAC) the prognostic factors of locoregional control (LRC), survival, late severe complications (LSC), and sphincter conservation (SC)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: From 1976 until 1994, 118 patients presenting with an ECAC were conservatively treated (mean age, 65 years). According to the 1987 International Union Against Cancer (TNM) classification, they were: 19 T1, 70 T2, 22 T3, 7 T4, 94 N0, and 24 N1-3. The treatment started with external beam irradiation (EBI) (36 Gy in 3 weeks or 45 Gy in 5 weeks). Concomitant chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil and mitomycin C) was delivered to 31 patients. Two months later, a boost of 20 Gy was delivered by interstitial 192Ir brachytherapy to 101 patients and EBI in 5. Twelve other patients had an abdominoperineal resection (APR). The mean follow-up was 6 years., RESULTS: At 5 years the overall survival was 60%, and specific survival (SS) was 75%; it was 94% for T1, 79% for T2, 53% for T3, and 19% for T4. In multivariate analysis, tumor size (> or = 4 cm), node involvement, and no response to the EBI were factors of poor prognosis for SS. Thirty-two locoregional recurrences occurred of which 21 were local recurrences in the 106 patients treated by a conservative schedule. Only tumor size and response to the EBI were prognostic factors on multivariate analysis for local and LRC. A total of 17 patients presented with LSC (Grade 3, 16 patients; and Grade 4, 1 patient), which was treated by APR in 4 patients and colostomy in 11 (of which 7 were definitive). The only significant prognostic factor for LSC in the multivariate analysis was the total extrapolated response dose of irradiation. The definitive rate of SC after conservative treatment in cured patients was 100% for T1, 82% for T2, 58% for T3, and 100% for T4. Since 1989, improvements of the technique have allowed reduction of the LSC in maintaining the same local control., CONCLUSION: The results of this series are similar to those of the literature. The confirmation of pretherapeutic prognostic factors related to response to the treatment should allow us to adapt the therapeutic intensity for each case to obtain better tumor control, with as few sequelae as possible, to yield a better rate of SC.",Excluded
3375,"Cyberknife treatment for advanced or terminal stage hepatocellular carcinoma AIM: To investigate the safety and efficacy of the Cyberknife treatment for patients with advanced or terminal stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)., METHODS: Patients with HCC with extrahepatic metastasis or vascular or bile duct invasion were enrolled between May 2011 and June 2015. The Cyberknife was used to treat each lesion. Treatment response scores were based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1. The trends of tumor markers, including alpha fetoprotein (AFP) and proteins induced by vitamin K absence II (PIVKA II) were assessed. Prognostic factors for tumor response and tumor markers were evaluated with Fisher's exact test and a logistic regression model. Survival was evaluated with the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model., RESULTS: Sixty-five patients with 95 lesions were enrolled. Based on the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer classification, all patients were either in the advanced or terminal stage of the disease. The target lesions were as follows: 52 were bone metastasis; 9, lung metastasis; 7, brain metastasis; 9, portal vein invasion; 4, hepatic vein invasion; 4, bile duct invasion; and 10 other lesion types. The response rate and disease control rate were 34% and 53%, respectively. None of the clinical factors correlated significantly with tumor response. Fiducial marker implantation was associated with better control of both AFP (HR = 0.152; 95%CI: 0.026-0.887; P = 0.036) and PIVKA II (HR = 0.035; 95%CI: 0.003-0.342; P = 0.004). The median survival time was 9 mo (95%CI: 5-15 mo). Terminal stage disease (HR = 9.809; 95%CI: 2.589-37.17, P < 0.001) and an AFP of more than 400 ng/mL (HR = 2.548; 95%CI: 1.070-6.068, P = 0.035) were associated with worse survival. A radiation dose higher than 30 Gy (HR = 0.274; 95%CI: 0.093-0.7541, P = 0.012) was associated with better survival. In the 52 cases of bone metastasis, 36 patients (69%) achieved pain relief. One patient had cerebral bleeding and another patient had an esophageal ulcer after treatment., CONCLUSION: The Cyberknife can be safely administered to patients with advanced or terminal stage HCC. High AFP levels were associated with worse survival, but a higher radiation dose improved the survival.",Excluded
2692,"Impact of the radiosurgery prescription dose on the local control of small (2 cm or smaller) brain metastases OBJECTIVE The impact of the stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) prescription dose (PD) on local progression and radiation necrosis for small (<= 2 cm) brain metastases was evaluated. METHODS An institutional review board-approved retrospective review was performed on 896 patients with brain metastases <= 2 cm (3034 tumors) who were treated with 1229 SRS procedures between 2000 and 2012. Local progression and/or radiation necrosis were the primary end points. Each tumor was followed from the date of radiosurgery until one of the end points was reached or the last MRI follow-up. Various criteria were used to differentiate tumor progression and radiation necrosis, including the evaluation of serial MRIs, cerebral blood volume on perfusion MR, FDG-PET scans, and, in some cases, surgical pathology. The median radiographic follow-up per lesion was 6.2 months. RESULTS The median patient age was 56 years, and 56% of the patients were female. The most common primary pathology was non-small cell lung cancer (44%), followed by breast cancer (19%), renal cell carcinoma (14%), melanoma (11%), and small cell lung cancer (5%). The median tumor volume and median largest diameter were 0.16 cm3 and 0.8 cm, respectively. In total, 1018 lesions (34%) were larger than 1 cm in maximum diameter. The PD for 2410 tumors (80%) was 24 Gy, for 408 tumors (13%) it was 19 to 23 Gy, and for 216 tumors (7%) it was 15 to 18 Gy. In total, 87 patients (10%) had local progression of 104 tumors (3%), and 148 patients (17%) had at least radiographic evidence of radiation necrosis involving 199 tumors (7%; 4% were symptomatic). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed for local progression and radiation necrosis. For local progression, tumors less than 1 cm (subhazard ratio [SHR] 2.32; p < 0.001), PD of 24 Gy (SHR 1.84; p = 0.01), and additional whole-brain radiation therapy (SHR 2.53; p = 0.001) were independently associated with better outcome. For the development of radiographic radiation necrosis, independent prognostic factors included size greater than 1 cm (SHR 2.13; p < 0.001), location in the corpus callosum (SHR 5.72; p < 0.001), and uncommon pathologies (SHR 1.65; p = 0.05). Size (SHR 4.78; p < 0.001) and location (SHR 7.62; p < 0.001)-but not uncommon pathologies-were independent prognostic factors for the subgroup with symptomatic radiation necrosis. CONCLUSIONS A PD of 24 Gy results in significantly better local control of metastases measuring < 2 cm than lower doses. In addition, tumor size is an independent prognostic factor for both local progression and radiation necrosis. Some tumor pathologies and locations may also contribute to an increased risk of radiation necrosis.",Excluded
2856,"Radiotherapy in the treatment of solitary plasmacytoma Solitary plasmacytoma of bone (SPB) and extramedullary plasmacytoma (EMP) are rare. High local control rates are reported with radiotherapy, although the optimal dose and extent of radiotherapy portals remains controversial. Between 1983 and 1993, 30 patients with solitary plasmacytoma were seen at the Regional Cancer Centre, Trivandrum, India. 23 patients had SPB and seven EMP. The mean age was 52 years and the male to female ratio 3.2:1. Diagnosis of SPB was confirmed by biopsy in 16 patients and tumour excision in seven. 20 patients received megavoltage radiotherapy to the bone lesion with limited margins, and one received chemotherapy. Two patients who underwent complete tumour excision received no further treatment. All seven patients with EMP received megavoltage radiotherapy, four following biopsy and three after tumour excision. Local control was achieved in all patients with SPB. Nine progressed to multiple myeloma and one developed a solitary plasmacytoma in another bone. Six patients with EMP achieved local control. Three later progressed to multiple myeloma and one had local relapse. Median time to relapse was 28 months in SPB and 30 months in EMP. 5-year overall survival rates were 82% and 57% for patients with SPB and EMP, respectively. The corresponding progression free survival rates were 55% and 50%, respectively. Age, sex, site of tumour, serum M protein and haemoglobin levels did not significantly influence progression free survival. The extent of surgery, radiotherapy dose or time to relapse were not significant prognostic factors. Radiotherapy appears to be an effective modality of treatment of solitary plasmacytoma. No dose-response relationship is observed, and high local control rates are achieved with limited portals. Progression to multiple myeloma is the commonest pattern of failure, although no prognostic factors for progression are identified. The role of chemotherapy in preventing disease progression needs further evaluation.",Excluded
2701,"Complex total knee arthroplasty using resection prostheses at mid-term follow-up Complex primary or revision TKA may require the use of a resection type prosthesis to address major bone loss and soft tissue deficiencies. The aim of this retrospective study is to evaluate the clinical and radiographic outcomes of salvage knee reconstructions in a larger cohort and longer follow-up than previously reported. We therefore present the results of 66 cases treated with the Finn/OSS knee system with an average follow-up of 5. years (range 2-12). Indications included 63 revision cases and three primary interventions with either massive bone loss and/or soft tissue deficiency. At final follow-up the average knee society score had significantly improved from 46 preoperatively to 73, and the function score improved from 27 to 47 points. Four cases needed to be revised: one for recurrent infection, two for aseptic loosening and one for implant breakage. Nine patients underwent minor reinterventions; including five cases with irrigation and debridement for prolonged wound drainage, two patellar realignment procedures and two extensor mechanism repairs. Two patients developed a peroneal nerve palsy. Overall implant survivorship with revision as the endpoint was 92% at 5 and 10. years. We conclude that the use of a resection prosthesis in the complex primary and revision TKA leads to acceptable results, but the complication rate is relatively high. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
3125,"Identification of the most important features of knee osteoarthritis structural progressors using machine learning methods Objectives: The aim was to identify the most important features of structural knee osteoarthritis (OA) progressors and classification using machine learning methods. Method(s): Participants, features and outcomes were from the Osteoarthritis Initiative. Features were from baseline (1107), including articular knee tissues (135) assessed by quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). OA progressors were ascertained by four outcomes: cartilage volume loss in medial plateau at 48 and 96 months (Prop_CV_48M, 96M), Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade 2 and medial joint space narrowing (JSN) 1 at 48 months. Six feature selection models were used to identify the common features in each outcome. Six classification methods were applied to measure the accuracy of the selected features in classifying the subjects into progressors and non-progressors. Classification of the best features was done using an automatic machine learning interface and the area under the curve (AUC). To prioritize the top five features, sparse partial least square (sPLS) method was used. Result(s): For the classification of the best common features in each outcome, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) achieved the highest AUC in Prop_CV_96M, KL and JSN (0.80, 0.88, 0.95), and Gradient Boosting Machine for Prop_CV_48M (0.70). sPLS showed the baseline top five features to predict knee OA progressors are the joint space width, mean cartilage thickness of the medial tibial plateau and sub-regions and JSN. Conclusion(s): In this comprehensive study using a large number of features (n = 1107) and MRI outcomes in addition to radiological outcomes, we identified the best features and classification methods for knee OA structural progressors. Data revealed baseline X-ray and MRI-based features could predict early OA knee progressors and that MLP is the best classification method.Copyright © The Author(s), 2020.",Excluded
2665,"Interforaminal implant placement in oral cancer patients: during ablative surgery or delayed? A 5-year retrospective study In a retrospective study, two mandibular prosthetic rehabilitation strategies supported by implants in oral cancer patients were evaluated: implants placed in the non-resected edentulous symphyseal area during ablative surgery (DAS implants); or at a later stage (postponed (P) implants). Medical files of patients from two head-neck oncology groups from 2000 to 2005 were screened for study inclusion. DAS protocol was used in one group and P protocol in the other. After a 5 year follow-up of 261 edentulous patients with oral cancer in the second group, P implants were placed in 27 patients to support an overdenture. Of the 249 edentulous patients in the first group, 82 patients were given an implant supported overdenture using the DAS implant protocol. Regarding implant loss, no statistically significant differences were seen between the DAS and P implants. In the DAS group, more patients benefited from an implant-supported lower overdenture (39 versus 11%, respectively), and they received their overdenture on average 20.0 months sooner (sd=11.01, p<0.001) after ablative surgery. 17.1% of DAS implants and 4.6% of P implants were never loaded due to tumour and patient related factors including unfavourable implant soft tissue, tumour recurrence near the implant, or radiotherapy induced trismus.

The enrolled COVID-19 infected patients were from Wuhan Jin Yin-tan Hospital (17 cases, Wuhan, China), Suzhou Infectious Disease Hospital (87 cases, Suzhou, China), and Xuzhou Infectious Disease Hospital (14 cases, Xuzhou, China). After admission, basic information was collected; X-ray and chest CT images were obtained; and data from routine blood tests, liver and kidney function, myocardial enzymes, electrolytes, blood coagulation function, (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) ESR, C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, procalcitonin (PCT), calcitonin, and other laboratory tests were obtained. The patients were grouped according to the clinical classification method based on the pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan for new coronavirus infection (trial version 7) in China. The measurements from mild (56 cases) and severe cases (51 cases) were compared and analyzed. Most COVID-19 patients presented with fever. Chest X-ray and CT images showed multiple patchy and ground glass opacities in the lungs of COVID 19 infected patients, especially in patients with severe cases. Compared with patients with mild infection, patients with severe infection were older (p = 0.023) and had a significant increase in AST and BUN. The levels of CK, LDH, CK-MB, proBNP, and Myo in patients with severe COVID-19 infection were also increased significantly compared to those in patients with mild cases. Patients with severe COVID-19 infections presented coagulation dysfunction and increased D-dimer and fibrin degradation product (FDP) levels. Severe COVID-19 patients had low serum calcium ion (Ca2+) concentrations and high calcitonin and PCT levels and exhibited serious systemic inflammation. Ca2+ in COVID-19 patients was significantly negatively correlated with PCT, calcitonin, D-dimer, PFDP, ESR, CRP and IL-6. D-dimer in COVID-19 patients was a significantly positively correlated with CRP and IL-6. In conclusion, patients with severe COVID-19 infection presented significant metabolic dysfunction and abnormal blood coagulation, a sharp increase in inflammatory factors and calcitonin and procalcitonin levels, and a significant decrease in Ca2+. Decreased Ca2+ and coagulation dysfunction in COVID-19 patients were significantly correlated with each other and with inflammatory factors.© Copyright © 2021 Qi, Kong, Ding, Wu, Ji, Huang, Li, Wang, Wen, Wu, Wu, Huang, Li, Liu and Tang.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): Total of 60 patients underwent contrast-enhanced abdominal CT for preoperative assessment. Of all, 30 suspected to have lung cancer underwent ADCT using step-and-shoot scan protocol. The other 30 suspected to have renal cell carcinoma underwent 64-MDCT using helical scan protocol. Two experienced radiologists independently assessed inferior epigastric, hepatic subsegmental (in the segment 8), mesenteric marginal (Griffith point) and inferior phrenic arteries by using 5-point visual scoring systems. Kappa analysis was used for evaluation of interobserver agreement. To compare the visualization capability of the two systems, the Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare the scores for each of the arteries. Result(s): Overall interobserver agreements for both systems were almost perfect (kappa > 0.80). Visualization scores for inferior epigastric and mesenteric arteries were significantly higher for ADCT than for 64-detector row CT (p < 0.05). No significant difference was found for hepatic subsegmental and inferior phrenic arteries.

In this study, we assessed long-term outcomes after ORIF of intraarticular calcaneal fractures, as well as outcomes of salvage surgery performed for patients with poor outcomes. Method(s): The subjects were 11 patients who were treated with ORIF and followed up for at least 5 years after surgery and 56 patients with poor outcomes, after initial surgery performed at another hospital. Salvage procedures performed for these patients were the lift-up of joint surface (36 feet), arthrodesis (17 feet), and observation without intervention (3 feet). Clinical assessment was based on Maxfield's criteria, and imaging assessment was based on X-ray findings. The mean postoperative follow-up periods were 6. 4 years in ORIF group and 4. 2 years in the lift-up or arthrodesis group. Result(s): ORIF group were excellent for 4 feet, good: 6, fair: 0, poor:1, and osteoarthritic (OA) changes were observed in 2. Lift-up of joint group were excellent: 26, good:7, fair:3, poor:none, OA:3. Arthrodesis group were excellent:11, good:3, fair:3, poor:none. Conclusion(s): If ORIF under the satisfactory reduction is performed, long-term outcomes would be good or excellent without any OA changes. When outcomes of initial surgery are poor, they may complain of pain soon after the initial surgery and require additional salvage surgery within 3 years.

3445,"Sleep disturbances are related to decreased transmission of blue light to the retina caused by lens yellowing STUDY OBJECTIVES: Sleep pattern and circadian rhythms are regulated via the retinohypothalamic tract in response to stimulation of a subset of retinal ganglion cells, predominantly by blue light (450-490 nm). With age, the transmission of blue light to the retina is reduced because of the aging process of the human lens, and this may impair the photoentrainment of circadian rhythm leading to sleep disorders. The aim of the study was to examine the association between lens aging and sleep disorders., DESIGN: Cross-sectional population based study., SETTING: The study was performed at the Research Center for Prevention and Health, Glostrup Hospital, Denmark and at the Department of Ophthalmology, Herlev Hospital, Denmark., PARTICIPANTS: An age- and sex-stratified sample of 970 persons aged 30 to 60 years of age drawn from a sample randomly selected from the background population., INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable., MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Sleep disturbances were evaluated by a combination of questionnaire and the use of prescription sleeping medication. Lens aging (transmission and yellowing) was measured objectively by lens autofluorometry. The risk of sleep disturbances was significantly increased when the transmission of blue light to the retina was low, even after correction for the effect of age and other confounding factors such as smoking habits, diabetes mellitus, gender, and the risk of ischemic heart disease (P < 0.0001)., CONCLUSIONS: Filtration of blue light by the aging lens was significantly associated with an increased risk of sleep disturbances. We propose that this is a result of disturbance of photoentrainment of circadian rhythms.",Excluded
2530,"Effect of constraint loading on the lower limb muscle forces in weightless treadmill exercise Long exposure to the microgravity will lead to muscle atrophy and bone loss. Treadmill exercise could mitigate the musculoskeletal decline. But muscle atrophy remains inevitable. The constraint loading applied on astronauts could affect the muscle force and its atrophy severity. However, the quantitative correlation between constraint loading mode and muscle forces remains unclear. This study aimed to characterize the influence of constraint loading mode on the lower limb muscle forces in weightless treadmill exercise. The muscle forces in the full gait cycle were calculated with the inverse dynamic model of human musculoskeletal system. The calculated muscle forces at gravity were validated with the EMG data. Muscle forces increased at weightlessness compared with those at the earth's gravity. The increasing percentage from high to low is as follows: biceps femoris, gastrocnemius, soleus, vastus, and rectus femoris, which was in agreement with the muscle atrophy observed in astronauts. The constraint loading mode had an impact on the muscle forces in treadmill exercise and thus could be manipulated to enhance the effect of the muscle training in spaceflight. The findings could provide biomechanical basis for the optimization of treadmill constraint system and training program and improve the countermeasure efficiency in spaceflight.Copyright © 2018 Ning Guo et al.",Excluded
2617,"Evaluation of coronary artery image quality with knowledge-based iterative model reconstruction RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate knowledge-based iterative model reconstruction (IMR) to improve image quality and reduce radiation dose in coronary computed tomography angiography (cCTA)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 45 consecutive cCTA studies, including 25 studies performed with an 80% systolic dose reduction using tube current modulation (TCM). Each study was reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP), hybrid iterative reconstruction (iDose(4)), and IMR in a diastolic phase. Additional systolic phase reconstructions were obtained for TCM studies. Mean pixel attenuation value and standard deviation (SD) were measured in the left ventricle and left main coronary artery. Subjective scores were obtained by two independent reviewers on a 5-point scale for definitions of contours of small coronary arteries (<3 mm), coronary calcifications, noncalcified plaque, and overall diagnostic confidence for the presence/absence of stenosis., RESULTS: There was no significant difference in pixel intensity among FBP, iDose(4), and IMR (P > .8). For diastolic phase images, noise amplitude in the left main coronary artery was reduced by a factor of 1.3 from FBP to iDose(4) (SD = 99 vs. 74; P = .005) and by a factor of 2.6 from iDose(4) to IMR (SD = 74 vs. 28; P < .001). For systolic phase TCM images, noise amplitude in the left main coronary artery was reduced by a factor of 2.3 from FBP to iDose(4) (SD = 322 vs. 142; P < .001) and by a factor of 3.0 from iDose(4) to IMR (SD = 142 vs. 48; P < .001). All four subjective image quality scores were significantly better with IMR compared to iDose(4) and FBP (P < .001). The reduction in image noise amplitude and improvement in image quality scores were greatest among obese patients., CONCLUSIONS: IMR reduces intravascular noise on cCTA by 86%-88% compared to FBP, and improves image quality at radiation exposure levels 80% below our standard technique.

3698,"Comparative genomic hybridization analysis of radiation-associated and sporadic meningiomas Ionizing irradiation to the skull is a known risk factor for meningioma development. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms that underlie radiation-associated meningioma (RAM), we characterized the somatic genetic alterations in 16 RAMs by using comparative genomic hybridization and compared the pattern of alterations with 17 nonradiation-associated meningiomas (non-RAM). Most tumors (29/33;87.9%) displayed at least one DNA copy number alteration, and 11 out of 33 (33%) exhibited four or more changes. The mean number of DNA copy number changes was similar in RAMs (2.4+/-1.9) and in non-RAMs (2.5+/-1.9). The most common DNA losses were noted in chromosome 22 (56.2% in RAM, and 47% in non-RAM) and chromosome 1 (37.5% in RAM and 35.3% in non-RAM), with no significant differences between the two groups. Noteworthy, gain in DNA copy number of chromosomes 8 and 12 was detected in two RAM tumors only. In conclusion, no significant differences were noted between RAMs and non-RAMs regarding the number of genetic changes and the extent and frequency of chromosomes 1 and 22 losses. These preliminary data suggest that the tumorogenic pathways of meningioma formation are similar, regardless of previous skull irradiation.",Included

The relation of the achieved thyroid dose to the success rate of treatment and to the incidence of hypothyroidism was analysed. Results The cure rates were 85% at 3 months, 98% at 1 year and 98% at the end of follow-up. Above an achieved thyroid dose of more than 120 Gy, there was no significant association between the dose achieved in the thyroid and the cure rate on follow-up. The incidences of hypothyroidism at 3 months, at 1 year and at the end of follow-up were 32%, 55% and 73%, respectively. Conclusions Radioiodine treatment with a calculated dose regimen is a highly effective treatment option in patients with toxic goitre with an overall success rate of 98%. However, radioiodine treatment with an intended thyroid dose of 150 Gy leads to a high incidence of hypothyroidism on long-term follow-up. This finding supports the suggestion that in future intended thyroid doses could be lowered in patients treated with a calculated dose regimen for toxic nodular goitre. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Excluded
3564,"Evaluation of the dedicated Frontier coronary bifurcation stent: A matched pair analysis with drug-eluting and bare metal stents Treatment of coronary bifurcation lesions (CBL) remains challenging. This study sought to evaluate a novel dedicated stent system (Frontier stent) by angiographic and clinical comparison with the provisional T-stenting technique using drug-eluting (DES) and bare metal stents (BMS). The study group comprised 105 CBL in 105 patients. 35 consecutive CBL were treated with the Frontier system. The control group of 70 CBL (35 DES, 35 BMS) was pair matched with the former group stratified by the type of CBL (Medina classification) and the reference diameter of the main branch (MB). Clinical, procedural, and quantitative angiographic data (QCA) were obtained in all patients. A follow-up angiography 6 +/- 2-month post-index intervention was performed in 84/105 (80%) patients, clinical 6-month follow-up was available in all patients (100%). All Frontier stent procedures were clinically and angiographically successful. Post-procedural QCA analysis of the MB and the side branches revealed comparable minimal lumen diameters (MLDs) between groups. Moreover, contrast use and radiation exposure were not different between groups. DES use, however, was associated with a significantly lower late lumen (LL) loss in the main and the side branch as compared to the Frontier stent and BMS group. Likewise, MACE rates were lowest in the DES group (6%, P < 0.05 vs. BMS) as compared to the Frontier stent (9%) and the BMS group (16%). The Frontier stent accomplishes treatment of CBL with excellent acute clinical, procedural, and angiographic results. Provisional T-stenting using DES provides superior clinical and angiographic long-term results as compared to BMS and Frontier stents. The results of next generation CBL systems combining a dedicated specific CBL design with DES surfaces are to be awaited.",Excluded
3464,"[Influence of the dose rate and postradiation hyperthermia on the cytogenetic effect of irradiation of cells in the G0 stage by 252Cf and 60Co sources] The paper is concerned with the results of a comparative study of radiation injury of chromosomes of human lymphocytes at the G0 stage resulting from the influence of 60Co gamma quanta and high activity 252Cf radiation sources and depending on a dose and dose rate; with the potentialities of modifying a cytogenetic effect of irradiation by postradiation hyperthermia of cells. It has been shown that at the G0 stage of a cell cycle the frequency of chromosome aberrations does not depend on the dose rate of 252Cf radiation within the range of 0.0035-0.35 Gy/min. by the neutron component. Linear correlation between the frequency of induced chromosome aberrations and a dose was observed within a dose range of 0.27-3.1 Gy. Thus, a conclusion is that postradiation hyperthermia at the G0 stage does not almost influence the frequency of chromosome aberrations during 252Cf radiation, and increases it insignificantly during 60Co gamma-radiation.",Included

3031,"The benefits and pitfalls of ipsilateral radiotherapy in carcinoma of the tonsillar region PURPOSE: Ipsilateral techniques designed to restrict treatment to the primary tumor and neck on the same side have been used in selected cases of cases of carcinoma of the tonsillar region at our institution for many years. The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the risk of failure in the opposite neck in cases selected for unilateral radiotherapy over a 21-year period., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Ipsilateral radiotherapy techniques were used in 228 of 642 patients with carcinoma of the tonsillar region from 1970 to 1991. Local control, regional lymph-node control (including contralateral failure), and survival were calculated for different degrees of tumor extent treated with these techniques., RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 7 years. Cases tended to be T1 and T2, with N0 disease. The 3-year actuarial local control rate was 77% and cause-specific survival was 76%. Opposite neck failure was seen in 8 patients (crude rate of 3.5%). In the earlier period of the study, primary coverage was problematic in a proportion of cases and resulted in higher rates of local failure., CONCLUSION: Appropriately selected cases of carcinoma of the tonsil show minimal risk of failure in the opposite neck with ipsilateral techniques. Patients should undergo computed tomography planning to ensure adequate target coverage.",Excluded
3259,"A minimally invasive assay for individual assessment of the ATM/CHEK2/p53 pathway activity Ionizing radiation induces DNA Double-Strand Breaks (DSBs) which activate the ATM/CHEK2/p53 pathway leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through transcription of genes including CDKN1A (p21) and BBC3 (PUMA). This pathway prevents genomic instability and tumorigenesis as demonstrated in heritable syndromes (e.g., Ataxia Telangiectasia (AT); Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS)). Here, a simple assay based on gene expression in peripheral blood to measure accurately ATM/CHEK2/p53 pathway activity is described. The expression of p21, Puma and Sesn2 was determined in blood from mice with different gene copy numbers of Atm, Trp53 (p53), Chek2 or Arf and in human blood and mitogen stimulated T-lymphocyte (MSTL) cultures from AT, AT carriers, LFS patients and controls, both before and after ex vivo ionizing irradiation. Mouse Atm/Chek2/p53 activity was highly dependent on the copy number of each gene except Arf. In human MSTL, an AT case, AT carriers and LFS patients showed responses distinct from healthy donors. The relationship between gene copy number and transcriptional induction upon radiation was linear for p21 and Puma and correlated well with cancer incidence in p53 variant mice. This reliable blood test provides an assay to determine ATM/CHEK2/p53 pathway activity and demonstrates the feasibility of assessing the activity of this essential cancer protection pathway in simple assays. These findings may have implications for the individualized prediction of cancer susceptibility. © 2011 Landes Bioscience.",Excluded
3550,"Multilocus inheritance determines predisposition to alpha-radiation induced bone tumourigenesis in mice In a recent study, we presented evidence for genetic predisposition governing radiation osteosarcomagenesis in mice. Following the incorporation of the bone-seeking alpha emitter 227Th, ~25% of the variance in osteosarcoma incidence was determined by inherited genetic factors. We have now mapped 5 susceptibility loci in crosses between the more susceptible BALB/c and the more resistant CBA/Ca strains. The major QTL on chromosome 14 overlaps with a locus that was already found in our previous study, using different strains of mice. Here, we investigate the effect by which the major susceptibility locus and 4 minor modifier loci interact to influence osteosarcoma predisposition. Following incorporation of the bone-seeking isotope, 100% of mice that harbour high-risk genotypes at all 5 susceptibility loci develop osteosarcoma with an average of 472 days latency times. In 10 mice inheriting exclusively low-risk genotypes only 1 osteosarcoma was found, arising after 733 days latency time. Inheritance of distinct combinations of BALB/c and CBA/Ca alleles at the susceptibility loci confer more extreme phenotypes in terms of susceptibility or resistance than observed in either of the two parental inbred strains. From the present study, we demonstrate that additive effects of multiple alleles, each making only a minor phenotypic contribution, can combine and significantly alter tumour risk. This mechanism can be of particular importance in genetically heterogeneous populations such as man. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Included

The mean diameter of lesions was 4.4 +/- 1.8 cm (range 1.8-9.0 cm). The needle path was carefully planned and calculated on the CBCT virtual navigation guidance system, which acquired 3D CT-like cross-sectional images. Diagnostic performance, procedure details, complication rate, and patient radiation exposure were investigated., RESULTS: The technical success rate of PNB under CBCT virtual navigation system was 100 % (100/100). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of PNB of small nodules under iGuide CBCT virtual navigation guidance were 95.1 % (79/83), 100 % (12/12), and 95.7 % (91/95), respectively.

A retrospective review of medical records and magnetic resonance imaging for NPC patients across a 5-year follow-up was conducted. Rhinosinusitis was diagnosed and staged by Lund-Mackay system. A total of 102 patients were enrolled in the study. On the 5th year following IMRT, 8 patients (7.8 %), 30 patients (29.4 %), and 17 patients (16.7 %) suffered from IMRT-induced CSOM, post-irradiation OME, and CRS, respectively. Analysis by logistic regression showed a lack of association between the occurrence of post-irradiation OME and CRS (P = 0.06). These observations indicated that the modern radiotherapy technique exhibits capability in decreasing the incidences of CSOM and CRS comparing to the data of traditional radiotherapy. But post-irradiation OME was still encountered in more than one-quarter of long-term survivors of NPC. Of note, rhinosinusitis in NPC survivors does not predispose to the development of post-irradiation OME, suggesting nasal irrigation might be unnecessary for the management of OME following radiotherapy.",Excluded
2826,"Irradiation of adult human dental pulp stem cells provokes activation of p53, cell cycle arrest, and senescence but not apoptosis Adult human dental pulp contains stem cells (DPSCs) that are capable of differentiation into osteoblasts, odontoblasts, adipocytes, and neuronal-like cells. Because these cells have potential use in tissue regeneration, herein we characterized the response of DPSC lines to ionizing radiation (IR). These DPSC lines have been developed from the extracted molars of healthy donors. DPSCs were cultivated in a unique media supplemented with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Since tissue homeostasis depends on a precise balance among cell proliferation, senescence, and cell death, we explored the effects of IR (2-20 Gy) on the proliferative activity of DPSCs and the molecular pathways involved. Even the highest dose used (20 Gy) did not induce DPSC apoptosis. After irradiation with doses of 6 and 20 Gy, DPSCs accumulated in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. DPSCs responded to IR (20 Gy) with senescence detected as SA-beta-galactosidase positivity, beginning on the third day after irradiation. Twenty-four hours after irradiation, p53 and its serine 15 and 392 phosphorylated forms were detected. At this time, p21 (WAF1) was induced. Increases in protein p16 were observed from the third day following irradiation and continued till the end of the examination (Day 13). We conclude that DPSCs respond to IR-induced damage by permanent cell cycle arrest in the G2 phase and by stress-induced premature senescence. © 2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Included

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 223 patients with T1b to T3a prostate cancer and a median (range) age of 66 (50-82) years were treated with permanent seed implantation from November 1990 to March 1998. They were followed for a median (range) of 8.2 (7-14.1) years using prospective quality-of-life measures. Erectile function (EF) was assessed using a physician-assigned score and beginning in June 2000; the validated International Index of EF (IIEF-5) was used as a complementary method to quantify late EF. No adjustment was made to differentiate sexual function with or with no pharmacological intervention for EF. Pearson's chi-square test and Student's t-test were used to compare the groups. RESULT(S): Of the 223 men, 131 (59%) had optimal EF before their brachytherapy; of these, 51 (40%) at the last follow-up evaluation were using either a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (44, 86%), yohimbine (two, 4%) or alprostadil (five, 10%). The age at implantation was highly predictive of current EF; 23 of 25 (92%) men aged 50-59 years had a current EF of >=2; those aged 60-69 and 70-78 years had an EF of >=2 in 48/75 (64%) and 18/31 (58%) (P = 0.01). A current IIEF-5 score of >=16 also correlated highly with age at implant, i.e. 50-59, 16/25 (64%); 60-69, 20/75 (27%) and 70-78 years, 6/31 (19%) (P < 0.001).

3501,"[Optimizing dosage in thoracic computerized tomography] Radiation exposure in computed tomography (CT) by far exceeds radiation dose in chest radiography. Dose requirements in CT of the chest, however, are much smaller than for the abdomen because of low x-ray absorption in the lungs. This article describes scanner parameters that influence patient exposure and image quality. Suitable compromises will be explained that allow for dose reduction in chest CT without jeopardising image quality. Dose reduction in chest CT should be performed depending on the clinical indication and requires active reduction of mAs settings. For helical CT, a pitch of 1.5 to 2 should be employed. Dedicated low-dose techniques for screening of bronchogenic carcinoma are described. Dose reduction decreases image quality but the detrimental effects can be reduced by applying proper parameters for scanning and image reconstruction. Thus, images of the mediastinum should be reconstructed with a smoothing filter, while a higher resolution filter should be used for the lungs. In multislice CT, reconstruction of thicker axial or multiplanar sections retains spatial resolution but keeps image noise and thus dose requirements low. The effective, weighted CT dose index (CTDIw,eff) can serve as a rough estimate of the effective patient dose (E) in helical or multislice CT of the whole chest: for most scanners and age groups the conversion factors are 0.5 mSv/mGy for females and 0.4 mSv/mGy for males.",Excluded

We hypothesized that the isotropic 0.5-mm CAC reconstruction outperforms the conventional 3.0-mm reconstruction in detecting and quantifying coronary calcium, and we proposed to compare them by validating against spatially registered intravascular ultrasound with radiofrequency backscatter-virtual histology (IVUS-VH)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven patients were enrolled, and 5976 mm of coronary arteries were analyzed. A semiautomatic software was developed to coregister CAC and IVUS-VH on a detailed slice-by-slice basis. Calcium detection and calcium volume quantification were evaluated and compared using varying calcium attenuation thresholds. Algorithms for deriving individualized optimal threshold and comparable Agatston score on the 0.5-mm reconstruction were developed., RESULTS: The isotropic 0.5-mm reconstruction achieved significantly higher area under receiver-operating curve than the conventional 3.0-mm reconstruction (0.9 vs. 0.74, P < .001). Using the optimal threshold, the 0.5-mm reconstruction had higher sensitivity (0.79 vs. 0.65), specificity (0.85 vs. 0.77), positive predictive value (0.42 vs. 0.29), and negative predictive value (0.97 vs. 0.94) than the 3.0 mm. Individualized optimal threshold was significantly correlated with the image noise (r = 0.66, P < .001) in the 0.5-mm reconstruction., CONCLUSIONS: By optimizing the calcium threshold, the 0.5-mm reconstruction is superior to the conventional 3.0-mm in detecting and quantifying calcium, which may improve the clinical value of CAC without additional radiation.

3644,"Iterative image reconstruction techniques: Applications for cardiac CT Traditional limitations of cardiac CT are related to image noise, blooming artifacts from calcifications and stents, and radiation exposure. We evaluated whether these limitations can be ameliorated by the use of iterative reconstruction in image space (IRIS) instead of traditional filtered back projection (FBP) image reconstruction techniques. We compared image reconstruction with the use of IRIS with traditional FBP for their effect on image quality, noise, volume of heavy coronary artery calcifications, and stents as a measure of ""blooming"" artifacts, and radiation dose at cardiac CT. The radiation dose comparison was performed as a matched pair analysis, whereas all other comparisons were performed within the same group of patients. The subjective image quality of IRIS reconstructions was rated higher than FBP reconstructions. Image noise was lower with IRIS than with FBP. The volume of stents and heavy coronary artery calcifications measured lower in IRIS reconstructed series compared with FBP. Similar levels of image noise were achieved with 80/100 kVp of tube voltage with IRIS compared with 120 kVp and FBP, resulting in a 62% reduction in effective dose. Our preliminary experiences suggest that IRIS incrementally improves the CT evaluation of coronary arteries, especially in challenging scenarios. Substantial radiation reduction seems feasible without associated increases in image noise. Copyright © 2011 Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography. Published by Elsevier Inc.

2960,"Three-dimensional analysis of recurrence patterns in rectal cancer: The cranial border in hypofractionated preoperative radiotherapy can be lowered Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine whether and where the radiotherapy (RT) clinical target volume (CTV) could be reduced in short-course preoperative treatment of rectal cancer patients. Methods and Materials: Patients treated in the Dutch total mesorectal excision trial, with a local recurrence were analyzed. For 94 (25 who underwent radiation therapy 69 who did not) of 114 patients with a local recurrence, the location of the recurrence was placed in a three-dimensionalthree (3D) model. The data in the 3D model were correlated to the clinical trial data to distinguish a group of patients eligible for CTV reduction. Effects of CTV reduction on dose to the small bowel was tested retrospectively in a dataset of 8 patients with three-field conformal plans and intensity-modulated RT (IMRT). Result(s): The use of preoperative RT mainly reduces anastomotic, lateral, and perineal recurrences. In patients without primary nodal involvement, no recurrences were found cranially of the S2-S3 interspace, irrespective of the delivery of RT. In patients without primary nodal involvement and a negative circumferential resection margin (CRM), only one recurrence was found cranial to the S2-S3 interspace. With a cranially reduced CTV to the S2-S3 interspace, over 60% reduction in absolute small bowel exposure at dose levels from 15 to 35 Gy could be achieved with three-field conventional RT, increasing to 80% when IMRT is also added. Conclusion(s): The cranial border of the CTV can safely be lowered for patients without expected nodal or CRM involvement, yielding a significant reduction of dose to the small bowel. Therefore, a significant reduction of acute and late toxicity can be expected. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

We retrospectively evaluated the outcome of 103 (female: 39, male: 64) pts, who underwent 1st ASCT for HL from September 1990 to November 2008 and relapsed or progressed. Sixty-four pts had been transplanted for refractory disease. The median time to relapse/progression was 5 (0.7-132) months post ASCT, and < 12 months in 77/103 pts. The median age at relapse was 29 (13-67) years. The stage at relapse was advanced (III or IV) in 58, and B-symptoms were present in 26 pts. In 41 pts, progression of disease to additional sites was noted. Salvage treatment was chemotherapy +/- irradiation (R/T) in 75 pts, R/T only in 6, 2nd SCT in 14 (ASCT in 3, and alloSCT with a reduced-intensity regimen in 11), while 2 refused any therapy. Six pts had a positive PET-scan without clinical suggestion of active disease, and did not receive any treatment (watch-and-wait approach). Sixty of the 95 treated pts achieved a complete (38 pts, 40%) or partial (22 pts, 24%) remission. The interval of < 12 months from 1st ASCT to relapse, advanced stage and presence of B-symptoms at relapse, as well as the disease refractoriness before 1st ASCT emerged as significant adverse factors for response rate (P < 0,05 by t-test). The median survival for all pts was 29.5 months. Multivariate analysis revealed late relapse (> 12 months), absence of B-symptoms at relapse and disease sensitivity before 1st ASCT as significant factors for prolonged survival (P < 0.05). The type of treatment had no impact on survival rates. Three of the 14 re-transplanted pts (2 allo- and 1 autografted) are alive (with 2 in CR for 7 and 5 years, respectively). Eight re-transplanted pts succumbed to progressive disease and 3 to treatment related toxicity. Interestingly, all 6 patients managed with the watch-and-wait approach are alive without disease progression for a median of 12 (1.5-45) months. Our results confirm that selected pts with relapsed or progressed HL following ASCT could be rescued with recent treatment modalities. Currently, given the conventional and alternative treatment options, management of relapsed disease post 1st ASCT remains a challenge and prospective studies with large series of pts are needed to establish the appropriate approach.",Excluded

The purpose of this study was to report on patterns of palliative RT of bone metastasis in a severely low-capacity setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patient and treatment characteristics of patients irradiated for palliation of symptomatic bone metastasis were extracted from a retrospective database of patients treated between May 2015 and January 2018. This database included a random sample of 1,823 of the estimated 4,000 patients who were treated with RT within in the study period. Associations between the applied RT schedule and patient and tumor characteristics were evaluated with the chi2 test. Hypothetical savings of RT sessions and time were compared in the case of a single-fraction policy. RESULTS From the database, 234 patients (13%) were treated for bone metastasis. Most patients were <= 65 years of age (n = 189; 80%) and female (n = 125; 53%). The most common primary sites were breast (n = 82; 35%) and prostate (n = 36; 15%). Fractionated regimens were preferred over single fraction: 20 Gy in 5 fractions (n = 192; 82.1%), 30 Gy in 10 fractions (n = 7; 3%), and 8 Gy in 1 fraction (n = 28; 12%). Factors associated with single-fraction RT included nonaxial sites of bone metastasis (P, .01) and an address outside Addis Ababa (P <= .01). If single-fraction RT would have been given uniformly for bone metastasis, this would have resulted in a 78% reduction in the number of RT sessions and 76% reduction in total RT time. CONCLUSION The pattern of palliative RT for bone metastasis in Ethiopia favors fractionated regimens over single fraction. Efforts should be made to adopt evidence-based and cost-effective guidelines.Copyright © 2020 by American Society of Clinical Oncology",Excluded

This study assessed the utility of dual-energy pulmonary CT angiography (CTA) for noninvasive assessment of regional pulmonary perfusion in patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). Regional perfusion abnormalities were correlated with hemodynamic parameters and structural abnormalities on pulmonary CTA. SUBJECTS and methods. Twenty patients with CTEPH (11 men and nine women; mean age, 61.5 years) underwent pulmonary CTA with a dual-energy technique. Right heart catheterization data were available in 15 cases. Scan parameters were as follows: tube A, 140 kV (75 mA); tube B, 80 kV (300 mA); gantry rotation, 500 milliseconds; pitch, 0.5; and collimation, 14 x 1.2 mm. An iodine map was generated via three-material- decomposition and was scored for extent of hypoperfusion. Correlation was made with mosaic attenuation pattern, extent of vascular obstruction, and right heart hemodynamics. Iodine attenuation values were analyzed within completely occluded, partially occluded, and disease-free lobes. Results . A strong correlation existed between dual-energy CT-derived perfusion and mosaic attenuation pattern when both lobar (r > 0.6; n = 20; p < 0.006) and whole-lung scores were assessed (r = 0.77; n = 20; p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant correlation between dual-energy CT perfusion and vascular obstructive index, mean pulmonary artery pressure, or pulmonary vascular resistance (p > 0.08). Of 42 completely occluded lobes, 27 (64%) had demonstrable residual perfusion (mismatching), suggesting that blood supply was maintained via systemic collaterals. Conclusion. Dual-energy CT can offer a ""one-stop"" assessment of anatomy and perfusion in CTEPH. The additional information provided by dual-energy CT could have a future role in helping guide patient selection for thromboendarterectomy surgery. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded

Background: Previous research employing global positioning satellite (GPS) data and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) has shown a smaller life-space (distance traveled from home) was associated with poorer community functioning and more severe negative symptoms in people with schizophrenia. Momentary emotional experiences may influence how much time is spent outside of the home. We evaluated the associations between emotional experiences in relation to life-space among people with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls (HCs). Method(s): 105 participants with schizophrenia and 76 HCs completed in-lab assessments of symptoms, cognition, and functioning. Participants completed EMA assessments of location and emotions seven times daily for seven days at stratified random intervals. GPS coordinates were collected 24 h a day over the 7-day study period. Analyses were performed at the momentary, day, and full week level using mixed effects models and Spearman correlations. Result(s): For HCs, greater happiness was associated with greater concurrent distance traveled away from home as measured by GPS. For participants with schizophrenia, greater anxiety was associated with greater distance traveled away from home and being outside of the home. Less happiness, but not anxiety, was also associated with greater negative symptoms, especially outside the home. Discussion(s): These findings suggest diminished positive emotion is associated with the experience of leaving the home in schizophrenia, but also suggest that anxiety may contribute to avoidance of out of home mobility. Interventions targeting both positive emotions and social anxiety may improve social functioning, and life-space may provide a useful outcome for functional rehabilitation interventions in schizophrenia.Copyright © 2020",Excluded
2801,"[Reliability of the diagnostic results obtained with confined quantities of the contrast medium in endolymphatic radionuclide therapy (ELRT) of the inferior limbs (author's transl)] Endolymphatic radionuclide therapy (ELRT) produces not only a radiotherapeutic effect on the lymph nodes but makes possible also to judge of the lymph nodes being stained with labelled lipiodol UF. With the purpose of avoiding an eventual radiation exposure of the lung, or at least of confining it to a minimum, only limited quantities not exceeding 3.5 ml (5 mCi of 32P; 0.5 mCi of 131I) of the oily contrast medium for unilateral, or twice 3.5 ml (together 4 mCi of 32P; 0.5 mCi of 131I) for bilateral application. A retrospective analysis of 245 patients of the study group for endolymphatic radionuclide therapy, who suffered from malignant melanomas of the inferior limbs, revealed 77.5% of correct diagnoses. Most of the false-positive findings (44/70) seem to be due to the knowledge of the primary disease, as 77% of these cases had been described as ""suspicious"". False-negative findings turned out in 5% only. The findings which had been characterized as ""surely positive"" proved reliable in 90%. The good results of lymphography with smaller quantities of the contrast medium are, on the whole, comparable to those of primary diagnostic lymphography.",Excluded
2971,"Holistic peripheral processing of a polygon display Polygon displays compress information that would otherwise be conveyed by separate indicators into a single display in which each reading is represented by the distance of a polygon vertex from its center. The effect on detection of fault states of varying the number of polygon vertices from 4 to 20 in a display presented peripherally around a dynamic, simulated flight display was studied. Presence of the dynamic task reduced both speed and accuracy of response to the polygon display but did not significantly affect the pattern of response to differing numbers of vertices. All measures of performance were better with larger numbers of vertices. If the vertices are processed serially, more vertices require more processing time. Therefore, the result argues for holistic processing and implies that such information integration is beneficial to human performance in fault detection.",Excluded

2732,"Precise determination of the erythema response of human skin to ultraviolet radiation and quantification of effects of protectors BACKGROUND: We describe highly reproducible methods for quantifying the erythema response of precisely selected areas (spots) of human skin to graded doses of ultraviolet radiation (UVR). These methods have permitted evaluation of the efficacy of protectors, such as sulforaphane from crucifers, that defend cells through induction of cytoprotective (phase 2) genes., METHODS: Spots on the back were precisely located by opaque, adhesive, vinyl templates provided with 16 circular, 2.0 cm diameter occludable windows. Doses (100-800 mJ/cm(2)) of narrow-band (311 nm) UVR were administered, and the erythema index (a(*)) was measured with a chromometer on treated and control areas, before and after radiation., RESULTS: Daily variations in basal a(*) values of each spot were much smaller than the differences of a(*) values among spots of one individual, or those of corresponding spots among different individuals. The increments in erythema responses to UVR (Delta a(*)) were similar despite large variations of basal a(*) of spots. The most appropriate measure of UVR-evoked erythema is therefore the Delta a(*) value for each spot, which is an independent observational entity. Delta a(*) was proportional to UVR dose, and independent of spot location. To evaluate effectiveness of protectors against UVR damage we paired horizontally adjacent spots for treatment and controls. Vertical or random spot pairing did not provide significantly higher consistency. Protective efficacy against UVR erythema is appropriately expressed as percent reduction in Delta a(*) values upon treatment with inducers., CONCLUSIONS: The protection of skin against UVR damage can be quantified precisely from changes in erythema index (Delta a(*)) obtained with a chromometer.",Excluded
2561,"The effect of caffeine on repair systems in oocytes of Drosophila melanogaster. II. The induction of chromosome aberrations in irradiated males Irradiated males were mated to females that had received treatment with caffeine or honey (by feeding), and the frequencies of sex chromosome losses and chromosome rearrangements induced in mature spermatozoa of the males were compared. Caffeine treatment led to an enhancement of the frequencies of sex chromosome loss and a decrease in those of rearrangements. These findings can be interpreted on the assumption that caffeine inhibits repair and misrepair processes that are active in the oocytes. Caffeine treatment administered to one of the female stocks used in these studies was without any effect, presumably because of the absence of a caffeine sensitive repair mechanism in the oocytes.",Excluded
2791,"Residual tumor after neoadjuvant chemoradiation outside the radiation therapy target volume: A new prognostic factor for survival in esophageal cancer Purpose/Objective(s) The aim of this study was to analyze the accuracy of gross tumor volume (GTV) delineation and clinical target volume (CTV) margins for neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (neo-CRT) in esophageal carcinoma at pathologic examination and to determine the impact on survival. Methods and Materials The study population consisted of 63 esophageal cancer patients treated with neo-CRT. GTV and CTV borders were demarcated in situ during surgery on the esophagus, using anatomical reference points to provide accurate information regarding tumor location at pathologic evaluation. To identify prognostic factors for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), a Cox regression analysis was performed. Results After resection, macroscopic residual tumor was found outside the GTV in 7 patients (11%). Microscopic residual tumor was located outside the CTV in 9 patients (14%). The median follow-up was 15.6 months. With multivariate analysis, only microscopic tumor outside the CTV (hazard ratio [HR], 4.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-15.36), and perineural growth (HR, 5.77; 95% CI, 1.27-26.13) were identified as independent prognostic factors for OS. The 1-year OS was 20% for patients with tumor outside the CTV and 86% for those without (P<.01). For DFS, microscopic tumor outside the CTV (HR, 5.92; 95% CI, 1.89-18.54) and ypN+ (HR, 3.36; 95% CI, 1.33-8.48) were identified as independent adverse prognostic factors. The 1-year DFS was 23% versus 77% for patients with or without tumor outside the CTV (P<.01). Conclusions Microscopic tumor outside the CTV is associated with markedly worse OS after neo-CRT. This may either stress the importance of accurate tumor delineation or reflect aggressive tumor behavior requiring new adjuvant treatment modalities. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

3332,"Comparison of low-dose and standard-dose helical CT in the evaluation of pulmonary nodules The purpose of this study was to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of low-dose helical computed tomography by comparing the number of nodules detected at low- and standard-dose CT. The prospective study included 25 patients who were referred to CT scan for the assessment of pulmonary metastases. All patients underwent CT examinations at both standard- (200 mA, 120 kV, collimation 5 mm, table feed 10 mm per rotation) and low-dose (50 mA, 120 kV, collimation 5 mm, table feed 10 mm per rotation). The number of nodules detected at each protocol was recorded. The size of the nodules was measured electronically and categorized as <3, 3-4.9, 5-6.9, 7-9.9, and >/=10 mm. Finally, the nodules detected at only standard- or low-dose CT were assessed for the underlying causes of discrepancy. In 25 patients, 533 nodules were detected at standard-dose, whereas 518 nodules were observed at low-dose CT. There were no statistically significant differences in the number of nodules detected at standard- or low-dose CT ( p>0.05). Four hundred ninety-one (87.7%) nodules were detected at both standard- or low-dose CT, 42 (7.5%) nodules were observed only at standard-dose CT, and 27 (4.8%) nodules were seen only at low-dose CT. The sensitivity of low-dose CT was 92.5% for all nodules, 88.1% for nodules <5 mm, and 97.4% for nodules >/=5 mm. No significant image artifact interfering with nodule detection was observed at low-dose CT. The low-dose CT protocol used in this study provided images of adequate quality; thus, it can be used reliably in the detection or exclusion of pulmonary nodules.",Excluded

The procedures were undertaken with the Siemens and General Electric X-ray equipment. A dose area product (DAP) meter was also used. The DAP values and fluoroscopy tmes were recorded for each patent. Result(s): The mean DAP values and patent effectve doses were 19.53 Gy.cm2and 1.71 mSv for CA, 49.74 Gy.cm2 and 4.57 mSv for PTCA, 153.34 Gy.cm2and 16.38 mSv for ablatons and 14.88 Gy.cm2and 1.65 mSv for electrophysiology, respectvely. The patent radiaton risk was estmated at 13, 1.3, 1.3, 3.6 fatal cancer per 10000 procedures of ablatons, electrophysiology, CA and PTCA cases, respectvely. Conclusion(s): Results showed that the radiaton risk due to RF cardiac ablaton is higher than the other complicaton procedures so, efforts should be made to minimize patent radiaton risk from RF ablaton procedures.

2546,"Detection of pulmonary embolism with combined ventilation-perfusion SPECT and low-dose CT: head-to-head comparison with multidetector CT angiography UNLABELLED: The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) is usually established by a combination of clinical assessment, D-dimer testing, and imaging with either pulmonary ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scintigraphy or pulmonary multidetector CT (MDCT) angiography. Both V/Q SPECT and MDCT angiography seem to have high diagnostic accuracy. However, only limited data directly comparing these 2 modalities are available. Hybrid gamma-camera/MDCT systems have been introduced and allow simultaneous 3-dimensional lung V/Q SPECT and MDCT angiography, suitable for diagnosing PE. The aim of our study was to compare, in a prospective design, the diagnostic ability of V/Q SPECT, V/Q SPECT combined with low-dose CT, and pulmonary MDCT angiography obtained simultaneously using a combined SPECT/MDCT scanner in patients suspected of having PE., METHODS: Consecutive patients from June 2006 to February 2008 suspected of having acute PE were referred to the Department of Nuclear Medicine at Rigshospitalet or Frederiksberg Hospital, Denmark, for V/Q SPECT as a first-line imaging procedure. The number of eligible patients was 196. Patients with positive D-dimer results (>0.5 mmol/mL) or a clinical assessment with a Wells score greater than 2 were included and underwent V/Q SPECT, low-dose CT, and pulmonary MDCT angiography in a single session. Patient follow-up was 6 mo., RESULTS: A total of 81 simultaneous studies were available for analysis, of which 38% were from patients with PE. V/Q SPECT had a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 88%. When low-dose CT was added, the sensitivity was still 97% and the specificity increased to 100%. Perfusion SPECT with low-dose CT had a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 51%. MDCT angiography alone had a sensitivity of 68% and a specificity of 100%., CONCLUSION: We conclude that V/Q SPECT in combination with low-dose CT without contrast enhancement has an excellent diagnostic performance and should therefore probably be considered first-line imaging in the work-up of PE in most cases.",Excluded
2485,"Real-time cerebral angiography: Sensitivity of a new contrast-specific ultrasound technique BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To test a new contrast-specific sonography imaging method that offers visualization of the intracranial vasculature in a manner similar to that seen on angiography. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients (35 sonography studies total) were included in the study after they provided written informed consent. The patients were scanned through the temporal bone window from both sides after intravenous injection of an ultrasound contrast agent (UCA; perflexane lipid microspheres [Imagent]). The goal was to visualize the intracranial arteries, including the middle (M1-M3), anterior (A1 and A2), and posterior (P1-P3) cerebral arteries, using an axial scanning plane. The studies were performed using a contrast-specific imaging mode, based on a phase inversion technique (transcranial ultrasound angiography [tUSA]). For sensitivity, the results were compared with x-ray angiography as the ""gold standard."" For interobserver reliability, 24 of 35 sonography studies were evaluated by 2 physicians with little training in transcranial sonography and by a seasoned sonographer. RESULT(S): The sensitivity of tUSA ranged between 0.778 (95% confidence interval [CI] of 0.577-0.914) and 0.963 (95% CI of 0.810-0.999). The sensitivities were similar among physicians with little training in transcranial sonography and the seasoned sonographer, indicating high inter-rater reliability. Overall, tUSA provided high anatomic resolution and vascular delineation even of small vessels in the millimeter range. At peak intensity, no UCA-related artifacts were observed. CONCLUSION(S): tUSA provides images of the intracranial arteries similar to those obtained at angiography with high anatomic resolution, reasonable sensitivity, and interobserver reliability.",Excluded

2584,"Mycoplasma pneumoniae may cause dyspnoea and hospitalisations in young healthy adults Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnostics for Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) from the respiratory tract has become widely available, but the interpretation of the results remains unclear. M. pneumoniae has been suggested to cause mainly mild and self-limiting infections or asymptomatic carriage. However, systematic analyses of the association between PCR results and clinical findings are scarce. This study aimed to clarify the clinical features of PCR-positive M. pneumoniae infections in a hospital setting. We reviewed 103 PCR-positive patients cared for in a university hospital during a 3-year period. Data on age, sex, health condition, acute symptoms, other pathogens found, laboratory and X-ray results and treatments were collected. Over 85% of the patients had a triad of typical symptoms: fever, cough and shortness of breath. Symptoms in the upper respiratory tract were rare. In 91% of the cases, M. pneumoniae was the only pathogen found. The highest incidence was found in the age group of 30-40 years, and 68% of the patients did not have any underlying diseases. Most patients were initially empirically treated with beta-lactam antibiotics and needed 2-4 changes in their treatment. Only 6% were discharged without an antibiotic effective against M. pneumoniae. This study shows that M. pneumoniae often led to hospitalisation and that patients needed appropriate antimicrobial treatment to recover. Mixed infections were rare, and situations that could be interpreted as carriage did not occur.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).",Excluded

METHOD(S): Patients with stage IIIA/B NSCLC received concurrently 63 grays radiation and 20 mg/m2 cisplatin Day 1 to 3 in Weeks 1 and 5, plus weekly gemcitabine at escalating doses (150-700 mg/m2) on Fridays after radiation to avoid radiosensitization. The authors assessed dose-limiting toxicities according to Common Toxicity Criteria. The primary endpoint was maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of gemcitabine. Tumor resectability, survival, and disease-free survival (DFS) were also determined. RESULT(S): Forty-two patients were accrued, of whom 95% received radiation and 66% cisplatin as above. Weekly doses of gemcitabine were escalated to 700 mg/m 2. Grade 3 dysphagia and 1 case of fatal, probably treatment-related pulmonary deterioration established the MTD of gemcitabine at 550 mg/m2 weekly. Twenty-five patients underwent surgery, and histopathological complete regression was documented in 26% of these patients. Overall, median actuarial survival and DFS were 23.8 and 12.4 months, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): Gemcitabine at doses up to 550 mg/m2 weekly can be given simultaneously with radiation and cisplatin to patients with locally advanced NSCLC. Radical resection thereafter is feasible.

Patients and Methods: The schedule consisted of a first phase of chemotherapy alone and a second phase of concurrent chemoradiation. Initial doses were: docetaxel and cisplatin 20 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 15, 29, 36 and 43 plus 5-FU 150 mg/m2 PVI on days 1-21 and 29-49; RT (40 Gy) started on day 29. In the following steps the doses were escalated up to docetaxel 35 mg/m2 and cisplatin 25 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 15, 29, 36, 43, 50 and 57 plus 5-FU 180 mg/m2 PVI on days 1-21 and 150 mg/m2 PVI on days 29-63 concurrently with RT 50 Gy. Result(s): Forty-seven patients were enrolled and 46 completed the planned treatment. During the concomitant phase, grade 3-4 hematological toxicities occurred in three patients (6.5%) (or 3/174 cycles) and non-hematological toxicities in six patients (13%) (or 7/179 cycles). A pathological downstaging was obtained in 59.6% of the cases (28/47): complete remission (pCR) in 14 patients, near pCR (residual microfoci on the primary pN0) in eight patients, pT2 pN0 in three patients and partial response on the primary with positive lymph nodes in three patients. Six (13%) and 13 (28%) patients were considered stable and non-responders, respectively. In the last dose level, eight pCR and four near-pCR were obtained out of 15 patients. The maximum tolerable dose was not formally defined because dose escalation was stopped at the last dose level.

3095,"Can we achieve a radionuclide radiation dose equal to or less than that of 99mTc-hydroxymethane diphosphonate bone scintigraphy with a low-dose 18F-sodium fluoride time-of-flight PET of diagnostic quality? PURPOSE: F-Sodium fluoride is a bone tracer with a high signal-to-noise ratio, but its dosimetry is higher than that of Tc-labeled phosphonates at the recommended activities. The study's purpose was to determine whether the reduction by half of F-sodium fluoride-injected activity, mimicked by a short-timed reconstruction image, simulating a total dose less than or equal to that of Tc-hydroxymethane diphosphonate scintigraphy, had an impact on the accuracy of PET semiquantitative measurements and image quality. METHOD(S): Whole-body time-of-flight F-sodium fluoride PET/computed tomography (CT) images were acquired prospectively from 40 adult patients for detection of bone metastases. F-Sodium fluoride was administered according to the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) and Society of Nuclear Medicine (SNM) practice guidelines. From the acquired 1 min/bed position list-mode data, 30-s reconstructions were extracted. Measurements of maximum standard uptake value were recorded with a region of interest applied to the same location on the 1-min and 30-s images, which were displayed side by side, and were analyzed using Bland-Altman plots. A masked reading was performed by two senior nuclear medicine physicians who counted the foci of visually increased uptake. RESULT(S): Bland-Altman plots showed an excellent agreement between the maximum standard uptake value measurements of the 60- and 30-s images. The paired Wilcoxon test results between the corresponding 60- and 30-s images read by masked readers A and B were not significant (P=0.15 and 0.19, respectively). CONCLUSION(S): Reducing acquisition duration by half or injecting half of the activity recommended by the EANM and SNM practice guidelines can lead to F-sodium fluoride time-of-flight PET images of diagnostic quality, achieving a radiation dose less than or equal to that of Tc-labeled phosphonates.

3228,"Overwhelming support among urban Irish COPD patients for lung cancer screening by low-dose CT scan PURPOSE: The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) has renewed interest in low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening for lung cancer. Smokers may be less receptive toward LDCT screening, however, compared with never smokers. The views of patients with COPD, a particularly high-risk group, toward LDCT screening for lung cancer are currently unknown. We therefore evaluated attitudes of patients with COPD toward LDCT screening for lung cancer., METHODS: Interviews with Irish patients with COPD who satisfied NLST eligibility criteria were conducted in clinical settings using a questionnaire based on that of a comparable study of U.S. current/former smokers of unspecified disease status., RESULTS: A total of 142 subjects had a mean age of 65.09 +/- 6.07 years (46.4 % were male, mean pack years 54.5 +/- 33.3, mean FEV1 59.16 +/- 23 %); 97.8 % had an identifiable usual source of healthcare. Compared with data from a U.S. cohort of current/former smokers, a higher proportion of Irish COPD smokers: believed that they were at risk for lung cancer (63.6 vs. 15.7 %); believed that early detection improved chances of survival (90 vs. 51.2 ); were willing to consider LDCT screening (97.9 vs. 78.6 %); were willing to pay for a LDCT scan (68.6 vs. 36.2 %); and were willing to accept treatment recommendations arising (95.7 vs. 56.2 %; p < 0.0001 for all comparisons)., CONCLUSIONS: Urban Irish smokers with COPD who would be eligible for LDCT screening are almost universally in favor of being screened and treated for screening-detected lung cancers.

2788,"Coronary artery operation in radiation-associated atherosclerosis: long-term follow-up Radiation-associated coronary atherosclerosis is a potential problem for patients who have had mediastinal irradiation for malignant tumors. This study identified 14 patients with radiation-associated coronary atherosclerosis, defines unique population characteristics, and analyses postsurgical problems and long-term outcome. Fourteen patients with radiation-associated coronary atherosclerosis and class III and IV New York Heart Association symptoms were identified because of mediastinal or chest wall irradiation (30 Gy) associated with anterior epicardial discoloration or fibrosis, aortitis with adventitial thickening, and inflammatory process over a proximal coronary artery. Two distinct treatment groups were analyzed. Coronary artery operation resulted in one hospital death, with vein grafts being used predominantly. The internal mammary artery could only be used in 3 patients because of vessel friability and mediastinal fibrosis. Postoperative right ventricular dysfunction and pulmonary problems were frequent. Severe pericardial inflammatory complications (fibrosis with graft closure, and constrictive pericarditis) present in 2 early patients resulted in routine anterior pericardiectomy after coronary artery operation without further problems. Long-term follow-up (100%) (range, 11 to 74 months) revealed that 1 patient died late and of the remainder (12 patients), 11 were in New York Heart Association class I and 1 in class II, experiencing three myocardial events. Thus, patients with radiation-associated coronary atherosclerosis have a low operative mortality but have risk of early right ventricular and pulmonary dysfunction. The routine use of internal mammary artery may not be possible and anterior pericardiectomy is recommended. Long-term results are excellent and no evidence of accelerated disease has been noted.",Excluded
2533,"Have increases in solar ultraviolet exposure contributed to the rise in incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma? The incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) has increased substantially in many countries over recent decades. The aetiology of this cancer is poorly understood, and this rise is largely unexplained. The incidence of NHL is known to increase markedly following immune suppression. In the light of evidence that exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) may cause systemic immune suppression, part of the recent increase in NHL incidence may reflect population-based increases in UVR exposure. That such exposure increases have occurred is inferred from the widespread increases in skin cancer incidence in fair-skinned populations, especially malignant melanoma (MM), over recent decades. Epidemiological evidence presented here in support of the proposed UVR-NHL relationship includes the following: in Caucasian populations there is a moderate positive correlation between ambient UVR level, by latitude, and NHL incidence; there is also a positive correlation between time trends in MM incidence and NHL; there is some evidence that migration across latitude gradients induces concordant shifts in risks of NHL and MM. Data from two historical cancer patient registers show that, in individuals, these two cancers concurred a little more often than expected. These findings support recent suggestions that UVR-induced impairment of immune functioning contributes to the aetiology of NHL.",Excluded
3213,"The roles of Bcl-xL in modulating apoptosis during development of Xenopus laevis BACKGROUND: Apoptosis is a common and essential aspect of development. It is particularly prevalent in the central nervous system and during remodelling processes such as formation of the digits and in amphibian metamorphosis. Apoptosis, which is dependent upon a balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic factors, also enables the embryo to rid itself of cells damaged by gamma irradiation. In this study, the roles of the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-xL in protecting cells from apoptosis were examined in Xenopus laevis embryos using transgenesis to overexpress the XR11 gene, which encodes Bcl-xL. The effects on developmental, thyroid hormone-induced and gamma-radiation-induced apoptosis in embryos were examined in these transgenic animals., RESULTS: Apoptosis was abrogated in XR11 transgenic embryos. However, the transgene did not prevent the apoptotic response of tadpoles to thyroid hormone during metamorphosis. Post-metamorphic XR11 frogs were reared to sexual maturity, thus allowing us to produce second-generation embryos and enabling us to distinguish between the maternal and zygotic contributions of Bcl-xL to the gamma-radiation apoptotic response. Wild-type embryos irradiated before the mid-blastula transition (MBT) underwent normal cell division until reaching the MBT, after which they underwent massive, catastrophic apoptosis. Over-expression of Bcl-xL derived from XR11 females, but not males, provided partial protection from apoptosis. Maternal expression of XR11 was also sufficient to abrogate apoptosis triggered by post-MBT gamma-radiation. Tolerance to post-MBT gamma-radiation from zygotically-derived XR11 was acquired gradually after the MBT in spite of abundant XR11 protein synthesis., CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that Bcl-xL is an effective counterbalance to proapoptotic factors during embryonic development but has no apparent effect on the thyroid hormone-induced apoptosis that occurs during metamorphosis. Furthermore, post-MBT apoptosis triggered by irradiation before the MBT could only be restrained by maternal expression of Bcl-xL. Although maternal expression of XR11 was sufficient to abrogate apoptosis triggered by post-MBT gamma-radiation, radiation tolerance from zygotically-derived XR11 was acquired gradually, indicating that synthesis of XR11 protein is not sufficient to prevent apoptosis. Thus, repression of radiation-induced apoptosis by overexpression of Bcl-xL during embryonic development depends upon the timing of its expression and post-translational events that enable the protein to become effective.",Excluded
3380,"4DMRI-based investigation on the interplay effect for pencil beam scanning proton therapy of pancreatic cancer patients Background: Time-resolved volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (4DMRI) offers the potential to analyze 3D motion with high soft-tissue contrast without additional imaging dose. We use 4DMRI to investigate the interplay effect for pencil beam scanning (PBS) proton therapy of pancreatic cancer and to quantify the dependency of residual interplay effects on the number of treatment fractions. Method(s): Based on repeated 4DMRI datasets for nine pancreatic cancer patients, synthetic 4DCTs were generated by warping static 3DCTs with 4DMRI deformation vector fields. 4D dose calculations for scanned proton therapy were performed to quantify the interplay effect by CTV coverage (v95) and dose homogeneity (d5/d95) for incrementally up to 28 fractions. The interplay effect was further correlated to CTV motion characteristics. For quality assurance, volume and mass conservation were evaluated by Jacobian determinants and volume-density comparisons. Result(s): For the underlying patient cohort with CTV motion amplitudes < 15 mm, we observed significant correlations between CTV motion amplitudes and both the length of breathing cycles and the interplay effect. For individual fractions, tumor underdosage down to v95 = 70% was observed with pronounced dose heterogeneity (d5/d95 = 1.3). For full x 28 fractionated treatments, we observed a mitigation of the interplay effect with increasing fraction numbers. On average, after seven fractions, a CTV coverage with 95-107% of the prescribed dose was reached with sufficient dose homogeneity. For organs at risk, no significant differences were found between the static and accumulated dose plans for 28 fractions. Conclusion(s): Intrafractional organ motion exhibits a large interplay effect for PBS proton therapy of pancreatic cancer. The interplay effect correlates with CTV motion, but can be mitigated efficiently by fractionation, mainly due to different breathing starting phases in fractionated treatments. For hypofractionated treatments, a further restriction of motion may be required. Repeated 4DMRI measurements are a viable tool for pre- and post-treatment evaluations of the interplay effect.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).",Excluded
3519,"The use of large fractions in radiotherapy for malignant melanoma Eighty-nine cutaneous, subcutaneous or lymph node metastases of malignant melanoma in 15 patients were treated with radiotherapy using electron beams at appropriate energies (6-15 MeV). A total dose of 40 Gy was given in 8 fractions (fraction size 5 Gy) over 23 days. The therapy was given as two weekly fractions on two consecutive days with a 24-h interval. The next two fractions were given after a pause of 6 days. Eighty-six of 89 lesions (97%) responded to treatment, response rate being clearly dependent on tumour size. All the 67 lesions less than 2 cm in diameter responded, 51 of them (78%) completely disappearing, while in tumours over 4 cm among 10 lesions only 2 CR lesions were achieved. In cases where prolonged follow-up (greater than one year) was possible no major late side-effects were observed. The treatment scheme with large fractions appears to be well-tolerated and effective for metastatic malignant melanoma.",Excluded
3663,"Defining disease progression in Chinese mainland people: Association between bone mineral density and knee osteoarthritis Objective: To evaluate change in bone mineral density (BMD) during development of knee osteoarthritis (OA) in elderly Chinese community residents. Further, to monitor disease progression by recording speed of sound (SOS), one parameter of BMD provided by quantitative ultrasound measurement. Method(s): A total of 4173 community residents of the Chinese mainland were organized to complete questionnaires and relevant measurements, including anthropometry, radiology and quantitative ultrasound (QUS). SOS measurements of the distal radius were acquired using QUS measurements. The Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade of knee OA was evaluated by two experienced radiographers using X-rays. Finally, a general linear models analysis was performed to determine potential relationships. Further, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) was applied to assess the distinction model. Result(s): The SOS score in the OA group was significantly lower than that in the control group (p < 0.001). However, after adjustment for age and body mass index (BMI), no significant difference was observed in the male population (p = 0.841), while a significantly lower SOS score presented in knee OA participants in the female population (p = 0.033). A turning point in SOS scores, from increasing to decreasing trends, occurred around KL grade 2; the SOS score gradually increased with progression in participants from KL grades 0 to 2, whereas the SOS score presented a significant decrease in participants with KL grades 3 and 4. The AUC for the model to distinguish OA progression was 0.891. Conclusion(s): There was a non-linear and stage-specific association between SOS score and knee OA, which presented a positive relationship in early stages, but a negative relationship in advanced stages. A decline of SOS score in knee OA patients in early stages should alert clinicians to the possibility of disease progression. The Translational potential of this article: In the present study, the relationship between OA and BMD had established by SOS. The results suggested that close monitoring of SOS in elderly Chinese communities residents with knee OA could alert disease progression involvement by an easily accessible method, and help early referral to orthopedist consultation for further examination and treatment.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)",Excluded
2490,"Assessment of glenoid inclination on routine clinical radiographs and computed tomography examinations of the shoulder Background: Accurate assessment of glenoid inclination is of interest for a variety of conditions and procedures. The purpose of this study was to develop an accurate and reproducible measurement for glenoid inclination on standardized anterior-posterior (AP) radiographs and on computed tomography (CT) images. Material(s) and Method(s): Three consistently identifiable angles were defined: Angle alpha by line AB connecting the superior and inferior glenoid tubercle (glenoid fossa) and the line identifying the scapular spine; angle beta by line AB and the floor of the supraspinatus fossa; angle gamma by line AB and the lateral margin of the scapula. Experimental study: these 3 angles were measured in function of the scapular position to test their resistance to rotation. Conventional AP radiographs and CT scans were acquired in extension/flexion and internal/external rotation in a range up to +/-40degree. Clinical study: the inter-rater reliability of all angles was assessed on AP radiographs and CT scans of 60 patients (30 with proximal humeral fractures, 30 with osteoarthritis) by 2 independent observers. Result(s): The experimental study showed that angle alpha and beta have a resistance to rotation of up to +/-20degree. The deviation from neutral position was not more than +/-10degree. The results for the inter-rater reliability analyzed by Bland-Altman plots for the angle beta fracture group were (mean +/- standard deviation) -0.1 +/- 4.2 for radiographs and -0.3 +/- 3.3 for CT scans; and for the osteoarthritis group were -1.2 +/- 3.8 for radiographs and -3.0 +/- 3.6 for CT scans. Conclusion(s): Angle beta is the most reproducible measurement for glenoid inclination on conventional AP radiographs, providing a resistance to positional variability of the scapula and a good inter-rater reliability. © 2012 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.",Excluded
2832,"Hippocampal sparing radiotherapy for glioblastoma patients: A planning study using volumetric modulated arc therapy Background: The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential to reduce exposure of the contralateral hippocampus in radiotherapy for glioblastoma using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Method(s): Datasets of 27 patients who had received 3D conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) for glioblastoma with a prescribed dose of 60Gy in fractions of 2Gy were included in this planning study. VMAT plans were optimized with the aim to reduce the dose to the contralateral hippocampus as much as possible without compromising other parameters. Hippocampal dose and treatment parameters were compared to the 3D-CRT plans using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The influence of tumour location and PTV size on the hippocampal dose was investigated with the Mann-Whitney-U-test and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Result(s): The median reduction of the contralateral hippocampus generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD) with VMAT was 36 % compared to the original 3D-CRT plans (p<0.05). Other dose parameters were maintained or improved. The median V30Gy brain could be reduced by 17.9 % (p<0.05). For VMAT, a parietal and a non-temporal tumour localisation as well as a larger PTV size were predictors for a higher hippocampal dose (p<0.05). Conclusion(s): Using VMAT, a substantial reduction of the radiotherapy dose to the contralateral hippocampus for patients with glioblastoma is feasible without compromising other treatment parameters. For larger PTV sizes, less sparing can be achieved. Whether this approach is able to preserve the neurocognitive status without compromising the oncological outcome needs to be investigated in the setting of prospective clinical trials.Copyright © 2016 The Author(s).",Excluded
2957,"Alternative means of estimating maximum permissible activity of I-131 administered to treat thyroid cancer Objectives Maximum permissible activity (MPA) of I-131 to be administered to treat thyroid cancer traditionally combines 2 dose components & requires 5 days of repeatedly measuring whole body gamma radiation with an Anger camera & blood processing. The objective of our study was to determine whether the 2 dose components are sufficiently well correlated to enable estimating total dose from blood work alone. Methods Data were examined retrospectively for all pts studied from 2004 - 2015. An uncollimated gamma camera measured anterior & posterior counts (corrected for background & decay & calibrated by I-131 standards) 6 times over 5 days after administration of 37-74 MBq I-131 to estimate dose to blood from gamma emissions (Dgamma). Blood was sampled within 10 min of each camera measurement, well counter counts of which estimated dose to blood from beta emissions (Dbeta). Adding these 2 estimates provided total dose (DT) to blood forming organs, adjusted for body habitus. Predicted total dose (DP) was obtained from Dbeta alone by linear regression. Conventional MPA was computed as 200 rad/DT & predicted MPA as 200 rad/DP. Results There were 62 pts (age = 61+/-12 yrs; 30 female; 32 male), of whom 2 were studied twice & 3 were studied 3 times, for a total of 68 measurements. DT was progressively larger for pts studied multiple times (rank correlation rho = 0.39, p = 0.004). DP was computed as = -0.005+1.473* Dbeta, & correlated strongly with DT (r = 0.98, p < 0.0001; intercept = 0.04+/-0.02, p = 0.09; slope = 0.95+/-0.02, p < 0.0001), with similar means (0.76+/-0.51 versus 0.76+/-0.52 rad/mCi, paired t-test p = 0.96). Predicted & conventional total doses were similar for pts studied once (0.69+/-0.41 versus 0.68+/-0.42 rad/mCi, p = 0.72), twice (1.06+/-0.69 versus 1.11+/-0.64 rad/mCi, p = 0.39), & 3 times (1.25+/-0.59 versus 1.26+/-0.62 rad/mCi, p = 0.87). Predicted MPA correlated strongly with actual MPA (r = 0.99, p < 0.0001), with similar means (385+/-230 versus 394+/-244 mCi, p = 0.11). Conclusions Similar results are obtained whether uncollimated camera measurements are obtained directly or are estimated based on blood measurements. (Figure Presented).",Excluded
