3737,"A Novel In Vivo Protocol for Molecular Study of Radiation-Induced Fibrosis in Head and Neck Cancer Patients OBJECTIVES: Radiation-induced fibrosis is a common complication for patients following head and neck cancer treatment. This study presents a novel minimally invasive protocol for molecular study of fibrosis in the stromal tissues., METHODS: Subjects with radiation-induced fibrosis in the head and neck who were at least 6 months post treatment received submental core needle biopsies, followed by molecular processing and quantification of gene expression for 14 select pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic genes. Control biopsies from the upper arm were obtained from the same subjects. Patients were followed up at 1 and 2 weeks to monitor for safety and adverse outcomes., RESULTS: Six subjects were enrolled and completed the study. No subjects experienced adverse outcomes or complication. An 18 gauge core biopsy needle with a 10 mm notch inserted for up to 60 seconds was needed. Subcutaneous tissue yielded 3 ng of RNA, amplified to 6 microg of cDNA, allowing for adequately sensitive quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis of approximately 28 genes., CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the safety and utility of a novel technique for the molecular study of fibrosis in head and neck cancer patients. Longitudinal studies of patients undergoing radiation therapy will allow for identification of molecular targets that contribute to the process of fibrosis in the head and neck.

4841,"Fractionated re-irradiation for local recurrence following stereotactic body radiotherapy for primary and metastatic lung cancers Purpose/Objective(s): The effectiveness of re-irradiation for local recurrence following stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has not been reported.We evaluated clinical outcomes of fractionated re-irradiation for local recurrence following SBRT for primary and metastatic lung cancers, retrospectively. Materials/Methods: Between April 2003 and December 2010, 410 patients with primary or metastatic lung tumor received SBRT in Kyushu University Hospital, and 47 patients developed local recurrence after SBRT. Fractionated re-irradiation was performed in 16 patients who were medically inoperable or refused surgery. The median age of 16 patients was 80 years (range 52- 88 years). Fourteen patients were male, and two were female. Thirteen patients had primary lung cancer, and three had metastatic lung tumor. The median tumor size was 41 mm (range 19 - 66 mm) and three patients had regional lymph node metastases. Radiation dose ranged from 60 to 70 Gy at 1.8 - 2 Gy per fraction. Concurrent chemotherapy was given in six patients. Result(s): Median follow-up was 10.2 months (range 1.6 - 21.2 months). Local re-recurrence was observed in 8 patients. Five patients died of recurrence and one patient died from other diseases. Local control rate, cause-specific survival and overall survival at 1 were 66.5%, 90.9% and 90.9%, respectively. No severe adverse events were observed in all patients during follow-up. Conclusion(s): Although the follow-up period was short, fractionated re-irradiation may be safe and an effective treatment option for local recurrence following SBRT. To confirm the effectiveness, a further accumulation of patients and longer follow-up are required.",Excluded
4380,"[Ambulatory diagnosis and therapy of ulcerative colitis] During an examination period of one year in a well defined population of 50 000 inhabitants 44 patients with colitis ulcerosa were diagnostically clarified and secured histologically. 37 patients (84.1%) could be treated and brought into a phase of remission with salazosulfapyridin (Azulfidine), glucocorticoids as well as a liberal gastroenterologic basic diet with restriction on dairy products and occasionally a diet, developed for astronauts. Only 7 patients (15.9%) had to be hospitalized for therapy because of accompanying illnesses, regression in the course of colitis and complications such as anemia and electrolyte imbalances. With view to the degree of severity, the majority of the patients showed signs of erosive and ulcerative changes as well as expanded pseudopolypic formations in the mucous membrane indicating the chronically continuing and chronically relapsing course of the disease. 54.5% of the affected showed endoscopical and histological changes in the rectosigmoid; an additional 27.2? had inflammatory changes up to the left colon flexure (see figure 2). Only 18.3% of the patients showed inflammatory attack of the entire colon. From the degree of severity of the inflammatory changes, the anatomic distribution and expansion in the large bowel, no difference in outpatient therapy with regard to its effectiveness can be seen.",Excluded
3889,"Surgical management of cervical spondylotic myelopathy Introduction: The surgical procedure by the anterior, posterior and combined antero-posterior approaches had applied for the treatment of cervical spondylotic myelopathy. Method(s): During the treatment process, all patients were pre-operatively as well post-operatively graded according to Japanese Orthopaedics Association. Several surgical methods such as anterior approach, posterior approach, and combined antero-posterior approach have been addressed for CSM patients, with the choice based on the pathogenesis of the myelopathy. The main indications for surgery were evidence of myelopathy on physical examinations, a JOA score below 13 points help with spinal cord compression observed on plain X-ray, CT scan, MRI studies. Result(s): The pre-operative JOA scores were 7.60+/-1.23 in laminoplasty, 8.30+/-1.03 in diskectomy and corpectomy and 7.10+/-1.20 in combined antero-posterior approach patients. At the follow-up after three months the JOA scores were laminoplasty 13.30+/-1.30, diskectomy and corpectomy 13.55+/-1.15 and combined antero-posterior 13.50+/-1.08. The JOA recovery rate averaged, 61.08+/-11.25% in laminoplasty, 60.67+/-10.60% in diskectomy and corpectomy and 64.67+/-10.72% in combined anteroposterior approach. The high- signal intensity changed to normal in 18 out of 28 and no any kyphotic change and instability were found in cervical spine at the follow up. Conclusion(s): Patients with OPLL (continuous, segmental and mixed type), stenosis of cervical spinal canal, multilevel cervical spondylosis, large and high ossification of IVDP with stenosis were improved with laminoplasty. Patients with PIVD, CSM with kyphosis, post laminectomy, OPLL herniated type, unstable vertebral alignment, stenosis by osteophytes, were improved with anterior approach. Ossified or deformed OPLL, unstable vertebral with stenosis,OPLL or OYL with cervical meandearing (swan-neck) were improved with Combined anterior and posterior approach.",Excluded
4943,"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated with intensity modulated radiation therapy using a reduced clinical target volume for the neck nodal regions Purpose/Objective(s): To evaluate the efficacy of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) using reduced clinical target volumes for regional lymph nodes (CTV-N) in the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Materials/Methods: From January 2006 to December 2010, a total of 1,208 patients with NPC treated with IMRT according to our institutional protocol were collected in the current study. The CTV-N was contoured according to DAHANCA, EORTC, GORTEC, NCIC, and RTOG consensus guidelines but the level I, the retrostyloid space, and the medial retropharyngeal nodes below the cranial edge of the second cervical vertebra (C2) were spared. Patients with locoregionally advanced disease were also prescribed cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Result(s): With a median follow-up of 57 months (range, 2-102 months), 33 patients had developed regional failure, of which, 22 patients encountered recurrence in the irradiation field and only 11 patients (1%) experienced relapse outside the irradiation field. The 5-year overall survival, distant metastasis-free survival, regional relapse-free survival, and local relapsefree survival were 80.8%, 82.6%, 96.8%, and 93.2% respectively. Multivariate analyses revealed that the N-classification was the only significant prognostic factor for predicting regional relapse-free survival. Conclusion(s): The IMRT approach using reduced CTV-N sparing the level I, the retrostyloid space, and the medial retropharyngeal nodes below the cranial edge of C2 for NPC is suitable.",Excluded
3958,"Ionizing radiation regulates the expression of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in epithelial cancer cells: modulation of cellular signals regulating cell cycle and survival PURPOSE: To analyze the (i) expression of AMPK in a variety of epithelial cancer cells, (ii) regulation of AMPK subunit expression by ionizing radiation (IR) and (iii) impact of AMPK on signaling pathways regulating cell cycle and survival., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Human lung, prostate, and breast normal and cancer cells were treated with 0 or 8 Gy IR and mRNA and protein levels of AMPK were evaluated by RT-PCR and immunoblotting 24 or 48 h later. Untreated and radiated wild type (WT) and AMPKalpha(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were analyzed by immunoblotting using total- and phosphorylation-specific antibodies. Histone H2Ax was examined by fluorescence microscopy. The cell cycle and survival of WT and AMPKalpha(-/-) MEFs was also evaluated following 8 Gy by IR., RESULTS: AMPK subunits were found widely expressed in normal and cancer epithelial cells. IR increased subunit protein levels and stimulated gene transcription in cancer cells. AMPKalpha(-/-)-MEFs showed enhanced basal total levels of ATM and phosphorylation of its substrates histone H2Ax, but inhibited response of these markers and of checkpoint kinase Chk2 phosphorylation to IR. AMPKalpha(-/-)-MEFs showed increased basal levels of p53 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21(cip1), but lack of response of both genes to IR. These cells had increased basal levels and activation of the Akt-mTOR-p70(S6K)/4-EBP1 signalling pathway. IR increased Akt, p70(S6K) and 4-EBP1 phosphorylation in WT-MEFs, but this was reduced in AMPKalpha(-/-)-MEFs. AMPKalpha(-/-)-MEFs failed to arrest at the G2-M checkpoint after IR and showed a trend for radio-resistance in proliferation assays., CONCLUSIONS: AMPK is widely expressed in human normal and cancer epithelial cells and its gene transcription, protein levels, and enzymatic activity is stimulated by IR. Work with AMPKalpha knockout cells suggests that AMPK (i) may mediate a suppressive regulation on basal expression and activity of ATM and its downstream effector pathways Chk2/p53-p21(cip1) and Akt-mTOR, (ii) facilitates the normal response of these pathways to IR and, (iii) mediates the IR-induced G2-M checkpoint.

4351,"Clinical outcome of radiation therapy for ocular adnexal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas Purpose/Objective(s): The purpose of this study was to evaluate the longterm treatment outcomes and patterns of failure in patients with primary ocular adnexal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma treated with involved-field radiation therapy. Materials/Methods: Patients who were pathologically diagnosed as Stage IE/IIE ocular adnexal MALT lymphoma and underwent radiation therapy were retrospectively analyzed. Since 2006, 55 patients received radiation therapy and were followed up for more than 6 months at our institution. At initial presentation, 53 patients had Stage IE disease and two had Stage IIE disease. There were 28 men and 27 women. The median age was 66 years (range, 39-90 years). Local control (LC), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): The median follow-up period was 47 months (range, 6-90 months). The median radiation dose was 30 Gy (range, 30-30.6 Gy in 15- 17 fractions). All patients were treated by radiation alone, but oral steroid was used for four patients who had double vision at the beginning of treatment. Thirty-four patients were treated with 6 MV photon beams with a wedged pair of fields. Nineteen patients with a lesion confined to the conjunctive or eyelid were treated with 9 MeV electron beams with a single anterior field. In the remaining two patients, combination of the two beams was used. A lead lens block was used in 16 patients. Six patients had bilateral lesions and were treated simultaneously. The 5-year LC rate was 100%. In two patients, local recurrence was suspected at 44 and 46 months, respectively, after radiation therapy, but both of them were diagnosed to have IgG4-related inflammation by biopsy, with no evidence of malignancy upon histological and immunohistochemical examinations. The 5-year PFS and OS rates were 89% and 100%, respectively. Four patients had recurrence at a distant site. The median time to recurrence was 24 months. Three of the four patients received systemic chemotherapy with R-CHOP and another patient is being followed up without second line treatment. One patient developed retinal detachment incidentally during radiation therapy and underwent surgery thereafter. There was no other Grade 3 or higher acute morbidity. Eleven patients had Grade 2 late morbidity (dry eye, 2; cataract, 9). Sixteen patients had Grade 3 cataract. No patients had severe late adverse events other than cataract. Conclusion(s): Patients with localized ocular adnexal MALT lymphoma achieved excellent local control after 30 Gy of radiation therapy alone. Local regrowth of the mass was observed in two patients, but both were diagnosed as IgG4-related disease. Association between MALT lymphoma and IgG4-related disease has been reported recently, and in such cases it should be born in mind.",Excluded
4338,"Surgical treatment and prognosis of mesenchymal chondrosarcoma Objective: To assess the surgical outcome of patients with mesenchymal chondrosarcoma (MCS) treated in our institute. This study was also designed to describe the clinical characteristics, treatment, and outcome of MCS to provide a better understanding of its clinical management. Method(s): A total of 27 patients with MCS were treated in Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, China from October 1997 to March 2011. Demographic information and follow-up data were obtained and statistically analyzed. Result(s): Among the 27 patients, 9 were males and 18 were females with a mean age of 30.4 years (ranging from 14 years to 51 years). The median follow-up time was 42.6 months (ranging from 6 months to 104 months). Among the total number of tumor cases, 22 and 5 were detected in bone tissues and extra-skeletal sites, respectively. A total of 25 patients underwent surgery, but only 17 achieved the standard surgical margin of wide excision. Among these patients, 16 and 13 were subjected to chemotherapy and irradiation. The threeand five-year survival rates were 65% and 49.5%, respectively. Conclusion(s): MCS is a rare tumor resulting in morbidity with local recurrences and long-term metastases. In this study, standard multimodal regimens were proposed to treat MCS. The results recommended wide resection with suitable surgical margins as the preferred treatment. However, further studies should be conducted because the information about the benefits of chemotherapy and radiotherapy for the control of local or systemic symptoms of MCS remains insufficient.",Excluded
4405,"Evaluation of the effectiveness of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair at the Thong Nhat hospital in Vietnam We evaluated the results of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Thirty cases of rotator cuff tear were treated by arthroscopic rotator cuff repair at the Thong Nhat hospital from 1/3/2012 to 30/6/2016. All patients were over 18 years old, had positive rotator cuff tear tests, and underwent X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging. The arthroscopic images showed rotator cuff tears, with indication for repair. The functional status of each patient was evaluated using the Constant-Murley Scale and the criteria of the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA). During postoperative rehabilitation, we applied Cohen's protocol. Seventeen patients were female and 13 were male. The median age was 54 years (21-83). Sixteen patients had partial thickness tears and 14 patients had full-thickness tears. Repair technique: Single-row in 13 patients, suture-bridge in 15 patients, transosseous-equivalent in two patients. Four patients with SLAP lesions were treated by debridement labrum for type I, and labral repair for more serious lesions. Five patients with long head biceps tendon rupture were treated with tenodesis. After surgery, 100% of patients were subjected to fluid extravasation through the shoulder joint, but did not have any compartment syndrome; all incisions healed good without infection or neurapraxia. The mean UCLA score was 32.4 (14 patients had excellent results, 14 good, and two fair). The mean Constant score was 38.5; the mean postoperative Constant score was 88.77 (p = 0.001). Among the patients, 90% achieved 80% function compared to a normal shoulder. All patients gave their consent to the study and were prepared for the full course of treatment and arthroscopic surgery. Repair of the rotator cuff was for some participants the only effective treatment and a way to restore the shoulder. Postoperative reconstruction of the rotator cuff of the shoulder resulted in a significant improvement in the indicators of the functional state of the shoulder joint.Copyright Â© FUNPEC-RP.",Excluded
4001,"Fat depot specific differences in mRNA expression of novel loci associated with waist-hip ratio Background and aims: Body fat distribution is one of the main predictors of obesity-associated complications. It might be hypothesised that changes in the gene expression or in gene function caused by genetic variants may result in metabolic alterations related to obesity. We therefore investigated the adipose tissue expression profiles of 6 loci (TBX15, WARS, PIGC, STAB1, GRB14, ZNRF3), identified in a recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) for WHR, as their exact role in fat distribution remains largely unknown. Effects of genetic variants within these loci (rs984222 TBX15/WARS; rs6784615 STAB1; rs1011731 PIGC; rs4823006 ZNFR3; rs10195252 GRB14) on gene expression, WHR, and obesity related traits were examined. Material(s) and Method(s): Paired samples of visceral (vis) and subcutaneous (sc) adipose tissue were obtained from 297 Caucasian men and women who underwent open abdominal surgery. Abdominal vis and sc fat area was calculated using CT scans and percentage body fat was measured by dualenergy X-ray absorptiometry. Gene expression was measured by quantitative real-time PCR by using TaqMan methodology. SNP genotyping was done using the TaqMan SNP Genotyping assay. Differences in mRNA expression between vis and sc adipose tissue were assessed using the paired t-test. Correlation analyses were carried out and multivariate linear relationships were assessed by generalized linear regression models. Two-sided P-values <0.05 were considered to provide nominal evidence for association (adj. age, gender). Result(s): Differential expression between vis and sc adipose tissue could be observed for all tested genes. Except for STAB1 with higher mRNA expression in sc adipose tissue of males vs. females, there were no gender differences in gene expression in either tissue. Surprisingly, no correlation between WHR and fat mRNA expression of any of the genes was observed except for WARS whose expression in vis fat correlated positively with WHR in men. However, mRNA expression of several genes (e.g. WARS, PIGC, STAB1) correlated with BMI. Further, STAB1 expression in sc adipose tissue correlated with fat mass, and ZNRF3 expression in sc tissue correlated negatively with vis fat area. In addition, vis as well as sc expression of WARS and PIGC correlated negatively with both vis and sc fat area. Nominal associations were detected for rs984222 and TBX15 mRNA expression, rs4823006 and ZNFR3 mRNA expression, and rs10195252 and GRB14 mRNA expression, whereat rs984222 was also associated with BMI, sc and vis fat area as well as the GRB14 SNP with waist and waist-hip ratio in men (adj. age, BMI). Conclusion(s): Besides rather moderate correlations of the expression levels with BMI or WHR, the most striking feature of expression of the 6 examined genes is the inter-depot variability as well as correlations with the vis and sc fat area. Our data further support the role of genes from recent GWAS in the regulation of fat distribution.",Excluded
4558,"Predicting Factors for Oncological and Functional Outcome in Hypopharyngeal Cancer Objectives/Hypothesis: Hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a rare but aggressive malignancy, with low survival rates and high incidence of tumor and treatment-related morbidity. This study aims to analyze the long-term oncologic and functional outcomes of a large cohort of patients and to determine prognostic factors. Study Design: Retrospective cohort study. Method(s): The records of all patients diagnosed with hypopharyngeal SCC and treated with curative intent at our tertiary referral center were reviewed. Patient and initial disease characteristics, features, and complications of primary treatment, recurrence patterns, and corresponding treatments and the oncologic and functional long-term outcome were determined. Result(s): For a total of 179 patients, primary radiotherapy (RT) was the predominant treatment modality (78%), whereas 22% underwent primary surgery. The median, 2-year, and 5-year overall survival (OS) for the study cohort were 47 months, 64% and 43%. The median survival after first and second relapse was 7 and 6 months, respectively. The 2 and 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) was 52% and 36%. The median RFS after first relapse and salvage treatment was 9 months. A nodal status of >=cN2 (HR = 1.89, CI:1.21-3.05, P <.005) and any other primary tumor localization than pyriform sinus (HR = 1.60, CI: 1.04-2.42, P <.05) were identified as independent risk factors for shorter OS and RFS. Regarding functional outcome, the 2- and 5-year laryngectomy-free-survival was 55% and 37%, respectively.

4900,"A retrospective study of concurrent chemoradiotherapy plus S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy on curative effect for treatment of patients with N3 stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma Introduction: The purpose of this study was to analyze the efficacy and safety of concurrent chemoradiotherapy plus S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy for N3 stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Method(s): This study included 44 N3 stage NPC patients treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy plus S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy. The intensity-modulated radiation therapy doses were planning target volume (PTV) 70-72 Gy for gross disease in the nasopharynx and 66-70 Gy for positive lymph nodes. The doses for high-risk-and low-risk region PTV were 60-62 and 54-56 Gy in 31-33 fractions. All patients received a concurrent chemotherapy program consisting of cisplatin 100 mg/m2, day 1, and the cycle repetition was every 21 days. The adjuvant chemotherapy program consisted of 4 cycles of S-1. The dose of S-1 was determined according to the body surface area (BSA): 40 mg twice a day for BSA <1.25 m2; 50 mg twice a day for 1.25 m2<=BSA<1.5 m2; and 60 mg twice a day for BSA >=1.5 m2. S-1 was given on days 1-28, given 6 weeks apart. Result(s): All 44 patients completed at least 2 cycles of concurrent chemotherapy and 4 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy. The total efficiency of therapy was 100.0%. The 3-year overall survival (OS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), local-regional control, and progression-free survival rates were 86.4%, 84.1%, 97.7%, and 81.8%, respectively. There were no differences in the OS, DMFS, and efficiency between fast-fading group (reaching partial response before the second cycle of concurrent chemotherapy) and general-fading group (the rest of the group). The incidence of rash in the entire group was low, and there was also no association with prognosis. Conclusion(s): In patients with N3 stage NPC, concurrent chemoradiotherapy plus S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy yielded an excellent survival benefit, and the toxicities were mild and tolerable. Distant metastasis was the main cause of treatment failure.Copyright Â© 2018 Zhang et al.",Excluded

Primary parotid gland carcinoma patients (n = 23) treated with 125I brachytherapy alone between 1 October 2005 and 31 July 2013 at Peking University Stomatology Hospital were enrolled in this retrospective study. All had clinical stage IV disease. The prescribed dose was 60-160 Gy. The local control rate, survival rate, and predictors of the prognosis were evaluated. Adverse events related to treatment were also noted. The average follow-up time was 29 months (range 9-74 months). Among the 23 patients, six had local failure and 11 died during the follow-up period. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 87.0%, 55.4%, and 47.5%, respectively. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year progression-free survival rates were 73.9%, 47.0%, and 39.2%, respectively. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year local control rates were 82.1%, 73.9%, and 73.9%, respectively. Age and distant metastasis were independent predictors of survival, while the preoperative duration of the disease was an independent predictor of local control.

Thyroid volume has been reported as one of the factors influencing radioiodine therapy outcome in man and cats. The goal of this study was to describe the most reliable and practically applicable formula to determine thyroid volume using scintigraphy. The volume of each thyroid lobe of 32 hyperthyroid cats was determined by ultrasound and scintigraphy. The ultrasonographically determined volume (ellipsoid formula) for each thyroid lobe was compared with the scintigraphic volume that was calculated using eight different formulas: F1 [(pi/6) x L x H x W], F2 [(pi /2) x L x W(2)], F3 [0.33 x (area cm(2))(3/2)], F4 [1.08 x (pi /6) x L x W(2)], F5 (area x H), F6 (0.27 x area x L), F7 (pi x L x W(2)) and F8 [pi x (4/3) x W(3)]. F1, F3, F4 and F6 did not differ statistically from the volumes measured on ultrasound, while F2, F5, F7 and F8 did.

4713,"Noncancer disease incidence in the atomic bomb survivors: 1958-1986 Using the longitudinal data of the Adult Health Study (AHS) cohort collected during 1958-1986, we examined for the first time the relationship between exposure to ionizing radiation and the incidence of 19 nonmalignant disorders in the A-bomb survivors. Affected individuals were ascertained through the three-digit codes of the International Classification of Diseases which are encoded in the AHS database subsequent to diagnoses made on the basis of general laboratory tests, physical examinations, and history-taking conducted during biennial AHS examinations. The disease onset time was estimated using the mid-point between the AHS examination data when the disease was initially reported and the previously attended disease-free examination date. Dosimetry System 86 organ doses judged to be most appropriate were used. Tests of dose effects were performed assuming a linear relative risk model with stratified background incidence. For the entire study period, significant excess risk was detected for uterine myoma (P < 0.001), chronic liver disease and cirrhosis (P = 0.006), and thyroid disease (P < 0.0001), defined broadly as the presence of one or more of certain noncancerous thyroid conditions. The incidence of myocardial infarction was shown to be increased (P = 0.03) in later years (1968-1986) among the younger heavily exposed AHS subjects, confirming the results of the recent Life Span Study (LSS) noncancer mortality report on coronary heart disease. The findings for uterine myoma may serve as additional evidence indicating benign tumor growth as a possible consequence of radiation exposure. Our results indicating the involvement of radiation in the development of liver diseases are consistent with the report of increased mortality from liver cirrhosis with radiation dose in the LSS cohort. An effect of age at exposure was detected for nonmalignant thyroid disease (P = 0.02), with an increased risk for those exposed who were under 20 years of age, but not for older survivors. Thus the AHS data suggest that thyroid glands in the young are more radiosensitive not only to the development of malignancies, but also to the development of nonmalignant disorders as well. The findings hold independently of the dose effects observed for thyroid cancer. This study also shows that for the period 1958-1986 new occurrences of lens opacity are not increased with radiation dose (P = 0.39) in the AHS subjects.",Included
4602,"Utilization of stem cells in alginate for nucleus pulposus tissue engineering In a general view of anatomy, intervertebral disc is composed of three parts: annulus fibrosus (AF), nucleus pulposus (NP), and cartilage endplate (CEP). Recently, several types of stem cells were successfully isolated from these corresponding regions, but up to now, no research was performed about which kind of stem cells is the most efficient candidate for NP tissue engineering or for stem cell-based disc regeneration therapy. In this study, we compared the regenerative potentials of the above-mentioned three kinds of disc-derived stem cells with that of the classic bone marrow (BM)-mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in a rabbit disc degeneration model. By magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), X-ray, histology, etc. evaluations, we found that cartilage endplate-derived stem cells (CESCs) showed superior capacity compared with the annulus fibrosus-derived stem cells (AFSCs), nucleus pulposus-derived stem cells (NPSCs), and BM-MSCs (p<0.05); additionally, when comparing the CESC group with the normal control group, there existed no statistical difference in X-ray (p>0.05). Those results demonstrated that the CESC-seeded alginate construct performed the most powerful ability for NP regeneration, while AFSCs showed the most inferior potency, NPSCs and BM-MSCs had similar regenerative capacity and located in the middle. All in all, our study showed that CESCs might act as an efficient seed cell source for NP tissue engineering, which paved a new way for the biological solution of disc degeneration diseases.

3746,"Altered and conventional fractionated radiotherapy in locoregional control and survival of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, oropharynx, and hypopharynx AIM: To compare the efficacy of two altered fractionation radiotherapy treatment protocols (hyperfractionation and accelerated fractionation with concomitant boost) with conventional fractionation in improvement of locoregional disease control and survival of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, oropharynx, or hypopharynx., METHODS: From March 1999 to December 2000, 51 patients with previously untreated squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, oropharynx or hypopharynx underwent conventionally fractionated radiotherapy and received 66-70 Gy in 6(1/2)-7 weeks (2 Gy per fraction a day, 5 fractions a week). From January 2001 to June 2004, 101 patients with the same diagnoses underwent either hyperfractionated radiotherapy, with 74.4-79.2 Gy delivered in 6.2-7 weeks (1.2 Gy per fraction twice a day), or accelerated fractionation with concomitant boost, which delivered 68.7-72 Gy in 6 weeks (1.8 Gy per fraction a day and 1.5 Gy per fraction a day to a boost filed as a second daily treatment for the last 11-12 treatment days). Locoregional relapse and overall survival were recorded., RESULTS: Complete response to treatment was obtained in 31 of 51 patients treated with conventional fractionation, 33 of 50 patients treated with hyperfractionation, and 36 of 51 patients treated with accelerated fractionation. No significant differences were observed among the patients treated with conventional, hyperfractionated, or accelerated radiotherapy modalities either in locoregional control rate (41% vs 35% vs 49%, respectively; P=0.690) or overall survival rate (50% vs 40% vs 51%, respectively; P=0.760).

The difference in the grade of acute side effects in the skin among the treatment groups was of borderline significance (chi2(2) test; P=0.054). There was also a borderline difference among the groups in the grade of late side effects in the mucous membrane (chi2(2) test; P=0.055)., CONCLUSION: Altered fractionation regimens were not more efficacious than conventional fractionation in the treatment of previously untreated head and neck carcinoma., CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00291434.",Excluded
4065,"Robust femur condyle disambiguation on biplanar X-rays Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the skeleton from biplanar X-rays relies on scarce information digitalised by an operator on both frontal and lateral radiographs. In clinical routine, difficulties occur for non-skilled operators to discriminate the medial from the lateral femur condyle on the lateral view. Our study proposes an algorithm able to detect automatically a possible inversion of the two condyles by the operator at an early stage of the reconstruction process. It relies on the computation of two 3D femur surfaces, one directly from the operator digitalisation and the other from the same digitalisation with medial and lateral condyles automatically swapped. Pairs of virtual biplanar X-rays are computed for both reconstructions and the closest pair to the original X-rays is selected on the basis of similarity measures, pointing the correct 3D surface. The algorithm shows a success rate higher than 85% for both asymptomatic and pathological femurs whatever the initial condyle digitalisation of the operator, bringing automatically non-skilled operators acting in clinical routine to the level of skilled operators. This study validates moreover the proof-of-concept of automatic shape adjustments of a 3D surface on the basis of similarity measures in the process of 3D reconstruction from biplanar X-rays.

These portions were injected subcutaneously into different groups of cross-bred calves. The calves injected with 0-, 3-, or 5-krad irradiated tick supernate had severe reactions (rectal temperature 39.8 to 41.6 C, two- to fourfold enlargement of prescapular lymph gland, mean peak parasitemia 27.3% to 32.5% infected erythrocytes, decreased PCV 41.7% to 60.7%, and hemoglobin concentration 37.5% to 50.8%), and many died, whereas those injected with 6- or 7-krad irradiated tick supernate had minimal reactions (rectal temperature 39.2 to 39.8 C, slight enlargement of prescapular lymph gland, parasitemia less than 1%, decrease packed cell volume 15.1%, and hemoglobin concentration 20.1%), with no mortality. All surviving calves injected with nonirradiated (0-) or 3-, 5-, 6-, or 7-krad irradiated tick supernate developed comparable indirect fluorescent antibody titers and were resistant to challenge exposure with infective material from 30 ticks. The calves injected with 9-krad irradiated tick supernate showed no reactions and did not develop indirect fluorescent antibody titers; they were also susceptible to challenge exposure with infective tick material.",Excluded
3812,"Dose-response relationships for radium-induced bone sarcomas The incidence of bone sarcomas among 3055 female radium-dial workers who entered the dial industry before 1950 was used to determine dose-response relationships for the induction of bone sarcomas by radium. Two subpopulations were analyzed: all measured cases who survived at least 5 yr after the start of employment and all cases who survived at least 2 yr after first measurement. The first constituted a group based on year of entry; it contained 1468 women who experienced 42 bone sarcomas; the expected number was 0.4. The second comprised a group based on first measurement; it contained 1257 women who experienced 13 bone sarcomas; the expected number was 0.2. The dose-response function, I = (C + alpha D + beta D2)e-gammaD, and simplifications of this general form, were fit to each data set. Incidence (I) was in units of bone sarcomas per person-yr; (D) was the quantity (muCi) of radium that entered the blood. Two functions, I = (C + alpha D + beta D2)e-gammaD and I = (C + beta D2)e-gammaD, fit the data for year of entry (p greater than or equal to 0.05); both these functions and I = (C + alpha D) fit the data for first measurement. The function I = (C + beta D2)e-gammaD was used to predict the number of bone sarcomas in all other pre-1950 radium cases (medical, laboratory and other exposures); fewer were actually observed than the fit of this function to the female dial workers predicted.",Excluded

4163,"Stereotactic radiation therapy of patients with brain tumors: Khabarovsk experience Introduction: Recently in our country for curing brain tumors stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is increasingly used, which combines a sufficient deleterious effect on the target with the maximum protection of the surrounding brain structures. We present our experience in the treatment on robotic system <>, UK. Material(s) and Method(s): Since 2010 this method therapy is applied for treating patients with brain tumors in Khabarovsk Clinical Oncology Centre. During the period of May 2010 - December 2012, 43 patients were treated using SRT. 30 patients with meningioma; 4 - with recurrent astrocytoma; 3 - with metastasis; 3 - with hemispheric cavernous malformation; 2 case of intracanalicular vestibular schwannoma; 1 patient with adenoma. Patients' age from 23 to 71 years old (mean, 52 Y). 10 men and 33 women. Formation of conformal dose distribution was obtained by multileaf (40-pair) collimator with a 0.25 mm accuracy of positioning. Frame fixation was standard. Dose distribution was calculated via XiO system. Patient positioning inaccuracy was measured by X-ray Volume Imaging (XVIm). The correction of patient's position was preformed automatically with HexaPod system, resulting in 0.1 mm accuracy by linear coordinates and 0.1degree by angular coordinates. Result(s): In the 6-months of postradiation period the stabilization of tumor and regression of symptoms was found in all patients. At the 12 months follow-up period tumor shrinking was found in 3 patients, in other cases the stabilization of tumor was observed. There were no severe adverse events. Conclusion(s): Our moderate experience of SRT of patients with brain tumors shows an effectiveness of the method. Moreover, in cases of tumor localization in eloquent areas and in patients with high operative risk, SRT implementation presents as the only accessible type of treatment.

3995,"Renal denervation for refractory hypertension - technical aspects, complications and radiation exposure PURPOSE: To analyze procedural details, complications and radiation exposure in renal denervation (RDN) using the Medtronic Symplicity R device in the treatment of refractory hypertension., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty three consecutive patients underwent RDN. The number of ablations per artery, peri-procedural complications, procedure time (PT), fluoroscopy time (FT), dose-area product (DAP) and procedure-related complications were documented. Additionally, the radiation dose was compared between obese (body mass index >= 30 kg/m(2)) and non-obese patients., RESULTS: Bilateral RDN was performed in 50/53 (94 %) cases and with a minimum of 4 ablations per artery in 33/50 (66 %), the mean count being 5.4 (range R: 2 - 13) on the right and 4.3 (R: 1 - 10) on the left. The FT and DAP decreased significantly over the first 12 procedures, reaching a steady state with a median FT of 11.2 min (R: 7.5 - 27) and a median DAP of 4796 cGy x cm(2) (R: 1076 - 21 371), resulting in an effective dose of 15.7 mSv. The median PT was 57 min (R: 40 - 70). Obese patients had a 3.3-fold higher radiation dose (p < 0.001). We observed one severe spasm and one imminent respiratory depression, both resolved without sequelae., CONCLUSION: For an experienced interventionalist, RDN has a short learning curve with a low risk profile. The radiation dose does not exceed that of other renal artery interventions, but is explicitly higher in obese patients, who account for a large portion of patients with refractory hypertension.

4525,"Treatment response in glass vs resin radioembolization of nonresectable hepatic metastasis Purpose: To compare treatment response between glass and resin yttrium-90 (90Y) microsphere radioembolization of hepatic metastasis from colorectal and other systemic malignancies. Material(s) and Method(s): A retrospective analysis was performed on 70 patients with hepatic metastasis treated with glass or resin 90Y radioembolization from 2008 to 2014 at an academic medical center. Up to 2 treated lesions per lobe were measured using cross-sectional imaging in the X, Y, and Z planes at baseline and at 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month intervals. Response was evaluated using the World Health Organization (WHO) and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria. Result(s): A total of 70 patients were evaluated with 39 (56%) receiving resin and 31 (44%) receiving glass particles. Of those, 34 (49%) patients had metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with a mean MELD score of 8.5 (SD 2.1), and 36 (51%) had other primary malignancies with a mean MELD score of 7.7 (SD 1.7). Thirty-seven (53%) patients were female with a mean age of 59.7 years (SD 12.3) at treatment 1. Patients received an average radiation dose of 1.12 gigabecquerel (GBq) (SD 0.33) with resin treatments, compared to 3.08 GBq (SD 1.09) with glass treatments. Evaluation of (Table presented) tumor response using WHO criteria found 1 (2.6%) patient had a complete response (CR), 13 (33.3%) had partial responses (PR), 19 (48.7%) had stable disease (SD), and 6 (15.4%) had progressive disease (PD) when treated with resin particles, and 0 (0.0%) had CR, 5 (16.1%) had PR, 21 (67.7%) had SD, and 5 (16.1%) had PD when treated with glass particles. RECIST 1.1 response criteria demonstrated 1 (2.6%) patient had CR, 13 (33.3%) had PR, 18 (46.2%) had SD, and 7 (17.9%) had PD when treated with resin, and 0 (0.0%) had CR, 7 (22.6%) had PR, 19 (61.3%) had SD, and 5 (16.1%) had PD when treated with glass (Table 1). Due to small sample sizes, we were unable to perform formal significance testing on the distribution of response by treatment type. Conclusion(s): Although both glass and resin 90Y microspheres are efficacious treatments for nonresectable metastatic hepatic disease, there is limited data on direct comparison of imaging response between the 2 treatment types. Our study demonstrates that resin-based 90Y therapy offers a comparable response when compared to glassbased 90Y therapy at nearly one-third the dose of radiation.",Excluded

Method(s): After ethics approval, consecutive patients with persistent or relapsed GD who underwent bilateral US-guided HIFU ablation from 2016 to 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. Altogether, 75 patients received HIFU ablation of the central portion of the right and left thyroid lobes with areas near the trachea-esophageal groove and common carotid artery un-ablated. They were followed for 24 months or longer. Baseline thyrotropin (TSH), free T4, anti-thyroid autoantibodies, and TSH receptor (TSHR) antibody were checked. Primary outcome was the 24-month relapse rate. Relapse referred to hyperthyroidism (free T4 (FT4) > 23 pmol/L) afterwards. Variables associated with relapse were analyzed by binary logistic regression. Result(s): The cohort comprised mostly females (84.0%) with a mean age of 42.05 +/- 10.74 years. The 24-month relapse rate was 41.3% with 31 patients suffering a relapse. No patient suffered from hypothyroidism. Three patients (4.0%) suffered from temporary vocal cord palsy but these injuries recovered spontaneously after 2 months. In univariate analysis, higher daily dose of carbimazole (OR = 1.125, 95% CI = 1.023-1.237, p = 0.015) and higher baseline TSHR level (OR = 1.085, 95% CI = 1.022-1.152, p = 0.007) were significant factors for disease relapse. In the multivariate analysis, higher baseline TSHR level was a significant independent factor for disease relapse within 24 months (OR = 1.079, 95% CI = 1.014-1.148, p = 0.016). Conclusion(s): US-guided HIFU of the thyroid gland was a safe and relatively efficacious treatment in the longer term for patients with persistent or relapsed GD. Key Points: * US-guided HIFU ablation is relatively efficacious in the longer term. * US-guided HIFU ablation of the thyroid is safe. * Higher TSHR level may lead to higher disease relapse after treatment.Copyright Â© 2019, European Society of Radiology.",Excluded
4879,"Intraoperative radiotherapy for parotid cancer: A single-institution experience Purpose: Our practice policy has been to provide intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) at resection to patients with head-and-neck malignancies considered to be at high risk of recurrence. The purpose of the present study was to review our experience with the use of IORT for primary or recurrent cancer of the parotid gland. Methods and Materials: Between 1982 and 2007, 96 patients were treated with gross total resection and IORT for primary or recurrent cancer of the parotid gland. The median age was 62.9 years (range, 14.3-88.1). Of the 96 patients, 33 had previously undergone external beam radiotherapy as a component of definitive therapy. Also, 34 patients had positive margins after surgery, and 40 had perineural invasion. IORT was administered as a single fraction of 15 or 20 Gy with 4-6-MeV electrons. The median follow-up period was 5.6 years. Result(s): Only 1 patient experienced local recurrence, 19 developed regional recurrence, and 12 distant recurrence. The recurrence-free survival rate at 1, 3, and 5 years was 82.0%, 68.5%, and 65.2%, respectively. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rate after surgery and IORT was 88.4%, 66.1%, and 56.2%, respectively. No perioperative fatalities occurred. Complications developed in 26 patients and included vascular complications in 7, trismus in 6, fistulas in 4, radiation osteonecrosis in 4, flap necrosis in 2, wound dehiscence in 2, and neuropathy in 1. Of these 26 patients, 12 had recurrent disease, and 8 had undergone external beam radiotherapy before IORT. Conclusion(s): IORT results in effective local disease control at acceptable levels of toxicity and should be considered for patients with primary or recurrent cancer of the parotid gland.

4049,"Dose-dependent expression of CLIP2 in post-Chernobyl papillary thyroid carcinomas A previous study on papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) in young patients who were exposed to 131iodine from the Chernobyl fallout revealed an exclusive gain of chromosomal band 7q11.23 in exposed cases compared to an age-matched control cohort. CLIP2, a gene located within band 7q11.23 was shown to be differentially expressed between exposed and non-exposed cases at messenger RNA and protein level. Therefore, a standardized procedure for CLIP2 typing of PTCs has been developed in a follow-up study. Here we used CLIP2 typing data on 117 post-Chernobyl PTCs from two cohorts of exposed patients with individual dose estimates and 24 non-exposed controls to investigate a possible quantitative dose-response relationship of the CLIP2 marker. The 'Genrisk-T' cohort consisted of 45 PTCs and the 'UkrAm' cohort of 72 PTCs. Both cohorts differed in mean dose (0.59 Gy Genrisk-T, 1.2 Gy UkrAm) and mean age at exposure (AaE) (2 years Genrisk-T, 8 years UkrAm), whilst the median latency (16 years Genrisk-T, 18 years UkrAm) was comparable. We analyzed the association between the binary CLIP2 typing and continuous thyroid dose with logistic regression. A clear positive dose-response relationship was found for young PTC cases [age at operation (AaO) < 20 years, AaE < 5 years]. In the elder age group a higher proportion of sporadic tumors is assumed due to a negligible dose response, suggesting different molecular mechanisms in sporadic and radiation-induced cases. This is further supported by the association of elder patients (AaO > 20 years) with positivity for BRAF V600E mutation.Copyright Â© The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press.

4404,"Phase II clinical trial of preoperative combined chemoradiation for T3 and T4 resectable rectal cancer: preliminary results PURPOSE: Although preoperative chemoradiation for high-risk rectal cancer may improve survival and local recurrence rate, its adverse effects are not well defined. This prospective study evaluated the use of preoperative chemoradiation for T3 and T4 resectable rectal cancer, with special emphasis on treatment morbidity, pathologic remission rate, quality of life, and anorectal function., METHODS: Forty-two patients (30 men, 12 women) were enrolled in the study. Median distance of the distal tumor margin from the anal verge was 6.5 cm. Preoperative staging was based on digital rectal examination, endorectal ultrasound, and computed tomography. None of the patients had distant metastases. All patients had 45 Gy (1.8 Gy/day in 25 fractions) over five weeks, plus 5-fluorouracil (350 mg/m(2)/day) and leucovorin (20 mg/m(2)/day) bolus on days 1 to 5 and 29 to 33. Quality of life was assessed with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 30-item quality-of-life questionnaire (QLQ-C30) and its colorectal cancer-specific module (QLQ-CR38) questionnaires. Objective anorectal function was assessed by anorectal manometry and pudendal nerve terminal motor latency. Surgery was performed 46 (range, 24-63) days after completion of adjuvant therapy., RESULTS: Nineteen patients (45 percent) had Grade 3 or 4 chemoradiation-induced toxic reactions. Four patients developed intercurrent distant metastases or intraperitoneal carcinomatosis at completion of chemoradiation. Thirty-eight patients underwent surgical resection: abdominoperineal resection, anterior resection, and Hartmann's procedure were performed in 55 percent, 39 percent (11 of 15 patients had a diverting stoma), and 5 percent, respectively. Major surgical complications occurred in 7 patients (18 percent) and included anastomotic leak (n = 1), pelvic abscess (n = 1), small-bowel obstruction (n = 3), and wound breakdown (n = 2). Final pathology was Stage 0 (no residual disease), I, II, and III in 6 (16 percent), 7 (18 percent), 9 (24 percent), and 16 (42 percent) patients, respectively. There was a deterioration, after chemoradiation and surgery, in the quality of life on all subscales assessed, with physical, role, and social function being most severely affected. The symptoms most adversely affected were micturition, defecation, and gastrointestinal problems. Body image and sexual enjoyment deteriorated in both men and women. Chemoradiation alone led to prolonged pudendal nerve terminal motor latency in 57 percent of 7 patients assessed., CONCLUSION: Preliminary results have identified defined costs with preoperative chemoradiation, which included treatment-induced toxicity, a high stoma rate, and adverse effects on quality of life and anorectal function.",Excluded
4711,"Do persons living near a uranium processing site have evidence of increased somatic cell gene mutations? A first study The objective of this study was to examine if individuals living near a uranium processing site have greater mutagenic damage, as measured by three mutagenicity assays, compared with subjects unexposed to any nuclear facilities. The design was a cross-sectional exploratory analysis of 112 subjects; 56 volunteer residents were from within a 5-mile radius of the Fernald Uranium Processing site and 56 'control' subjects were from a geographically separate area unexposed to any known uranium emissions. The groups were constrained to be similar in age and sex composition. The main outcome measures were three human somatic gene mutation assays consisting of the HPRT T-lymphocyte cloning assay to measure 6-thioguanine resistant lymphocytes; the glycophorin A assay to detect the loss of expression of the M or N allele; and the micronucleus assay as a marker of chromosomal damage. The results showed no statistically significant or quantitatively important differences between groups for all three mutagenicity assays; only the unselected cloning efficiency was statistically significantly different between groups (0.42 +/- 0.16 for the Fernald versus 0.35 +/- 0.12 for the comparison groups). In both groups, age was significantly related to HPRT mutant frequency, with a 1.25% rate of increase in mutant frequencies for each 1-year gain of age in the Fernald group and a 1.12% rate of increase in mutant frequencies for each 1-year gain of age in the comparison group. For the micronucleus data, females had a greater mean micronucleus frequency than males. In addition, smokers had an increased mean ln (natural logarithm) HPRT mutant frequency (3.06 +/- 0.14 for current smokers compared with a mean of 2.72 +/- 0.05 for non-current (i.e. never plus former) smokers). Our results are consistent with the previously reported association between sex type and micronucleus frequency, the known relationship between age and T-lymphocyte cloning efficiency and age and HPRT mutant frequency, and verify the wide inter-subject variability for the latter. Finally, we conclude that at a population level, the relationships between current cigarette use and HPRT mutant frequency, and sex type and micronucleus frequency, are stronger than is the association between geographic proximity to a uranium processing site and mutagenic abnormalities.",Included
4648,"A Bioadhesive Barrier-Forming Oral Liquid Gel Improved Oral Mucositis and Nutritional Status in Patients With Head and Neck Cancers Undergoing Radiotherapy: A Retrospective Single Center Study Background: Episil is a bioadhesive barrier-forming oral liquid gel that can relieve oral mucositis (OM) caused by radiotherapy (RT) and hence relieves pain effectively. In this study, we observed the effects of Episil on the OM and nutritional status of patients with head and neck cancers (HNCs) undergoing RT. Method(s): A total of 50 HNC patients were divided into the Episil (25 patients) and control (25 patients) groups. Patients in the Episil group were sprayed with Episil. In the control group, the kangfuxin solution or KangsuTM oral gargle was used. Medical staff assessed the OM extent and timing as well as the nutritional status during treatment and recorded adverse reactions other than OM. The nutritional status assessment included the following indicators: Patient Generated-Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) score, body mass index (BMI), body weight, albumin levels, and other hematological indicators. Result(s): The incidence of high-level OM (III-IV) after RT was lower in the Episil group than in the control group (P < 0.05). Nutritional status assessments showed that the Episil group had a lower percentage of weight loss than the control group at weeks 4 and 7 after RT. Similar results were also obtained for BMI and albumin levels (P < 0.05). Moreover, according to PG-SGA scores, fewer patients in the Episil group were malnourished and more patients were well-nourished (P < 0.05) compared with the control group. Conclusion(s): Episil effectively improved OM and malnutrition in HNC patients who received RT and has a good clinical application value.Â© Copyright Â© 2021 Wei, Wu, Wang, Wang, Zhao, Meng, Dong and Jiang.",Excluded

Patients and Methods Patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC, performance status of 0 to 1, and adequate organ function were accrued in 2 strata, low- and high-risk (squamous histology, hemoptysis, tumor with cavitation and/or adjacent to a major vessel). Cohort 1 patients received cisplatin 50 mg/m2 days (d) 1 and 8, etoposide 50 mg/m2 (d 1-5) for 2 cycles concurrent with radiotherapy (64.8 Gy) followed by docetaxel (D) 75 mg/m2 and B 15 mg/kg for 3 cycles. If safety was established, then accrual would continue to cohort 2 (B, d 15, 36, 57) and then subsequently to cohort 3 (B, d 1, 22, 43). Results Twenty-nine patients (17 low- and 12 high-risk) registered to cohort 1. Twenty-six patients (including 4 squamous, 1 adenosquamous) were assessable. Twenty-five completed CRT. Grade 3/4 toxicities during CRT included acceptable rates of hematologic toxicity, esophagitis, and pneumonitis. Of 21 assessable for safety with D/B consolidation, major adverse events were pneumonitis (2 Grade 3) and 2 episodes of fatal hemoptysis in the high-risk group, resulting in closure of this stratum. The low-risk stratum subsequently closed because of slow accrual. Median overall survival was 46 months for low-risk and 17 months for high-risk strata. Conclusion Bevacizumab was not safely integrated into CRT for stage III NSCLC in patients considered at high risk for hemoptysis. In lower risk patients, data are insufficient to determine safety or efficacy.Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

We randomized 50 patients with primary knee osteoarthritis into 2 groups. We used CT scan axial images to measure the PCA. In the first group we followed the CT scan plan (group 1), but in the second we did not follow the plan and adjusted rotation to the standard three degrees (group 2). The mean age of the included patients was 63 years. The radiological data of the included patients showed 5 patients with valgus deformity and 45 patients with varus deformity with the mean coronal alignment of 7.5 degrees. CT scan showed the mean PCA of 3.7 degrees (1.3 degrees). The axial knee postoperative X-ray showed the mean patellar tilt angle of 2.1 degrees (0.5 degrees) and 1.9 degrees (0.5 degrees) in groups 1 and 2, respectively. The congruence angle was 4 degrees (2.6 degrees) in group 1 and 5.5 degrees (3.2 degrees) in group 2.

4832,"Radiation-dose response of glycophorin A somatic mutation in erythrocytes associated with gene polymorphisms of p53 binding protein 1 Information on individual variations in response to ionizing radiation is still quite limited. Previous studies of atomic-bomb survivors revealed that somatic mutations at the glycophorin A (GPA) gene locus in erythrocytes were significantly elevated with radiation exposure dose, and that the dose response was significantly higher in survivors with subsequent cancer development compared to those without cancer development. Noteworthy in these studies were great inter-individual differences in GPA mutant fraction even in persons with similar radiation doses. It is hypothesized that persistent GPA mutations in erythrocytes of atomic-bomb survivors are derived from those in long-lived hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) populations, and that individual genetic backgrounds, specifically related to DNA double-strand break repair, contribute to individual differences in HSC mutability following radiation exposure. Thus, we examined the relationship between radiation exposure, GPA mutant fraction in erythrocytes, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the key gene involved in DNA double-strand break repair, p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1). 53BP1 SNPs and inferred haplotypes demonstrated a significant interaction with radiation dose, suggesting that radiation-dose response of GPA somatic mutation is partly dependent on 53BP1 genotype. It is also possible that 53BP1 plays a significant role in DNA double-strand break repair in HSCs following radiation exposure. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded
4930,"Cerebellar modulation of feeding-related neurons in rat dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus Cerebellum has newly been implicated in many more nonsomatic functions other than motor control. Previous studies indicate that the cerebellum is involved in feeding regulation and that the gastric vagal nerves transmit short-term meal-related visceral signals, including cholecystokinin (CCK), into the hypothalamus. Recently, the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMN) has been thought to play an important role in feeding control. Here we investigate whether the inputs from cerebellar interpositus nucleus (IN) can reach and converge onto single DMN neurons with some feeding-related visceral signals, including gastric vagal inputs, CCK, and blood glucose, whose concentration is closely linked to food intake. Among the 259 DMN neurons recorded, 120 (46.3%) and 169 (65.3%) responded to the cerebellar IN and gastric vagal stimulations, respectively. Within the 120 DMN neurons responsive to the cerebellar IN stimulation, 98 (81.7%) also responded to the gastric vagal stimulus, and a summation of the responses was observed further (n = 20), suggesting a convergence and interaction of cerebellar and gastric vagal inputs on the cells. Moreover, among the 98 cells receiving convergent inputs from cerebellar IN and gastric vagal nerves, 69 (70.4%) were identified to be glycemia sensitive, and 22 (68.8%) of the 32 tested neurons were also sensitive to systemic CCK. These results demonstrate that the DMN integrates somatic information forwarded by the cerebellar IN and visceral signals related to food intake, including gastric vagal, CCK and glycemia, and electrophysiologically reveal a novel cerebellohypothalamic IN-DMN pathway through which the cerebellum may actively participate in short-term feeding regulation.",Excluded

The patients were exposed to therapeutic plasmapheresis and enterosorption as part of a complex conventional treatment programme. The conclusion the authors have come to is as follows: enterosorption strikingly reduces manifestations of ""cytostatic disease""; the use of plasmapheresis in those persons having been previously exposed to small dose chronic radiation, makes for improvement of clinical and laboratory values but further studies are warranted to determine indications for therapeutic plasmapheresis.",Excluded

4086,"A Small Peptide Ac-SDKP Inhibits Radiation-Induced Cardiomyopathy BACKGROUND: Advances in radiotherapy for thoracic cancers have resulted in improvement of survival. However, radiation exposure to the heart can induce cardiotoxicity. No therapy is currently available to inhibit these untoward effects. We examined whether a small tetrapeptide, N-acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro (Ac-SDKP), can counteract radiation-induced cardiotoxicity by inhibiting macrophage-dependent inflammatory and fibrotic pathways. METHODS AND RESULTS: After characterizing a rat model of cardiac irradiation with magnetic resonance imaging protocols, we examined the effects of Ac-SDKP in radiation-induced cardiomyopathy. We treated rats with Ac-SDKP for 18 weeks. We then compared myocardial contractile function and extracellular matrix by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and the extent of inflammation, fibrosis, and Mac-2 (galectin-3) release by tissue analyses. Because Mac-2 is a crucial macrophage-derived mediator of fibrosis, we performed studies to determine Mac-2 synthesis by macrophages in response to radiation, and change in profibrotic responses by Mac-2 gene depleted cardiac fibroblasts after radiation. Cardiac irradiation diminished myocardial contractile velocities and enhanced extracellular matrix deposition. This was accompanied by macrophage infiltration, fibrosis, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and cardiac Mac-2 expression. Ac-SDKP strongly inhibited these detrimental effects. Ac-SDKP migrated into the perinuclear cytoplasm of the macrophages and inhibited radiation-induced Mac-2 release. Cardiac fibroblasts lacking the Mac-2 gene showed reduced transforming growth factor beta1, collagen I, and collagen III expression after radiation exposure. CONCLUSION(S): Our study identifies novel cardioprotective effects of Ac-SDKP in a model of cardiac irradiation. These protective effects are exerted by inhibiting inflammation, fibrosis, and reducing macrophage activation. This study shows a therapeutic potential of this endogenously released peptide to counteract radiation-induced cardiomyopathy.",Excluded
4476,"Balloon kyphoplasty under three-dimensional radiography guidance Percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty (PBKP) is generally performed under two-dimensional (2D) radiography guidance (lateral- and anteroposterior (A-P) views) using C-arm fluoroscopy. However, 2D images taken by single-plane or bi-plane fluoroscopy cannot provide information regarding axial views, particularly the Z axis. Lack of information regarding the Z axis prevents the creation of three-dimensional (3D) images. Currently, there has been a progress in interventional X-ray systems, and they are capable of providing 3D radiographic images using a rotational angiography mode which is used to create 3D angiographies. In this report, we described the usefulness of 3D radiography guidance. Patients treated by PBKP was designed to evaluate the efficacy of 3D radiography guidance. These patients experienced osteoporotic vertebral fractures with severe pain. We retrospectively analyzed patients who underwent PBKP from February to December 2016. All patients had a single-level vertebral fracture and underwent surgery by 2D or 3D radiography guidance. We performed 16 patients in 3D radiography guidance, and 10 patients in traditional 2D radiography guidance. This 3D radiography guided PBKP increase the amount of the polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) injection compared with ordinary 2D method. As a result, postoperative vertebral height and alignment were significantly improved. Both groups have no complication. To confirm the final results and make PBKP more effective, 3D radiography guidance is feasible and safe for balloon kyphoplasty.Copyright Â© 2017 by The Japan Neurosurgical Society.",Excluded

The maximum eye lens dose of 1492 mGy was measured at LOC region for an AVM case, followed by 907 mGy for an aneurysm case and 665 mGy for a diagnostic angiography procedure. Strong correlations (shown as R(2)) were observed between kerma-area-product and measured eye doses (LOC: 0.78, LE: 0.68). Lateral and frontal air-kerma showed strong correlations with measured dose at LOC (AKL: 0.93, AKF: 0.78) and a weak correlation with measured dose at LE. A moderate correlation was observed between fluoroscopic time and dose measured at LE and LOC regions., CONCLUSIONS: The MOSkin dose-monitoring system represents a new tool enabling real-time monitoring of eye lens dose during neuro-interventional procedures.

4159,"Meal replacement in isolated and confined mission environments: Consumption, acceptability, and implications for physical and behavioral health Strategies that reduce food system mass without negatively impacting food intake, acceptability, and resulting astronaut health and performance are essential for mission success in extreme operational environments such as space exploration. Here, we report the impact of substituting the spaceflight standard breakfast with energy equivalent, calorically-dense meal replacement bars (MRBs) on consumption, acceptability, and satiety and on associations with physical and behavioral health outcomes in high-performing subjects completing 30-day missions in the isolated and confined operational environment of NASA's Human Exploration Research Analog (HERA) habitat. MRB implementation was associated with reduced daily caloric intake, weight loss, and decrements in mood and neurobehavioral functioning, with no significant impacts on somatic symptoms and physical functioning. Food acceptability ratings suggest that flavor, texture, and menu fatigue attributed to limited variety are contributing factors, which are exacerbated by a daily implementation schedule. Meal replacement strategies for short-duration missions are operationally feasible, moderately acceptable, and can contribute to the practical goal of mass reduction, but more work is needed to define and optimize flavors, variety, and implementation schedules that sustain adequate nutrition, physical and behavioral health, and operational performance over time in isolated, confined, and extreme mission environments.Copyright Â© 2020",Excluded
4945,"[The aqueous humour antioxidative capacity in different types and color of the age-related cataract] BACKGROUND/AIM: Oxidative stress results from increased oxidative processes, decreased antioxidative protection, or both processes simultaneously. Photooxidative stress, as a form of oxidative stress, induced by the energy of solar radiation, today is considered as crucial in the age-related cataractogenesis. Other known and unknown, endogenous and egsogenous factors that contribute to the oxidative stress intensity, can influnce the cataract type and brunescence. Thus the oxidative stress intensity and its form might determine the cataract type and brunescence, and also make the efforts in cataract prevention more complex. Hence, the objective of the present paper was to investigate the current amount of antioxidative capacity in aqueous humour during the cataract genesis of different types and pigmentation of cataract., METHODS: Transversal review of 80 samples of humour aqueous obtained during extracapsular cataract extraction. Aqueouses were analyzed by tiobarbituric acid (TBA) method for the total antioxidant activity estimation, expressed as %iMDA, and by using 0.1 ml of aqueous., RESULTS: The mixed type of cataract showed the statistically significantly lower values of the intensities of antioxidative protection in aqueous humour compared to cortical and nuclear cataracts (p < 0.001, respectively). Between pure nuclear and cortical cataracts we found the small differences of the investigated parameter, but they pointed to the decreased level of antioxidative protection, i.e. the increased intensity of the aqueous humour oxidative stress in the cortical cataract type. A significant correlation betweer the cortical cataract maturation and the %iMDA (p < 0.05) was found., CONCLUSIONS: The role of the oxidative stress, here expressed as the antioxidative capacity of aqueous humour, could not be the same for all the cataract types. The lower level of antioxidative protection of aqueous in brunescent and mixed cataracts may point to the higher intensity of oxidative stress in those cataract types. The correlation betweer the cortical cataract maturity and %iMDA points to the significant decrease of the aqueous antioxidative protection in the cataract progression.",Excluded

The aim of this study was to determine dose-volume histogram parameters and other factors that predict renal atrophy after 10-fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for primary renal cell carcinoma (RCC)., METHODS: A total of 14 patients (11 males, 3 females) who received SBRT for RCC at Tohoku University Hospital between April 2010 and February 2014 were analyzed. The median serum creatinine level was 1.1 mg/dl and two patients had a single kidney. Nine patients were implanted with fiducial markers. The median tumor diameter was 30 mm. SBRT was delivered at 70 Gy in 10 fractions for 7 tumors, at 60 Gy in 10 fractions for 2 tumors, and at 50 Gy in 10 fractions for 5 tumors with 6 and/or 15 MV X-ray using 5 to 8 multi-static beams. Renal atrophy was assessed using post-SBRT CT images after 12-24 months intervals. Correlations were examined by Spearman rank correlation analysis. Differences between two groups were evaluated by the Mann-Whitney test, and pairwise comparisons were made by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test., RESULTS: The median tumor volume shrunk from 14.8 cc to 10.6 cc (p = 0.12), and the median irradiated kidney volume changed from 160.4 cc to 137.1 cc (p < .01). The median peak creatinine level was 1.6 mg/dl after treatment (p < .01). Percentage volumes of the irradiated kidney receiving at least 10 Gy (V10, p = 0.03), V20 (p < .01), V30(p < .01), V40 (p = 0.01), mean irradiated kidney dose (p < .01), and magnitude of overlap between PTV and kidney volume (p = 0.03) were significantly correlated with post-treatment irradiated kidney volume in percent, and V20-V30 had strong correlation (r < -0.70, p < .01). Patients with implanted fiducial markers showed a significantly lower ratio of renal atrophy (p = 0.02)., CONCLUSIONS: Significant renal atrophic change was observed.

4517,"Polarization Variability in Age-related Macular Degeneration SIGNIFICANCE: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of irreversible vision loss. Complementary imaging techniques can be used to better characterize and quantify pathological changes associated with AMD. By assessing specific light-tissue interactions, polarization-sensitive imaging can be used to detect tissue disruption early in the disease process., PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare variability in central macular polarization properties in patients with nonexudative AMD and age-matched control subjects., METHODS: A scanning laser polarimeter (GDx, LDT/CZM) was used to acquire 15 x 15-degree macular images in 10 subjects diagnosed with nonexudative AMD and 10 age-matched control subjects. The coefficient of variation (COV, SD/mean) was used to quantify variability in pixel intensity in the central 3.3degree of the macula for custom images emphasizing multiply scattered light (the depolarized light image) and polarization-retaining light (the maximum of the parallel detector image). The intensity COV was compared across subject categories using paired t tests for each image type., RESULTS: The COV in the central macula was significantly higher in the AMD subject group (average, 0.221; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.157 to 0.265) when compared with matched control subjects (average 0.120; 95% CI, 0.107 to 0.133) in the depolarized light image (P = .01). The COV in the maximum of the parallel detector image was not statistically different between the two subject groups (AMD average, 0.162 [95% CI, 0.138 to 0.185]; control average, 0.137 [95% CI, 0.115 to 0.158]; P = .21)., CONCLUSIONS: Variability in multiply scattered light is higher than that of light that is more polarization preserving in patients with nonexudative AMD.

4385,"Inter-laboratory comparison of cytogenetic endpoints for the biomonitoring of radiological workers Purpose: The evaluation of different cytogenetic endpoints of radiation damage for the biomonitoring of contract workers temporarily employed at nuclear power plants. Material(s) and Method(s): Blood samples from six donors were irradiated in vitro with doses ranging from 0.1 to 2 Gy 60Co gamma-rays. Compared were a conventional analysis for dicentrics, the conventional micronucleus (MN) assay, the centromere micronucleus assay using p82H and an alphaAllCen pancentromeric probe, and tricolour FISH with chromosome 2, 4 and 8 DNA probes for the scoring of translocations. Result(s): Agreement in the number of MN between Giemsa-and propidium iodine fluorescence-stained preparations was obtained. The control samples showed higher centromere positivity for the MN after FISH with the p82H probe compared with the alphaAllCen probe. The MN results with both probes showed a slight but systematic increase in the number of centromere-positive MN with dose, indicating that radiation, although principally clastogenic, also has aneuploidogenic properties. The values of the genomic translocation frequency (F(G)) derived from the observed translocation frequencies were systematically higher than the dicentric yields. Comparing the sensitivity of the different methods with restriction of the scoring time to 1 day for biomonitoring purposes, the centromere micronucleus assay had the lowest dose detection limit (0.1 to 0.2 Gy).

The purpose of this retrospective study is to evaluate the clinical outcomes of definitive chemoradiotherapy using carboplatin and paclitaxel. Medical records were reviewed of patients treated for nonmetastatic squamous cell or adenocarcinoma of the esophagus between January 2009 and December 2013 in two collaborating institutes. Treatment consisted of external beam radiotherapy (28 fractions of 1.8 Gy) and 6 weekly courses of carboplatin (AUC = 2) and paclitaxel (50 mg/m2). Data on survival, progression, toxicity, and effect on dysphagia were recorded. Sixty-six patients were included. Median overall survival (OS) was 13.1 months (95% CI 4.7-21.5 months) and a 2-year OS was 30% (95% CI 18%-42%). At 2 years, 26% of patients developed local progression (95% CI 15%-37%) and 49% developed distant metastases (95% CI 36%-64%). Acute toxicity grade >=3 was observed in 47% of patients. Late adverse events grade >=3 were seen in 20%, mostly esophageal stenoses. Of patients with available data 3 months after treatment, 70% had relief of dysphagia. Definitive chemoradiotherapy led to a median OS of 13 months. Toxicity was common, mostly due to hematological toxicity. Given the relatively short median survival, an adequate selection of patients for this intensive treatment is required.Copyright Â© The Authors 2017.

Previously, we have shown the efficacy of individualized dose escalation based on normal tissue constraints in sequential chemo-radiation (van Baardwijk et al, J Clin Oncol 2010). Here, we report the mature results of a Phase II trial (NCT00572325) on individualized radiation dose-escalation in concurrent chemo-radiation. Materials/Methods: Stage III NSCLC patients fit for concurrent chemo-radiation (PS 0-2; FEV1 and DLCO >30%) were included. An individualized prescribed total tumor dose (TTD) based on normal tissue dose constraints was applied: mean lung dose (MLD) 19 Gy, spinal cord dose 54 Gy and brachial plexus dose 66 Gy. RT planning was 4D-PET-CT based. ATTD between 51 and 69 Gy was delivered in 1.5 Gy fractions twice daily up to 45 Gy, followed by once daily fractions of 2 Gy. Radiotherapy (RT) was started at the second course of chemotherapy. OS and Progression Free Survival (PFS) were calculated from date of diagnosis (Kaplan-Meier). Toxicity was scored according to CTCAE v 3.0. Result(s): One hundred fifty patients (97 men and 53 women, median age 63.2 years) were included from April 2006 until December 2009. Stage: IIB 0.7%, IIIA 34.7%, IIIB 64.6%, including 7 patients (9.7%) with recurrent disease. Median total GTV (+/- SD, range): 73.9 +/- 91.3 cc (3.7-518.9 cc). Median TTD was 65.0 +/- 5.9 Gy (51-69.0 Gy) given in an OTTof 35 days (equals a scheme of 74 Gy in 37 fractions QD in 7.4 weeks). The median MLD was 16.3 +/- 3.7 Gy (4.4-21.0 Gy). Six patients (4.0%) did not complete radiotherapy (3 due to toxicity, 3 patient's wish). Severe acute toxicity (>=Grade 3, n = 51, 34.0%) consisted mainly of Grade 3 dysphagia during RT (24.0%) and 1 month after RT (6.0%). Pulmonary complaints were less frequent: Grade 3 and 4 dyspnea resp. 2.7% and 0.7% and 8.7% Grade 3 cough.With regard to late toxicity: 4% Grade 3 dysphagia (e.g., stenosis/ulcus), 2% thoracic empyema or fistula and 1 patient died of a radiation pneumonitis (0.7%). Five patients (3.3%) died within 3 months after start of RT (pulmonary causes n = 2; sepsis n = 1; cardiomyopathy n = 1; unknown cause n = 1).With a median FU of 29.4 months (95% CI 26.1-32.6 months), the median OS was 24.2 months (95% CI 18.9-29.6 months; 2year OS 51.5%) and the median PFS 16.5 months (95% CI 11.9-21.1 months).

3775,"Incidental findings detection using low tube potential for CT pulmonary angiography While lowering the radiation dose using a reduced tube potential (kVp) strategy for CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) maintains accuracy for pulmonary embolism detection, there is no data regarding the effect of increased noise from lower kVp on both the accuracy of lung and mediastinum lesion detection in the same patient cohort. This study compares the accuracy and diagnostic confidence of lung nodules and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes detection between low and standard kVp CTPA. The study cohort included 272 CTPA studies acquired at low kVp and 274 studies at standard kVp. Each patient had a routine chest CT acquired within 60 days of the CTPA that served as a reference standard for lung and mediastinum lesions. In additional to the evaluation of image quality, two radiologists independently interpreted lung nodules and mediastinal lymph nodes on CTPA and recorded confidence level for each interpretation. Multivariate models assessed effect of kVp settings on diagnostic accuracy and confidence level in interpretation. Low kVp CTPAs had higher image noise. A significant decrease in the confidence levels for evaluation of mediastinal lymph nodes was observed at low kVp by one of two readers, although there was no significant correlation between accuracy of interpretation and kVp settings for lung and mediastinum lesion detection (adjusted odds ratios = 0.67-1.22, p values >0.2).

3791,"Examination of the optimal temporal resolution required for computed tomography coronary angiography Sub-second multidetector-row computed tomography systems provide great potential for the further improvement of CT coronary angiography (CTCA). However, because the temporal resolution (TR) of such CT systems is insufficient, blurring and artifacts produced by fast cardiac motion remain as unresolved issues. Previous TR investigations of CTCA were based on the retrospective electrocardiogram-gated multisegment reconstruction technique. However, the results obtained may not necessarily be correct because the TR of multisegment reconstruction may not be substantial due to the insufficient periodicity of cardiac motion. The optimal TR required for better CTCA images was evaluated with use of a dual-source CT system, which has various substantial TR modes (83, 125, and 165 ms). CTCA images of 147 patients with heart rates (HRs) ranging from 36 to 117 beats/minute (bpm) were evaluated visually on a 4-point scale. Our results revealed not only that the 165-ms TR is sufficient for low HRs (<=60 bpm), but also that the 83- and 125-ms TRs are unnecessary for such HRs. The image quality with the 125-ms TR mode was acceptable for the left anterior descending artery, left circumflex artery, and right coronary artery at low to intermediate HRs (<=70 bpm). At high HRs (>70 bpm), the 83-ms TR mode resulted in an excellent image quality for all cases except those with very rapid RCA motion. Adequate TRs for a wide range of heart rates (52-106 bpm) are thus clarified. Â© 2013 Japanese Society of Radiological Technology and Japan Society of Medical Physics.",Excluded
4225,"A sentinel case series of cancer patients with occupational exposures to electromagnetic non-ionizing radiation and other agents Background. There are reports that intense prolonged occupational exposure to non-ionizing radiation may increase risks for cancer. We previously have reported a sentinel cluster, of 7 workers with high exposures and short latent periods, and individual patients with brain cancer high occupational exposures and short latent periods. We present a sentinel case series (n=47, 40M, 7F) of cancer patients, referred to our medical unit with occupational exposures to non-ionizing radiation of all types. Objectives. Our aims were to report the findings on tumour types, age of first diagnosis, and latency, to describe their exposures and to examine the hypothesis that latencies for all tumour types (solid tissue, hematolymphatic, testicular) were coherently related to high occupational exposures starting at young ages. Methods. We divided the patients into groups by latency. We categorized each patient's exposures in regard to types of radiation, far or near field exposure and direct body contact. For some we had data on frequencies, for others we provided assessments. We also present the patient data categorized by age of diagnosis.We used a case-case type comparison to examine latencies for tumour types [solid, hematolymphatic (HL), testicular]. Results. 15 patients developed cancer with latent periods of less than 5 years and 12 patients with latent periods between 5 and 10 years. The remaining 20 patients had longer latent periods between first occupational exposure to EMF and diagnosis of cancer. 6 patients (12.7%) had multiple tumours. 12 patients (25.5%) reported cancer cases in co-workers. In the <5 years latency group there were 8 hematolymphatic cancers, 3 testicular cancers and 6 solid tumours [head & neck (including brain) and GI tract]. In all latency groups there were patients who were exposed to intense levels of electromagnetic fields (EMF), to several types of EMF, or to EMF in combination with ionizing radiation (IR) or other exposures, and patients who had direct body contact with the equipment, were in direct focus of high radiation, or worked in small, electronically dense environments. Case classification by age showed shorter latencies with younger ages, but this association is complicated by the fact that shorter latencies co-vary with younger ages especially for testicular tumours. But patients with testicular and hematolymphatic tumours had shorter latencies than those with solid tumours. Conclusion. Many of the patients were young and had extremely short latent periods, especially for HL and testicular cancers. The fact that latent periods for testes were very short, HL longer and solid still longer suggests a coherent and biologically plausible pattern of latency in relation to the onset of exposure to EMF and other agents. The findings strengthen the hypothesis that these exposures may possibly be the major cause of many of these tumours. The findings state the case for (1) better modelling of exposure sources and penetration into the body and (2) preventive and protective measures based on control of exposure at source, barriers, and personal protection.",Excluded

This surgical technique compared to the traditional fusion techniques allows to preserve lumbar spine mobility reducing the risk of an adjacent segment disease. Aim of the study was to analyze in a retrospective way patients who underwent direct repair for isthmic spondylolysis in order to evaluate the onset of degenerative diseases or of a vertebral slippage worsening at long-term follow-up. Method(s): From 1996 to 2003 45 patients, 32 males and 13 females, underwent isthmic direct repair. Inclusion criteria were: low grade spondilolysthesis, age ranged between 11 and 25 years, low back pain from at least 6 months and resistant to conservative treatment, no degenerative diseases at the involved and adjacent level. Radiographic evaluation was performed with pre-operative lumbar x-ray and MRI and post-operative lumbar x-ray at regular intervals. In all patients the grade of degeneration at the treated and adjacent level was evaluated with the UCLA classification; the presence of an instability and the spinopelvic harmony value were also evaluated. Result(s): Median age was of 15 years (range 11-25). Median follow-up was of 12 years (10-16). Good clinical outcome was observed in the 98 % of the patients, in 2 patients an hardware failure which requested a surgical revision with a traditional fusion was observed, in 1 patient a spondylodiscitis involving the adjacent level was observed at 7 years follow-up. Radiographic analysis showed no worsening of the vertebral slippage, a complete fusion of the lysis in the 94 % of patients, no bone resorption, no statistically significant variation in the spinopelvic harmony value, a one grade worsening of the UCLA classification value only in the 10 % of patients. In these patients a concomitant alteration of the spinopelvic harmony value was observed. Nor the worsening in the UCLA classification grade none the alteration of the spinopelvic harmony influenced the clinical outcome in our series. Conclusion(s): Direct repair is a valid and reliable surgical treatment possibility for lumbar isthmic spondylolysis. Its use allows, in young symptomatic patients, to preserve the motility of the treated level in order to avoid, at over 10 years follow-up, the onset of degenerative changes to the treated and adjacent discs and zygaphofiseal joints, preserving also, a good spinopelvic harmony)over time.",Excluded
4601,"Single-balloon versus double-balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures Twenty-eight patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCF) were treated with single-balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty (Group A), and 40 patients were treated with double-balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty (Group B). Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score, vertebral height, and kyphotic angle (KA) were evaluated pre-operatively, post-operatively (3 days after surgery) and at final follow-up. Operative time, X-ray exposure frequency and costs were recorded. The mean operative time and X-ray exposure frequency in Group A were greater than in Group B (p < 0.05). Significant improvement of the VAS score was noted in each group, and remained unchanged at final follow-up. Mean increases of anterior and middle height of the fractured vertebral body were 5.14 mm and 4.14 mm in Group A, respectively, and 6.22 mm and 5.06 mm in Group B, respectively, and the differences between the groups were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Mean reduction of KA was 6.9degree in Group A and 8.8degree in Group B, which was statistically significant (p < 0.05). No statistically significant difference was observed in terms of cement leakage between groups. The mean cost of Group A (US$4202) was significantly less than that of Group B (US$6220) (p < 0.001). Single-balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty is a safe and cost-effective surgical method for the treatment of OVCF. It can achieve pain relief comparable with double-balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty. However, double-balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty is more efficacious in terms of the restoration of vertebral height and reduction of KA, and the operative time and X-ray exposure frequency are lower.Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

4553,"Clustered Ca2+ Channels Are Blocked by Synaptic Vesicle Proton Release at Mammalian Auditory Ribbon Synapses A Ca2+ current transient block (ICaTB) by protons occurs at some ribbon-type synapses after exocytosis, but this has not been observed at mammalian hair cells. Here we show that a robust ICaTB occurs at post-hearing mouse and gerbil inner hair cell (IHC) synapses, but not in immature IHC synapses, which contain non-compact active zones, where Ca2+ channels are loosely coupled to the release sites. Unlike ICaTB at other ribbon synapses, ICaTB in mammalian IHCs displays a surprising multi-peak structure that mirrors the EPSCs seen in paired recordings. Desynchronizing vesicular release with intracellular BAPTA or by deleting otoferlin, the Ca2+ sensor for exocytosis, greatly reduces ICaTB, whereas enhancing release synchronization by raising Ca2+ influx or temperature increases ICaTB. This suggests that ICaTB is produced by fast multivesicular proton-release events. We propose that ICaTB may function as a submillisecond feedback mechanism contributing to the auditory nerve's fast spike adaptation during sound stimulation., Mature inner hair cells in the cochlea contain compact active zones where clustered Ca2+ channels are tightly coupled to the sites of vesicle fusion. Vincent et al. show that vesicle exocytosis leads to the release of protons into the synaptic cleft, which transiently blocks a subset of Ca2+ channels.Copyright Â© 2018",Excluded
4800,"Radiation effect on unresectable pancreatic carcinoma through 125 I seeds implantation Objective: To investigate the therapeutic effect of 125I particles implantation in the treatment of unresectable pancreatic carcinoma. Method(s): Fifty cases of pancreatic carcinoma were chosen in the trial, 30 of them were treated by 125I seeds implantation accompanied with or without choledoenteroanastomosis and (or) gastrojejunostomy, and 20 cases treated with choas the choledoenteroanastomosis and (or) gastrojejunostomy. The peri-operative hepatic function, serum bilirubin, the size of the tumor, complications and the intensity of pain were observered. Result(s): The total bilirubin decreased to normal level 4 weeks after the operation, while the liver function recovered in the cases of both the groups. Nearly all the 30 of radiotherapy cases (100%) had a perfect remission of the abdominal and back painfulness, and the CR rate was 97%. No obvious complications occurred, and tumor seemed to be smaller then. Conclusion(s): 125I seeds implantation has an obvious therapeutic effect to those cases of unresectable pancreatic carcinoma. It can prolong the survival period, improve the quality of life, and relieve pain obviously.",Excluded
4313,"Mortality Analysis of the Life Span Study (LSS) Cohort Taking into Account Multiple Causes of Death Indicated in Death Certificates Mortality analyses have been performed using underlying causes of death as reported on death certificates; these are uniquely determined for a deceased person according to the World Health Organization coding system. Comorbidities, the disease conditions other than the underlying cause of death from death certificates recording multiple causes of death, have rarely been explored in Life Span Study subjects. The purpose of this study was to clarify associations between atomic bomb radiation exposure and mortality from combinations of the underlying cause of death and comorbidities. The focused follow-up period was 1977-2003, prior to which death certificate accuracy was unreliable. The study cohort was comprised of 10,017 people for whom the category ""all circulatory disease"" was listed as the underlying cause of death, of which heart disease (rheumatic, hypertensive and ischemic heart disease) and stroke were major subtypes. Comorbidities considered were pneumonia, renal disease, diabetes mellitus, cancer and the major circulatory disease subtypes listed above. Poisson regression models were used for analyses. Excess relative risks (ERRs) for mortality at 1 Gy were significantly increased when cancer was comorbid with all circulatory disease, heart disease, ischemic heart disease or stroke, ranging from 0.61 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.13, 1.41; N = 177 for all circulatory diseases to 1.60 (CI: 0.07, 4.86; N = 42) for ischemic heart disease. Among the other comorbidities, only diabetes comorbid with heart disease had a significant radiation dose response (ERR at 1 Gy of 0.62, CI: 0.10, 1.46; N = 128). It remains uncertain if the high ERRs with comorbid cancers were anomalous due to the small number of cases or some dissimilarity in statistical methodologies, or if this might suggest some pathogenetic basis for increased fatality. For this reason, further investigation is required.Copyright Â© 2017 by Radiation Research Society.",Excluded
4009,"Value ofadditional magnetic resonance myocardial perfusion imaging in patients with high calcium score or intermediate stenoses detected by computed tomography coronaryangiography Objectives: Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and cardiac magnetic resonance myocardial perfusion imaging (CMR-MPI) are established diagnostic tools for non-invasive assessment of coronary artery disease (CAD). While CCTA offers highresolution images of coronary anatomy, CMR-MPI is able to give valuable functional information. Aim of this study was to evaluate the burden of myocardial ischemia in patients with intermediate stenosis assessed by CCTA and in patients, which were not eligible to CTA due to high calciumscore or unfavourable calciumplaque location. Method(s): 102 patients with known CAD (n=15) and suspected CAD (n=87) were included at one centre (CCB). All patients underwent a standardized CCTA protocol and a standardized adenosine stress CMR-MPI study (1.5 T). Intermediate stenoses were defined as>30 and<= 70% luminal narrowing in CCTA. Both, CCTA and CMR-MPI were analysed by highly experienced readers (radiologist and/or cardiologist). Result(s): Mean Agatston coronary artery calcium score (CAC) was 970 +/- 881. In 47 patients (46%) no CTA was performed due to the high CAC or an unfavourable plaque location. In the remaining patients CCTA affirmed at least one intermediate stenosis with unknown relevance regarding myocardial ischemia. CMR-MPI revealed a visual assessed ischemia in 27 (26.5%). In summary 34 patients (33%) were referred to coronary angiography (XA) due to CMR results and clinical decision; +/- patients denied XA. In 21 of the remaining 28 patients significant CAD was diagnosed. In patients with ischemia in CMR, XA confirmed significant CAD (89.5%) in 17 patients, in 2 patients significant CAD was excluded. In both patients no CCTA was done due to high CAC. Of the remaining patients, which underwent XA; only 4 had relevant CAD (36.4%). Overall, the stepwise approach of imaging modalities would help to reduce the costs by around 9% in contrast to an alternative invasive strategy XA with fractional flow reserve (FFR)measurement. Conclusion(s): Our results indicate that CMR-MPRI is a highly valuable tool to evaluate patients at risk for myocardial ischemia with unclear CCTA results and can avoid radiation exposure and reduce cost efforts.",Excluded
3890,"Support vector machine classification of brain metastasis and radiation necrosis based on texture analysis in MRI Purpose To develop a classification model using texture features and support vector machine in contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images to differentiate between brain metastasis and radiation necrosis. Methods Texture features were extracted from 115 lesions: 32 of them previously diagnosed as radiation necrosis, 23 as radiation-treated metastasis and 60 untreated metastases; including a total of 179 features derived from six texture analysis methods. A feature selection technique based on support vector machine was used to obtain a subset of features that provide optimal performance. Results The highest classification accuracy evaluated over test sets was achieved with a subset of ten features when the untreated metastases were not considered; and with a subset of seven features when the classifier was trained with untreated metastases and tested on treated ones. Receiver operating characteristic curves provided area-under-the-curve (mean+/-standard deviation) of 0.94+/-0.07 in the first case, and 0.93+/-0.02 in the second. Conclusion High classification accuracy (AUC>0.9) was obtained using texture features and a support vector machine classifier in an approach based on conventional MRI to differentiate between brain metastasis and radiation necrosis.Copyright Â© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
4593,"Postcontrast T1 Mapping for Differential Diagnosis of Recurrence and Radionecrosis after Gamma Knife Radiosurgery for Brain Metastasis BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The differential diagnosis of radionecrosis and tumor recurrence in brain metastases is challenging. We investigated the diagnostic efficiency of postcontrast T1 mapping in solving this problem., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 2016 and June 2017, fifty-six patients with brain metastases who underwent contrast-enhanced cerebral T1 mapping were recruited for this prospective study. The findings revealed new enhancement after gamma knife radiosurgery. The subjects were assigned to radionecrosis and recurrence groups based on follow-up (median, 11.5 months) and histopathologic results. T1 values of lesions 5 (T15min) and 60 (T160min) minutes after administration of contrast agent and their difference (T1differ) were compared between the 2 groups with the 2-tailed Mann-Whitney U test. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to determine the optimum cutoff values for differential diagnosis., RESULTS: There were significant differences between the 2 groups in T15min, T160min, and T1differ values (P = .012, P = .004, and P < .001, respectively). Relative to T15min and T160min, T1differ exhibited greater sensitivity and specificity (P < .001, respectively) in identifying radionecrosis. The optimum T1differ value for differential diagnosis was 71.1 ms (area under the curve = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.93-1.00), with sensitivity and specificity of 81.5% and 96.5%, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Postcontrast T1 mapping is optimal for the differential diagnosis of radionecrosis and tumor recurrence. Among T1 parameters, T1differ is the most powerful parameter for differential diagnosis. Advantages in terms of quantitative analysis and high resolution portend the wide use of postcontrast T1 mapping in the future. Copyright Â© 2018 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.",Excluded
3928,"Papillary thyroid carcinoma with exclusive involvement of a functioning recurrent laryngeal nerve may be treated with shaving technique OBJECTIVES: We sought to validate the feasibility of preserving a functioning recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) invaded by papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) using a shaving technique followed by high-dose radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy., METHODS: A retrospective review of 34 patients with locally invasive PTC who had exclusive tumor involvement of a functioning RLN was performed. All patients underwent total thyroidectomy and high-dose RAI therapy. A shaving technique was conducted with the goal of leaving the smallest amount of residual tumor as possible while attempting to preserve nerve function. Clinicopathologic factors and oncologic outcomes of the patients with resected RLN (group A, n = 14) and preserved RLN (group B, n = 20) were compared., RESULTS: The two groups showed no differences in clinicopathologic factors or follow-up period. Mean dose of radioiodine therapy was 245.0 +/- 140.3 mCi (range 100-540 mCi). Permanent postoperative vocal cord paralysis after RLN shaving occurred in two patients of group B (10%). Only one patient (5%) in group B had local recurrence at the thyroid bed where the residual tumor was located. The overall recurrence rate was 35.7% (5/14) and 20.0% (4/20) in groups A and B, respectively showing no significant difference (p = 0.525). There were no cases of death due to PTC during the median follow-up of 75 months (range 36-159 months)., CONCLUSIONS: Patients with locally invasive PTC with exclusive involvement of a functioning RLN may be treated by nerve shaving followed by treatment of the macroscopic residual tumor with high-dose RAI therapy.",Excluded
4418,"Radiation exposure to relatives of patients treated with iodine-131 for thyroid cancer at Siriraj hospital Objective: Thyroid cancer patients treated with I-131 are potential source of radiation exposure to relatives who are knowingly and willingly exposed to ionizing radiation as a result of providing comfort to patients undergoing I-131 therapy. This study aims to determine radiation dose received by relatives who care for non self-supporting I-131 patients at Siriraj Hospital. Material(s) and Method(s): Twenty caregivers of 20 patients underwent I-131 therapy for thyroid cancer with a standard protocol were given specific instructions with regard to radiation safety and provided with electronic digital dosimeter to continuously measure radiation dose received on daily basis, three days in the hospital. On the day patient is released, thyroid uptake estimates were performed to assess internal radiation dose received by caregivers. Result(s): The 3-day accumulative doses to caregivers to patients receiving 150 mCi (n = 11) and 200 mCi (n = 9) of I-131 ranged from 37 to 333 muSv and 176 to 1,920 muSv respectively depending on the level of supports required. Thyroid uptake estimates in all caregivers were undetectable. Dosimeter indicated a maximum whole-body dose of 1.92 mSv was more than the public dose limit of 1 mSv but within the dose constraint of 5 mSv for caregivers. Discussion(s): Radiation dose to caregivers of a non self-supporting hospitalized patient undergoing I-131 therapy were well below the limits recommended by the ICRP. The patients can be comforted with confidence that dose to caregivers will be less than the limit. Conclusion(s): This study provides guidance for medical practitioners to obtain practical radiation safety concerns associated with hospitalized patients receiving I-131 therapy especially when patient needs assistance.Copyright Â© 2016, Medical Association of Thailand.

3953,"Dosimetric effect of different isocenter for nasopharyngeal carcinoma with volumetric modulated arc therapy Objective: The purpose of this study was to analyze the dosimetric effect of different isocenters with volumetric modulated arc therapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Method(s): A total of 20 NPC patients who had received radiotherapy were re-planned by the volumetric modulated arc therapy plan. Three volumetric modulated arc therapy plans with different isocenters were generated for each patient: the first plan using the center of PGTVnx as the isocenter (AP-V), the second plan using the center of PGTVnd as the isocenter (BP-V), and the third plan using the center of PTV2 as the isocenter (CP-V). The conformity and homogeneity indexes of the target, dose-volume histogram of organs at risk, normal tissue, volume of dose, and monitor units were compared for the three plans. Result(s): AP-V provided a significantly lower maximum dose for the optic nerves and optic chiasm; lower mean dose for the eyeballs; lower absolute volume >10 Gy, absolute volume >20 Gy, and absolute volume >30 Gy; and fewer monitor units than BP-V and CP-V. BP-V and CP-V provided a significantly lower absolute volume >50 Gy than AP-V. In the conformity indexes of PGTVnd and PTV2, BP-V and CP-V were significantly better than in AP-V. In the homogeneity index of PTV2, BP-V and CP-V were significantly better than in AP-V. In general, there is no significant difference between BP-V and CP-V. Conclusion(s): All three plans achieved the clinical demands. AP-V decreased the volumes of absolute volume >10 Gy, absolute volume >20 Gy, and absolute volume >30 Gy, whereas BP-V and CP-V decreased the volume of absolute volume >50 Gy. In terms of organs at risk, AP-V offered better protection of the optic nerves, optic chiasm, and eyeballs for NPC than BP-V and CP-V. Most importantly, AP-V enhanced the utilization of the monitor units. For this reason, we propose that the radiotherapy technician put the location position in the PGTVnx center during simulation of the NPC patients. We further propose that the isocenter be moved to the geometric center of PGTVnx if the NPC patient plan has higher dosimeter requirements for the optic nerves, optic chiasm, or eyeballs.Copyright Â© 2019 The Authors.

4514,"Preoperative Prediction of Pathologic Response to Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy in Patients With Esophageal Cancer Using 18F-FDG PET/CT and DW-MRI: A Prospective Multicenter Study Purpose: Accurate preoperative prediction of pathologic response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) in patients with esophageal cancer could enable omission of esophagectomy in patients with a pathologic complete response (pCR). This study aimed to evaluate the individual and combined value of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography with integrated computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) during and after nCRT to predict pathologic response in patients with esophageal cancer. Methods and Materials: In this multicenter prospective study, patients scheduled to receive nCRT followed by esophagectomy for esophageal cancer underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT and DW-MRI scanning before the start of nCRT, during nCRT, and before esophagectomy. Response to nCRT was based on histopathologic evaluation of the resection specimen. Relative changes in 18F-FDG PET/CT and DW-MRI parameters were compared between patients with pCR and non-pCR groups. Multivariable ridge regression analyses with bootstrapped c-indices were performed to evaluate the individual and combined value of 18F-FDG PET/CT and DW-MRI. Result(s): pCR was found in 26.1% of 69 patients. Relative changes in 18F-FDG PET/CT parameters after nCRT (DELTA standardized uptake value [SUV]mean,post P = .016, and DELTA total lesion glycolysis post P = .024), as well as changes in DW-MRI parameters during nCRT (DELTA apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC]during P = .008) were significantly different between pCR and non-pCR. A c-statistic of 0.84 was obtained for a model with DELTAADCduring, DELTASUVmean,post, and histology in classifying patients as pCR (versus 0.82 for DELTAADCduring and 0.79 for DELTASUVmean,post alone). Conclusion(s): Changes on 18F-FDG PET/CT after nCRT and early changes on DW-MRI during nCRT can help identify pCR to nCRT in esophageal cancer. Moreover, 18F-FDG PET/CT and DW-MRI might be of complementary value in the assessment of pCR.Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

Initial reports using single-stage radiosurgery have demonstrated excellent tumor control rates. Many patients now elect to undergo radiosurgery given the potential for tumor control while avoiding the morbidity associated with microsurgical resection. In attempt to improve hearing preservation rates of single-state radiosurgery, staged frame-based radiotherapy using a 12-hour interfraction interval was used at the authors' institution and has shown a hearing preservation rate of 77% at 2 years of follow-up. With the arrival of the Cyberknife, a frameless, image-guided radiotherapy system, staged stereotactic radiotherapy for vestibular schwannoma became more practical.

The main objective was to study the change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) over 6 months from ranibizumab 0.5 mg (experimental) compared to focal laser of the macula and panretinal laser treatment of the ischemic retina (control) in patients with radiation retinopathy in choroidal melanoma. The secondary objectives of the radiation retinopathy study were to compare functional and anatomical results between ranibizumab and laser group over 12 months and to measure the frequency of vitreous hemorrhage and rubeosis iridis., RESULTS: The intention-to-treat analysis included 31 patients assigned to ranibizumab (n = 15) or laser treatment (n = 16). In terms of BCVA at month 6, ranibizumab was superior to laser treatment, with an advantage of 0.14 logMAR, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.25, p = 0.030. The positive effect of ranibizumab disappeared after treatment was discontinued. Similar results without statistically significant difference were found with respect to macular thickness. In both groups, no change was observed at month 6 in the size of ischemia in the macula or periphery compared to baseline. There was 1 case of vitreous hemorrhage in the laser group and no case of rubeosis iridis over time., CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a statistically significant improvement in visual acuity and clear superiority of ranibizumab compared to laser treatment up to 26 weeks, but this effect disappeared at week 52 after completion of intravitreal treatment.

Method(s): Retrospective analysis was conducted on 78 patients with localized sinonasal mucosal melanoma treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC from 1998-2013). Demographic, tumor, imaging, and treatment factors were recorded and survival and disease-control outcomes were analyzed. Result(s): Median overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were 32 and 50 months, respectively. Median locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS) and distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) were 43 and 12 months, respectively. Multivariate analysis demonstrated greater OS in nasal cavity tumors and earlier T classification. Radiotherapy (RT) was associated with significantly greater LRFS (5-years; 35% vs 59%; p =.01), but no difference in OS. Post-RT positron emission tomography (PET) response was associated with greater OS.

4170,"Phosphorylation of Ser312 contributes to tumor suppression by p53 in vivo The tumor suppressor p53 is a master sensor of stress, and posttranslational modifications are key in controlling its stability and transcriptional activities. p53 can be phosphorylated on at least 23 Ser/Thr residues, the majority of which are phosphorylated by stress-related kinases. An exception is Ser315 in human p53 (Ser312 in mouse), which is predominantly phosphorylated by cell cyclerelated kinases. To understand the biological importance of Ser312 phosphorylation in vivo, wegenerated p53Ser312Ala knock-in mice. We show here that, although Ser312 is not essential for mouse life span under normal physiological conditions, Ser312Ala mutation dampens p53's activity during embryonic development. This is evident from its partial rescue of embryonic lethality caused by Mdm4 deletion. In agreement with the notion that Ser312 mutation weakens p53 function, Ser312Ala mice are alsomore susceptible to tumorigenesis following a sublethal ionizing radiation dose. Importantly, in the cohort studied, Ser312 mutation predisposes mice to develop thymic lymphomas and liver tumors, partly due to p53Ser312Ala's inability to fully induce a set of p53 target genes including p21 and cyclin G1. Thus, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of Ser312 is required for p53 to function fully as a tumor suppressor in vivo.",Excluded

4393,"Sun exposure and pterygium of the eye: a dose-response curve PURPOSE: To present a quantitative analysis of pterygium and ocular sun exposure, a dose-response curve, and a discussion of the health-promotion implications of the findings., METHODS: A hospital-based, case-control study was conducted in Perth, Western Australia. Case subjects had surgical removal of a pterygium; control subjects had an ear, nose, or throat procedure. A lifetime history of residence, sun exposure patterns, and use of hats, spectacles, and sunglasses was obtained at interview. Measures of potential sun exposure included latitude, daily sunshine hours, and daily global solar radiant energy. The most complex estimate of actual sun exposure was the daily ocular solar radiation dose, calculated from climatic data, time spent outdoors not under shade, and the use of hats and spectacles., RESULTS: There were strong positive associations between pterygium and measures of potential and actual sun exposure. Associations were as strong for whole-life measures as for those in any specific age range. Pterygium odds ratios increased with exposure level; the odds ratio was 4.0 (95% confidence interval, 1.6 to 10.9) for the highest quarter of the daily sun exposure. The strongest associations were seen for the estimated daily ocular solar radiation dose, with an odds ratio of 6.8 (95% confidence interval, 2.6 to 19.7) for the highest quarter of exposure., CONCLUSIONS: Pterygium is strongly related to ocular sun exposure, with little evidence that exposure during any particular period of life is more important than in other periods; the implication for prevention of pterygium is that ocular protection is beneficial at all ages.",Excluded
4222,"Observer variation in target volume delineation of lung cancer related to radiation oncologist-computer interaction: a 'Big Brother' evaluation BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To evaluate the process of target volume delineation in lung cancer for optimization of imaging, delineation protocol and delineation software., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eleven radiation oncologists (observers) from five different institutions delineated the Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) including positive lymph nodes of 22 lung cancer patients (stages I-IIIB) on CT only. All radiation oncologist-computer interactions were recorded with a tool called 'Big Brother'. For each radiation oncologist and patient the following issues were analyzed: delineation time, number of delineated points and corrections, zoom levels, level and window (L/W) settings, CT slice changes, use of side windows (coronal and sagittal) and software button use., RESULTS: The mean delineation time per GTV was 16 min (SD 10 min). The mean delineation time for lymph node positive patients was on average 3 min larger (P = 0.02) than for lymph node negative patients. Many corrections (55%) were due to L/W change (e.g. delineating in mediastinum L/W and then correcting in lung L/W). For the lymph node region, a relatively large number of corrections was found (3.7 corr/cm2), indicating that it was difficult to delineate lymph nodes. For the tumor-atelectasis region, a relative small number of corrections was found (1.0 corr/cm2), indicating that including or excluding atelectasis into the GTV was a clinical decision. Inappropriate use of L/W settings was frequently found (e.g. 46% of all delineated points in the tumor-lung region were delineated in mediastinum L/W settings). Despite a large observer variation in cranial and caudal direction of 0.72 cm (1 SD), the coronal and sagittal side windows were not used in 45 and 60% of the cases, respectively. For the more difficult cases, observer variation was smaller when the coronal and sagittal side windows were used., CONCLUSIONS: With the 'Big Brother' tool a method was developed to trace the delineation process. The differences between observers concerning the delineation style were large. This study led to recommendations on how to improve delineation accuracy by adapting the delineation protocol (guidelines for L/W use) and delineation software (double window with lung and mediastinum L/W settings at the same time, enforced use of coronal and sagittal views) and including FDG-PET information (lymph nodes and atelectasis).",Excluded
4285,"Clinical and molecular recursive partitioning analysis of high-grade glioma treated with IMRT Introduction: Despite multimodal treatment for high-grade gliomas, prognosis remains grim. Prior Radiation Therapy Oncology Group-Recursive Partitioning Analysis (RTOG-RPA) reports indicate based on pretreatment and treatment-related factors, a subset of patients experience a significantly improved survival. Since the development of the RTOG-RPA, high-grade gliomas have seen the widespread introduction of temozolomide and tumor oncogenetics. Here we aimed to determine whether the RTOG-RPA retained prognostic significance in the context of modern treatment, as well as generate an updated RPA incorporating both clinical and genetic variables. Method(s): Patients with histologically proven glioblastoma, gliosarcoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, and anaplastic oligodendroglioma treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) between 2004 and 2017 were reviewed. The primary endpoint was overall survival from date of diagnosis. Primary analysis compared actual survival rates to that expected of corresponding RTOG-RPA class. Secondary analysis utilized the rpart function to recursively partition overall survival by numerous clinical and genetic pretreatment and treatment-related variables. A tertiary analysis recursively partitioned a subset of patients in which the status of all genetic markers were known. Result(s): We identified 878 patients with histologically proven high-grade glioma treated with IMRT and 291 patients in our genetic subset. Median overall survival for the entire cohort was 14.2 months (95% confidence interval, 13.1-15.3). Applying the RTOG-RPA to our cohort validated the relative prognostic ordering of the survival classes except class II. Generating our new RPA created 7 significantly different survival classes (P<0.001, chi 2 =584) with median survival ranging from 96.4 to 2.9 months based on age, histology, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation status, radiation fractions, tumor location, radiation dose, temozolomide status, and resection status. Our second RPA of our genetic subset generated 5 significantly different survival classes (P<0.001, chi 2 =166) with survival ranging from 65.3 to 5.6 months based on age, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutation status, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation status, neurological functional classification, hospitalization during IMRT, temozolomide status, and Karnofsky performance status. Conclusion(s): The RTOG-RPA retains partial prognostic significance, however, should be updated to reflect recent advancements. This series represents a large RPA analyzing both clinical and genetic factors and generated 7 distinct survival classes. Further assessment of patients with fully available genetic markers generated 5 distinct survival classes. These survival classifications need to be validated by a prospective data set and compared against the RTOG-RPA to determine whether they provide improved prognostic power.Â© Copyright 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

4218,"The use of a comprehensive tumour xenograft dataset to validate gene signatures relevant for radiation response PURPOSE: To investigate the use of xenograft models in a novel gene signature validation method using gene expression microarrays., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gene expression profiles of ten human Head and Neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) were obtained. Several published prognostic gene expression signatures were evaluated within this set. These consisted of different radiotherapy relevant signatures (i.e. for hypoxia, proliferation and 'stemness'). Signatures were correlated with various endpoints that have been determined in the ten different xenograft models. These include immunohistochemical measures for hypoxia and proliferation, volume doubling time (VDT) and local tumour control after fractionated irradiation or after single dose irradiation under clamp hypoxia., RESULTS: We found several significant correlations between the published gene expression signatures and tumour parameters. Several signatures, like the proliferation and wound signature correlated with BrdU labelling index. Further a 'stemness'-related gene signature showed a strong negative correlation with hypoxic fraction., CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous assessment of immunohistochemistry, in vivo tumour properties and gene expression profiling in a comprehensive set of xenograft models can be used to validate and potentially infer biological information about prognostic gene signatures.",Excluded
4436,"Early and late lung radiographic injury following stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) OBJECTIVE: To describe early and late CT patterns of radiographic lung injury after SBRT for lung cancer, and to correlate radiological findings with patient and treatment characteristics., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Follow-up CT scans of 68 patients with 70 tumors were divided into 4 periods: (1) 6 weeks; (2) 2-6 months; (3) 7-12 months and (4) 13-18 months after SBRT. Early (within 6 months) and late radiological injuries were evaluated according to Ikezoe and Koening, respectively. The correlation between CT findings and patient characteristics was evaluated., RESULTS: Radiographic injury in periods 1 and 2 was: (1) diffuse consolidation 3 and 27%, (2) patchy consolidation and ground-glass opacity (GGO) 13.2 and 33%, (3) diffuse GGO 13.2 and 21%, (4) patchy GGO 16.2 and 6%, and (5) no findings 54.4 and 21%, respectively. Late injury in periods 3 and 4 were: (1) modified conventional pattern (consolidation, volume loss, bronchiectasis) 54 and 44%, (2) mass-like 20 and 28%, (3) scar-like 14 and 16% and (4) no findings 20 and 12%, respectively. The proportion of emphysema grades 2-4 was significantly higher in patients who had no radiological findings 6 weeks after treatment (p=0.021). Both patchy consolidation and GGO patterns resulted more frequently in patients who were not administered steroids (p=0.035). No relationship was found with smoking, tumor dimension and radiation dose., CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients had no evidence of radiographic lung injury 6 weeks after SBRT; the most prevalent findings were diffuse or patchy GGO. Patchy and diffuse consolidation develops 2-6 months after SBRT. Modified conventional pattern was the most prevalent in the late periods. Copyright 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

4479,"Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type: The significance of radiotherapeutic parameters BACKGROUND. The objective of this study was to investigate the correlation between local recurrence and radiotherapeutic parameters, including dose and RT radiotherapy (RT) field. METHODS. The current study included 35 patients who were diagnosed with immunohistochemically confirmed nasal natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma between 1976 and 2004. There were 21 males and 14 females, and they ranged in age from 18 years to 76 years (median, 51 yrs). The primary tumor originated in the nasal cavity in 28 patients, and 32 patients had Stage I disease. Seventeen patients received treatment solely with RT, and the remaining 18 patients received a combination of chemotherapy and RT. The median tumor dose was 50 grays (Gy) (range, 22-60 Gy). Twenty-seven patients received RT to include all macroscopic lesions, all paranasal sinuses, the palate, and the nasopharynx. Eight patients received RT to all macroscopic lesions with generous margins. RESULTS. A complete remission (CR) or a CR/unconfirmed was achieved in 28 patients (80%). The 5-year overall survival (OAS) rate, disease-free survival (DFS) rate, and local control probability (LCP) were 47.3%, 42.9%, and 65.2%, respectively. Patients who received RT only to macroscopic lesions fared less well in terms of LCP (LCP 5 years, 71.9% vs. 41.7%; P = 0.007). The difference in RT field also affected both the OAS rate and the DFS rate. Patients who received RT doses >= 50 Gy tended to achieve favorable local control. CONCLUSIONS. In the management of nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma, the RT field affected treatment outcomes. RT doses >= 50 Gy resulted in favorable local control. Â© 2005 American Cancer Society.",Excluded

Depending on the localization of the tumor, dissection of one or more of the rectus muscles is necessary during placement of the plaque or during the course of protracted irradiation. Orthoptic investigations were performed to evaluate the cause of motility disorders and to follow up the functional outcome. In 13 patients (out of 30) who underwent ruthenium-106 therapy for uveal melanomas, one or more muscles had to be dissected during placement of the plaque and were reinserted in the same operation or after removal of the applicator. In 4 cases rectus muscles had to be shifted and were replaced after the irradiation. There were 5 patients who developed motility disorders with double vision.

4536,"Radioadaptive response in human lymphocytes in vitro Exposure to low doses of radiation and/or chemicals can prime an organism to withstand the stress of a subsequent exposure to higher doses of the same agent. In the case of radiation, this phenomenon has been called radioadaptive response. Cytogenetic studies have been undertaken in human lymphocytes to investigate adaptive response (AR) to ionizing radiation, in particular to seek the role of variables such as priming dose, cell cycle stage, and age and gender of the donor. We demonstrated that pre-exposure of lymphocytes in whole blood cultures to very low doses in the range of about 1 cGy (priming or adaptive dose [AD]) reduced the frequency of micronuclei in binucleated cells induced by 100 cGy - that is, produced an AR in these cells in vitro. However, pre-exposure of cells to 10.0 cGy did not reduce the chromosomal damage (micronuclei) induced by the challenging dose (CD) of 100 cGy under the same protocol, thus exhibiting an inverse dose-response relationship. There was marked variability in the AR among the individuals investigated in the study. The extent of AR also depended on the stage of cell cycle exposed to the CD of radiation. Maximum AR was observed when CD of 100 cGy was given 4 hours after AD, 30 hours following the mitogenic stimulation of lymphocytes. The least AR was observed when CD was given 48 hours after stimulation. Interestingly, AR was also found to be dependent on the age of the donor, a decrease in AR being observed with an increasing age. No significant difference in AR was observed between male and female donors. To understand the molecular events underlying AR, protein synthesis patterns were studied in human lymphocytes subjected to mitogen, heat, or radiation stress. Heat shock (45 degreeC, for 15 min) induced 7 proteins with molecular weights ranging from 40 to 80 kDa, while treatment with phytohemagglutinin (40 mug/ mL) showed induction of 2 proteins of molecular weights 38 and 48 kDa, respectively. However, exposure of human lymphocyte cultures to gamma radiation did not significantly induce synthesis of any protein, up to 800 cGy dose. Lack of induction of proteins by gamma radiation in human lymphocytes contrasts with the previous reports showing X-ray radiation-enhanced gene expression in melanoma cells and/or human tumor fibroblasts.",Included
4155,"Dosimetric Correlate of Cardiac-Specific Survival Among Patients Undergoing Coronary Artery Stenting After Thoracic Radiotherapy for Cancer OBJECTIVES: To retrospectively evaluate outcomes among cancer survivors previously treated with thoracic radiotherapy (RT) who later underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)., METHODS: From 1998 to 2012, 76 patients first received curative RT (>30 Gy, except for Hodgkin lymphoma patients) involving the heart and lungs followed by PCI. Heart and lung-specific dosimetric parameters were correlated with overall survival (OS) and cardiac-specific survival by Cox variate methods., RESULTS: The mean interval between cancer diagnosis and PCI was 3.7 years (range, 0.1 to 12.6 y). Median follow-up since cancer diagnosis was 5.5 years. At analysis, 46 patients (61%) were alive, 5 (7%) died of cardiac causes, and 9 (12%) of cancer. Higher maximum RT heart dose was related to poorer OS since PCI (P=0.009). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (P=0.005) and higher mean heart dose (P<0.001) were related to poorer OS since cancer diagnosis. beta-Blockers, higher mean heart dose (hazard ratio [HR]=1.49, P<0.001), and percentage of targeted volume or organ receiving >=40 Gy for heart doses (HR=1.32, P<0.001) were associated with poorer non-cancer-specific survival since cancer diagnosis. Diabetes (HR=3.84, P=0.008) and increased percentage of targeted volume or organ receiving >=45 Gy (HR=1.01 per additional 100 cm irradiated, P=0.01) for the heart decreased major adverse cardiac event-free survival., CONCLUSIONS: Prior heart and lung-directed RT had volume-dependent and dose-dependent adverse effects on long-term cardiac outcomes for patients subsequently treated with PCI.

4510,"18 Years' experience with high dose rate strontium-90 brachytherapy of small to medium sized posterior uveal melanoma Aim: To analyse local tumour control, radiation related complications, visual acuity, enucleation rate, and survival after brachytherapy of small to medium sized choroidal melanoma (CM) with a high dose rate (HDR) strontium-90 (Sr-90) applicator. Method(s): From 1983 until 2000, 98 eyes with CM were treated with Sr-90 brachytherapy. The main outcome measures were actuarial rates of the patients' survival, ocular conservation rate, tumour regression, complication rates, and preservation of visual acuity. End point rates were estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Result(s): The median follow up time was 6.7 years (0.5-18.8 years). Actuarial melanoma free patient survival rate was 85% (SE 4.8%) after 18 years. Actuarial rate of ocular conservation and complete tumour regression was 90% (SE 3.8%) after 15 years. In 93% local tumour control was achieved, 88% showed a stable scar. Recurrence of the tumour on the border caused enucleation of six eyes (7%). In three cases (4%) retinal detachment was the end point. No cases of optic atrophy or of sight impairing retinopathy outside the treated area were found. Actuarial rate of preservation of visual acuity of 1/10 was 65% at 5 years and 45% at 15 years of follow up (SE 5.9% and 8.8%). Conclusion(s): Sr-90 brachytherapy is as effective as iodine or ruthenium brachytherapy for small to medium sized CM but causes fewer complications. The preservation of vision is better than with all other described radioisotopes. HDR Sr-90 brachytherapy can therefore safely be recommended for small to medium sized CM.",Excluded
4780,"Reducing the Radiation Dose for CT Colonography: Effect of Low Tube Voltage and Iterative Reconstruction Rationale and Objectives: The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of a low-tube-voltage technique and iterative reconstruction (IR) on the radiation dose and image quality of computed tomography colonography (CTC). Material(s) and Method(s): We studied 30 patients (14 women and 16 men; mean age, 64.5 +/- 13.1 years; range, 39-90 years) with colorectal cancer referred for surgical treatment. All underwent CTC with fecal tagging under a standard 120-kVp protocol in the supine position and a 100-kVp protocol in the prone position. The 120-kVp images were reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP). The 100-kVp images were postprocessed using FBP and a hybrid type of IR (adaptive iterative dose reduction 3D). The effective radiation dose (ED), image noise, and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were compared among the three protocols. The visual image quality was scored on a four-point scale. Result(s): The mean ED was significantly lower under the 100-kVp protocol than the 120-kVp protocol, resulting in a 27% radiation dose decrease (3.5 +/- 2.0 vs 2.5 +/- 1.5 mSv; P <01). Image noise decreased by 48%, and the mean attenuation of tagged fluid increased from 452 to 558 HU on images acquired at 100 kVp with IR compared to that in the 120-kVp protocol; these differences were significant. The mean CNR was significantly higher under the 100 kVp with IR than the other two protocols. We found no significant differences in the visual scores for diagnostic utility between the 100 kVp with IR and the 120 kVp with FBP protocol (P=10). Conclusion(s): Low-tube-voltage CTC reduced the radiation dose by approximately 27% while maintaining the image quality.Copyright Â© 2016 AUR.",Excluded
3797,"Latest-generation catheterization systems enable invasive submillisievert coronary angiography BACKGROUND: The radiation risk of patients undergoing invasive cardiology remains considerable and includes skin injuries and cancer. To date, submillisievert coronary angiography has not been considered feasible., PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 2011, we compared results from 100 consecutive patients undergoing elective coronary angiography using the latest-generation flat-panel angiography system (FPS) with results from examinations by the same operator using 106 historic controls with a conventional image-intensifier system (IIS) that was new in 2002., RESULTS: The median patient exposure parameters were measured as follows: dose-area product (DAP) associated with radiographic cine acquisitions (DAP(R)) and fluoroscopy (DAP(F)) scenes, radiographic frames and runs, and cumulative exposure times for radiography and fluoroscopy. On the FPS as compared to the traditional IIS, radiographic detector entrance dose levels were reduced from 164 to 80 nGy/frame and pulse rates were lowered from 12.5/s to 7.5/s during radiography and from 25/s to 4/s during fluoroscopy. The cardiologist's performance patterns remained comparable over the years: fluoroscopy time was constant and radiography time even slightly increased. Overall patient DAP decreased from 7.0 to 2.4 Gy x cm(2); DAP(R), from 4.2 to 1.7 Gy x cm(2); and DAP(F), from 2.8 to 0.6 Gy x cm(2). Time-adjusted DAP(R)/s decreased from 436 to 130 mGy x cm(2) and DAP(F)/s, from 21.6 to 4.4 mGy x cm(2). Cumulative patient skin dose with the FPS amounted to 67 mGy, and the median (interquartile range) of effective dose was 0.5 (0.3 ... 0.7) mSv., CONCLUSION: Consistent application of radiation-reducing techniques with the latest-generation flat-panel systems enables submillisievert coronary angiography in invasive cardiology.",Excluded

Nearly 10% of the study population intentionally tanned outdoors. Outdoor tanning was more prevalent among women (11.4%), non-Hispanic white individuals (11.5%), those aged 18-29 years (14.1%), those without a high school diploma (12.7%), and those in the northeast United States (13.2%). The adjusted odds of outdoor tanning were significantly higher among women than men (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12-2.04); those with a history of indoor tanning or recent sunburn than those without (AOR 2.61, CI 1.94-3.51; AOR 1.96, CI 1.46-2.63, respectively); those who agreed they looked better with a tan than those who did not (AOR 6.69, CI 3.62-12.35); and those who did not try to protect their skin from the sun when outdoors than those who did (AOR 2.17, CI 1.56-3.04). Adults who engaged in other risky behaviors that expose a person to ultraviolet (UV) radiation were more likely to tan outdoors, further increasing their risk of skin cancer.

This study aimed to assess the relapse patterns and outcomes of patients with orbital MALToma who underwent RT and to suggest implications for optimized RT. Method(s): We reviewed 212 patients (246 orbits) diagnosed with orbital MALToma who received RT between 1993 and 2013. Median RT dose was 25.2 Gy. Generally, conjunctival and eyelid lesions were irradiated with electrons, whereas retrobulbar and lacrimal gland lesions with photons. Lens shielding was used for 70% of treated eyes, mainly conjunctival and eyelid tumors. Result(s): Relapse occurred in 29 patients. Among 11 patients with local relapse (LR), 4 were attributed to insufficient dose (n = 2) and improper RT volume (n = 2). The 10-year LR, contralateral orbit relapse, and distant relapse rates were 8.6%, 12.8% and 4.9%, respectively. Twelve patients died of disease-specific causes (n = 1) and intercurrent diseases (n = 11). The 10-year relapse-free survival, overall survival, and cause-specific survival rates were 69.7%, 88.2% and 98.8%, respectively. Grade 3 cataracts and nasolacrimal duct obstruction were observed in 27 and 4 orbits, respectively. Conclusion(s): Low-dose RT with proper lens shielding is an appropriate treatment for orbital MALToma in terms of high disease control rate and acceptable morbidity. However, lower RT dose may be attempted to further reduce toxicity while maintaining excellent outcomes.Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2019.",Excluded

Method(s): 120 patients (age:60.6 +/- 7.9 years, 35% female) with indications to ICA were randomized 1:1 to undergo CCTA versus direct ICA. Outcomes were evaluated during the diagnostic and therapeutic periods. Result(s): The number of invasively examined patients was reduced by 64.4% in the CCTA group as compared to the direct ICA group (21vs59,p < 0.0001). The number of patients with ICAs not followed by coronary intervention was reduced by 88.1% with the CCTA strategy (5vs42,p < 0.0001). Over the diagnostic and therapeutic course there were no significant differences regarding the median volume of contrast (CCTA 80.3 ml[65.0-165.0] vs ICA 90.0 ml[55.0-100.0], p = 0.099), while a non-significant trend towards higher radiation dose in the CCTA group was observed (9.9 mSv[7.0-22.1] vs 9.4 mSv[5.2-14.0], p = 0.05). There were no acute cardiovascular events. Conclusion(s): CCTA may hypothetically act as an effective 'gatekeeper' to the catheterization laboratory in the diagnosis of stable patients with current indications for ICA. This strategy may result in non-invasive, outpatient-based triage of two thirds of individuals without actionable CAD, obviating unnecessary invasive examinations.

METHOD(S):: Retrospective interventional case series. Interferon alpha 2b (IFNa2b) eye drops (1 million units/cc) 4 times daily and IFNa2b sublesional injection (5 million units/0.5cc to 8 million units/0.8 cc) were delivered for tumor control. Participants were 3 patients with ocular prosthesis who developed extensive socket OSSN. Tumor control was graded as complete regression, partial regression, or no regression. RESULT(S):: OSSN was detected in the socket at age 60, 43, and 20 years in patients who had worn ophthalmic prostheses for 54, 26, and 13 years, respectively. The patients had chronic discharge and irritation (n = 3) managed with intermittent topical corticosteroids (n = 2). There were no predisposing factors of cigarette exposure, radiation exposure, eczema, systemic immune suppression, or organ transplantation. The prosthesis fit well with nonirritative edges. At presentation, OSSN was subtle (n = 3), vascular (n = 3), and multifocal (n = 3), with largest lesions or confluence of lesions measuring 20, 25, and 20 mm, respectively. The tumors involved the tarsal (n = 3), bulbar (n = 2), and forniceal (n = 2) surfaces. All patients were treated with topical and injection IFNa2b, with complete regression achieved in 2 cases (at 1 months and 20 months) and partial regression in one case (at 9 months). All patients continue on chronic maintenance IFNa2b topically. There were no recurrences, and IFNa2b injection side effects of nausea and chills were minor, lasting 1 day. No patient required surgical removal of tumors from the socket and no patient required exenteration. CONCLUSION(S):: Patients wearing ophthalmic prosthesis over a socket should be monitored for the development of OSSN. Combined topical and injection IFNa2b could represent a potentially effective therapy for this condition. Â© 2011 The American Society of Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Inc.",Excluded

The extent of DNA damage including oxidative lesions and efficiency of the repair were examined by alkaline comet assay. HNSCC cancer cells were more sensitive to genotoxic treatment and displayed impaired DNA repair. In particular, lesions caused by gamma-radiation were repaired less effectively in metastasis of HNSCC than in healthy controls. The differences in radiation sensitivity of cancer and control cells suggested that DNA repair might be critical for HNSCC treatment.

3957,"Ionizing radiation and genetic risks. VI. Chronic multifactorial diseases: a review of epidemiological and genetical aspects of coronary heart disease, essential hypertension and diabetes mellitus This paper provides a broad overview of the epidemiological and genetical aspects of common multifactorial diseases in man with focus on three well-studied ones, namely, coronary heart disease (CHD), essential hypertension (EHYT) and diabetes mellitus (DM). In contrast to mendelian diseases, for which a mutant gene either in the heterozygous or homozygous condition is generally sufficient to cause disease, for most multifactorial diseases, the concepts of genetic susceptibility' and risk factors' are more appropriate. For these diseases, genetic susceptibility is heterogeneous. The well-studied diseases such as CHD permit one to conceptualize the complex relationships between genotype and phenotype for chronic multifactorial diseases in general, namely that allelic variations in genes, through their products interacting with environmental factors, contribute to the quantitative variability of biological risk factor traits and thus ultimately to disease outcome. Two types of such allelic variations can be distinguished, namely those in genes whose mutant alleles have (i) small to moderate effects on the risk factor trait, are common in the population (polymorphic alleles) and therefore contribute substantially to the variability of biological risk factor traits and (ii) profound effects, are rare in the population and therefore contribute far less to the variability of biological risk factor traits. For all the three diseases considered in this review, a positive family history is a strong risk factor. CHD is one of the major contributors to mortality in most industrialized countries. Evidence from epidemiological studies, clinical correlations, genetic hyperlipidaemias etc., indicate that lipids play a key role in the pathogenesis of CHD. The known lipid-related risk factors include: high levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol, low levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol, high apoB levels (the major protein fraction of the low density lipoprotein particles) and elevated levels of Lp(a) lipoprotein. Among the risk factors which are not related to lipids are: high levels of homocysteine, low activity of paraoxonase and possibly also elevated plasma fibrinogen levels. In addition to the above, hypertension, diabetes and obesity (which themselves have genetic determinants) are important risk factors for CHD. Among the environmental risk factors are: high dietary fat intake, smoking, stress, lack of exercise etc. About 60% of the variability of the plasma cholesterol is genetic in origin. While a few genes have been identified whose mutant alleles have large effects on this trait (e.g., LDLR, familial defective apoB-100), variability in cholesterol levels among individuals in most families is influenced by allelic variation in many genes (polymorphisms) as well as environmental exposures. A proportion of this variation can be accounted for by two alleles of the apoE locus that increase (&epsi;4) and decrease (&epsi;2) cholesterol levels, respectively. A polymorphism at the apoB gene (XbaI) also has similar effects, but is probably not mediated through lipids. High density lipoprotein cholesterol levels are genetically influenced and are related to apoA1 and hepatic lipase (LIPC) gene functions. Mutations in the apoA1 gene are rare and there are data which suggest a role of allelic variation at or linked LIPC gene in high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Polymorphism at the apoA1--C3 loci is often associated with hypertriglyceridemia. The apo(a) gene which codes for Lp(a) is highly polymorphic, each allele determining a specific number of multiple tandem repeats of a unique coding sequence known as Kringle 4. The size of the gene correlates with the size of the Lp(a) protein. The smaller the size of the Lp(a) protein, the higher are the Lp(a) levels. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)",Excluded
4836,"Long-term outcomes of combined endoscopic resection and chemoradiotherapy for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma with submucosal invasion Background: For esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) with submucosal (SM) invasion, surgery is the standard treatment. Definitive chemoradiotherapy (D-CRT) is a less invasive alternative option, but sometimes results in locoregional failure. Aim(s): To examine whether endoscopic resection for primary lesion removal combined with chemoradiotherapy (ER-CRT) reduces locoregional failure rates in cases of ESCC with SM invasion. Method(s): We retrospectively compared clinical outcomes between ER-CRT and D-CRT in patients diagnosed with ESCC with SM invasion between 2003 and 2014. Twenty-one patients underwent ER-CRT based on a pathological diagnosis, and 43 patients underwent D-CRT based on a clinical diagnosis. Result(s): Locoregional failure developed in 26% of patients in the D-CRT group, and in no patients in the ER-CRT group (p < 0.01). Thus, the 5-year relapse-free survival in the ER-CRT group was significantly more favorable than that in the D-CRT group (85.1% vs 59.2%; p < 0.05), although there was no difference in overall survival (85.1% vs 79.1%) nor in cause-specific survival (90.5% vs 87.2%) between the groups. There were no instances of perforation or hemorrhage associated with ER. Conclusion(s): ER-CRT is a safe and effective treatment strategy and can be considered as a new minimally invasive treatment option for patients with ESCC with SM invasion.Copyright Â© 2018 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.",Excluded
3866,"A forgotten moment in physiology: the Lovelace Woman in Space Program (1960-1962) In 1959, Brigadier General Donald Flickinger and Dr. W. Randolph Lovelace II suggested that it would be more practical from an engineering standpoint to send women rather than men into space due to their lower body weights and oxygen requirements. When the Air Force decided not to pursue this project, Dr. Lovelace assumed leadership of the Woman in Space Program and began medical and physiological testing of a series of accomplished women aviators at the Lovelace Medical Clinic in Albuquerque, NM, in 1960. The tests that these women underwent were identical to those used to test the original Mercury astronauts, with the addition of gynecological examinations. Thirteen of the nineteen women tested passed these strenuous physiological exams (for comparison, 18 of 32 men tested passed); a subset of these pilots was further tested on a series of psychological exams that were similar to or, in some instances, more demanding than those given to male Mercury candidates. Despite these promising results, further testing was halted, and the Woman in Space Program was disbanded in 1962. Although the Woman in Space Program received a great deal of publicity at the time, the story of these women was somewhat lost until they were reunited at the 1999 launch of the shuttle Columbia, commanded by Colonel Eileen Collins.",Excluded
3881,"Straylight Measurements in Two Different Apodized Diffractive Multifocal Intraocular Lenses PURPOSE: To evaluate differences in straylight between eyes implanted with a hydrophilic multifocal IOL (Seelens MF; Hanita Lenses, Hanita, Israel) and a hydrophobic multifocal IOL (SN6AD1; Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Fort Worth, TX)., METHODS: In a prospective cohort study, routinely obtained straylight measurements (C-Quant; Oculus Optikgerate, Wetzlar, Germany) 3 months after standard phacoemulsification for either cataract or refractive lens procedures were compared. Patients were implanted with either the SeeLens MF IOL or the SN6AD1 IOL. Postoperative straylight values, visual acuity, and refractive outcomes were compared., RESULTS: The SeeLens MF IOL was implanted in 84 eyes and the SN6AD1 IOL in 79 eyes. The difference in straylight was 0.08 (P = .01), with the SeeLens MF IOL having less straylight. Postoperative CDVA was logMAR -0.03 +/- 0.06 in the SeeLens MF group, and logMAR -0.02 +/- 0.08 in the SN6AD1 group. Mean postoperative refraction was +0.01 +/- 0.43 and +0.06 +/- 0.35 D, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: The Seelens MF IOL showed a stray-light of log(s) 0.08 lower than the SN6AD1 IOL. In terms of spherical equivalent and visual acuity the lenses performed equally. More study will aid in understanding the causes and clinical impact of this difference.

4181,"Statistical shape modeling predicts patellar bone geometry to enable stereo-radiographic kinematic tracking Complications in the patellofemoral (PF) joint of patients with total knee replacements include patellar subluxation and dislocation, and remain a cause for revision. Kinematic measurements to assess these complications and evaluate implant designs require the accuracy of dynamic stereo-radiographic systems with 3D-2D registration techniques. While tibiofemoral kinematics are typically derived by tracking metallic implants, PF kinematic measurements are difficult as the patellar implant is radiotransparent and a representation of the resected patella bone requires either pre-surgical imaging and precise implant placement or post-surgical imaging. Statistical shape models (SSMs), used to characterize anatomic variation, provide an alternative means to obtain the representation of the resected patella for use in kinematic tracking. Using a virtual platform of a stereo-radiographic system, the objectives of this study were to evaluate the ability of an SSM to predict subject-specific 3D implanted patellar geometries from simulated 2D image profiles, and to formulate an effective data collection methodology for PF kinematics by considering accuracy for a variety of patient pose scenarios. An SSM of the patella was developed for 50 subjects and a leave-one-out approach compared SSM-predicted and actual geometries; average 3D errors were 0.45 +/- 0.07 mm (mean +/- standard deviation), which is comparable to the accuracy of traditional segmentation. Further, initial imaging of the patella in five unique stereo radiographic perspectives yielded the most accurate representation. The ability to predict the remaining patellar geometry of the implanted PF joint with radiographic images and SSM, instead of CT, can reduce radiation exposure and streamline in vivo kinematic evaluations.Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
4300,"[Treatment of radiogenic colitis with a rectal foam containing cortisol. Clinical and pharmacologic data] 20 patients with highly dosed irradiation of the small pelvis had been treated with Colifoam (hydrocortisone) in order to prove the therapeutic effect of radiation-induced proctitis. Over a period of three to six weeks starting in the third week of irradiation all patients received one applicator filling of rectal foam after bowel movement daily. The findings were verified by proctoscopy, histology and subjective personal well being. In ten patients we determined the daily cortisol profiles. Six months post irradiation ten patients underwent barium enema of the colon. During therapy no major complaints were recorded. The proctoscopic findings showed little changes concerning the submucous vascular walls. In none of the patients any kind of late lesion could be observed. The daily cortisol profile did not show any aberration of the physiological patterns. In conclusion the local therapy of Colifoam can be considered an additional treatment of radiation-induced colitis (proctitis).",Excluded
3723,"Targeting, toxicity, and efficacy of 2-step, pretargeted radioimmunotherapy using a chimeric bispecific antibody and 131I-labeled bivalent hapten in a phase I optimization clinical trial UNLABELLED: Safety, targeting, and antitumor efficacy of pretargeted radioimmunotherapy using anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) hMN-14 x m734 bispecific antibody (BsmAb) and 131I-di-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA)-indium hapten were evaluated in a phase I study performed on patients with CEA-expressing tumors., METHODS: Twenty-two patients with nonmedullary thyroid carcinoma (non-MTC) (group I, 13 patients) or medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) (group II, 9 patients) were enrolled. These patients received a 75 mg/m2 (11 patients) or 40 mg/m2 (11 patients) dose of BsmAb and escalating activities of (131)I-di-DTPA-indium 5 d later. Toxicity and tumor response were assessed in 20 patients who received a therapeutic (>2.2 GBq) hapten dose of radioactivity., RESULTS: The percentage of lesions detected by immunoscintigraphy after injection of the therapeutic dose of hapten was 70% on an anatomic-site basis. High bone uptake was relatively frequent. A transient grade I or II hepatic toxicity was observed in 5 patients (45%) injected with 75 mg/m2 of BsmAb and in 1 patient (11%) injected with 40 mg/m2. No other nonhematologic toxicity was observed. With 75 mg/m2 of BsmAb, hematologic toxicity was high: 5 cases of grade III or IV leukopenia (45%) and 5 cases of grade III or IV thrombopenia (45%). With a 40 mg/m2 dose of BsmAb, hematologic toxicity was reduced significantly: 3 cases of grade III or IV leukopenia (33%) and 1 case of grade III or IV thrombopenia (11%) (P = 0.02). Toxicity was significantly higher in MTC patients than in non-MTC patients (P = 0.019). Nine cases of tumor stabilization of 3 mo to more than 12 mo were observed (45%), 6 in the MTC group and 3 in the non-MTC group. The rate of disease stabilization was significantly higher with 75 mg/m2 of BsmAb (64%) than with 40 mg/m2 (22%) (P = 0.04). Human antimouse antibody elevation was observed in 1 patient (8%) and human antihuman antibody in 4 (33%)., CONCLUSION: A BsmAb dose of 40 mg/m2 and a 5-d interval appeared to be a better dose/schedule regimen, with acceptable toxicity. Under these conditions, the maximal tolerated activity was 3 GBq of 131I-di-DTPA-indium in MTC patients. In non-MTC patients, dose escalation should continue.",Excluded
4216,"A role for neutrophil elastase in the progression of solar elastosis Hairless (SKH-1) mice were mated with Beige (C57B/bb) mice to produce a hairless mouse deficient in neutrophil elastase (hhbb). These mice were exposed to 0.09J UVB irradiation for 5 months to see if neutrophil elastase was an important factor in elastin remodeling and development of solar elastoses. Analysis of peritoneal neutrophils confirmed that the hhbb mouse was deficient in elastase, retaining only 10% as much activity as the normal littermates (hhHb). Skin MPO activity was equally elevated in all the mice receiving UVB suggesting an equal influx of inflammatory cells. The absolute breaking strength of the skin in both the hhBb and hhbb mice was not altered by UVB treatment over the 5 month exposure period. Elastin quantitated biochemically as desmosine, or visualized histologically, was increased following UVB exposure in the normal mice. In the elastase deficient mice, however, the elastin fibers appeared to be unaffected by exposure to UVB irradiation at this level. The results suggest that neutrophil elastase is an important mediator in the development of solar elastosis resulting from continued exposure to UVB irradiation.",Excluded

METHOD(S): The bilateral auricles of New Zealand white rabbits were received surgical trauma and beta-active irradiation(90Sr-90Y), bFGF was then applied to the wound. The efficacy of bFGF on wound healing was compared with the control group. RESULT(S): On the 10th day after the trauma, the mean epithelalized area was (34.17 +/- 0.37) mm2 and the mean number of microvessels/high power field was (10.25 +/- 2.34) in the treated group, whereas both were (26.25 +/- 0.20) mm2 and (4.38 +/- 0.92) respectivety in the control group. There was a significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.05). On the 7th and 14th days after the trauma, the mean epithelialized area in the treated group was significantly different from that of the control group. The measurement by the image cytometry showed that the treated group had a mean nuclear peak area value of (38.28 +/- 7.23) micron 2 and the mean S-stage cell value of (31.28 +/- 10.35)%, and those of the control group were (28.02 +/- 8.13) micron 2 and (20.14 +/- 9.46)% respectively.

Of seventy-two respondents contacted, 61 (84.7%) completed the questionnaire. Twenty-eight, (45.9%) were younger than 45 years. Thirty-seven, (60.6%) had less than 10 years of experience in the laboratory. Only 28 (45.9%) had undertaken radiation protection training. Fifty-eight, (95.1%) consistently used lead aprons. Forty-seven, (77%) reported consistently using thyroid shields. Ten (16.4%) consistently used radiation protection eyeglasses, whilst 36 (59%) never used them. Thermoluminescent Dosimeter badges were consistently used in 23 (37.7%). Forty-two, (68.9%) reported having ceiling mounted lead/acrylic shields. Level of radiation exposure in the most recent one year was <=2 mSv in 14, between 2 and 20 mSv in 8 and between 20 and 30 mSv in 2, whilst 33 did not know their dose readings. The use of basic radiation protection tools as well as the knowledge and measurement of radiation exposure among interventional cardiologists working in Africa is low. The unavailability of some of the protective tools and a knowledge gap in terms of radiation protection and monitoring of self-exposure were some of the reasons for suboptimal self-protection against ionising radiation among our respondents.

4584,"Scintigraphic studies of rectal emptying in patients with constipation and defecatory difficulty We prospectively evaluated 38 adult patients with chronic constipation with and without defecatory difficulties using a newly described scintigraphic test to measure rectal emptying and compared them to 20 healthy controls. All patients underwent anorectal manometry, and 30 who complained of infrequent defecation underwent a colonic transit study using radiopaque markers. Control subjects promptly evacuated both 100 ml and 200 ml artificial stool in a characteristic fashion, but three evacuated none of the 100-ml volume and two had no evacuation of the 200-ml stool (inhibited controls). Constipated patients exhibited three patterns of emptying: (1) normal emptying of both volumes (47%); (2) poor emptying of both volumes or inhibited defecation (29%); and (3) normal emptying of the 200-ml but abnormal evacuation of the 100-ml volume (24%). An abnormal expulsion pattern during manometry occurred in 21% of patients and was strongly associated with the inhibited defecation pattern. However, defecation patterns could not be predicted on the basis of age, gender, symptoms, duration of complaints, colonic transit, or other rectal manometric parameters. Although rectal scintigraphy has potential advantages as a diagnostic test in terms of quantitation and decreased radiation exposure, the inability of the test to distinguish patients with slow transit constipation and defecatory complaints makes the potential utility of this test of uncertain value in clinical and investigative settings.",Excluded
4545,"When cervical pain is actually migraine: An observational study in 207 patients Introduction: A large proportion of migraine patients remain undiagnosed or misdiagnosed in Italy. In our experience, many migraineurs self-diagnose their condition as ""cervical pain attack"" or ""cervical pain syndrome"" (CP), assuming cervical spine pathology as the cause. We aimed to phenotype and classify the headache of patients with self-diagnosed CP, and to describe this sample of patients. Method(s): Consecutive patients aged 18 to 75 years, referred to the Headache Center of the Mondino Institute (Pavia, Italy) for a first visit for headache, completed a questionnaire about CP and were subsequently examined by an experienced clinician. Result(s): Out of 207 patients, 132 (64%) believed they suffered from CP. According to ICHD-IIIbeta criteria, these patients suffered from migraine or probable migraine in 91% of cases. The great majority of patients who believed that they suffered from CP underwent unnecessary medical exams (including radiation exposure in 40% of cases) and used treatments that were inadequate for their real diagnosis. Conclusion(s): The majority of patients with CP suffer from typical migraine.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and MTV according to metabolic volume threshold as measured by positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT), and other clinical factors, in patients with NPC. Method(s): This study was a retrospective chart review. We evaluated the association of SUVmax, MTV2.5, MTV3.0, and other clinical factors with overall survival (OS) using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression models. (MTV2.5 and MTV3.0 are the volume of hypermetabolic tissue within the regions of gross tumor volumes with a SUV value greater than the threshold values of 2.5 and 3.0, respectively.) Results: Higher MTV2.5 of 31.45 cm3 and MTV3.0 of 23.01 cm3 were associated with an increased risk of death (hazard ratio [HR] = 5.028; p = 0.029), although no significant relationship was found between SUVmax and OS. Interestingly, MTV3.0 was associated with OS in both the differentiated and undifferentiated groups, although MTV2.5 was only associated with OS in the undifferentiated group. Among the clinical parameters, only radiotherapy was associated with longer OS (HR = 12.124; p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): The MTV and radiotherapy could be prognostic values associated with OS. Particularly, MTV2.5 and MTV3.0 might be valuable metabolic parameters for predicting long-term survival in patients with NPC. Furthermore, MTV3.0 may be more useful because it can be applied irrespective of pathologic subtype.Copyright Â© 2014 ARS-AAOA, LLC.",Excluded

However, there is no consensus regarding delineation of the nodal clinical target volume (CTVn), especially for lower cervical lymph nodes. This study aimed to map the location of metastatic supraclavicular lymph nodes in thoracic esophageal carcinoma patients with supraclavicular node involvement and generate an atlas to delineate the CTVn for elective nodal radiation of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Patients and Methods: In this study, the supraclavicular regional lymph node was further divided into four subgroups. The locations of the involved supraclavicular nodes for all patients were then transferred onto a template computed tomography (CT) image. A volume probability map was then generated with nodal volumes, and was displayed on the template CT to provide a visual impression of nodal frequencies and anatomic distribution. Result(s): We identified 154 supraclavicular nodal metastases based on CT image in 96 patients. Of these, 29.2% were located in group I region, 59.7% in group II region, 10.4% in group III region, and 0.7% in group IV region. Conclusion(s): On the basis of our study, we suggest that the appropriate radiation field of CTVn should include the group I and II regions and the CTVn exterior margin along the lateral side of the internal jugular vein may be suitable.Copyright Â© 2016 Xing et al.",Excluded

Method(s): This prospective study included T1-2N0 glottic cancers treated with whole larynx VMAT (WL-VMAT). Pre- and mid-treatment 4D-computed tomography (4D-CT) and dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allowed for assessment of larynx swallowing and respiratory motion. For 10 patients with lateralized lesions, PL-VMAT plans were calculated using margins derived from 4D-CT analysis. Result(s): Twenty patients were accrued from 2014 to 2016. Mean amplitude of larynx swallowing excursion was 23 mm and 6 mm in the superior and anterior directions, respectively. Mean respiratory motion reached 4 mm and 2 mm in superior-inferior and antero-posterior directions, respectively. Pre-treatment 4D-CT analysis identified one patient with planning CT acquired during swallowing. Mid-treatment 4D-CT revealed larynx shift relative to vertebrae in 30% of cases. PL-VMAT allowed for significant reduction of mean doses to ipsilateral carotid, contralateral carotid, thyroid gland, contralateral arytenoid and larynx. Using 8 mm internal margin for PL-VMAT, swallowing resulted in clinical target volume excursion beyond 95% isodose line during <=1.5% of total treatment time in all patients. Conclusion(s): Although swallowing motion is rare, rapid and easily suppressed by patients, there is a risk of systematic miss-targeting if planning CT is acquired during swallowing. Larynx position shift relative to vertebrae occurs in 1/3 of patients over the course of radiotherapy. With soft-tissue image guidance and margins accounting for respiratory motion, PL-VMAT allows safe reduction of dose to organs at risk.Copyright Â© 2017 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists",Excluded

The autograft group were given an intradermal injection of a suspension of irradiated autologous tumour-cells mixed with intradermal BCG on the day of operation. Tests of cell-mediated immunity were repeated two weeks after operation. Five patients in each group received a course of radiotherapy to the mediastinum three weeks after operation. There was a rise in cutaneous tuberculin reactivity (P=0.08) and total leucocyte count (P=0.09) in the autograft group postoperatively with a fall in total lymphocyte and T lymphocyte counts in the non-autograft group (P less 0.05). These differences, however, were not followed by any difference in the frequency of tumour recurrence or the survival rate two years after operation. The results show that the immunological surveillance mechanism is impaired even in patients with early bronchial carcinoma and that it is possible to overcome postoperative immunological depression with specific immunotherapy combined with BCG.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of RT and routine endoscopic surveillance, hypothesizing that most patients are curable with RT alone. We queried a single institution database at a tertiary referral cancer center for patients with H pylori-independent GML treated with RT between 1991 and 2017. Response was assessed by follow-up endoscopies (EGDs) starting 10 to 12 weeks post-RT. Computed tomography scans were also part of the follow-up program, and positron emission tomography was added when clinically appropriate. We identified 178 patients (median age, 63 years; range, 25-89 years); 86% had stage I disease, 7% had stage II disease, and 7% had stage IV disease. Median RT dose was 3000 cGy over 20 fractions. Ninety-five percent of patients exhibited complete pathologic response on posttreatment EGD. Two patients experienced grade 3 toxicity, and 2 patients experienced in-field secondary malignancies. Over a median follow-up of 6.2 years, 9.6% experienced local failures, and 11.8% developed distant sites of disease.

4646,"Predicting late effects of pelvic radiotherapy: is there a better approach? PURPOSE: Significant chronic symptoms following pelvic radiotherapy occur more frequently than commonly realized. Predictive factors for the development of late symptoms are poorly defined. Moderate sustained acute (cumulative) toxicity might predict severe late effects better than peak reaction., METHODS AND MATERIALS: To determine prospectively whether peak or cumulative gastrointestinal (GI) acute symptoms better predict late symptoms in patients receiving pelvic radiotherapy. Symptom scores were measured weekly from the start of radiotherapy, and at 1 year using the Modified Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire-Bowel subset. The possible prognostic impact of patient-related factors was explored., RESULTS: Three hundred and eight patients were recruited. 100 were excluded due to lack of follow-up data at one year resulting from death, too ill, stoma, relapsed, non-response or withdrawal. A further 15 were excluded for incomplete data, leaving 193 patients with evaluable data. Of these, 28 had GI, 101 urological, and 64 gynecological cancers. Patients' median age was 65 years (range, 23-82), and they were treated with median 60 Gy dose for a median of 6 weeks. Univariate analysis revealed a significant association between cumulative acute symptom scores and scores at 1 year (p < 0.001), which was dose-independent (p < 0.001). Acute peak and 1-year scores were not associated (p = 0.431). The correlation coefficient between cumulative acute symptoms and symptoms at 1 year was 0.367 and for peak acute symptoms was weaker at 0.057. Patients with an abnormal body mass index and current smokers were more likely to experience worse symptoms at 1 year., CONCLUSION: Cumulative acute symptoms are more predictive of late symptoms than peak acute changes in score. This association is independent of the radiotherapy dose delivered and is suggestive of a consequential late effect. Copyright Â© 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Methods A retrospective cohort study of patients who had undergone thyroidectomy and RAI for PTC was undertaken. We divided the cohort into those who had <=3 GBq (75 mCi) RAI (group A) and those who had >3 GBq (75 mCi) RAI (group B). The primary outcome measure was the rate of structural recurrence. Results Of 1,171 patients with PTC from 1990 to 2012 who were followed for a mean of 60 months, 970 with T1-T3 tumors underwent RAI in addition to thyroidectomy. The mean first dose of RAI was 2.5 GBq (68 mCi) for group A (n = 153) and 4.7 GBq (127 mCi) for group B (n = 817; P <.001). The overall rate of recurrence was 8%. When corrected for T stage, the recurrence rates were not different for T1 tumors (2% group A versus 4% group B; P =.54) nor for T2 and T3 tumors (P =.36 and.55, respectively). On multivariate analysis, the dose of RAI was not an independent predictor for structural recurrence. Conclusion Decreasing the dose of RAI at initial ablation for patients with pT1-pT3 PTC does not seem to be associated with an increased risk of structural cancer recurrence. Â© 2013 Mosby, Inc.

3741,"Pretherapeutic dosimetry before 131P therapy of benign thyroid disease: A clinical practice assessment of dosimetric parameters Aim: To compare uptake measurements and different methods for the pretherapeutic determination of the effective thyroidal 131I half life (Teff) to the results of posttherapeutic dosimetric measurements. Patients, methods: Retrospective study of 1538 patients who received their first RIT in our department for autonomous thyroid nodules (ATN), autonomous multinodular goiter (AMG) or Graves' disease (GD) between November 1999 and January 2011. Pretherapeutic measurements were performed at any combination of 24 h, 48 h and 6 days after 131I administration. Post-therapy dosimetric measurements were performed in 12 h intervals until discharge. Teff was determined through monoexponential curve fitting. Result(s): Pretherapeutic Teff values based on measurements at 24 h and 48 h, 24 h and 6 d, 48 h and 6 d as well as on day 24 h, 48 h and 6 d yielded implausible (< 2 d or > 8 d) values for Teff, in 60.4%, 25.7%, 29.1 and 21.4% of available calculations, respectively. The plausible results showed significant, clinically relevant and sometimes considerable overestimations of Teff. Using empirically determined fixed disease specific Teff values resulted in a better congruence between the pre- and posttherapeutic dosimetry results. 24 h measurements were marginally more accurate than 48 h ones in AMG and GD whereas 48 h measurements were marginally more accurate in ATN; these differences are however not clinically relevant. 6 d measurements are clearly less accurate than those after 24 h or 48 h. Conclusion(s): In ATN, AMG and GD, pretherapeutic dosimetry can be performed by a single uptake measurement at 24 h or 48 h using a fixed, disease specific value for Teff. Additional later measurements do not yield a further clinically relevant contribution to accuracy of pretherapeutic dosimetry.Copyright Â© Schattauer 2015.",Excluded
4357,"Extracorporeal irradiation of tumorous calvaria: a case series OBJECT When intracranial tumors invade the overlying skull, gross resection typically includes removal of the involved bone. Methods used to repair the resulting structural defect in the cranium include artificial prostheses, allogeneic bone grafts, and autoclaving the autologous graft. The authors have previously reported a case involving high-dose extracorporeal ionizing radiation to treat the tumorous calvaria intraoperatively, followed by reimplantation of the treated bone flap. In this paper the authors report the long-term follow-up of that case, as well as results of using extracorporeal irradiation of tumorous calvaria (EITC) for an additional 20 patients treated similarly. METHODS The decision to undergo EITC was typically anticipated preoperatively, but determined intraoperatively, if upon inspection the bone flap was invaded by tumor. The bone flap was then delivered to the radiation oncology department, where a total dose of 120 Gy was delivered, using a clinical linear accelerator, over a period of approximately 15 minutes. After the intracranial tumor resection was completed, the irradiated craniotomy bone flap was reimplanted and the wound was closed in a standard fashion. A retrospective review of patients who had undergone EITC was performed for evidence of calvarial tumor recurrence or other complications. RESULTS Since the originally reported case, 20 additional patients have received EITC during craniotomy for invasive tumors. Eighteen (86%) of 21 patients were diagnosed with meningioma: 12 (67%) with WHO Grade I, 5 (28%) with WHO Grade II, and 1 with WHO Grade III (6%). The remaining 3 patients presented with dural-based B-cell lymphoma with extensive adjacent bone invasion (n = 2) and metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung (n = 1). Follow-up of the 21 patients ranged from 1 to 132 months, with a mean of 41 months and a median of 23 months. No patients have experienced tumor recurrence, infection associated with the treated calvaria, or evidence of bone flap resorption. CONCLUSIONS Calvaria reconstructions represent an important component in structural and cosmetic outcome following craniectomy for tumorous bone. The authors' long-term experience with EITC has been excellent with no local tumor recurrence or complications. Therefore, EITC represents an excellent and efficient option for cranial reconstruction in such patients.",Excluded
4140,"Biodegradable esophageal stents in benign and malignant strictures - A single center experience Background and study aims: Biodegradable (BD) esophageal stents were recently developed mainly for refractory benign strictures, but experience and available literature are limited. Patients and Methods: This was a retrospective observational study. All patients who had BD stents inserted due to refractory benign esophageal strictures or malignant strictures, or were awaiting radical radiotherapy/chemotherapy or neo-adjuvant therapy and esophagectomy between March 2011 and July 2015 were included. Result(s): Stent placement was successful in all patients. Ten patients with benign strictures (3 male, median age 80.5 years, IQR: 68.75-89.5) were followed-up for a median of 171.5 weeks (IQR: 24-177.25). The interval between dilatations prior to the first BD stent placement (median: 34.25 days, IQR: 23.06-48.29) was significantly shorter than the interval between the first BD stent placement and the first intervention required (median: 149.5 days, IQR: 94.25-209.5) and this difference was statistically significant (P=0.012). Ten patients with esophageal cancer (8 male, median age: 69 years, IQR: 59.25-80.75) were included and they were followed up for a median of 36 weeks (IQR: 26-58). Only 1 completed radical radiotherapy successfully, but developed refractory post-radiotherapy stricture. No one proceeded to esophagectomy and 50% required a self-expanding metal stent (SEMS) at a median of 134 days (IQR: 100-263) following stent placement. Conclusion(s): BD stents were successfully deployed in both benign and malignant strictures. They offered a prolonged dilatation-free interval in benign strictures, yet in the majority of patients, strictures recurred. In malignant strictures, stent patency was similar to that of benign strictures, which suggests a potential value in ensuring adequate oral intake during oncologic therapy. In our cohort, however, use of stents did not contribute to improved outcome.Copyright Â© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart, New York.",Excluded

4508,"Geometric Image Biomarker Changes of the Parotid Gland Are Associated With Late Xerostomia Purpose To identify a surrogate marker for late xerostomia 12 months after radiation therapy (Xer12m), according to information obtained shortly after treatment. Methods and Materials Differences in parotid gland (PG) were quantified in image biomarkers (DELTAIBMs) before and 6 weeks after radiation therapy in 107 patients. By performing stepwise forward selection, DELTAIBMs that were associated with Xer12m were selected. Subsequently other variables, such as PG dose and acute xerostomia scores, were added to improve the prediction performance. All models were internally validated. Results Prediction of Xer12m based on PG surface reduction (DELTAPG-surface) was good (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.82). Parotid gland dose was related to DELTAPG-surface (P<.001, R2 = 0.27). The addition of acute xerostomia scores to the DELTAPG-surface improved the prediction of Xer12m significantly, and vice versa. The final model including DELTAPG-surface and acute xerostomia had outstanding performance in predicting Xer12m early after radiation therapy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.90). Conclusions Parotid gland surface reduction was associated with late xerostomia. The early posttreatment model with DELTAPG-surface and acute xerostomia scores can be considered as a surrogate marker for late xerostomia.Copyright Â© 2017 The Author(s)",Excluded
4765,"Feasibility and Safety of Ultrasonography Guidance and Flank Position during Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy Purpose: Percutaneous nephrolithotomy is generally performed using fluoroscopy, which is associated with exposure to radiation. Another drawback of fluoroscopic guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy is the prone position, which is not suitable for all patients. In this study we evaluated the feasibility, safety and efficacy of ultrasound guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy with the patient in the flank position. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 603 patients with a mean +/- SD age of 50.9 +/- 13 years were included in this study from December 2010 to July 2016. Access to the collecting system and tract dilation were performed under ultrasound guidance. Perioperative data on the stone-free rate, operative time, length of stay and complication rates were recorded. Result(s): Successful access was achieved in all but 1 patient. Mean operative time was 56.6 +/- 6.5 minutes. Complete stone clearance was achieved in 529 patients (87.7%) and Clavien-Dindo grade 3 complications were noted in 17 (2.8%). Blood transfusion was necessary in 43 patients (7.1%). However, bleeding was self-limited in all cases and did not require angioembolization. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge this is the largest series of ultrasound guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy with the patient in the flank position. Unlike in other studies we used this procedure in all patients irrespective of stone burden, renal anomaly and body habitus. Ultrasound guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy has outcomes comparable to those of conventional percutaneous nephrolithotomy and it is not associated with radiation exposure. Furthermore, anesthesia while in the flank position might be less harmful in some patients, including those with obesity or cardiopulmonary comorbidities.Copyright Â© 2018 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.",Excluded
4750,"Induction chemotherapy with docetaxel plus cisplatin (TP regimen) followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy with TP regimen versus cisplatin in treating locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma Background and Objective: Clinical trials on docetaxel plus cisplatin (DDP) (TP regimen) in treating nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) are still uncertain due to limited samples. This study was to compare the short-term efficacy and toxicity of induction chemotherapy with TP regimen followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy with TP regimen versus DDP in treating locally advanced NPC. Method(s): Fifty-seven patients with stage T3-4N2-3M0 NPC diagnosed pathologically from December 2005 to December 2006 were randomized into TP group (30 patients) and DDP group (27 patients). Both groups received TP regimen as induction chemotherapy with docetaxel (70 mg/m2) on Day 1 and DDP (80 mg/m2) on Day 2, repeating every 21 days for two cycles. For concurrent chemotherapy, TP group were administered docetaxel (60 mg/ m2) on Day 1 and DDP (80 mg/m2) on Day 2; DDP group were administered DDP (80 mg/m2) on Day 1. Both schedules were repeated every 21 days for two cycles. Linear accelerator was used as radioactive source. Irradiation field was designed with CT-simulation and conventional fractions. Result(s): The 57 patients received 111 cycles of induction chemotherapy, and 53 of them received 103 cycles of concurrent chemotherapy; four patients ceased induction chemotherapy and three ceased concurrent chemotherapy. All patients completed radiotherapy. The major toxicity of induction chemotherapy was hematologic toxicity; the main toxicities of concurrent chemoradiotherapy were hematologic toxicity and mucositis. The occurrence rates of Grade 3-4 leucopenia and Grade 3-4 neutropenia were significantly higher in TP group than in DDP groups (p < 0.05). In concurrent chemoradiotherapy, the application rate of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) was significantly higher in TP group than in DDP group (100% vs. 72.0%, p < 0.05). After concurrent chemoradiotherapy, the complete remission (CR) rates of the nasopharynx and regional lymph nodes were 93.3% and 92.9% in TP group, and were 96.3% and 91.3% in DDP group (p > 0.05). Conclusion(s): The short-term efficacy of induction chemotherapy with TP regimen followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy with TP regimen on locally advanced NPC is similar to that of TP regimen followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy with DDP. The toxicity of the former schedule is severer than that of the latter, but it is tolerable with the use of G-CSF. The long-term efficacy of induction chemotherapy with TP regimen followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy with TP regimen need to be further studied. Â© 2009 Landes Bioscience.",Excluded
3867,"Influence of muscle strength to weight ratio on functional task performance Existing models of muscle deconditioning such as bed rest are expensive and time-consuming. We propose a new model utilizing a weighted suit to manipulate muscle strength, power, or endurance relative to body weight. The aims of the study were to determine as to which muscle measures best predict functional task performance and to determine muscle performance thresholds below which task performance is impaired. Twenty subjects performed seven occupational astronaut tasks (supine and upright seat egress and walk, rise from fall, hatch opening, ladder climb, object carry, and construction board activity), while wearing a suit weighted with 0-120 % of body weight. Models of the relationship between muscle function/body weight and task completion time were developed using fractional polynomial regression and verified with pre- and post-flight astronaut performance data. Spline regression was used to identify muscle function thresholds for each task. Upright seat egress and walk was the most difficult task according to the spline regression analysis thresholds. Thresholds normalized to body weight were 17.8 N/kg for leg press isometric force, 17.6 W/kg for leg press power, 78.8 J/kg for leg press work, 5.9 N/kg isometric knee extension and 1.9 Nm/kg isokinetic knee extension torque. Leg press maximal isometric force/body weight was the most reliable measure for modeling performance of ambulatory tasks. Laboratory-based manipulation of relative strength has promise as an analog for spaceflight-induced loss of muscle function. Muscle performance values normalized to body weight can be used to predict occupational task performance and to establish relevant strength thresholds.",Excluded
3714,"Impact of the Number of Metastatic Tumors Treated by Stereotactic Radiosurgery on the Dose to Normal Brain: Implications for Brain Protection PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the number of brain lesions for which stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) was performed on the dose volume relationships in normal brain., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Brain tissue was segmented using the patient's pre-SRS MRI. For each plan, the following data points were recorded: total brain volume, number of lesions treated, volume of brain receiving 8 Gy (V8), V10, V12, and V15., RESULTS: A total of 225 Gamma Knife R treatments were included in this retrospective analysis. The number of lesions treated ranged from 1 to 29. The isodose for prescription ranged from 40 to 95% (mean 55%). The mean prescription dose to tumor edge was 18 Gy. The mean coverage, selectivity, conformity, and gradient index were 97.5%, 0.63, 0.56, and 3.5, respectively. The mean V12 was 9.5 cm3 (ranging from 0.5 to 59.29). There was no correlation between the number of lesions and brain V8, V12, V10, or V15. There was a direct and statistically significant relationship between the brain volume treated (V8, V10, V12, and V15) and total volume of tumors treated (p < 0.001). In our study, the integral dose to the brain exceeded 3 J when the total tumor volume exceeded 25 cm3., CONCLUSIONS: The number of metastatic brain lesions treated bears no significant relationship to total brain tissue volume treated when using SRS. The fact that the integral dose to the brain exceeded 3 J when the total tumor volume exceeded 25 cm3 is useful for establishing guidelines. Although standard practice has favored using whole brain radiation therapy in patients with more than 4 lesions, a significant amount of normal brain tissue may be spared by treating these patients with SRS. SRS should be carefully considered in patients with multiple brain lesions, with the emphasis on total brain volume involved rather than the number of lesions to be treated. Copyright Â© 2017 S.

4705,"New type of hip arthroplasty failure related to modular femoral components: Breakage at the neck-stem junction Total hip replacements (THR) with modular femoral components (stem-neck interface) make it possible to adapt to extramedullary femoral parameters (anteversion, offset, and length) theoretically improving muscle function and stability. Nevertheless, adding a new interface has its disadvantages: reduced mechanical resistance, fretting corrosion and material fatigue fracture. We report the case of a femoral stem fracture of the female part of the component where the modular morse taper of the neck is inserted. An extended trochanteric osteotomy was necessary during revision surgery because the femoral stump could not be grasped for extraction, so that a long stem had to be used. In this case, the patient had the usual risk factors for modular neck failure: he was an active overweight male patient with a long varus neck. This report shows that the female part of the stem of a small femoral component may also be at increased failure risk and should be added to the list of risk factors. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of this type of failure. Â© 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.",Excluded
3814,"Outcomes and toxicity following Yttrium-90 radioembolization for hepatic metastases from neuroendocrine tumors-a single-institution experience Background: The prognosis of patients with hepatic metastases from neuroendocrine tumors (NET) is generally good, and radioembolization with Yttrium-90 microspheres is a locoregional therapy that is used in efforts to improve hepatic disease control and survival. This study aims to describe the survival outcomes and toxicities associated with radioembolization for hepatic-predominant metastatic NET in a large single-institution cohort. Method(s): A total of 59 patients underwent radioembolization for metastatic NET with hepatic predominant disease at a single academic center. Patient outcomes were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and toxicities were detailed and described. Ten patients within the cohort underwent post-treatment dosimetric analysis using PET-MRI and normal liver dosimetry was correlated with hepatic fibrosis and toxicity. Result(s): Median overall survival from time of radioembolization in the patient cohort was 31 months, and the 1- and 2-year overall survival was 80.4% and 65.6% respectively. Median hepatic progression-free survival and overall progression-free survival were 18 and 13 months, respectively. Three patients died of hepatic failure that was possibly therapy-related. Ten patients underwent evaluation of post-treatment dosimetry following radioembolization. In patients who did not develop hepatotoxicity or hepatic fibrosis, mean dose to normal liver was 25.4 Gy, while the mean liver dose in patients who experienced toxicity (hepatic fibrosis in n=2 and death from hepatic failure in n=1) was 59.1 Gy. Conclusion(s): Overall survival following radioembolization for hepatic metastases from NET is excellent; however, deaths that are potentially treatment-related have been observed. Preliminary data regarding dose to normal liver is suggestive of a relation between dosimetry and toxicity, however further work is required to further elucidate the mechanism, correlation with dosimetry, as well as additional patient and tumor factors that may predispose these patients to toxicity.Copyright Â© Journal of Gastrointestinal Oncology.

3929,"Fractional photothermolysis for the treatment of acne scars: a report of 27 Korean patients OBJECTIVES: Atrophic post-acne scarring remains a therapeutically challenging condition despite various currently available technologies. Fractional photothermolysis (FP) is a novel concept of cutaneous resurfacing which induces non-contiguous microscopic thermal injury. The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of FP in the treatment of acne scars in Asian patients., METHODS: A total of 27 Korean patients (Fitzpatrick skin types IV or V) with moderate to severe facial acne scars received three to five sessions of FP treatment (Fraxel Laser; Reliant Technologies, CA, USA), each spaced 3-4 weeks apart. Standardized digital photographs were obtained before each treatment and 3 months after the final treatment. In addition, the patients' perceived degrees of improvement were assessed 3 months after the final treatment using a five-point grading scale., RESULTS: FP led to marked improvement in the appearance of acne scars at 3 months post-treatment. Patients' self-assessed degrees of improvement were as follows: excellent improvement in eight patients (30%), significant improvement in 16 patients (59%), and moderate improvement in three patients (11%).

3788,"Characteristics of High-Performing Radiologists Within Medicare Quality Programs Purpose: The aim of this study was to assess radiologists' performance on Medicare quality measures and identify physician characteristics potentially influencing such scores. Method(s): Medicare quality scores reported by US radiologists in 2015 were obtained from CMS. Associations were explored with publicly available physician characteristic data. Result(s): Overall, 15,045 radiologists reported 40,427 Medicare quality scores encompassing 25 claims measures, 18 registry measures, and 2 qualified clinical data registry (QCDR) measures. Claims measures included reporting fluoroscopic times (n = 10,152; mean score, 80.3 +/- 27.6), carotid ultrasound stenosis (n = 8,940; mean score, 86.8 +/- 20.6), inappropriate mammography use of ""probably benign"" (n = 8,083; mean score, 0.4 +/- 3.3), mammography reminders (n = 7,229; mean score, 86.6 +/- 29.0), bone scintigraphy correlation (n = 2,712; mean score, 76.0 +/- 27.0), and line-related infection prevention (n = 2,226; mean score, 83.3 +/- 27.4). Registry measures were reported by <=17 radiologists. The two QCDR measures were dose index registry participation (n = 246; mean score, 99.5 +/- 1.4) and mammography recall rate (n = 77; mean score, 9.0 +/- 5.6). Higher scores were observed for radiologists in larger practices (strongest independent predictor), in subspecialized practices, in academic practices, in the South and West, and with fewer years in practice. The fluoroscopic exposure times measure had the best performance scores by musculoskeletal and interventional radiologists, carotid Doppler measure by abdominal radiologists, mammography measures by breast radiologists, bone scintigraphy measure by musculoskeletal and nuclear medicine radiologists, and line infection measure by interventionalists. The dose registry participation QCDR measure had near perfect performance across generalists and subspecialists. Conclusion(s): Current Medicare performance metrics favor radiologists in larger practices and subspecialized radiologists, possibly reflecting support infrastructures and the narrow focus of most metrics, respectively. These findings may assist targeted data-driven reporting by radiologists and guide efforts to refine existing and develop new metrics.Copyright Â© 2018 American College of Radiology",Excluded

4830,"Acute massive gastrointestinal bleeding: Detection and localization with arterial phase multi-detector row helical CT Purpose: To prospectively evaluate accuracy of arterial phase multi-detector row helical computed tomography (CT) for detection and localization of acute massive gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, with angiography as reference standard. Material(s) and Method(s): Institutional review board approved this study; written informed consent was obtained from each patient or patient's family after procedures, including radiation dose, were explained. Twenty-six consecutive patients (17 men, nine women; age range, 18-89 years) had acute massive GI bleeding (defined as requirement of transfusion of at least 4 units of blood during 24 hours in the hospital or as hypotension with systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg) and underwent arterial phase multi-detector row CT before angiography. Scans were obtained during arterial phase to identify extravasation of contrast material with attenuation greater than 90 HU within bowel lumen; this finding was considered diagnostic for active GI bleeding. Presence of contrast medium extravasation in each anatomic location was recorded. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy of multi-detector row CT for detection of acute GI bleeding were assessed. Accuracy for localization of acute GI bleeding was assessed by comparing locations of active bleeding at both multi-detector row CT and angiography in each patient who had active bleeding. Result(s): Arterial phase multi-detector row CT deplicted extravasation of contrast material in 21 of 26 patients. Overall location-based sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive and negative predictive values of multi-detector row CT for detection of GI bleeding were 90.9% (20 of 22), 99% (107 of 109), respectively. Overall patient-based accuracy of multi-detector row CT for detection of acute GI bleeding was 88.5% (23 of 26). The location of contrast material extravasation on multi-detector row CT scans corresponded exactly to that of active bleeding on angiograms in all patients with contrast medium extravasation at both multi-detector row CT and angiography.

Method(s): Seventy-six patients who underwent unenhanced computed tomography (CT) and dual-energy (DE)-CT angiography after surgical clipping of 85 intracranial aneurysms were included in the study. Diagnostic performances of VNC and TNC images were compared with respect to sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values. The results of quantitative and qualitative analyses were compared between VNC and TNC images. Radiation doses were also compared between VNC and TNC images. Result(s): Diagnostic performance of VNC images was lower than that of TNC images; however, addition of contrast-enhanced images improved diagnostic performance. Image noise and mean attenuation of VNC images were significantly higher than those of TNC images in the centrum semiovale, cerebellum, and pons. The quality of VNC images was excellent or sufficient (85.5% for observer 1, 85.5% for observer 2), and complete acceptance of VNC images was achieved in 64.5% for observer 1 and in 71.0% for observer 2; however, the addition of contrast-enhanced images increased the level of acceptance (92.0% for observer 1, 90.9% for observer 2). Clip artifacts were significantly lower in VNC images than in TNC images. CT dose index, dose-length product, and effective dose were significantly lower without TNC images. Conclusion(s): VNC images showed lower diagnostic performance and image quality, and higher image noise than TNC images; however, VNC images could reduce clip artifacts and radiation doses.Copyright Â© 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
4330,"The role of FDG-PET/CT in detection of gastric cancer recurrence AIM: The purpose of this study was to retrospectively determine the efficacy and usefulness of 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) in detecting and re-staging recurrent gastric cancer patients with clinical or radiological suspicion of recurrence. METHOD(S): This retrospective study has been conducted on 41 patients who were treated gastrectomy and postoperatively radiotherapy or/and chemotherapy. Histopathologic diagnosis revealed 2 signet ring cell carcinoma, and 39 adenocancer. All of the patients referred to our department for restaging due to clinical findings, tumor markers and/or radiologic suspicion of recurrence during follow-up.27 out of 41 were male and 14 female. The mean age was 58+/-10 years (range 30-75 years). FDG-PET/CT was applied twice to all patients. The first FDG- PET/CT was for staging and restaging. The second was for restaging due to clinical findings, tumor markers and/or radiologic suspicion of recurrence during follow-up. The standard of reference for tumor recurrence consisted of histopathologic confirmation or clinical follow-up information for at least 6 month after FDG-PET/CT examinations. RESULT(S): Cause of the first FDG-PET/CT application was due to staging in 24 patients and restaging in 17. FDG-PET/CT was negative in 14 patients and positive in 27. Out of 27, 7 patients had recurrence in gastric area, 7 patients had both recurrence and metastases and, 13 patients had metastases Histological verification was done in 11 patients who were re-operated after the first FDG-PET/CT. The second FDG-PET/CT application to 27 patients was for the assessment of the response to the treatment applied. 4 patients had full metabolic recovery, 11 had progression and 12 had regression. For 17 patients whose first FDG-PET/CT results were negative, the second FDG-PET/CT application was due to restaging for the suspicion of metastases in other radiologic modalities in 6 and high tumor marker levels in 8 patients. The results for the 17 patients were metastases in 5 and negative in 9 patients CONCLUSION(S): FDG-PET/CT is helpful in confirming the presence of recurrence particularly in patients who were highly suspicious of recurrence, because of its high positive predictability.",Excluded

All patients underwent hearing tests including pure tone audiometry and impedance audiometry before and after RT., RESULTS: The dosage difference to the middle ear cavity and isthmus between these two groups was statistically significant (p<0.05). The difference in hearing test results between these two groups was also statistically significant (p<0.05). If we limited the dose to the middle ear cavity under 34 Gy and the dose to the isthmus under 53 Gy with IMRT, we may decrease radiation-induced OME even with the larger 2.25 Gy fraction size., CONCLUSIONS: IMRT may have better protected the middle ear function compared with the CRT technique, even with larger fraction sizes than for the conventional CRT technique.",Excluded

3809,"Which patients are prone to undergo disproportionate recurrent CT imaging and should we worry? Purpose: To identify the spectrum of patients who undergo disproportionate recurrent computed tomography (CT) imaging, and to explore the cumulative effects of radiation exposure and intravenously injected contrast agents in these patients. Method(s): This retrospective study investigated all patients who had undergone 40 or more CT scans at a tertiary care center between 2007-2017. Result(s): Fifty-six patients who had undergone a median of 47 (range: 40-92) CT scans were included. The main reason for CT scanning in all patients was oncological, and 55 patients (98.2 %) had metastatic disease. Twenty-six patients (45.6) had received chemotherapy, 35 (62.5 %) radiation therapy, 38 (67.9 %) targeted therapy, 12 (21.4 %) liver tumor microwave ablation, 44 (78.6 %) major surgery, and 34 (60.7 %) had participated in a therapeutic trial. Mean cumulative effective dose was 187.4 mSv (range: 120.7-278.4 mSv). Median estimated radiation-induced lifetime attributable risk (LAR) of cancer incidence was 1.0 % (range: 0.20-2.36 %). Mean estimated radiation-induced LAR of cancer mortality was 0.68 % (range: 0.18-1.37 %). Mean cumulative volume of intravenously injected iomeprol was 2339 mL (range: 540-3605 mL). Three patients (5.4 %) had developed severely decreased kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate between 15 and 29 mL/min per 1.73 m2 for at least 3 months). Conclusion(s): Patients with metastatic disease who experience a relatively long survival may be prone to undergo disproportionate recurrent CT imaging. The non-negligible CT radiation-induced cancer risk and mortality should be taken into account in these patients, while the effect of cumulatively administered CT contrast agents on kidney function requires further investigation.Copyright Â© 2020 The Author(s)",Excluded

4622,"Swallowing functional outcomes and nutritional status in head and neck cancer radiotherapy: longitudinal study OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationships between swallowing functional outcomes and nutritional status in patients with head and neck cancer undergoing radiotherapy (RT). METHOD(S): This longitudinal study included 122 patients. Data were collected at three time points: baseline (T1), the third week of RT (T2) and the completion of RT (T3). The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events was used to assess the symptom of dysphagia and other toxicities; the MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI) was used to assess the patient-perceived swallowing functional outcomes; the nutritional status was evaluated by the weight ratio and the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA). The generalised estimating equation (GEE) was used to measure the correlation of MDADI with the weight ratio or PG-SGA and also to analyse the influential factors of swallowing functional outcomes. RESULT(S): The participants' acute dysphagia rates were 5.7% at T1, 69.7% at T2 and 77.9% at T3. The swallowing functional outcomes worsen over RT (p<0.001) and were associated with weight ratio (beta=0.032, p=0.008) and PG-SGA (beta=-0.115, p<0.001). GEE models showed that patients with cancer of the pharynx region, advanced stage, chemoradiotherapy and high RT dose perceived worse swallowing functional outcomes. Oral mucositis, pharynx mucositis and salivary gland inflammation were positively correlated with swallowing functional outcomes, and the pharynx mucositis presented the highest absolute value of beta. CONCLUSION(S): The swallowing functional outcomes were negatively correlated with nutritional status. Healthcare professionals should identify early on the population at higher risk and focus on multiple toxicities, especially the management of pharynx mucositis, to improve nutritional status.Copyright Â© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

This prospective study was designed to evaluate the treatment outcomes and treatment-related complications of patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated with escalated radiation doses., METHODS: A total of 118 consecutive patients with T4 classification (1992 American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system), histology-proven nonmetastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma were treated with radiotherapy alone between 1992 and 1997 in a medical center in southern Taiwan. Thirty-two of them were enrolled into a prospective study of dose escalation and were irradiated to a total of 81 Gy. The other 86 patients received a total of 70.2 Gy. Potentially significant patient-related and treatment-related parameters were analyzed for their prognostic significance. Radiation-related complications were recorded and analyzed., RESULTS: The 5-year local progression-free rates were 61%, and 61% for patients receiving 70.2 Gy and 81 Gy, respectively (P > 0.05). The incidences of xerostomia, hearing impairment, and temporal radionecrosis were significantly higher for those receiving 81 Gy. The 5-year complication-free rates of patients receiving 70.2 Gy and 81 Gy were 14% versus 2% for xerostomia (P = 0.0070), 50% versus 30% for hearing impairment (P = 0.0198), and 91% versus 82% for temporal radionecrosis (P = 0.0400)., CONCLUSIONS: For patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated with radiotherapy alone, dose escalation to 81 Gy failed to show benefits on local control rate.

Taste ability was measured by the taste threshold for the four basic tastes (sweet, sour, salt, and bitter qualities) plus another taste of ""umami"" quality using a filter-paper-disc method in patients before, during, and after radiotherapy (RT)., RESULTS: All tastes declined on the fifth week after the start of RT and improved on the 11th week. Anatomic pathologic analyses in rats revealed that taste buds diminished completely on the sixth day after irradiation of 15 Gy in a single fraction, and the appearance of taste buds returned almost to the preirradiation state on the 28th day., CONCLUSIONS: The main cause of taste disorder resulting from RT was believed to be a disappearance of taste buds and not damage to the taste nerves.",Excluded

We found a higher use of 20 Gy as a component of CMT after 2010, the year of publication of the GHSG HD10 trial results., Introduction: Treatment for early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) involves radiotherapy (RT), chemotherapy, or combined modality therapy (CMT). We analyzed reduction of RT dose in CMT, particularly in the context of German Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG) HD10 randomized trial results of 2010. Patients and Methods: The National Cancer Data Base was queried for patients with stage I-II HL receiving CMT. RT dose and associated characteristics were analyzed. Stage I and absence of B symptoms were used as a surrogate for early-stage favorable disease. Result(s): Of 31,301 patients with stage I-II HL, 11,457 received CMT between 2004 and 2015. Using the surrogate defined above, 1955 patients (17.1%) were classified as having favorable disease. The majority (61.6%) received 30-36 Gy, while 7.0% received 20 Gy. The provision of 20 Gy was more common in stage I patients (12.3% vs. 5.4% in stage II) and at academic facilities (10.8% vs. 6.3%-8.9% at other facilities). Use of 20 Gy (vs. 30-36 Gy) was less likely with thorax site (odds ratio [OR] 0.43 vs. head and neck), stage II disease (OR 0.41), and B symptoms (OR 0.33). Notably, the use of 20 Gy increased dramatically after 2010 (the year of publication of GHSG HD10 trial results), with rates of 12.3% in 2010-2015 versus 0.1% in 2004-2009 (OR 6.3, P <.001). This was even more pronounced in cases of favorable early-stage disease, with 25.5% after 2010 versus 2.8% before 2010 (OR 13.2, P <.001). The use of doses > 36 Gy decreased over a corresponding time period (OR 0.44, P <.001).

The availability of equipment that provides photon and electron beams of energies from 4 MeV to 25 MeV permits optimal dose distribution throughout the treatment volume. Since no difference in the biological effectiveness of electrons compared with megavoltage photons has been demonstrated in laboratory studies, there is no hesitation in combining electrons with photons. The selection of the various energies, the combination of electrons with photons, and the ratio of the given doses of each beam depend on the location of the tumor and the maximum depth to be treated. With the use of one beam alone, a combination of 25 MeV and 4 to 6 MeV photon beams, or a combination of photons and electrons, the most effective treatment plan with the available beams can be designed for any clinical situation.",Excluded
4031,"Radiation dose among different cardiac and vascular invasive procedures: The RODEO study Background Interventional radiology and cardiology procedures contribute significantly to the collective dose of radiation exposure from medical interventions. Recent and dedicated studies comparing directly these procedures in term of patient radiation exposure are lacking. Our aim was to compare radiation exposure among different interventional procedures performed under fluoroscopic guidance. Methods The RODEO study (NCT: 02972736) is an international observational retrospective multicenter study enrolling all patients undergoing diagnostic or interventional procedures performed by different interventional operators (i.e. radiologists, interventional cardiologists or electrophysiologists) in 6 centers, without exclusion criteria. The primary end-point of the study was the comparison of dose area product (DAP) among interventional cardiology, electrophysiology or interventional radiology procedures. Results A total of 17,711 procedures were included in the study: 13,522 interventional cardiology, 2352 electrophysiology and 1864 interventional radiology procedures. The highest DAP values were observed for interventional radiology procedures (74 Gy * cm2 [Interquartile range 27-178 Gy * cm2]), followed by interventional cardiology (40 Gy * cm2 [22-78 Gy * cm2]) and electrophysiology procedures (13 Gy * cm2 [4-44 Gy * cm2], p < 0.0001). In term of specific procedures, the highest DAP values were observed in structural or valvular cardiac procedures (134 Gy * cm2 [51-260 Gy * cm2]) whereas the lowest DAP values in pacemaker insertion (11 Gy * cm2 [4-28 Gy * cm2]). Conclusion In this large multicenter study, the highest radiation exposure was observed in procedures performed by interventional radiologists.

4282,"Effect of fluoroscopic X-rays combined with iodinated radiographic contrast media on human hematological parameters Introduction: Fluoroscopic X-rays are widely used for examinations around the world. Technicians often use an iodinated radiographic contrast media during fluoroscopic X-ray examinations. Objective(s): This study examined the impact on hematological parameters for human blood and morphology of red blood cells that were exposed to fluoroscopic X-ray combined with iodinated radiographic contrast media, i.e., iopromid, iohexol, and iodixanol. Method(s): Blood samples from male and female subjects were incubated with 5 mgI/mL of iodinated radiographic contrast media for 5 min, then were irradiated using fluoroscopic X-rays (70 kV, 0.8 mA) for 10, 30, and 60 min. Hematological parameters of the blood samples were determined by a clinical service center, and morphology of red blood cells was examined by light microscope. Comparison of mean values of hematological parameters based on the student's t-tests between irradiated blood alone, iodinated radiographic contrast media-incubated blood alone, and combination-exposed blood to each corresponding control blood was performed. Result(s): These data showed no change in the hematological parameters and morphology of red blood cells in irradiated blood alone, iodinated radiographic contrast media-incubated blood alone, and combination-exposed blood in both male and female subjects when compared to control blood at all fluoroscopic X-ray times.

3868,"Reduction of operator radiation dose by a pelvic lead shield during cardiac catheterization by radial access: Comparison with femoral access Objectives: This study sought to determine the efficacy of patient pelvic lead shielding for the reduction of operator radiation exposure during cardiac catheterization via the radial access in comparison with the femoral access. Background(s): Cardiac catheterization via the radial access is associated with significantly increased radiation dose to the patient and the operator. Improvements in radiation protection are needed to minimize this drawback. Pelvic lead shielding has the potential to reduce operator radiation dose. Method(s): We randomly assigned 210 patients undergoing elective coronary angiography by the same operator to a radial and femoral access with and without pelvic lead shielding of the patient. Operator radiation dose was measured by a radiation dosimeter attached to the outside breast pocket of the lead apron. Result(s): For radial access, operator dose decreased from 20.9 +/- 13.8 muSv to 9.0 +/- 5.4 muSv, p < 0.0001 with pelvic lead shielding. For femoral access, it decreased from 15.3 +/- 10.4 muSv to 2.9 +/- 2.7 muSv, p < 0.0001. Pelvic lead shielding significantly decreased the dose-area product-normalized operator dose (operator dose divided by the dose-area product) by the same amount for radial and femoral access (0.94 +/- 0.28 to 0.39 +/- 0.19 muSv x Gy-1 x cm-2 and 0.70 +/- 0.26 to 0.16 +/- 0.13 muSv x Gy-1 x cm-2, respectively). Conclusion(s): Pelvic lead shielding is highly effective in reducing operator radiation exposure for radial as well as femoral procedures. However, despite its use, radial access remains associated with a higher operator radiation dose. Â© 2012 American College of Cardiology Foundation.",Excluded

Only few studies have investigated the detailed clinical subtypes or radiographic changes based on serologic status; double (RF/ACCP) positive (+ve), RF or ACCP +ve, double negative (-ve) (seronegative, SN). We aimed to analyze the clinical and radiographic features of RA patients with robust disease activity, based on their serologic status. Method(s): RA patients registered in the Korean College of Rheumatology Biologics Registry (KOBIO), a nationwide inception cohort, were analyzed. Data regarding patient demographics, comorbidity, disease activity, medication, imaging and laboratory exams were utilized. After adjusting for gender, age, disease duration, and smoking history, we analyzed the association of seropositivity and bony erosion (hands and feet X-ray), and the association of the ACCP titer and joint damage, both at baseline (initiation of biologics) presented as odd ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval [95% CI]. Result(s): Data of 1198 RA patients were investigated. Mean age was 57.2 years, and disease duration was 8.3 +/- 7.6 years. Mean DAS28-ESR was 5.71, and erosion were found in 40.1% of patients. Being ACCP+ve was significantly associated with bony erosions (OR 1.69 [95% CI 1.13-2.52], p= 0.0096), compared with RF+ve (OR 1.03 p= 0.83), or RF+ve/ACCP+ve (OR 2.19 [95% CI 1.19-4.01], p= 0.012). Of note, being ACCP+ve/RF-ve was strongly associated with radiographic damage (OR 4.93 [95% CI 2.29-10.61], p< 0.0001) in our analysis (figure). In contrast, a multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that baseline ACCP titers were not positively associated with joint damage; a multivariate linear regression model revealed disease duration (estimate -3.95, p< 0.0001) and RF titer (estimate +0.0665, p= 0.0157) were associated with ACCP titers. Conclusion(s): Our data demonstrate the significance of ACCP in predicting radiographic damage in established Korean RA patients with persistently high disease activity. Longitudinal studies would be needed to clarify the impact of ACCP titers on radiographic progression. (Figure Presented).",Excluded

We aimed to evaluate the occurrence of aortic dilation and related predictors in patients with CoA using dual-source computed tomography (DSCT). Method(s): Fifty-three patients with CoA identified by DSCT were retrospectively reviewed. Aortic diameters were measured at six different levels and standardized as z-scores based on the square root of body surface area. Coarctation site-diaphragm ratio (CDR) was used to describe the degree of narrowing. A total of 26 patients were included in mild group (CDR > 50%) and 27 in severe group (CDR < 50%) according to the severity of coarctation. Student's t-test and Spearman correlation coefficients, univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to assess the risk factors including age, degree of narrowing and other malformations for aortic dilation. Result(s): Severe group had significantly larger z-scores of ascending aorta (2.41 +/- 0.39 vs. 2.10 +/- 0.57, p < 0.05) and post-coarctation aorta (2.17 +/- 0.48 vs. 1.68 +/- 0.43, p < 0.001) compared with mild group. Degree of coarctation was associated with the z-scores of the ascending aorta (r = - 0.356, p < 0.05) and post-coarctation aorta (r = - 0.414, p < 0.05). Collateral circulation was related to the z-scores of ascending aorta (r = 0.375, p < 0.05). Increased severity of coarctation was independent predictor of ascending (odds ratio 7.46; 95% CI 1.19-46.76; p < 0.05) and post-coarctation aortic dilation(odds ratio 8.42; 95% CI 1.84-38.56; p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Ascending and post-coarctation aortic diameters or dilations were both associated with the degree of coarctation.

4409,"Comparison of safety and effectiveness between the right and left radial artery approach in percutaneous coronary intervention Introduction and objectives: There is a paucity of data comparing the left radial approach (LRA) and right radial approach (RRA) for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in all-comers populations and performed by operators with different experience levels. Thus, we sought to compare the safety and clinical outcomes of the RRA and LRA during PCI in ""real-world"" patients with either stable angina or acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Method(s): To overcome the possible impact of the nonrandomized design, a propensity score was calculated to compare the 2 radial approaches. The study group comprised 18 716 matched pairs with stable angina and 46 241 with ACS treated with PCI and stent implantation between 2014 and 2017 in 151 tertiary invasive cardiology centers in Poland (the ORPKI Polish National Registry). Result(s): The rates of death and periprocedural complications were similar for the RRA and LRA in stable angina patients. A higher radiation dose was observed with PCI via the LRA in both clinical presentations (stable angina: 1067.0 +/- 947.1 mGy vs 1007.4 +/- 983.5 mGy, P = .001; ACS: 1212.7 +/- 1005.5 mGy vs 1053.5 +/- 1029.7 mGy, P = .001). More contrast was used in LRA procedures but only in ACS patients (174.2 +/- 75.4 mL vs 167.2 +/- 72.1 mL, P = .001). Furthermore, periprocedural complications such as coronary artery dissection (0.16% vs 0.09%, P = .008), no-reflow phenomenon (0.65% vs 0.49%, P = .005), and puncture site bleeding (0.09% vs 0.05%, P = .04) were more frequently observed with the LRA in ACS patients. There was no difference in mortality between the 2 groups (P = .90). Conclusion(s): Our finding of poorer outcomes with the LRA may be related to lower operator experience with this approach. While both the LRA and RRA are safe in the setting of stable angina, the LRA was associated with a higher rate of periprocedural complications during PCI in ACS patients.

3945,"Comparison of dynamic expiratory CT with bronchoscopy for diagnosing airway malacia: A pilot evaluation Objective: To assess the accuracy of dynamic expiratory CT for detecting airway malacia using bronchoscopy as the diagnostic ""gold standard."" Material(s) and Method(s): A computerized hospital information system was used to retrospectively identify all patients with bronchoscopically proven airway malacia referred for CT airway imaging at our institution during a 19-month period. CT was performed within I week of bronchoscopy. All patients were scanned with a standard protocol, including end-inspiratory and dynamic expiratory volumetric imaging, using an eight-detector multislice helical CT scanner. For both CT and bronchoscopy, malacia was defined as >= 50% expiratory reduction of the airway lumen. CT and bronchoscopic findings were subsequently jointly reviewed by the radiologist and bronchoscopist for concordance. Result(s): Twenty-nine patients (12 men and 17 women; mean age, 60 years; range, 36 to 79 years) comprised the study cohort. CT correctly diagnosed malacia in 28 of 29 patients (97%). The most common presenting symptoms were dyspnea in 20 patients (69%), severe or persistent cough in 16 patients (55%), and recurrent infection in 7 patients (24%). The estimated radiation dose (expressed as dose-length product) for the dual-phase study is 508 mGy-cm, which is comparable to a routine chest CT. Conclusion(s): Dynamic expiratory CT is a highly sensitive method for detecting airway malacia and has the potential to serve as an effective, noninvasive test for diagnosing this condition.",Excluded

3988,"Tumor accumulation of NIR fluorescent PEG-PLA nanoparticles: impact of particle size and human xenograft tumor model Cancer therapies are often terminated due to serious side effects of the drugs. The cause is the nonspecific distribution of chemotherapeutic agents to both cancerous and normal cells. Therefore, drug carriers which deliver their toxic cargo specific to cancer cells are needed. Size is one key parameter for the nanoparticle accumulation in tumor tissues. In the present study the influence of the size of biodegradable nanoparticles was investigated in detail, combining in vivo and ex vivo analysis with comprehensive particle size characterizations. Polyethylene glycol-polyesters poly(lactide) block polymers were synthesized and used for the production of three defined, stable, and nontoxic near-infrared (NIR) dye-loaded nanoparticle batches. Size analysis based on asymmetrical field flow field fractionation coupled with multiangle laser light scattering and photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) revealed narrow size distribution and permitted accurate size evaluations. Furthermore, this study demonstrates the constraints of particle size data only obtained by PCS. By the multispectral analysis of the Maestro in vivo imaging system the in vivo fate of the nanoparticles next to their accumulation in special red fluorescent DsRed2 expressing HT29 xenografts could be followed. This simultaneous imaging in addition to confocal microscopy studies revealed information about the accumulation characteristics of nanoparticles inside the tumor tissues. This knowledge was further combined with extended size-dependent fluorescence imaging studies at two different xenograft tumor types, the HT29 (colorectal carcinoma) and the A2780 (ovarian carcinoma) cell lines. The combination of two different size measurement methods allowed the characterization of the dependence of nanoparticle accumulation in the tumor on even rather small differences in the nanoparticle size. While two nanoparticle batches (111 and 141 nm in diameter) accumulated efficiently in the human xenograft tumor tissue, the slightly bigger nanoparticles (diameter 166 nm) were rapidly eliminated by the liver.

Methods 330 consecutive patients with early-stage laryngeal carcinoma were treated from 1/1989 to 5/2011, including 282 conventional radiotherapy (CRT) and 48 CS-IMRT patients. The median follow-up was 43 (CS-IMRT) and 66 (CRT) months. Results There was no difference in local failure rates comparing patients undergoing CS-IMRT with CRT, with 3-year local control rates of 88% vs. 89%, respectively (p = 0.938).

Material(s) and Method(s): Prospectively collected registry data were retrospectively analyzed to compare the procedural, short- and long-term outcomes of consecutive F-BEVAR performed from January 2010 to December 2014 under standard mobile C-arm versus hybrid room guidance in a high-volume aortic center. Result(s): A total of 262 consecutive patients, including 133 patients treated with a mobile C-arm equipped operating room and 129 with a HOR guidance, were enrolled in this study. Patient radiation exposure and contrast media volume were significantly reduced in the HOR group. Short-term clinical outcomes were improved despite higher case complexity in the HOR group, with no statistical significance. At a median follow-up of 63.3 months (Q1 33.4, Q3 75.9) in the C-arm group, and 44.9 months (Q1 25.1, Q3 53.5, p=0.53) in the HOR group, there was no statistically significant difference in terms of target vessel occlusion and limb occlusion. When the endograft involved 3 or more fenestrations and/or branches (complex F-BEVAR), graft instability (36% vs 25%, p=0.035), reintervention on target vessels (20% vs 11%, p=0.019) and total reintervention rates (24% vs 15%, p=0.032) were significantly reduced in the HOR group. The multivariable Cox regression analysis did not show statistically significant differences for long-term death and aortic-related death between the 2 groups.

The radiation dose to the pelvis was 45 Gy/25 fractions with a boost dose of 5.4 Gy/3 fractions. The total dose to the tumour bed was 50.4 Gy/28 fractions. Clinical response was evaluated by MRI prior to surgery. Patients underwent surgery 4-6 weeks after completion of radiotherapy. The endpoints of this study were clinical response, pathological response, and toxicities. Results. Twenty patients have been enrolled. Median age was 59.5 years (range 37-72). Male:female ratio was 1.22:1. All patients had clinical T3 N positive disease except one who hadT4 disease. After receiving concurrent chemoradiotherapy, severe toxicities (diarrhoea, fatigue, anorexia,and neuropathy) were found in four patients (20%). One patient refused surgery after preoperative treatment. Response rate was evaluated in 18 patients. Clinical response rate was 83.4% (cCR 55.6%). Pathological response rate was 70.6% (pCR 5.9%). Eleven patients had microscopic residual disease. Most patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. Two patients developed recurrent disease and finally died. Discussion. Neoadjuvant concurrent capecitabine-oxaliplatin radiotherapy in Thai patients with locally advanced rectal cancer demonstrated excellent response rate and tolerable toxicities.",Excluded

4919,"Guided Punctures with Ultrasound Volume Navigation in Percutaneous Transforaminal Endoscopic Discectomy: A Technical Note Objective: Ultrasound volume navigation (UVN) has been widely used for accurate guidance and decreased radiation exposure. However, few studies have focused on the clinical significance of UVN in guiding percutaneous puncture in percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy (PTED). We evaluated UVN to guide percutaneous puncture in PTED. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 12 patients (8 men and 4 women), who had undergone PTED with the help of UVN or fluoroscopic guidance for lumbar disc herniation from November 2017 to December 2017. Result(s): The age of these 12 patients range was 26-71 years, and the body mass index range was 18.19-26.91 kg/m2. Of the 12 patients, 6 were in UVN group and 6 were in fluoroscopy group. The mean number of punctures was 1.00 in UVN group and 3.83 in fluoroscopy group. The mean exposure time was 3.60 and 13.80 seconds in UVN and fluoroscopy groups, respectively. The mean operation time was 48.17 minutes and 61.33 minutes in UVN and fluoroscopy groups, respectively. A positive relationship was found between operation time and exposure time (P < 0.05). All patients achieved excellent or good clinical outcomes. The Oswestry Disability Index and visual analog scales for leg pain and back pain all showed significant improvement after the procedure (P < 0.05). None of patients experienced a complication. Conclusion(s): UVN decreased the number of puncture attempts, radiation exposure, and operation time compared with fluoroscopic guidance in PTED. Therefore, UVN is a feasible and efficient method for guiding percutaneous puncture in PTED.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
4039,"Experience with higher doses of radiotherapy in the postoperative treatment of glioblastoma multiforme: A single institutional report Background: Glioblastoma multiforme is a highly aggressive tumour with median survival of approximately 14 months. Management consists of maximal surgical resection followed by postoperative chemoradiation with concurrent then adjuvant temozolamide. The standard radiotherapy dose is 60 Gy in 2-Gy fractions. Most tumour recurrences occur within the previous irradiation field. Regimens designed to deliver higher radiation dose to improve local control and enhance survival warrant investigation. Method(s): We report a single institutional experience of treatment of consecutive patients with glioblastoma multiforme, treated with resection, postoperative radiotherapy followed by concurrent and/or adjuvant chemotherapy. Finding(s): Of the 80 patients who entered the study, 68 completed the treatment course; there were 45 (66.2 %) male and 23 (33.8%) female patients with a mean age at diagnosis of 48.97 +/- 12.85 (21-75) years. At a median follow up of 19 months, 39 (57.3%) patients had evidence of tumour progression and 36 (52.9%) patients had died. Median overall survival for all patients was 16 months and progression-free survival for all patients was 6.02 months. All potential prognostic factors were analysed to evaluate their effects on overall survival. age of 50 years or younger, concurrent and adjuvant chemotherapy, and extent of surgery were significant. We noted a lower progression rate among patients who received higher doses of radiotherapy (>60 Gy; p = 0.03). Overall survival was also increased, but this was not significant. Interpretation(s): This study suggests that higher radiation doses (>60 Gy) can improve local control and potentially survival; prospective multicentric studies should be done to evaluate the effect of higher doses of conformal radiation on the outcomes of patients with glioblastoma multiforme.",Excluded
4224,"A comparison of leg length discrepancy with function and satisfaction scores after cemented total hip replacement Introduction: Total Hip replacement (THR) is considered an effective surgical intervention for the relief of chronic pain and functional disability. However, a proportion of patients experience a poor outcome. Leg length discrepancy (LLD) can be introduced, or not corrected, at the time of operation. Previous research has shown that patients with LLD reported a lower functional outcome than those with equal leg lengths. We report on a cohort of 146 patients with a minimum of 3-year follow-up who underwent cemented total hip replacement. We have compared the data when looking at independent variables including age, sex, BMI, femoral head size, offset of stem, grade of surgeon, surgical approach and cup type. Material(s) and Method(s): 146 patients were followed up for a mean of 3.66 years (range 3.25-4.5 years). There were 96 females and 45 males. The mean age at surgery was 77 years (range 50-95 years). All patients were reviewed in clinic or contacted by postal survey for assessment of function and satisfaction. The pre-operative X-rays were compared with early post-operative X-rays. LLD was assessed radiologically according to the method of Woolson, as modified by Konyves and Bannister, on plain sequential AP pelvis radiographs by 2 independent observers. Result(s): Mean LLD was 2 mm (range -10 mm to +14 mm). No significant association was found for the above independent variables. The overall stem alignment was satisfactory. A non-significant reduction in function (measured by oxford hip score, SF- 12 and satisfaction score) was noted in association with LLD of greater than 5 mm. Discussion(s): We report radiological LLD after cemented THR. This has previously been reported as being linked to function. We found a non-significant correlation between reported function and satisfaction with LLD. However 94% of our observed limb lengths were within 1 cm of the other side. There was no significant association between LLD and other independent variables.",Excluded
4724,"Three-dimensional anatomic analysis and navigation templates for C1 pedicle screw placement perpendicular to the coronal plane: a retrospective study OBJECTIVE: To explore the corridor for atlas pedicle screw placement perpendicular to the coronal plane and to develop patient-specific navigation templates for pedicle screw placement., METHODS: This study is a retrospective analysis. A total of 71 patients (41 males and 30 females) were involved in this study from June 2016 to June 2018, and they were divided into a template group (39 patients) and a conventional group (32 patients). The CT-based 3D reconstruction models were analyzed in the template group. From the perspective of the 3D atlas in a coronal view, the pedicle corridor was obtained. Taking the center of the tangential circle of the pedicle as the entry point, we simulated screw placement perpendicular to the coronal plane. Then, the individual navigation template was designed and used in surgery. In the conventional group, free-hand pedicle screw placement was performed perpendicular to the coronal plane. The diameter of the maximum tangential circle and screw length of the pedicle corridor were measured in the template group. The surgical time, radiation exposure time, screw grading criteria and so on were evaluated and compared between the two groups after surgery., RESULTS: ;The diameter of the maximum tangential circle and the distance between the entry point and posterior tubercle were significantly greater in males than in females. The operation was successfully completed in all patients, without aggravation of nerve injury, and the follow-up was 12-20 months, with an average of 15.6 months. A total of 78 screws were inserted in the template group, and 64 screws were inserted in the conventional group. The surgical times in the template group and conventional group were 76.47+/-24.44 min and 125.63+/-36.41 min, respectively. The radiation exposure times in the template group and conventional group were 3.51+/-1.77 and 10.15+/-4.95, respectively, and there was a significant difference between the two groups. In the template group, the deviation in the screw entry point and screw angle were 1.92+/-1.67 mm and 2.08+/-1.98degree, respectively. The medial angle deviation between the left and right sides was 2.71+/-1.88degree in the template group, which was significantly less than the deviation of 3.76+/-2.22degree in the conventional group., CONCLUSION: A pedicle screw trajectory perpendicular to the coronal plane can be quickly obtained based on the perspective of 3D models. The technique of screw placement perpendicular to the coronal plane assisted by navigation templates has a shorter operative time, lessintraoperative fluoroscopy and a higher safety of screw placement than traditional surgery.",Excluded
4893,"Computed tomography-guided interstitial 125iodine seed brachytherapy as a salvage therapy for recurrent spinal bone metastases after radiotherapy Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of permanent 125I seed interstitial brachytherapy in patients with recurrent spinal bone metastases under CT guidance. Material(s) and Method(s): From November 2010 to November 2015, 17 patients who met the inclusion criteria were retrospectively reviewed. There were 12 men and 5 women with a median age of 56 years (range 24-83 years). There were 10 lung carcinomas, 4 esophagus carcinomas , 1 liver cancer, 1 breast cancer, and 1 kidney carcinoma . 6 had squamous cell carcinoma, 8 were adenocarcinoma, 3 others respectively. All patients suffered varying degrees of pain before seed implantation, ranging from 1 to 9 on the NRS. Mean NRS scores before implantation was 6.88 +/- 2.25 respectively. Regarding neurologic function, 2 grade Bs, 2 grade Cs, 3 grade Ds and 10 grade Es. All patients with recurrent spinal bone metastases had received conventional EBRT. During the procedure, patients remained in a prone position to facilitate CT guidance. We measured the pedicle angle and the distance of the puncture point. The depth of the puncture point to the pedicle was also borne in mind. Needles were inserted through the anterior portion of the lateral images, in the interval between the pedicle and the vertebral body, or with a pedicle or paraspinal approach, respectively. Seeds were implanted 1.0 cm from the spinal cord, to minimize radiation damage. Immediately after the procedure, a CT scan was obtained to confirm the location of the seeds in case of any need for supplementary implantation. The number of 125I seeds implanted ranged from 18 to 62 (median 30) with specific activity of 0.5-0.8 mCi (median 0.75 mCi). The post-plan showed that the actuarial D90 of 125I seeds were 60.5-154 Gy(median 106 Gy). The follow-up period ranged from 1 to 59 months (median 7 months). The local control rate was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): For all patients, the 1-,2-year overall survival rates were 74.8%, 49.8%, respectively, with a median of 15 months (range, 1-59 months), the 1-, 2-year local control rates were 54.1%, 36.1%, respectively, with a median of 14 months (range, 1-59 months). During the follow-up period, 5.9% (1/17) died from metastases, 5.9% (1/17) died from developed local recurrence,11.8% (2/17) died from primary tumors, 5.9% (1/17) died from another reason, while 70.6% (12/17) remained alive,100% experienced pain relief, and mean NRS scores after implantation was 2.06 +/- 2.08 respectively. Normal or improved ambulation, without more than Frankel grade 3 radiation myelopathy.

4058,"Human brain imaging and radiation dosimetry of 11C-N-desmethyl-loperamide, a PET radiotracer to measure the function of P-glycoprotein UNLABELLED: P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a membrane-bound efflux pump that limits the distribution of drugs to several organs of the body. At the blood-brain barrier, P-gp blocks the entry of both loperamide and its metabolite, N-desmethyl-loperamide (N-dLop), and thereby prevents central opiate effects. Animal studies have shown that (11)C-dLop, compared with (11)C-loperamide, is an especially promising radiotracer because it generates negligible radiometabolites that enter the brain. The purposes of this study were to determine whether (11)C-dLop is a substrate for P-gp at the blood-brain barrier in humans and to measure the distribution of radioactivity in the entire body to estimate radiation exposure., METHODS: Brain PET scans were acquired in 4 healthy subjects for 90 min and included concurrent measurements of the plasma concentration of unchanged radiotracer. Time-activity data from the whole brain were quantified using a 1-tissue-compartment model to estimate the rate of entry (K(1)) of radiotracer into the brain. Whole-body PET scans were acquired in 8 healthy subjects for 120 min., RESULTS: For brain imaging, after the injection of (11)C-dLop the concentration of radioactivity in the brain was low (standardized uptake value, approximately 15%) and stable after approximately 20 min. In contrast, uptake of radioactivity in the pituitary was about 50-fold higher than that in the brain. The plasma concentration of (11)C-dLop declined rapidly, but the percentage composition of plasma was unusually stable, with the parent radiotracer constituting 85% of total radioactivity after approximately 5 min. The rate of brain entry was low (K(1) = 0.009 +/- 0.002 mL.cm(-3). min(-1); n = 4). For whole-body imaging, as a measure of radiation exposure to the entire body the effective dose of (11)C-dLop was 7.8 +/- 0.6 muSv/MBq (n = 8)., CONCLUSION: The low brain uptake of radioactivity is consistent with (11)C-dLop being a substrate for P-gp in humans and confirms that this radiotracer generates negligible quantities of brain-penetrant radiometabolites. In addition, the low rate of K(1) is consistent with P-gp rapidly effluxing substrates while they transit through the lipid bilayer. The radiation exposure of (11)C-dLop is similar to that of many other (11)C-radiotracers. Thus, (11)C-dLop is a promising radiotracer to study the function of P-gp at the blood-brain barrier, at which impaired function would allow increased uptake into the brain.",Excluded
4460,"Vitreoretinal lymphoma: Changing trends in diagnosis and local treatment modalities at a single institution Introduction: The purpose of this study was to report the changing trends in treatment (external beam radiotherapy [EBRT] and intravitreal chemotherapy) of VRL and treatment outcomes at a single institution. Material(s) and Method(s): A retrospective chart review of vitreous biopsy proven patients was performed. The data analysis included demographics, systemic lymphoma status, ocular symptoms, clinical and immunocytological findings, treatment methods, and response (intravitreal methotrexate 300 mug/0.05 mL, 1000 mug/0.1 mL of rituximab and EBRT 36-45 Gy) and ocular and systemic lymphoma outcomes at last follow-up. Result(s): Twelve eyes of 8 patients had intraocular B-cell lymphoma (median age, 61 years; range, 50-83). Central nervous system non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (CNS-NHL) was present in 7 of 8 patients. Most common ocular symptoms were diminution of vision in 4 and floaters in 3 patients. Iritis and uveitis were fournd in 6 eyes and vitritis in 11 eyes. Retinal infiltrates were present in 8 eyes. Immunocytology revealed elevated levels of interleukin (IL)-10 (12,783.5 pg/mL), IL-6 (26.7 pg/mL), and IgH gene rearrangement. Three patients were treated with EBRT, 6 eyes with intravitreal methotrexate (median, 9.5; range, 2-15), and 2 eyes with intravitreal rituximab injections (median, 4; range, 2-6). Two patients developed marked keratitis because of methotrexate toxicity. At median follow-up of 33.5 months (range, 4-96), VRL had resolved in 7 eyes and persistent in 5 eyes. One patient died because of advanced CNS-NHL. Conclusion(s): Intravitreal chemotherapy provided good control rates for VRL patients in our limited series. Patients with associated CNS-NHL had poorer outcomes. Â© 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
4549,"Commercial sunscreen formulations: UVB irradiation stability and effect on UVB irradiation-induced skin oxidative stress and inflammation Evidence shows that sunscreens undergo degradation processes induced by UV irradiation forming free radicals, which reduces skin protection. In this regard, the biological effects of three commercial sunscreen formulations upon UVB irradiation in the skin were investigated. The three formulations had in common the presence of benzophenone-3 added with octyl methoxycinnamate or octyl salycilate or both, which are regular UV filters in sunscreens. The results show that formulations F1 and F2 presented partial degradation upon UVB irradiation. Formulations F1 and F2 presented higher skin penetration profiles than F3. None of the formulations avoided UVB irradiation-induced GSH depletion, but inhibited reduction of SOD activity, suggesting the tested formulations did not present as a major mechanism inhibiting all UVB irradiation-triggered oxidative stress pathways. The formulations avoided the increase of myeloperoxidase activity and cytokine production (IL-1beta and TNF-alpha), but with different levels of protection in relation to the IL-1beta release. Concluding, UVB irradiation can reduce the stability of sunscreens, which in turn, present the undesirable properties of reaching viable skin. Additionally, the same SPF does not mean that different sunscreens will present the same biological effects as SPF is solely based on a skin erythema response. This found opens up perspectives to consider additional studies to reach highly safe sunscreens. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded
4503,"Comprehensive toxicity risk profiling in radiation therapy for head and neck cancer: A new concept for individually optimised treatment Background and purpose: A comprehensive individual toxicity risk profile is needed to improve radiation treatment optimisation, minimising toxicity burden, in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. We aimed to develop and externally validate NTCP models for various toxicities at multiple time points. Material(s) and Method(s): Using logistic regression, we determined the relationship between normal tissue irradiation and the risk of 22 toxicities at ten time points during and after treatment in 750 HNC patients. The toxicities involved swallowing, salivary, mucosal, speech, pain and general complaints. Studied predictors included patient, tumour and treatment characteristics and dose parameters of 28 organs. The resulting NTCP models were externally validated in 395 HNC patients. Result(s): The NTCP models involved 14 organs that were associated with at least one toxicity. The oral cavity was the predominant organ, associated with 12 toxicities. Other important organs included the parotid and submandibular glands, buccal mucosa and swallowing muscles. In addition, baseline toxicity, treatment modality, and tumour site were common predictors of toxicity. The median discrimination performance (AUC) of the models was 0.71 (interquartile range: 0.68-0.75) at internal validation and 0.67 (interquartile range: 0.62-0.71) at external validation. Conclusion(s): We established a comprehensive individual toxicity risk profile that provides essential insight into how radiation exposure of various organs translates into multiple acute and late toxicities. This comprehensive understanding of radiation-induced toxicities enables a new radiation treatment optimisation concept that balances multiple toxicity risks simultaneously and minimises the overall toxicity burden for an individual HNC patient who needs to undergo radiation treatment.Copyright Â© 2021 The Author(s)",Excluded
3979,"Characteristics of induced mutations in offspring derived from irradiated mouse spermatogonia and mature oocytes The exposure of germ cells to radiation introduces mutations in the genomes of offspring, and a previous whole-genome sequencing study indicated that the irradiation of mouse sperm induces insertions/deletions (indels) and multisite mutations (clustered single nucleotide variants and indels). However, the current knowledge on the mutation spectra is limited, and the effects of radiation exposure on germ cells at stages other than the sperm stage remain unknown. Here, we performed whole-genome sequencing experiments to investigate the exposure of spermatogonia and mature oocytes. We compared de novo mutations in a total of 24 F1 mice conceived before and after the irradiation of their parents. The results indicated that radiation exposure, 4 Gy of gamma rays, induced 9.6 indels and 2.5 multisite mutations in spermatogonia and 4.7 indels and 3.1 multisite mutations in mature oocytes in the autosomal regions of each F1 individual. Notably, we found two types of deletions, namely, small deletions (mainly 1~12 nucleotides) in non-repeat sequences, many of which showed microhomology at the breakpoint junction, and single-nucleotide deletions in mononucleotide repeat sequences. The results suggest that these deletions and multisite mutations could be a typical signature of mutations induced by parental irradiation in mammals.",Excluded
4882,"Prognostic factors in set of limited disease small-cell lung cancer patients treated with chemoradiotherapy Background: Combined chemoradiotherapy is the standard treatment for patients with limited disease small cell lung cancer (LD SCLC). Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is recommended in case of complete remission (CR) since late 90' and for partial remissions last few years. Early concurrent radiation (RT) has been found as slightly beneficial at cost of higher toxicity. Use of granulocyte colonystimulating factor (G-CSF) for prophylaxis of febrile neutropenia is controversial in SCLC. We analyzed patients and treatment related variables for prognostic significance in long term follow-up of regional treatment protocol since 2000 in VFN, University Hospital Prague. Method(s): The planned treatment consisted of 4 to 6 courses of platinum/etoposide chemotherapy (CT) and thoracic irradiation of 45 to 66 grays with one daily fraction. Patients with CR or later with PR were assigned to PCI (30Gy in 15 fractions) at the end of treatment. Sequential strategy was preferred due to age over 70 or worse performance status. In some patients G-CSF prophylaxis was used. Influence of factors as sex, age, timing and dose of RT, dose and regimen of CT, G-CSF delivery, treatment response and PCI yes or not, were tested for survival impact. Result(s): Eighty consecutive patients were treated between Jan-2000 and Sep-2010, 49 men, 31 women, median age 62 years (range 49 - 80). CT in median dose of 5 cycles was predominantly cisplatin based, RT in median dose of 57.6 Gy was given concurrently in 56% and sequentially in 33% of patients. Thoracic RT was omitted in 9 patients, for poor performance status or progressive disease in 6 and due to radical surgery in 3 subjects. Esophagitis grade 3-4 occurred in 42%, significantly more often in concurrent RT (60% vs. 19%, p< 0.01). Response rate (RR) 90% and CR 62% in concurrent group did not differ significantly from sequential one (RR 88%, CR 52%). The median survival was 19.5 months and 3- and 5-year survival was 27% in all the patients. Survival differences in groups according to sex, age, stage, carbo or cisplatin and partial versus complete treatment response did not differ significantly. Significantly longer survival was observed in groups with PCI, with concurrent radiation or in patients treated with G-CSFs. Median time to progression was 14 months for the whole group. Significantly longer time to progression was in CR patients, concurrent RT, PCI patients and G-CSF delivery.

3855,"Time sequence of cancer occurrence. Implications in low level radiation risk assessment A total of 8 229 C57 Black mice of both sexes were randomly assigned to various groups. In some groups, mice aged 33 +/- 3 days were submitted to either sham, neutron or cobalt external radiation at 32, 45, 63, 88 and 123 mGy or at 18, 25, 36 and 51 cGy dose levels, respectively. In other groups, mice either at birth or weaning, were injected with tritiated thymidine or tritiated water, or were given tritiated water as drinking water for the entire lifespan. The main purpose of the experiment was to investigate the low dose-response relationship of cancer induction, especially leukemogenesis and to evaluate the excess risk, using actuarial age-specific rates. Following neutron or cobalt exposure, the phenotypic occurrence of lymphocytic lymphomas was earlier in appearance and higher in yield during the first decades of lifespan in irradiated groups versus matching controls, whereas such occurrence was markedly lower in yield at a later age. Under parallel experimental conditions, induction of reticulum cell lymphomas, however, was uniformly enhanced throughout the entire lifespan. Induction rates of all tumors (reticular and solid) pooled were significantly increased, and more so following cobalt than neutron irradiation. In mice injected with tritiated thymidine, the overall tumor incidence was increased monotonically throughout the lifespan. In mice exposed to tritiated water, the incidence of lymphocytic lymphomas was markedly increased throughout the lifespan, whereas no such effect was observed for reticulum cell tumors. In the light of tumor data analysis, it appears that selection of a particular type of tumor as a dependent variable for dose-response assessment cannot disregard the primary modulation of the whole tumor spectrum. In C57 Black murine leukemogenesis, the shape and structure of the dose-response regression curve over the entire lifespan does not fit the linear-quadratic model. It is, however, theorized that our data are consistent with the two-mutation clonal expansion model, assuming creation of initiated cells which are added to the pool of spontaneously occurring initiated cells and implying that the excess risk is initially high at early age and then decreases with increasing age following exposure. It is concluded that murine radiocarcinogenesis investigation may contribute to improving the assessment as well as understanding the underlying mechanisms of low level radiation hazards.

Method(s): We present a prospective and consecutive series of 288 patients evaluated between April 2005 and November 2013 undergoing DMRPF. Of the total patient number, 10 (3.47%) were male. Result(s): Due to the coexistence of pathology in different parts of the pelvic floor - more often in women - diagnostic confirmation is necessary so that the appropriate treatments can be accomplished in one single surgical approach. Outlet obstruction syndrome (OOS) was present in 262 patients. In 239 (82.4%) patients, an anterior rectocele was confirmed. In 55 (23%) of these cases, an anterior retrocele was the only finding. In 207 patients, other abdomino-pelvic anatomical dislocations were found that had not been clinically suspected or detected during physical examination. Conclusion(s): DMRPF is a study that does not expose patients to ionizing radiation providing dynamic interactive anatomical and functional data at rest and during provocative manoeuvers. Multi-plane imaging provides a clear view of the organs in the pelvis and the pelvic floor muscles which is not always accurately detected on physical examination. Currently, DMRPF is the recommended study designed to evaluate pelvic floor dysfunction as it can be used to confirm presumptive diagnoses and to quantify the impact of the dislocation of pelvic floor viscera, to define intestinal emptying dynamics, and to outline inadequate relaxation of the puborectalis during straining and simulated evacuation.",Excluded
3948,"The risk of level IB nodal involvement in oropharynx cancer: Guidance for submandibular gland sparing irradiation Purpose Xerostomia remains a common side effect of head and neck irradiation. Conflicting data exist regarding the likelihood of level IB involvement for patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (OPSCC), and data are limited on this risk in patients with human papillomavirus-positive disease. This study examined surgically treated OPSCC to determine the risk of pathologic level IB nodal involvement and to identify a cohort of patients in whom ipsilateral level IB radiation therapy may be safely omitted. Methods and materials A total of 102 submandibular nodal dissections were identified (92 ipsilateral and 10 contralateral) in 92 patients from 2010 to 2016 in those undergoing primary surgical treatment and dissection of ipsilateral level IB lymph nodes. Radiographically positive cases were excluded. Retrospective chart review was used for data collection, and the rate of pathologic level IB involvement was determined. Results The ipsilateral level IB nodal station had negative imaging and pathologically positive nodes at rates of 4.3% in OPSCC and 5.3% in human papillomavirus-positive OPSCC. Positive node burden in the ipsilateral neck at stations other than IB appeared to correlate with the risk of pathologic positive IB (pIB+) nodes: 50% of pathologically IB-negative patients had 2 or more positive nodes versus 75% of pIB+ patients who had 4 or more positive nodes. Conclusions Our data indicate a low risk of pathologic level IB involvement in early-stage OPSCC. High positive node burden in stations near level IB may be associated with a higher chance of pathologic level IB involvement.Copyright Â© 2017 American Society for Radiation Oncology",Excluded

3898,"Patterns of nodal involvement for clinically N0 salivary gland carcinoma: Refining the role of elective neck irradiation Background. The purpose of this study was to analyze the pattern of occult cervical lymph node metastasis among patients with clinically N0 salivary gland carcinoma. Methods. One hundred nineteen patients underwent primary surgery and ipsilateral neck dissection for clinically N0 carcinomas of the major and minor salivary glands. Eighty patients (67%) had parotid tumors. Distribution of T classification was: T1 (18%), T2 (28%), T3 (23%), and T4 (32%). Results. Twenty-five patients (21%) had pathological cervical disease. The incidence was highest among patients with adenocarcinoma (35%) and high-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma (35%). The most common site of cervical lymph node metastasis was level II (71%), followed by level III (15%), and level IB (8%). On multivariate analysis, histological subtype was independently predictive of occult pathological lymph node metastasis (p < .001). Conclusion.

4818,"Sexual Function, Quality of Life, and Mood After Radiation Therapy in Patients with Anal Cancer PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE(S): Definitive chemoradiation (CRT) results in high cure rates of anal cancer, with advanced radiation (RT) techniques improving toxicity. However, there is limited data regarding these patients' sexual function (SF), quality of life (QOL), and mood. We hypothesized that anal cancer treatment would result in detrimental effects on SF, QOL, and mood., MATERIALS/METHODS: We prospectively surveyed patients with anal cancer treated with definitive CRT. We assessed SF for women with the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and for men with the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). For all patients, we assessed QOL using EORTC QLQ-C30 and CR29 and mood using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). We reported descriptive statistics for SF, QOL, and mood and used univariate analysis to evaluate predictors of SF for women., RESULTS: Of 50 eligible patients, 84% completed the surveys. Median time from RT until survey was 36 months (1-97 months). Women (n = 34) reported poor SF overall (mean FSFI score = 15, scale 2-36, standard deviation (SD) 10.4). Most women reported poor SF related to satisfaction, desire, orgasm, arousal, pain, and lubrication. Men (n = 8) also had poor overall satisfaction (mean IIEF score = 6.1, scale 2-10, SD 3.6). Men reported poor erectile function and lower satisfaction with intercourse. Mean QLQ-C30 QOL score was 86.5 (SD 16.3). Results from EORTC QLQ-CR-20 demonstrated patients experienced poor sexual interest. Per HADS, 2.5% reported depression and 18% anxiety., CONCLUSION: Patients with anal cancer experience sexual dysfunction after RT, with QOL and mood symptoms similar to patients with other cancers. Our data support the need for ongoing efforts to understand and address issues with SF, QOL, and mood following RT for these patients.",Excluded
3789,"Concurrent daily carboplatin and accelerated hyperfractionated thoracic radiotherapy in locally advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer PURPOSE: This study was designed to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of accelerated hyperfractionated thoracic radiotherapy concurrently combined with daily carboplatin in patients with locally advanced, unresectable nonsmall cell lung cancer., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty-one patients with locally advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer were treated with continuous course, twice daily thoracic radiotherapy (1.5 Gy each) to a total of 60 Gy over 4 weeks. Carboplatin (25 mg/m2) i.v. was given immediately before each morning thoracic radiotherapy. Blood samples were taken to measure the blood free platinum pharmacokinetics on day 1., RESULTS: All 31 patients completed the protocol treatment without delay. The median age was 73 years, and the majority had Stage IIIA (32%) or IIIB (48%) disease. Major acute toxicity (> or = Grade 3) included 17 patients (55%) with leukopenia, 5 patients (16%) with thrombocytopenia, and 7 patients (23%) with esophagitis. One possible treatment-related death due to diffuse pneumonitis was observed. There were three complete responses (CRs) and 23 partial responses (PRs) in the radiation field, for a response rate of 84%. The relapse pattern was predominantly loco-regional, and the median survival time was 9.8 months. The area under the plasma level-time curve (AUC) of free platinum correlated significantly (r = -0.41, p = 0.04) with the surviving fraction of leukocytes, but not with the severity of the esophagitis. Responders had significantly (p = 0.04 by Welch's t-test) higher AUCs than nonresponders., CONCLUSIONS: This combination therapy was feasible and efficacious against locally advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer. Although long-term local control still remains unsatisfactory, pharmacokinetic data are suggestive of a role for platinum in enhancing the radiation effect.",Excluded
3907,"Reduction of healthcare-associated infections in a long-term care brain injury ward by replacing regular linens with biocidal copper oxide impregnated linens Background: Contaminated textiles in hospitals contribute to endogenous, indirect-contact, and aerosol transmission of nosocomial related pathogens. Copper oxide impregnated linens have wide-spectrum antimicrobial, antifungal, and antiviral properties. Our aim was to determine if replacing non-biocidal linens with biocidal copper oxide impregnated linens would reduce the rates of healthcare-associated infections (HAI) in a long-term care ward. Method(s): We compared the rates of HAI in two analogous patient cohorts in a head injury care ward over two 6-month parallel periods before (period A) and after (period B) replacing all the regular non-biocidal linens and personnel uniforms with copper oxide impregnated biocidal products. Result(s): During period B, in comparison to period A, there was a 24% reduction in the HAI per 1000 hospitalization-days (p< 0.05), a 47% reduction in the number of fever days (>38.5. degreeC) per 1000 hospitalization-days (p< 0.01), and a 32.8% reduction in total number of days of antibiotic administration per 1000 hospitalization-days (p< 0.0001). Accordingly there was saving of approximately 27% in costs of antibiotics, HAI-related treatments, X-rays, disposables, labor, and laundry, expenses during period B. Conclusion(s): The use of biocidal copper oxide impregnated textiles in a long-term care ward may significantly reduce HAI, fever, antibiotic consumption, and related treatment costs.

Cytogenetic analysis (1000 metaphase plate per individual) and genotyping at 19 sites of genes involved in detoxification and DNA repair were performed in a sample of 83 Chernobyl liquidators and a matched control sample of 96 volunteers. In either sample, the frequency of chromosome aberrations was higher in carriers of the minor alleles of the XPD gene (sites 2251T > G and 862G > A) and the positive genotypes of the GSTM1-GSTT1 genes. The highest frequency of chromosome aberrations was observed in carriers of a combined genotype including at least one minor allele of the XPD sites + at least one insertion in the GSTM1-GSTT1 genes. The high-risk genotype, which had a prevalence of 64%, was strongly associated with a higher frequency of chromosome aberrations in both volunteers (OR = 6.9, P = 0.008) and Chernobyl liquidators (OR = 5.6, P = 0.002).",Excluded

Ultrasound data were acquired from 10 open-chested Yorkshire pigs (25-33 kg) at baseline, during regional ischemia and during 30 min of stunning, using a broadband ultrasound transducer (3-7 MHz) sutured directly upon the left ventricular myocardial wall. Cyclic variation of integrated backscatter and myocardial wall thickening were calculated using three definitions obtained from the literature. Independent of the definition, cyclic variation of wall thickness and integrated backscatter were blunted during acute ischemia and returned transiently to or above baseline during the first minute of reperfusion, followed by a gradual decrease to a level under baseline during stunning. An early return of the cyclic variation of the integrated backscatter was not observed in pigs, independent of the data processing used.

METHOD(S): From 1994 to 2000, 3 patients (1 with clavicle osteosynthesis, 1 with chronic clavicle osteomyelitis, and 1 with radioactive ulcer in clavicular region accompanied by chronic osteomyelitis of clavicle) were reconstructed with turnover adipofascial flap, myocutaneous flap of pectoris, and myocutaneous flap of latissimus dorsal respectively. The outcome was observed. The operation principles of tissue flaps transferring for wound repair of the clavicle were summarized. RESULT(S): Follow-ups were done for 2 months to 7 years. All tissue flaps survived well and the wounds in clavicular region were healed well. There was no recurrence of chronic clavicle osteomyelitis. CONCLUSION(S): Turnover adipofascial flap, myocutaneous flap of pectoris and latissimus dorsal are often used for wound repair of the clavicle. Most of the wounds of the clavicle can be repaired by turnover adipofascial flap. Myocutaneous flap of pectoris and latissimus dorsal are more suitable for wound repair with chronic clavicle osteomyelitis. In the case of radioactive ulcer of the clavicular region, myocutaneous flap of latissimus dorsal transposition is a better alternative for wound repair.",Excluded
3886,"[Characteristics of postural corrective responses before and after long-term spaceflight] Balance function is dramatically deteriorated after exposure to microgravity. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the role and the contribution of different gravity sensory systems to the development of balance impairment after long-term spaceflights. Postural perturbations (pushes to the chest) of the threshold, medium, and sub-maximal intensities were produced in eight cosmonauts before, and on the day 3, 7, and 11 following spaceflight. Postural corrective responses were analyzed by anterior-posterior body sway fluctuation and electromyographic activity of leg muscles. The characteristics of the postural corrective responses changed significantly on the day 3 following spaceflight: the amplitude of posterior sway caused by perturbation of threshold intensity was increased reaching 135% ofpreflight value; the corrective responses lasted more than 6 s in 50% of all trials, while it did not last more than 4 s in 96% before spaceflight. The EMG responses were characterized by increased contribution of medium- and long-latency reactions. On the day 11 following spaceflight, most of the characteristics of postural corrective responses were close to preflight values. We assumed that the balance alterations after spaceflight are caused by changes in weightlessness of functions of two main gravity sensory systems, namely, weight-bearing and vestibular one. The deficit of weight-bearing afferentation triggers a decline of the extensors' muscle tone, while changes of vestibular function cause a decline of accuracy of postural corrections.",Excluded
4741,"Religious belief as a coping strategy: An explorative trial in patients irradiated for head-and-neck cancer Purpose: To explore the role of religious belief in coping with disease symptoms and treatment-related side effects in patients with head-and-neck cancer under radiotherapy. Patients and Methods: Prospectively collected data were used with a cohort of head-and-neck cancer patients treated by radiotherapy and epoetin beta or placebo within a double-blind multicenter trial. All patients were divided into believers and nonbelievers. Answers to a quality of life questionnaire at four points in time during radiotherapy were analyzed according to both groups. Clinical parameters and therapy side effects were controlled regularly. Result(s): 62.1% of the patients (66/105) sent back a baseline questionnaire discriminating between believers and nonbelievers. For 34.2% (40/105) data of all four measures could be obtained. On average, believers felt better in all categories of side effects at all points of time before, during and directly after therapy. Conclusion(s): Religious faith seems to play an important role in coping strategies of radiotherapy patients. More research in this area would be worthwhile. Â© Urban & Vogel.",Excluded
4186,"Radioprotective properties of detoxified lipid A from Salmonella minnesota R595 In the past, the toxicity of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or its principal bioactive component, lipid A, has detracted from their potential use as radioprotectants. Recently, a relatively nontoxic monophosphoryl Lipid A (LAM) that retains many of the immunobiologic properties of LPS has been isolated from a polysaccharide deficient Re mutant strain of Salmonella minnesota (R595). The ability of the native endotoxic glycolipid (GL) from S. minnesota (R595) as well as diphosphoryl lipid A (LAD) and nontoxic monophosphoryl lipid A (LAM) derived from GL to protect LPS responsive (CD2F1 or C3H/HeN) and nonresponsive (C3H/HeJ) mice from 60Co gamma irradiation has been studied. Administration of GL, LAD, or LAM to CD2F1 or C3H/HeN mice (400 micrograms/kg) 24 h prior to exposure provided significant radioprotection. No protection was afforded to C3H/HeJ mice. Experiments were also conducted to determine the relative abilities of GL, LAD, and LAM to stimulate hematopoiesis as reflected by the endogenous spleen colony (E-CFU) assay. Protection was not correlated with the ability of these substances to increase E-CFUs or to induce colony-stimulating activity (CSA).",Excluded
4461,"Adjuvant chemoradiation versus chemotherapy for stage III gastric cancer after surgery with curative intent Objective: Gastric cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage and surgery alone cannot guarantee satisfactory results. Both chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and chemotherapy (CT) are used in postoperative therapy. However, it is controversial whether CRT or CT is better after D2 lymphadenectomy. In this study we investigated the efficacy of adjuvant CRT versus CT in stage III gastric cancer patients treated with R0 gastrectomy and D2 lymph node dissection. Patients and Methods: Data from 92 patients diagnosed with gastric adenocarcinoma and treated with surgery followed by adjuvant treatment were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were classified into two groups depending on type of adjuvant treatment such as CT (Arm A) and CRT (Arm B). Result(s): Twenty-one patients in Arm A and 71 patients in Arm B were included. Median age at diagnosis was 60 years. The median follow-up time was 30 months. No difference in local recurrence (14.3 vs 15.7%, P = 0.89), peritoneal recurrence (29.4 vs 23.5%, P = 0.62), and distant metastases rates (57.1 vs 45.1%, P = 0.42) were observed between the arms.

4633,"Lung stereotactic body radiation therapy for elderly patients aged >= 80 years with pathologically proven early-stage non-small cell lung cancer: a retrospective cohort study Background: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is an established therapy for medically inoperable early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Many elderly patients are medically inoperable owing to comorbidities. Therefore, SBRT may be a useful therapy for elderly patients. However, the application of SBRT for patients aged >= 80 years has not been completely elucidated. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the clinical utility of SBRT for elderly patients aged >= 80 years with pathologically proven early-stage NSCLC. Method(s): We retrospectively evaluated the data of patients aged >= 80 years with pathologically proven primary NSCLC who underwent SBRT at our institution between January 2009 and March 2020. Treatment outcomes and toxicities were analyzed. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate survival curves and the log-rank test to compare the survival curves. We performed univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. p-values < 0.05 were regarded significant. Result(s): Sixty-four patients (65 lesions) were included, and the median follow-up period was 38.7 (range 3.5-95.7) months. The median age was 82.9 (range 80.0-94.8) years. Sixteen patients were medically operable, and 48 patients were medically inoperable. The prescribed dose of SBRT was either 48 Gy in four fractions or 60 Gy in 10 fractions. The median survival time was 60.0 months (95% confidence interval, 43.5-71.1). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year local control, cancer-specific survival, progression-free survival, and overall survival rates were 98.4%, 98.4%, 81.0%, and 88.9%; 90.1%, 93.7%, 58.9%, and 68.3%; and 87.4%, 83.5%, 38.2%, and 47.5%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that inoperability and solid nodules were the predictors of poor overall survival after SBRT in elderly patients. Two patients (3.1%) had grade 3 radiation pneumonitis, and one patient (1.6%) had grade 5 radiation pneumonitis. Conclusion(s): SBRT was feasible in patients aged >= 80 years with NSCLC. It achieved good local control with minimal toxicity. SBRT may be beneficial in elderly patients with early-stage NSCLC.Copyright Â© 2021, The Author(s).",Excluded
3935,"Osteosarcoma of the flat bone Objective: We aimed to understand the biology of osteosarcoma of the flat bone, which is a rare tumor entity. Method(s): Cases with osteosarcoma of the flat bone were compared with those of the extremity in order to evaluate their clinicopathologic characteristics. And the influences of heterogeneous treatment modalities on outcome were analyzed. Result(s): Tumors of the flat bone comprised 91 (11.3%) of 806 osteosarcoma cases. Eight cases were secondary osteosarcoma associated with previous radiotherapy. Patients with a flat bone tumor were significantly older and more likely to present with metastases at diagnosis than extremity tumor. The proportions of female sex and chondroblastic subtype were higher among flat bone tumors than among extremity tumors. The 5-year overall survival and event-free survival rates were 35.2 +/- 5.4% and 24.7 +/- 5.5%, respectively. Although age and histologic response to pre-operative chemotherapy were not related to outcome of flat bone tumors, treatment modality influenced the survival. Patients treated surgically had better outcomes than those treated by another means. Radiation therapy did not appear to be an effective local control measure as surgery. Conclusion(s): Treatment outcome of the tumor of the flat bone was worse than extremity tumors. Further studies are needed to identify effective local control measures that can substitute for surgery and to determine the biologic characteristics of osteosarcoma of the flat bone.

4670,"The role of dose escalation with intracavitary brachytherapy in the treatment of localized CNS malignancies: Outcomes and toxicities of a prospective study Purpose: This single-institution prospective study was designed to investigate the feasibility and safety of dose escalation with GliaSite (Proxima Therapeutics Inc., Alpharetta, GA) brachytherapy for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed and recurrent central nervous system (CNS) tumors after neurosurgical resection. We now report mature results of this trial, its outcomes, and a toxicity profile. Methods and Materials: Ten adult consecutive patients with recurrent and newly diagnosed CNS malignancies underwent GliaSite brachytherapy after maximally safe neurosurgical resection between 2004 and 2007. GliaSite balloon was placed intraoperatively, and the size was selected so as to conform to the surgical cavity. Low-dose-rate radiation was delivered with an aqueous solution of organically bound 125I (Iotrex: sodium 3-(125I)-iodo-4-hydroxybenzenesulfonate; Proxima Therapeutics Inc.), introduced into the balloon portion of the device via a subcutaneous port. Two to 3 weeks later, the device was filled with Iotrex for a median dwell time of 94.3 hours (range, 68.0-120.5 hours), after which the balloon was explanted. A commercial 3-D planning system was used for a detailed analysis of dosimetry. Median dose of 52.0 Gy (range, 45.0-60.0 Gy) was prescribed 0.5-1.0 cm from the balloon surface. Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) criteria were used to assess acute and long-term toxicities associated with this technique. Followup was assessed with MRI scans and was available on all enrolled patients. Result(s): Median followup for surviving patients was 38 months (range, 18-57 months). Mean size of GliaSite balloon was 3.4 cm (range, 2.0-4.0 cm). Mean volume of filling was 19.0 cc (range, 4.0-35.0 cc). Median activity of Iotrex was 301.6 mCi (range, 95.0-515.4 mCi). Median survival was 14.0 months for the entire cohort after the treatment with the GliaSite device. Of our cohort, 6/10 (60%) patients sustained recurrence (20% local and 40% distant). Median time to recurrence after treatment with GliaSite was 8.0 months, and median time to death after recurrence was 7.5 months. There were no RTOG Grade 3 or 4 acute or late toxicities. Followup MRI imaging did not identify any evidence of radiation necrosis. Conclusion(s): Our data indicate that treatment with GliaSite balloon brachytherapy is feasible and safe, while rendering acceptable local control and minimal acute and long-term toxicities for newly diagnosed and recurrent CNS malignancies.

4068,"Combination Therapy with Radiation and PARP Inhibition Enhances Responsiveness to Anti-PD-1 Therapy in Colorectal Tumor Models PURPOSE: The majority of colorectal cancers are resistant to cancer immune checkpoint inhibitors. Ionizing radiation (IR) and several radiosensitizers, including PARP inhibitors, can enhance responsiveness to immune checkpoint inhibitors by potentially complementary mechanisms of action. We assessed the ability of radiation and PARP inhibition to induce proimmunogenic changes in tumor cells and enhance their in vivo responsiveness to anti-PD-1 antibodies., METHODS AND MATERIALS: We performed a candidate drug screen and used flow cytometry to assess effects of the PARP inhibitor veliparib on IR-mediated changes in MHC-1 antigen presentation and surface localization of immune-modulating proteins including PD-L1 and calreticulin in colorectal cancer tumor models. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to assess the effects of veliparib and radiation on the expression of proinflammatory and immunosuppressive cytokines. The ability of concurrent PARP inhibition and subablative doses of radiation therapy to enhance in vivo responsiveness to anti-PD-1 antibodies was assessed using unilateral flank-tumor models with or without T-cell depletion., RESULTS: Veliparib was a potent radiosensitizer in both cell lines. Radiation increased surface localization of MHC-1 and PD-L1 in a dose-dependent manner, and veliparib pretreatment significantly enhanced these effects with high (8 Gy) but not with lower radiation doses. Enhancement of MHC-1 and PD-L1 surface localization by IR and IR+ veliparib remained significant 1, 3, and 7 days after treatment. IR significantly increased delayed tumoral expression of proinflammatory cytokines interferon-Y and CXCL10 but had no significant effect on the expression of IL-6 or TGF-beta. Concurrent administration of veliparib and subablative radiation therapy (8 Gy x 2) significantly prolonged anti-PD-1-mediated in vivo tumor growth delay and survival in both tumor models. Moreover, these effects were more pronounced in the microsatellite instability-mutated MC38 tumor model. Enhancement of anti-PD-1 mediated tumor growth delay with veliparib and IR was attenuated by CD8+ T-cell depletion., CONCLUSIONS: We provide preclinical evidence for a novel therapeutic strategy to enhance responsiveness of colorectal tumors to immune checkpoint inhibitors.

4885,"CT-derived abdominal adiposity: Distributions and better predictive ability than BMI in a nationwide study of 59,429 adults in China Background: Although abdominal adiposity is associated with an altered cardiometabolic risk profile, the specific contribution of abdominal adipose tissue distribution remains not fully understood. Computed tomography (CT) is a well-established and precise method to measure abdominal adipose tissue distribution. The present study investigated abdominal adiposity assessed by CT in a large-scale Chinese population. Method(s): A total of 59,429 adults who underwent a low dose chest CT for lung cancer screening at one of 13 health checkup centers throughout China were evaluated. Abdominal visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) areas were measured at the center of the 2nd lumbar vertebra with Mindways quantitative CT software using the existing CT dataset without any additional radiation exposure. The ratio of visceral to total adipose tissue (TAT) areas (VAT/TAT ratio) was calculated and expressed as a percentage. Anthropometric indices including body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference were also obtained. Result(s): BMI, waist circumference, VAT area, SAT area, and the VAT/TAT ratio were 25.0 +/- 3.0 kg/m2, 90 +/- 8 cm, 194 +/- 77 cm2, 85 +/- 41 cm2, and 69.5 +/- 9.1%, respectively, in men and 23.3 +/- 3.1 kg/m2, 79 +/- 8 cm, 120 +/- 57 cm2, 123 +/- 53 cm2, and 48.9 +/- 9.7% in women. With increasing age, VAT area and the VAT/TAT ratio increased in both sexes whereas SAT area decreased in men (P < 0.001 for all). After adjustment for BMI and waist circumference, older individuals showed higher VAT area and higher VAT/TAT ratio than younger subjects (P < 0.001 for all). Adjusted VAT areas in participants aged 75 or older was 45 cm2 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 41 cm2, 50 cm2) higher in men and 43 cm2 (95% CI: 37 cm2, 49 cm2) higher in women compared with participants aged 31-44 years. Additionally, differences in VAT area across age groups increased as BMI or waist circumference increased. VAT and SAT areas, but not the VAT/TAT ratio, were positively associated with BMI and waist circumference in every age group. Conclusion(s): In a nationwide study conducted in China, distributions of CT-derived measures of visceral and subcutaneous adiposity were found to vary significantly between sex and age groups. Our study also revealed that the proportion of VAT (an important driver of cardiometabolic risk) could not be predicted from BMI in a Chinese population.Copyright Â© 2020 The Authors",Excluded
4303,"Treatment results and prognostic factors for advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy Objective: To review our experience with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) for patients with advanced resectable squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the larynx and to evaluate the factors affecting survival and larynx preservation. Study design: Retrospective study. Subjects and methods: The records of 102 patients with stage III or IV resectable SCC of the larynx treated with CCRT between February 1994 and March 2009 were reviewed. Of 102 patients, 59 were treated with high-dose regimens, including cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), methotrexate, and leucovorin or docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-FU, and 43 were treated with low-dose regimens, including carboplatin and uracil-tegafur or S-1. Radiotherapy was delivered 5 days a week using a single daily fraction of 1.8-2.0 Gray (Gy), to a total dose of 66.0-70.2 Gy. Overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and DSS with larynx preservation were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods. The log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to identify significant prognostic factors for DSS and DSS with larynx preservation. Result(s): The 5-year OS and DSS for all patients treated with CCRT were 63.9 and 70.7 %, respectively. The 5-year DSS with larynx preservation was 54.1 %. On multivariate analysis, N stage, synchronous multiple primary cancers, and the contents of chemotherapy were significant predictors of OS for patients undergoing CCRT; T stage, N stage, and the contents of chemotherapy were significant prognostic factors for larynx preservation. Conclusion(s): The treatment method including the indication for CCRT may be determined by the contents of the chemotherapy and the T and N stages of laryngeal SCC. It is important to diagnose multiple synchronous primary cancers before CCRT. Â© 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
4582,"Use of IIb/IIIa inhibitors in patients with in-stent restenosis treated with intracoronary gamma-radiation. Integrilin WRIST The Integrilin Washington Radiation for In-Stent Restenosis Trial (WRIST) aimed to study the impact of IIb/IIIa inhibitors as adjunct therapy to intracoronary radiation therapy (IRT) for patients with in-stent restenosis (ISR). The impact of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor (eptifibatide) as adjunct therapy to vascular brachytherapy using (192)Ir emitter was examined in patients with in-stent restenosis. In the study, 150 patients were assigned to eptifibatide (Integrilin) and 150 patients to heparin only. Clinical composite endpoints at 30 days were similar between the patients treated with and without eptifibatide (4.7% vs. 4.0%; P = 0.78). There was a similarity in the non-Q-wave myocardial infarction (MI) rates between the eptifibatide and the control group. Major bleeding was similar in patients treated with and without eptifibatide. Overall, the use of eptifibatide as adjunct therapy for patients with ISR that are treated with IRT did not impact the clinical outcome at 30 days. Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Excluded
4143,"[Safety and feasibility of intracoronary brachytherapy with the Novoste system within the scope of international multicenter studies] UNLABELLED: Clinical trials are increasingly investigating the effects of intracoronary radiation for the treatment of de-novo lesions, restenosis (without stents), and in-stent restenosis. As the first group in Germany, we had the opportunity to use the Novoste system within the international multicenter studies BETA-CATH, START and BRIE and report our preliminary experience regarding safety and feasibility of intracoronary brachytherapy with this afterloader. A total of 95 patients were enrolled. The Novoste system was used in 92 patients (104 lesions). Ischemic complications were not observed; therefore, radiation was performed as planned. The mean applied dose was 16 +/- 2 Gy (14-20 Gy, at 2 mm distance) and mean exposure time was 202 +/- 27 s (165-261 s). The addition of brachytherapy increased the total duration of the intervention for 17 +/- 8 min. At the body surface of the patients, the following dose rates were measured: left chest wall: 99 +/- 52 microSv/h; groin 3 +/- 3 microSv/h. All patients received ASS 300 mg/d o.d. Patients with stent implantation in the same session received 250 mg b.i.d. Ticlopidin or 75 mg Clopidogrel o.d. for at least three months. Total mortality and infarct rate was 0. There was no acute, subacute or late stent thrombosis., CONCLUSION: Our first experience with the Novoste Beta-Cath system showed that intracoronary brachytherapy can be safely and simply performed in the cath lab. There were no acute complications. To avoid the possible risk of late stent thrombosis, Ticlopidin or Clopidogrel must be administered for at least three months.",Excluded
4626,"Gut microbial dysbiosis is associated with development and progression of radiation enteritis during pelvic radiotherapy Radiation enteritis (RE) is the most common complication of radiotherapy for pelvic irradiation receivers. Herein we investigated the alterations in gut microbial profiles and their association with enteritis in patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy. Faecal samples were collected from 18 cervical cancer patients during radiotherapy. Microbiota profiles were characterized based on 16S rRNA sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq platform. Epithelial inflammatory response was evaluated using bacterial-epithelial co-cultures. Dysbiosis was observed among patients with RE, which was characterized by significantly reduced alpha-diversity but increased beta-diversity, relative higher abundance of Proteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria and lower abundance of Bacteroides. Coprococcus was clearly enriched prior to radiotherapy in patients who later developed RE. Metastat analysis further revealed unique grade-related microbial features, such as more abundant Virgibacillus and Alcanivorax in patients with mild enteritis. Additionally, using bacterial-epithelial co-cultures, RE patient-derived microbiota induced epithelial inflammation and barrier dysfunction, enhanced TNF-alpha and IL-1beta expression compared with control microbiota. Taken together, we define the overall picture of gut microbiota in patients with RE. Our results suggest that dysbiosis of gut microbiota may contribute to development and progression of RE. Gut microbiota can offer a set of biomarkers for prediction, disease activity evaluation and treatment selection in RE. Copyright Â© 2019 The Authors.

3726,"Structural Brain Changes following Long-Term 6degree Head-Down Tilt Bed Rest as an Analog for Spaceflight BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Following long-term spaceflight, a subset of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration astronauts present with visual impairment and increased intracranial pressure, known as visual impairment and intracranial pressure syndrome. We investigated structural brain changes following long-term head-down tilt bed rest as a spaceflight analog., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Volumetric analysis was performed on structural pre- and post-bed rest brain MR images., RESULTS: Comparing post-bed rest to pre-bed rest images, we found the following: 1) no significant group differences in GM, WM, CSF, or ventricular volumes; 2) shift of the center of mass of the brain upward and posterior rotation of the brain relative to the skull; 3) a significant correlation between posterior brain rotation and changes in ventricular volume; and 4) significant increases in brain tissue density in regions at the vertex, including the frontoparietal lobes, with contraction of adjacent extra-axial CSF spaces, and significant decreases in tissue density in areas along the base of the brain, including the orbitofrontal cortex., CONCLUSIONS: We observed widespread morphologic changes with brain tissue redistribution in response to gravity changes; possible associated functional changes are unknown. The observation that ventricular change is correlated to posterior brain rotation suggests an alteration in CSF homeostasis. Ultimately, to elucidate any structural changes that may play a role in visual impairment and intracranial pressure syndrome, volumetric analysis of pre- and postflight structural scans of astronauts is needed.

4543,"18F-Fluorothymidine radiation dosimetry in human PET imaging studies UNLABELLED: 3'-Deoxy-3'-(18)F-fluorothymidine ((18)F-FLT) is a PET imaging agent that shows promise for studying cellular proliferation in human cancers. FLT is a nucleoside analog that enters cells and is phosphorylated by human thymidine kinase 1, but the 3' substitution prevents further incorporation into DNA. We estimated the radiation dosimetry for this tracer from data gathered in patient studies., METHODS: Time-dependent tissue concentrations of radioactivity were determined from blood samples and PET images of 18 patients after intravenous injection of (18)F-FLT. Radiation-absorbed doses were calculated using the MIRD Committee methods, taking into account variations that were based on the distribution of activities observed in the individual patients. Effective dose equivalent (EDE) was calculated using International Commission on Radiological Protection Publication 60 tissue weighting factors for the standard man and woman., RESULTS: For a single bladder voiding at 6 h after (18)F-FLT injection, the (18)F-FLT EDE (mean +/- SD) was 0.028 +/- 0.012 mSv/MBq (103 +/- 43 mrem/mCi) for a standard male patient and 0.033 +/- 0.012 mSv/MBq (121 +/- 43 mrem/mCi) for a standard female patient. The organ that received the highest dose was the bladder (male, 0.179 mGy/MBq [662 mrad/mCi]; female, 0.174 mGy/MBq [646 mrad/mCi]), followed by the liver (male, 0.045 mGy/MBq [167 mrad/mCi]; female, 0.064 mGy/MBq [238 mrad/mCi]), the kidneys (male, 0.035 mGy/MBq [131 mrad/mCi]; female, 0.042 mGy/MBq [155 mrad/mCi]), and the bone marrow (male, 0.024 mGy/MBq [89 mrad/mCi]; female, 0.033 mGy/MBq [122 mrad/mCi])., CONCLUSION: Organ dose estimates for (18)F-FLT are comparable to those associated with other commonly performed nuclear medicine tests, and the potential radiation risks associated with (18)F-FLT PET imaging are within accepted limits.",Excluded
4142,"Selective brain responses to acute and chronic low-dose X-ray irradiation in males and females Radiation exposure is known to have profound effects on the brain, leading to precursor cell dysfunction and debilitating cognitive declines [Nat. Med. 8 (2002) 955]. Although a plethora of data exist on the effects of high radiation doses, the effects of low-dose irradiation, such as ones received during repetitive diagnostic and therapeutic exposures, are still under-investigated [Am. J. Otolaryngol. 23 (2002) 215; Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97 (2000) 889; Curr. Opin. Neurol. 16 (2003) 129]. Furthermore, most studies of the biological effects of ionizing radiation have been performed using a single acute dose, while clinically and environmentally relevant exposures occur predominantly under chronic/repetitive conditions. Here, we have used a mouse model to compare the effects of chronic/repetitive and acute low-dose radiation (LDR) exposure (0.5Gy) to ionizing radiation on the brain in vivo. We examined the LDR effects on p42/44 MAPK (ERK1/ERK2), CaMKII, and AKT signaling-the interconnected pathways that have been previously shown to be crucial for neuronal survival upon irradiation. We report perturbations in ERK1/2, AKT, and CREB upon acute and chronic/repetitive low-dose exposure in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of mice. These studies were paralleled by the analysis of radiation effects on neurogenesis and cellular proliferation. Repetitive exposure had a much more pronounced effect on cellular signaling and neurogenesis than acute exposure. These results suggest that studies of single acute exposures might be limited in terms of their predictive value. We also present the first evidence of sex differences in radiation-induced signaling in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. We show the role of estrogens in brain radiation responses and discuss the implications of the observed changes.",Included
4213,"Novel predictors of esophageal toxicity with stereotactic body radiation therapy for central lung tumors Purpose: The aim of this study is to report on clinical and dosimetric endpoints for development of esophagus toxicity (ET) in patients treated with thoracic stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). Methods and materials: One hundred thirty-one patients were treated from 2006 to 2014 with SBRT for primary, recurrent, and metastatic lung tumors. Thirty-four had central lesions. We collected esophageal dosimetric data including Dmax, D1cc, D5cc, and D10cc. We recorded the percent circumferential luminal overlap at 10 Gy intervals from 10 Gy to Dmax, as well as at 24, 39, and 50 Gy, by dividing the extent of overlapping isodose by total esophagus luminal circumference (calculated by 2pi(a2 + b2/2)). Result(s): Of 34 patients included for analysis, 9 had ET and 2 of which had high-grade ET. The mean axial percent esophagus encompassed by 24, 39, and 50 Gy isodose lines of patients with ET vs. no ET was 38.9 vs. 11.5 %, 8.8 vs. 2.3 %, and 5.7 vs. 0.5 % (p = 0.04, 0.16, 0.13, respectively). Mean maximum point dose, D1cc and D5cc for patients with ET vs. those without was 31.2 Gy vs. 18.2 Gy, 25.5 Gy vs. 14.1 Gy, 19.6 Gy vs. 10.0 Gy (p = 0.045, 0.067, 0.071, respectively). Multiple treatment sites and previous thoracic radiation were significantly associated with ET. Conclusion(s): Previous thoracic RT, multiple-site irradiation, and percent esophageal overlap with 39 and 50 Gy isodose lines were most significantly associated with ET. These predictive factors can risk stratify SBRT patients for ET, and the dosimetric factors should be considered in treatment planning to decrease the risk of ET.Copyright Â© 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
4372,"Postoperative chemoradiotherapy in rectal cancer. Late results of a pilot study BACKGROUND/AIMS: It has recently been proven that postoperative radiotherapy combined with fluorouracil showed an increase of survival and local control in patients with rectal cancer. However, hematological and intestinal toxicity also increased. Experimental and clinical studies showed an increased radiation effect with an acceptable toxicity by delivering drug via a continuous intravenous infusion., METHODOLOGY: From 1988 to 1998, 80 patients radically operated on for stages B2-C rectal cancer were irradiated with 3 fractions of 100 cGy per day to a total dose of 5,600 cGy. 34 out of these 80 patients underwent postoperative radiotherapy alone and 46 received radiotherapy combined with concomitant protracted infusion of fluorouracil at doses of 250 mg/m2 per day., RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 54 months, the 5-year overall and disease-free survival were 59% and 54%, respectively, in the combined modality group, as compared to 42% and 34%, respectively, in the radiation alone group. The differences were not significant, but the incidence of local relapse and patients' survival showed a better trend for combined approach., CONCLUSIONS: The data from international literature are in favor of a combined approach, both in preoperative and postoperative treatment of advanced rectal cancer.

4117,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for pituitary adenoma invading the cavernous sinus Object. The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS) treatment of pituitary adenomas that have invaded the cavernous sinus. Methods. Sixteen patients were treated with GKS: three with nonfunctional adenomas and 13 with hormone-secreting (seven growth hormone [GH] and six adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH]) adenomas. More than 16 Gy and 30 Gy were delivered to the tumor margin for nonfunctioning tumors and functioning tumors, respectively, keeping the dose to the optic pathways below 10 Gy. The median follow up was 3 years. Tumor growth control was achieved in all cases. In GH-producing tumors, four of six cases evaluated were endocrinologically normalized (serum GH < 10 mIU/L, somatomedin C < 450 ng/ml), and the remaining two cases also showed a steady decrease in the GH and somatomedin level. In ACTH-producing tumors, three of six cases were endocrinologically normalized (24-hour urinary-free cortisol < 90 mg/day), two were unchanged, and one showed hormonal recurrence 3 years after radiosurgery. Notably, there were no cases of permanent hypopituitarism or visual symptoms caused by radiosurgery. Conclusions. The authors data indicate that GKS can be a safe salvage therapy for invading pituitary adenomas, with effectiveness equivalent to conventional radiation therapy but with less risk of causing radiation-induced injury to the surrounding structures.",Excluded
4739,"Ultraviolet B enhances DNA hypomethylation of CD4+ T cells in systemic lupus erythematosus via inhibiting DNMT1 catalytic activity Background: CD4+ T cells DNA hypomethylation is involved in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Recent studies showed that ultraviolet B (UVB, 290-320. nm) might induce the exacerbation of SLE by decreasing the DNA methylation level. However, the role of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) in the UVB-induced CD4+ T cells DNA hypomethylation remains unclear. Objective(s): To elucidate the role of DNMT1 in lupus CD4+ T cells global DNA hypomethylation enhanced by UVB. Method(s): 35 SLE patients and 15 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. CD4+ T cells from SLE patients and healthy controls exposed to different dosages of UVB were analyzed. The global DNA methylation measurement, real-time PCR, Western blotting and DNMT1 catalytic activity detection were employed. Result(s): The level of global DNA methylation and DNMT1 mRNA expression in CD4+ T cells from SLE patients were significantly lower than those from the control group. DNA methylation was decreased after UVB exposure in a dosage-dependent manner in SLE patients, but not in the control group. DNMT1 mRNA and protein expression level were not affected by UVB exposure in both SLE patients and healthy controls. DNMT1 catalytic activity was significantly decreased in CD4+ T cells from SLE patients after UVB exposure in a dosage-dependent manner. DNMT1 catalytic activity was lower and more sensitive to UVB exposure in CD4+ T cells from active SLE patients that from stable ones. Conclusion(s): UVB enhanced DNA hypomethylation of CD4+ T cells in SLE via inhibiting DNMT1 catalytic activity in a dosage-dependent manner.

4231,"Ionizing radiation accelerates the development of atherosclerotic lesions in ApoE-/- mice and predisposes to an inflammatory plaque phenotype prone to hemorrhage After radiotherapy treatment, there is an increased incidence of localized atherosclerosis in patients with Hodgkin's disease, breast cancer, and head and neck cancer. Here, we established a mouse model to study the development and progression of radiation-induced atherosclerosis and to compare the phenotype of these lesions with age-related atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis-prone ApoE-/- mice fed a regular chow diet received single radiation doses of 14 Gy or sham treatments (0 Gy) to the neck, including both carotid arteries. At 22, 28, and 34 weeks after irradiation, blood samples were taken, and the arterial tree was removed for histological examination. Cholesterol levels in irradiated mice were not significantly different from age-matched controls, and markers of systemic inflammation (soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and C-reactive protein) were not elevated. The lesions in irradiated arteries were macrophage rich, with a remarkable influx of inflammatory cells, predominantly granulocytes. Intraplaque hemorrhage and erythrocyte-containing macrophages were seen only in lesions of irradiated arteries. Based on these data, we propose that irradiation accelerates the development of macrophage-rich, inflammatory atherosclerotic lesions prone to intraplaque hemorrhage.",Included

Between March 2008 and August 2009, 10 patients were treated with SRT boost using CyberKnife system due mainly to unfavorable condition such as tumors in close proximity to serial organs or former radiotherapy fields. Treatment sites were the external auditory canal in two, the nasopharynx in one, the oropharynx in three, the nasal cavity in one, the maxillary sinus in two, and the oligometastatic cervical lymph node in one. All patients underwent preceding conventional radiotherapy of 40 to 60 Gy. Dose and fractionation scheme of the Cyberknife SRT boost was individualized, and prescribed dose ranged from 9 Gy to 16 Gy in 3 to 4 fractions. Among four patients for whom dose to the optic pathway was concerned, the maximum dose was only about 3 Gy for three patients whereas 9.6 Gy in the remaining one patient. The maximum dose for the mandible in one of three patients with oropharyngeal cancer was 19.7 Gy, whereas majority of the bone can be spared by using non-isocentric conformal beams. For a patient with nasopharyngeal cancer, the highest dose in the brain stem was 15 Gy. However, majority of the brain stem received less than 40% of the maximum dose.

3760,"Survival curves after X-ray and heat treatments for melanoma cells derived directly from surgical specimens of tumours in man X-ray and heat survival curves were established for melanoma cells derived directly from surgical specimens of tumours in man by using the Courtenay soft agar colony assay. The plating efficiency for 11 of the 14 melanomas studied was sufficiently high (PE = 0.3-58%) to measure cell survival over at least two decades. Experiments repeated with cells stored in liquid nitrogen showed that the survival assay gave highly reproducible results. The melanomas exhibited individual and characteristic survival curves whether exposed to radiation or heat (43.5 degrees C). The Do-values were in the ranges 0.63-1.66 Gy (X-rays) and 33-58 min (heat). The survival curves were similar to those reported previously for human melanoma xenografts. The radiation sensitivity of the cells was not correlated to the heat sensitivity. Since the melanomas appeared to be very heterogeneous in radiation response in vitro as melanomas are known to be clinically, it is suggested that melanomas may be suitable for prospective studies aimed at establishing whether clinical radioresponsiveness somehow is related to in vitro survival curve parameters.",Excluded
3837,"Cone beam computerized tomography: basics for digital planning in oral surgery and implantology For the diagnosis of bone pathology, planning of complex implant-supported prosthetic restorations, and guaranteeing oral surgery that is as safe and free of complications as possible, a three-dimensional radiological display is frequently indicated. Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), which can cover a large part of the indications of the dental and oral surgical spectrum, represents an alternative to computed tomography. Moreover, the method offers the advantage that it can also be used in the dental practice, taking the existing radiation protection regulations into account. This guarantees optimum patient and user friendliness, because referral to a specialized CT facility is thus no longer necessary in most cases. In the first 12 months of the trials of the Planmeca Promax 3D at the Department of Dental Surgery and Radiology of the University Clinic for Oral and Maxillofacial Medicine in Graz, the overwhelming majority of referrals for CBCT (almost 90%) was concerned with the field of oral surgery and implantology. Oral surgical questions mainly covered aspects of wisdom tooth anatomy, position of impacted canines, premolars, and mesiodents, as well as cystic lesions. Diagnoses of the maxillary sinuses and the area of tooth preservation represented further indications. Apart from diagnostic purposes, the objective of the referrals was facilitating optimum preparation for the pending operation. In the area of implantology, this was combined frequently with pre- or post-augmentative three-dimensional digital therapy planning. CBCT showed good results in the display of hard tissue structures and can be integrated without difficulty in the daily clinical routine.",Excluded
4810,"Comparison of a safety strategy using transradial access and dual-axis rotational coronary angiography with transfemoral access and standard coronary angiography Objectives We sought to investigate the radiation exposure and contrast utilization associated with using a strategy of transradial access and rotational angiography (radial-DARCA) compared to the traditional approach of transfemoral access and standard angiography (femoral-SA). Background There is an increased focus on optimizing patient safety during cardiac catheterization procedures. Professional guidelines have highlighted physician responsibility to minimize radiation doses and contrast volume. Dual axis rotational coronary angiography (DARCA) is the most recently investigated type of rotational angiography. This new technique permits complete visualization of the left or right coronary tree with a single injection, and is felt to reduce contrast and radiation exposure. Methods A total of 56 consecutive patients who underwent radial-DARCA were identified. From the same time period, an age- and gender-matched group of 61 patients who had femoral-SA were selected for comparison. Total volume of contrast agent used, fluoroscopy time, and 2 measures of radiation dose (dose area product and air kerma) were recorded for each group. Results Mean contrast agent use and patient radiation exposure of the radial-DARCA group were significantly less than that of the femoral-SA group. There was no significant difference in fluoroscopy time between the 2 groups. Conclusions Physicians can successfully employ an innovative safety strategy of transradial access combined with DARCA that is feasible and is associated with lower radiation doses and contrast volume than femoral artery access and traditional coronary angiography approach.

4620,"Relationship of Th17/treg cells and radiation pneumonia in locally advanced esophageal carcinoma Background/Aim: Radiation pneumonia is a main side-effect that has limited the clinical usage of radiotherapy in locally advanced esophageal carcinoma. T helper cells 17 (Th 17) and T regulatory cells (Tregs) play an important role in inflammatory diseases. The balance between Treg and Th17 cells is a key factor in the progression of many inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Whether Tregs and Th17 cells are predictive factors of radiation pneumonia has not yet been reported. In this study, we investigated the relationships of Treg/Th17 cells and radiation pneumonia in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer who received radiotherapy. Patients and Methods: One hundred and forty-eight patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer who received radical and palliative radiotherapy were enrolled. The levels of Th17 and Treg cells in the blood of patients were detected using flow cytometry at the time point of pre-radiotherapy, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th week from the start of radiation and 4 weeks after completion of radiotherapy. Radiation pneumonia was evaluated according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group's acute radiation pneumonia standards, with the endpoint being grade 2 or above radiation pneumonia. Result(s): There were 24 cases of radiation pneumonia in 148 cases of locally advanced esophageal cancer patients who underwent radiotherapy. Th17 cells increased and, in contrast, Treg cells decreased in the radiation pneumonia group. The change in the ratio of Th17/Treg was more pronounced and the difference was statistically significant from the 5th week after irradiation compared to patients with no radiation pneumonia (p<0.05). There was no significant difference in dosimetric parameters, including V5, V20, V30 and mean lung dose (MLD) and clinical factors, such as gender, age, smoking history, history of surgery and chemotherapy. Conclusion(s): The ratio of Th17/Treg cells may be an effective predictive factor of radiation pneumonia.",Excluded
3922,"Effect of different reconstruction algorithms on computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) performance in ultra-low dose CT colonography PURPOSE: To assess the effect of different reconstruction algorithms on computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) performance in ultra-low-dose CT colonography (ULD CTC)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: IRB approval and informed consents were obtained. Thirty prospectively enrolled patients underwent non-contrast CTC at 120 kVp/10 mAs in supine and 100 kVp/10 mAs in prone positions, followed by same-day colonoscopy. Images were reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP), 80% adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR80), and model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR). A commercial CAD system was applied and per-polyp sensitivities and numbers of false-positives (FPs) were compared among algorithms., RESULTS: Mean effective radiation dose of CTC was 1.02 mSv. Of 101 polyps detected and removed by colonoscopy, 61 polyps were detected on supine and on prone CTC datasets on consensus unblinded review, resulting in 122 visible polyps (32 polyps<6 mm, 52 6-9.9 mm, and 38>=10 mm). Per-polyp sensitivity of CAD for all polyps was highest with MBIR (56/122, 45.9%), followed by ASIR80 (54/122, 44.3%) and FBP (43/122, 35.2%), with significant differences between FBP and IR algorithms (P<0.017). Per-polyp sensitivity for polyps>=10 mm was also higher with MBIR (25/38, 65.8%) and ASIR80 (24/38, 63.2%) than with FBP (20/38, 58.8%), albeit without statistical significance (P>0.017). Mean number of FPs was significantly different among algorithms (FBP, 1.4; ASIR, 2.1; MBIR, 2.4) (P=0.011)., CONCLUSION: Although the performance of stand-alone CAD for ULD CTC can be improved, IR algorithms, particularly MBIR, were shown to significantly increase the per-polyp sensitivity of CAD compared to FBP according to this study. Therefore, as ULD CTC only requires 1.02mSv, specific optimization of CAD for ULD CTC and IR algorithms is strongly warranted to make ULD CTC with CAD clinically viable.

4322,"Trends in the incidence of sudden deaths and heart diseases in fukushima after the great east Japan earthquake On March 11, 2011, a great earthquake, known as the Great East Japan Earthquake, hit northeastern Japan, resulting in a tsunami that caused a nuclear disaster, the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident, forcing about 160,000 people to evacuate. We, therefore, sought to examine the effects of this evacuation on the onset of cardiovascular diseases and sudden death (SD) in Fukushima Prefecture, three years after the earthquake. We divided the evacuation zone into two areas, whole evacuation zone (Area 1) and partial evacuation zone (Area 2), and we defined the north district of the prefecture as the control area (Area 3). We cross-referenced the death certificate data with data from the Fukushima Prefecture acute myocardial infarction registration survey. For each area, we tallied the number of people who fell into the SD, myocardial infarction (MI), and MI suspected groups. We calculated the age-adjusted incidence rates and analyzed the differences in the adjusted incidence rates across three years using a Poisson regression model. The age-adjusted death rate of the SD group was significantly higher in 2011 in all areas than in 2012 or 2013 (P < 0.05). The total death rate was higher in Area 1 in March 2011, just after the disaster, than in the other two areas. The rate of SD was also higher in Area 1 than in the other areas in March 2011. The incidence of sudden cardiac death might have increased just after the Great East Japan Earthquake in the evacuation area, but not in other areas in Fukushima Prefecture.Copyright Â© 2019, International Heart Journal Association.

Frozen tissues from eight CRP patients and five non-CRP controls were collected and analyzed by antibody array, which contained sixty human angiogenesis-related factors. Quality controls with positive and negative controls were performed during antibody array analysis. Two differentially expressed factors were confirmed by ELISA. Result(s): CRP lesions showed vasculopathy, fibrosis, mucosal ulceration, edema, and inflammatory cell infiltration. Human angiogenesis antibody array and ELISA confirmed the increased angiostatin in CRP lesions. Immunohistochemical staining showed dispersed distribution of angiostatin throughout the mucosal and submucosal layers in CRP lesions, while angiostatin accumulated within the vessel lumens in non-CRP tissues. MVD significantly decreased in the submucosal layer of CRP, suggesting a potential association with increased angiostatin. Conclusion(s): Angiostatin increased and had a distinct distribution in CRP lesions. Compensatory telangiectasia in the mucosa, vessel stenosis, and reduced MVD might attenuate blood flow in the submucosa and contribute to CRP progression. Restoration of vascular functionality by promoting angiogenesis in the submucosal layer may help alleviate CRP in clinical practice.Copyright Â© 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Excluded
3798,"Is oncoplastic surgery a contraindication for accelerated partial breast radiation using the interstitial multicatheter brachytherapy method? Purpose: To evaluate accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) in patients after oncoplastic surgery for early breast cancer. Methods and Materials: A retrospective analysis of 136 breasts of 134 patients, who received breast-conserving oncoplastic surgery for low-risk breast cancer between 2002 and 2010 in the Universities of Vienna and Luebeck followed by adjuvant APBI applying total doses of pulse dose rate of 50.4Gy or high-dose rate (HDR) of 32Gy over 4days. Target volume definition was performed by the use of surgical-free margin data, related to intraoperatively fixed clip positions, pre- and postoperative imaging, and palpation. Result(s): At the time of data acquisition, 131 of 134 patients were alive. The median follow-up time was 39months (range, 4-106 months). After high-dose rate treatment, 3 of 89 patients showed systemic progress after a mean follow-up of 47months (range, 19-75 months) and 2 patients had a different quadrant in-breast tumor after 27 and 35months. One patient died 7months after treatment of unknown causes. After pulse dose rate treatment, 1 of 45 patients had a local recurrence after 42months and 1 patient died because of another cause after 13months. We observed mild fibrosis in 27 breasts, telangiectasia in 6, hyperpigmentation in 14 cases, and keloid formation in1. Conclusion(s): These preliminary results suggest the feasibility of multicatheter APBI after oncoplastic breast-conserving surgery in selected low-risk breast cancer patients; however, special attention to target volume definition is needed. Further prospective investigations with long follow-up are needed to define the real value of the procedure. Â© 2014 American Brachytherapy Society.",Excluded
4275,"pH-Sensitive and Long-Circulation Nanoparticles for Near-Infrared Fluorescence Imaging-Monitored and Chemo-Photothermal Synergistic Treatment Against Gastric Cancer Gastrectomy is the primary therapeutic option for gastric cancer. Postoperative treatment also plays a crucial role. The strategy to improve the postoperative prognosis of gastric cancer requires a combined system that includes a more efficient synergistic treatment and real-time monitoring after surgery. In this study, photothermal-chemotherapy combined nanoparticles (PCC NPs) were prepared via pi-pi stacking to perform chemo-photothermal synergistic therapy and continuous imaging of gastric cancer. PCC NPs had a spherical morphology and good monodispersity under aqueous conditions. The hydrodynamic diameter of PCC NPs was 59.4 +/- 3.6 nm. PCC NPs possessed strong encapsulation ability, and the maximum drug loading rate was approximately 37%. The NPs exhibited extraordinary stability and pH-response release profiles. The NPs were rapidly heated under irradiation. The maximum temperature was close to 58degreeC. PCC NPs showed good biocompatibility both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the NPs could effectively be used for in vivo continuous monitoring of gastric cancer. After one injection, the fluorescent signal remained in tumor tissues for nearly a week. The inhibitory effect of PCC NPs was evaluated in a gastric cancer cell line and xenograft mouse model. Both in vitro and in vivo evaluations demonstrated that PCC NPs could be used for chemo-photothermal synergistic therapy. The suppression effect of PCC NPs was significantly better than that of single chemotherapy or photothermal treatment. This study lays the foundation for the development of novel postoperative treatments for gastric cancer.Â© Copyright Â© 2020 Zhou, Sun, Zhou and Zhang.",Excluded
3724,"Interventional Radiology Image-Guided Suprapubic Cystostomy Using Trocar versus Seldinger Technique: A Comparative Analysis of Outcomes and Complications Objective: To compare two techniques-trocar and Seldinger-for performing percutaneous suprapubic cystostomy. Materials And Methods: 125 patients, mean age 71.8 +/- 16.5 years (range, 15-102 years), underwent primary suprapubic cystostomy from January 2013 to December 2018. Trocar access (N = 60) was performed as a single step using a puncture cannula without guidewire access. Seldinger access (N = 65) involved needle puncture, guidewire placement, and serial dilation. A retrospective review of patient records was conducted. Result(s): All procedures were technically successful. Mean catheter size was 13.1 +/- 2.0 and 13.9 +/- 2.0 French for trocar and Seldinger, respectively (P =.044). Mean procedure time was significantly reduced using trocar technique, 12.4 +/- 7.7 versus 25.7 +/- 12.1 minutes (P <.001), and was associated with lower anxiolytic dose, 1.2 +/- 0.8 versus 1.9 +/- 1.1 mg midazolam (P =.003), and less radiation exposure, 20.2 +/- 59.5 versus 100.7 +/- 98.5 mGy (P <.001). Catheter occlusion was the most common complication (28.8%), followed by UTI (13.6%) and bladder spasm (8.0%). All but 2 complications were classified as Clavien-Dindo grade I or II. Catheter occlusion was more frequent in the trocar group (41.7% vs 16.9%, P =.003), while bladder spasms were more frequent in the Seldinger group (13.8% vs 1.7%, P =.018). Conclusion(s): Suprapubic cystostomy via trocar is associated with faster procedure time, lower anxiolytic dose, and less radiation. While major complications are rare, catheter occlusion is a common occurrence that may be overlooked. Although we detected more occlusions with trocar technique, this may be confounded by a catheter-tract size discrepancy.Copyright Â© 2020",Excluded
4188,"[CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery in the treatment of patients with trigeminal neuralgia] Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a disabling disease with severe impairment of quality of life and everyday activity of patients. Range of treatment modalities is wide and includes conservative therapy, surgical methods and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). SRS is a minimally invasive technique which provides good results and minimal rate of complications. High geometrical and clinical precision of frameless SRS using CyberKnife system allows its application in TN when high dose is delivered to a small volume. The given paper focuses on the first Russian experience of frameless SRS of TN using robotized system CyberKnife. Since April 2009 till June 2011 4 patients with TN were treated in department for radiation therapy of Burdenko Neurosurgical Institute using CyberKnife system. Mean age was 63 years. Mean and maximal target dose reached 70 and 90 Gy, respectively. Data of catamnestic clinical examination were available in all 4 patients. Follow-up period reached 8 months. Response to treatment was observed in all cases. In 2 (50%) patients full effect was reached while in the rest only partial effect was present. No complications were encountered.

Method(s): From January 2004 to October 2015, 324 patients with gastric cancer who underwent radical D2 resection followed by postoperative CRT were enrolled. Clinicopathological characteristics and patterns of failure were retrospectively reviewed to identify factors associated with survival and recurrence. Result(s): After a median follow-up of 30 months, the 3-year overall survival and 3-year disease-free survival rates of these patients were 60.3 and 51.1%, respectively. 117 patients had recurrence or metastasis, with peritoneal recurrence as the most frequent (20.7%), followed by distant metastasis (14.2%). The most commonly involved distant organs were the liver (5.9%) and bone (4.9%). Locoregional failure occurred in 39 patients (12.0%), with isolated regional failure occurring in only 23 (7.1%). Further multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed N stage to be an independent risk factor for distant failure-free survival (p = 0.012). Independent risk factors for peritoneal metastasis were tumor differentiation (p = 0.022), T stage (p =0.035) and vascular invasion (p = 0.016). conclusion: Postoperative CRT has a potential effect on optimizing locoregional control, resulting in only 12.0% of locoregional failure. In patients after D2 resection and adjuvant CRT, peritoneal metastasis was the leading pattern of failure, followed by distant metastasis.Copyright Â© 2018 British Institute of Radiology.

4744,"The protective effects of ambroxol on radiation lung injury and influence on production of transforming growth factor beta1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha The aim of this article was to investigate the effect of ambroxol on radiation lung injury and the expression of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1), as well as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in plasma. Totally, 120 patients with locally advanced lung cancer in radiotherapy were randomized into treatment and control groups. Patients in the treatment group took ambroxol orally at a dosage of 90 mg, three times per day for 3 months from the beginning of radiotherapy. The expression of TGF-beta1 and TNF-alpha in plasma was analyzed. The clinical symptoms and lung diffusing capacity were monitored using high resolving power computed tomography. The level of TGF-beta1 in the control group was increased (11.8 +/- 5.5 ng/ml), whereas in ambroxol-treated patients, the increase was not significant (5.6 +/- 2.6 ng/ml, P < 0.001). Radiotherapy-induced elevation of TNF-alpha levels, seen in control patients, was also abolished after treatment with ambroxol (5.1 +/- 1.0 vs. 2.4 +/- 0.8 ng/ml, P < 0.001). In the treatment group, carbon monoxide diffusion capacity was not significantly decreased at 6, 12, and 18 months post-radiotherapy, compared with the control group (P < 0.05). Ambroxol decreased the expression of TGF-beta1 and TNF-alpha, and minimized the diminishment of lung diffusion capacity after radiotherapy. Â© 2009 Humana Press Inc.",Excluded

Effective radiation doses were calculated. We investigated the diagnostic accuracy of high-pitch, low-dose, prospective, electrocardiogram-triggering, dual-source MDCT for CABG patency compared with catheter coronary angiography imaging findings., RESULTS: A total of 215 grafts and 645 vessel segments were analyzed. All graft segments had diagnostic image quality. The proximal and middle graft segments had significantly (P < 0.05) better mean image quality scores (1.18 +/- 0.4) than the distal segments (1.31 +/- 0.5). Using catheter coronary angiography as the reference standard, high-pitch MDCT had the following sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of per-segment analysis for detecting graft patency: 97.1%, 99.6%, 94.4%, and 99.8%, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, MDCT can be used noninvasively with a lower radiation dose for the assessment of restenosis in CABG patients.",Excluded

4884,"Proton pencil beam scanning for mediastinal lymphoma: treatment planning and robustness assessment BACKGROUND: Modern radiotherapy (RT) for lymphoma is highly personalized. While advanced imaging is largely employed to define limited treatment volumes, the use of proton pencil beam scanning (PBS) for highly conformal lymphoma RT is still in its infancy. Here, we assess the dosimetric benefits and feasibility of PBS for mediastinal lymphoma (ML)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten patients were planned using PBS for involved-site RT. The initial plans were calculated on the average four-dimensional computed tomography (4D-CT). PBS plans were compared with 3D conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT), intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), and proton double scattering (DS). In order to evaluate the feasibility of PBS and the plan robustness against inter- and intra-fractional uncertainties, the 4D dose was calculated on initial and verification CTs. The deviation of planned dose from delivered dose was measured. The same proton beamline was used for all patients, while another beamline with larger spots was employed for patients with large motion perpendicular to the beam., RESULTS: PBS provided the lowest mean lung dose (MLD) and mean heart dose (MHD) for all patients in comparison with 3D-CRT, IMRT, and DS. For eight patients, internal target volume (ITV) D98% was degraded by <3%; and the MLD and MHD deviated by <10% of prescription over the course of treatment when the PBS field was painted twice in each session. For one patient with target motion perpendicular to the beam (>5 mm), the degradation of ITV D98% was 9%, which was effectively mitigated by employing large spots. One patient exhibited large dose degradation due to pericardial effusion, which required replanning across all modalities., CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that PBS plans significantly reduce MLD and MHD relative to 3D-CRT, IMRT, and DS and identifies requirements for robust free-breathing ML PBS treatments, showing that PBS plan robustness can be maintained with repainting and/or large spots.",Excluded

The aim of our study was to investigate liver morphological features in relation to alpha-isoform of smooth muscle actin expression in hepatic stellate cells in six patients treated by localized radiotherapy on the biliopancreatic area. Within the month after completion of treatment, an activation of hepatic stellate cells strictly confined to irradiated areas and coinciding with congestive changes was observed. At a later stage, collagen deposition gradually increased, replacing the congestive and destroyed areas. This new fibrotic tissue also contained numerous alpha-smooth muscle positive cells. Our data suggest that early hepatic stellate cells activation coinciding with congestive changes plays an important role in radiation liver injury and ensuing fibrosis.",Included
4681,"SAR values of mobile phones. Safety evaluation and risk perception The specific absorption rate (SAR) is a prominent topic in the discussion about precautionary health protection. An experimental study investigated the effect of information about various SAR values (below the existing partial body limit value of 2 W/kg) on safety judgments of potential mobile phones users. It turns out that about 94% of the participants do not know the SAR value of their own mobile phone. SAR values below existing limits are not perceived as equally safe. Rather, the lower the SAR value, the higher the perceived safety. However, a majority of the participants does not consider these SAR values to be 100% safe, even if they are clearly below the existing limits. Explicitly indicating a precautionary limit value (referring to the Federal Office for Radiation Protection or to consumer organizations) does not change this safety evaluation. As expected, safety evaluation of the SAR values is also related to the perception of mobile phone risks. Those who are concerned about mobile phone communication give lower safety judgments than the unconcerned-independent of the level of the SAR values. Irrespective of that, our results suggest that establishing the SAR value as a criterion for mobile phones depends first of all on making it known to the public.",Excluded

This recommendation is largely based on the findings of the National Lung Screening Trial. Both policy-level and clinical decision-making about LDCT screening must consider the potential benefits of screening (reduced mortality from lung cancer) and possible harms. Effective screening requires an appreciation that screening should be limited to individuals at high risk of death from lung cancer, and that the risk of harm related to false positive findings, overdiagnosis, and unnecessary invasive testing is real. A comprehensive understanding of these aspects of screening will inform appropriate implementation, with the objective that an evidence-based and systematic approach to screening will help to reduce the enormous mortality burden of lung cancer.",Excluded

Ninety-seven percent of tumors progress, and 5-year surgery rates are 20%-60%. Stereotactic radiosurgery and fractionated radiotherapy have had limited success. For the first time, we have used infratentorial craniospinal radiation therapy (ICSRT) for VHL patients with CNS hemangioblastomas. Consecutive VHL patients treated at the National Institutes of Health with radiographic evidence of hemangioblastomas were included if they received ICSRT. Patients underwent neurologic examinations and imaging at 3- to 12-month intervals. Seven patients with 84 hemangioblastomas met eligibility criteria. ICSRT was commonly administered to 43.2 Gy in 24 fractions. Mean pre-ICSRT tumor volume was 5.48 cm3. At a mean follow-up of 73.8 months, mean post-ICSRT tumor volume was 6.87 cm3, and 91 tumors were identified. Complete radiographic resolution was achieved in 17.9% of lesions. Although many patients were no longer optimal surgical candidates, only 4 surgeries were needed for symptomatic lesions after ICSRT, compared with 33 prior. Acute toxicity was mild and no patient developed grade >=1 late spinal cord toxicity according to the criteria of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer, despite the high dose that the entire spinal cord received. Clinical and radiographic stability or resolution was demonstrated in the majority of tumors. Tumor growth rate in this study was less than reported in natural history studies, and the rate of surgical intervention was reduced. ICSRT was well tolerated, can decrease hemangioblastoma growth rate, and is a potential therapeutic option for VHL patients that warrants further investigation. Â© 2011 The Author(s).",Excluded

Use of the Pipeline embolization device (PED) for pseudoaneurysm exclusion at the skull base is not well described. Objective To report the clinical and angiographic outcome after using multiple PEDs to treat recently ruptured radiation-induced carotid pseudoaneurysms at the skull base. Methods Retrospective review of the clinical and angiographic records of patients who received PEDs as primary treatment for skull base carotid pseudoaneurysm between April 1, 2011 to March 31, 2013. Results Seven patients (five men, two women) with a mean age of 58 years (range 47-65) were treated in the study period. Primary treatment with the PED alone, with adjunct coil embolization in two patients, achieved immediate hemostasis in all patients, with no pseudoaneurysm rebleeding after a mean follow-up of 15.3 months (range 4-24 months). One patient had periprocedural cerebral infarction. Delayed internal carotid artery occlusion secondary to in-stent thrombosis occurred in three patients, one of whom had lacunar infarct and two remained asymptomatic. Conclusions Endovascular treatment with the PED was effective in excluding skull base post-irradiated carotid pseudoaneurysms and preventing recurrent blowout.

Method(s): We analyzed 17 radiation-oncology patients who underwent thoracic CE+ CTs. Full-resolution CT and 5-bulk-density plans were generated using an adaptive convolution algorithm. Bulk densities for air, lung, fat, soft tissue, and bone were applied to regions identified by an isodensity segmentation tool. The population-averaged physical density of each region was calculated and compared with the reference value calculated from 66 noncontrast-enhanced (CE-) thoracic CT images. Using the 5-bulk densities, we created a new plan in which the physical densities of each area were forced to be the same as the CE- reference value, and we compared the dose-volume histograms (DVH). Result(s): Average physical density for the segmented air, lung, fat, soft tissue, and bone for CE+ were 0.14, 0.29, 0.90, 1.03, and 1.13 g/cm3, and the reference values for CE- were 0.14, 0.26, 0.89, 1.02, and 1.12 g/cm3, respectively.

There is a global crisis due to a lack of qualified applicants entering STEM careers, especially in science. Add the fact that women are greatly underrepresented in science, and the solution becomes obvious. Go to the source, and find out why girls as young as 12 years old are losing an interest in scientific endeavors that they once found to be captivating. This action research project sought to find out if the implementation of aerospace science, embedded both in the classroom and in an after school Space Club, could assist girls in maintaining their confidence and engagement in science overall as they transition to middle school. Furthermore, girls in fifth through seventh grade, who had previously been the teacher researcher's students, were included in the study in order to discover if their previous participation in a variety of authentic and ongoing aerospace activities had any impact upon their engagement in science as they entered the notable years of declined interest. The research took place at an international American school, Academia Cotopaxi, in Quito, Ecuador from September 2015 through April 2016. Data was collected through both qualitative and quantitative sources, and included attitude surveys, parent questionnaires, a writing prompt, photos, video, interviews and observations. Additionally, a control group was utilized in grades five to seven for purposes of comparison. Innovative activities included engaging and first-hand experiences with the Ecuadorian Civilian Space Agency (EXA), the National Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA), Space X and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). Inquiry-based activities included, but were not limited to, experiences with: speaking live with both astronauts and cosmonauts on the International Space Station, robotics, rocketry, Skype chats with aerospace professionals, utilizing the Design Process, online resources and more. Findings suggested that embedding aerospace science in grade four, both during and after school hours, not only increased girls' interest and confidence in science, but also served to maintain and foster an interest in STEM as they transitioned to middle school.

In contrast, removal of 6-4 photoproducts was rapid (half-life = 2.3 h), the decay kinetics of which correlated better with the decline in epidermal unscheduled DNA synthesis (half-life = 7.1 h). These data show that as in mouse, monkey, and in vitro models, the 6-4 photolesion is repaired preferentially in human epidermis in situ. They also raise the possibility that poor thymine dimer repair may be a feature of skin types I and II, who are more prone to skin cancer than are types III and IV. There was an inverse relationship between the onset of erythema and 6-4 photoproduct repair, suggesting that this repair process initiates erythema.",Excluded
4169,"A simple and effective daily pain management method for patients receiving radiation therapy for painful bone metastases Purpose: The incidence of painful bone metastases increases with longer survival times. Although external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) is an effective palliative treatment, it often requires several days from the start of treatment to produce a measurable reduction in pain scores and a qualitative amelioration of patient pain levels. Meanwhile, the use of analgesics remains the best approach early on in the treatment course. We investigated the role of radiation therapists as key personnel for collecting daily pain scores to supplement assessments by physician and oncology nursing staff and manage pain more effectively during radiation treatment. Methods and Materials: Daily pain scores were obtained by the radiation therapists for 89 patients undertaking a total of 124 courses of EBRT for bone metastases and compared with pretreatment pain scores. The majority of patients (71%) were treated to 30 Gy (range, 20-37.5) in 10 fractions (range, 8-15 fractions). Result(s): One hundred nineteen treatment courses (96%) were completed. Pain scores declined rapidly to 37.5%, 50%, and 75% of the pretreatment levels by Days 2, 4, and 10, respectively. Pain was improved in 91% of patients with only 4% of worse pain at the end of treatment. Improved pain scores were maintained in 83% of patients at 1-month follow-up, but in 35% of them, the pain was worse than at the end of treatment. Conclusion(s): Collection of daily pain scores by radiation therapists was associated with an effective reduction in pain scores early on during EBRT of painful osseous metastases.

3980,"Estimates of Environmental Exposure to Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields and Risk of Lymphoma Subtypes We investigated the association between environmental exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) and risk of lymphoma subtypes in a case-control study comprised of 322 patients and 444 individuals serving as controls in Sardinia, Italy in 1998-2004. Questionnaire information included the self-reported distance of the three longest held residential addresses from fixed radio-television transmitters and mobile phone base stations. We georeferenced the residential addresses of all study subjects and obtained the spatial coordinates of mobile phone base stations. For each address within a 500-meter radius from a mobile phone base station, we estimated the RF-EMF intensity using predictions from spatial models, and we performed RF-EMF measurements at the door in the subset of the longest held addresses within a 250-meter radius. We calculated risk of lymphoma and its major subtypes associated with the RF-EMF exposure metrics with unconditional logistic regression, adjusting by age, gender and years of education. In the analysis of self-reported data, risk associated with residence in proximity (within 50 meters) to fixed radio-television transmitters was likewise elevated for lymphoma overall [odds ratio = 2.7, 95% confidence interval = 1.5-4.6], and for the major lymphoma subtypes. With reference to mobile phone base stations, we did not observe an association with either the self-reported, or the geocoded distance from mobile phone base stations. RF-EMF measurements did not vary by case-control status. By comparing the self-reports to the geocoded data, we discovered that the cases tended to underestimate the distance from mobile phone base stations differentially from the controls (P = 0.073). The interpretation of our findings is compromised by the limited study size, particularly in the analysis of the individual lymphoma subtypes, and the unavailability of the spatial coordinates of radio-television transmitters. Nonetheless, our results do not support the hypothesis of a link between environmental exposure to RF-EMF from mobile phone base stations and risk of lymphoma subtypes.Copyright Â© 2018 by Radiation Research Society.",Excluded
3732,"High ambient solar UV correlates with greater beta HPV seropositivity in New South Wales, Australia Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is highly prevalent worldwide and may have a role, with sun exposure, in causing cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Little is known about the relationship of UV exposure and seroprevalence of cutaneous HPVs in the general population. Method(s): Using multiplex serology, we estimated the seroprevalence of 23 beta and 7 gamma HPVs and 7 other antigens (mu HPV1, HPV63, nu HPV41, alpha HPV16; polyomaviruses HPyV7 and MCV; p53) in a population-based sample of 1,161 Australian 45 and Up Study participants with valid data from blood specimens collected from 2010 to 2012. We calculated prevalence ratios (PR) for the association of each antigen with residential ambient solar UV and other UV-related variables. Result(s): Seropositivity for at least one beta or gamma HPV was high at 88% (beta HPVs 74%, gamma HPVs 70%), and less in women than men [e.g., PR beta-2 HPV38 1/4 0.70; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.56-0.87; any gamma 1/4 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84-0.97]. A high ambient UV level in the 10 years before study enrollment was associated with elevated seroprevalence for genus beta (PRtertile3vs1 any beta 1/4 1.17; 95% CI, 1.07-1.28), and beta-1 to beta-3 species, but not for gamma HPVs. Other UV-related measures had less or no evidence of an association. Conclusion(s): Seroprevalence of cutaneous beta HPVs is higher with higher ambient UV exposure in the past 10 years. Impact: The observed association between ambient UV in the past 10 years and cutaneous HPVs supports further study of the possible joint role of solar UV and HPV in causing skin cancer.Copyright Â©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.",Excluded
4308,"Regional correlation between estimated UVB levels and skin cancer mortality in Japan Most ecological studies investigating the relationship between incidence and/or mortality of skin cancer and surrogate measures of ultraviolet radiation B (UVB) have been conducted among the Caucasian population. The objective of the present study was therefore to assess the geographical correlation between ambient UVB estimates and regional mortality rates for skin cancer in Japan. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for malignant melanoma and other malignant neoplasms of the skin was calculated by sex, region and time-period for all deaths occurring in the period 1973-1994. The Spearman's correlation coefficient was calculated between estimated ambient UVB and regional SMRs for the two types of skin cancer. There was no geographical correlation between UVB and skin cancer mortality, except for a significantly negative correlation in malignant melanoma among males and a significantly negative correlation in other malignant neoplasms of the skin confined to unexposed anatomic sites of the body among females. The characteristic ecological relationship adds to the importance of conducting further epidemiological studies at the individual level in Japan.",Excluded
3934,"Spherical aberration reduction in nuclear cataracts PURPOSE: To measure higher-order aberrations (HOAs) in nuclear cataracts and to investigate spherical aberration changes with nuclear cataract progression., METHODS: A total of 102 eyes of older subjects (>50 years) were classified based on the nuclear opalescence (NO) grading of the Lens Opacities Classification System III: Group 1 (= NO 4:21 eyes). Wave front measurements were performed with a Hartmann-Shack aberrometer. To investigate lenticular spherical aberration, HOAs were examined in 28 eyes before and after phacoemulsification, followed by insertion of an aberration-free intraocular lens. The relationship between lens opacity grade and ocular and lenticular spherical aberrations were investigated., RESULTS: Mean spherical aberrations in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 were 0.25 +/- 0.10, 0.16 +/- 0.13, 0.12 +/- 0.15, and 0.10 +/- 0.20 mum, respectively, and showed a significant difference with nuclear opacity grading (p = 0.001). The spherical aberration showed negative associations with nuclear opacity grading (r = -0.408, p < 0.001). The predominant change in HOAs after phacoemulsification was an increase in spherical aberration, and 86 % of lenticular spherical aberrations were presumed to have negative values. The lenticular spherical aberration was negatively correlated with nuclear opacity severity (r = -0.409, p = 0.031)., CONCLUSIONS: Ocular spherical aberration decreases with the progression of nuclear cataracts due to the negative correlation between lenticular spherical aberration and nuclear opacity severity.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of regional fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (F-FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) in patients with skull base osteomyelitis (SBO) and to compare with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) whenever available., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 77 patients (male:female = 56:21; mean age 66.4 +/- 9.4 years) with clinically suspected SBO, who underwent regional F-FDG PET-CT were included in this retrospective study. F-FDG PET-CT images were analyzed for presence, localization and intensity of FDG uptake. Diagnostic performance of F-FDG PET-CT was analyzed based on histopathology, culture, and clinical/imaging follow-up. The agreement analysis between F-FDG PET-CT and MRI findings was performed in 56 patients., RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of F-FDG PET-CT for diagnosing SBO were 96.7, 93.3, 98.3, 87.5, and 96.1%, respectively. The average SUVmax of the lesions was 5.9 +/- 3.5. The SUVmax of the fungal lesions was lower than that of bacterial lesions with P-value of <0.001. On comparing variables like C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and SUVmax for prediction of recurrence/progression, by plotting an ROC curve, the SUVmax was found to be an independent prognostic marker. 56 out of 77 patients had undergone both F-FDG PET-CT and MRI. The agreement analysis between the modalities showed almost perfect agreement for delineation of soft tissue and bony involvement with kappa values of 0.82 and 0.81, respectively., CONCLUSION: F-FDG PET-CT is a sensitive tool in evaluation of patients with SBO. It shows a very good agreement with the MRI. It plays a critical role in treatment response evaluation.",Excluded
4331,"Critical analysis of lumbar interspinous devices failures: A retrospective study Interspinous devices (IDs) were introduced in the 90s. Since then, they have rapidly become very popular for the minimally invasive treatment of lumbar pain disorders. They feature different shapes and biomechanical characteristics, and are used in the spine degenerative pathologies or as motion segment stabilizers (dynamic stabilization) or to obtain the decompression of neurological structures. The indications seem to be rather narrow and still to be verified in terms of their clinical efficacy. However, IDs are being extensively utilized beyond their classical indications with the inevitable risk of a clinical failure. The aim of the present work was to carry out a critical analysis of the causes of failure in a series of 19 patients. From January 2007 to March 2009, 19 patients with residual painful syndrome after the implantation of IDs were observed. The series includes 11 males and 8 females with a mean age of 53.6 years (range 38-84 years) who were operated on elsewhere and who underwent revision surgery at our hospital. The inclusion criteria were low back pain and/or radiculopathy after the device implantation without improvement of the painful symptomatology, radiculopathy with signs of sensory and motor deficit, intermittent neurogenic claudication, and infection. All patients were thoroughly re-assessed with new standard imaging examinations such as MRI and CT scans, considering the following image features: the position of the device with respect to the spinous processes (X-ray), the intervertebral disc disease of the level operated upon or of the adjacent levels (MRI), the segmental instability (dynamic X-rays), the severity of the canal stenosis (CT). The accurate evaluation of the clinical and imaging parameters revealed three main causes of failure: errors of indication, technical errors and the structural failure of the ID. The most frequent cause of failure was a wrong indication. The results of the study are presented and the causes of failure are discussed in detail. Â© 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Excluded
4538,"Oral mucositis in patients undergoing radiation treatment for head and neck carcinoma BACKGROUND: The current study was conducted to characterize the risks and clinical consequences of oral mucositis (OM) in patients with head and neck carcinoma (HNC) who are receiving radiation therapy., METHODS: Data regarding 450 HNC patients who had received radiation therapy were collected via chart review from 154 U.S. medical and radiation oncologists. Information obtained included patient characteristics, treatments received, highest recorded grade of OM during radiation therapy (none, mild, moderate, or severe), and outcomes potentially associated with mucosal injury., RESULTS: The mean age (+/- standard deviation [SD]) of the study subjects was 61.3 years (12.3 yrs); the majority of patients (80%) were men. Primary tumor locations included the oropharynx (26.4%), larynx (26.4%), oral cavity including the lip (24.4%), hypopharynx (13.6%), and nasopharynx (9.1%). The majority of tumors were new and were classified as AJCC Stages III or IV. The majority of patients (83%) received standard radiation therapy; the mean (+/- SD) cumulative dose was 6285 centigrays (cGy) (+/- 1158 cGy). Approximately 33% of the patients received concomitant chemotherapy. The majority of patients (83%) developed OM; 29% developed severe OM. Patients with severe OM were more likely to have nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal tumors (adjusted odds ratio [OR] of 10.1 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 2.1-49.9] and 6.9 [95% CI, 2.4-19.7], respectively), and to have received cumulative radiation doses > 5000 cGy (OR of 10.4; 95% CI, 2.9-37.1) and concomitant chemotherapy (OR of 3.3; 95% CI, 1.4-8.0).

4128,"Postoperative chest radiograph after open reduction internal fixation of clavicle fractures: a necessary practice? Hypothesis/Background: Iatrogenic pneumothorax is a rare but serious complication of open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of clavicular fractures. Many institutions use postoperative chest radiographs to evaluate for this complication despite a lack of data to support this routine practice. Due to concerns of radiation exposure and health care costs, this practice may not be necessary. This study determined the rate of iatrogenic pneumothorax after clavicular ORIF with plate fixation at a single institution over 8 years. We hypothesized that postoperative chest radiographs would identify a very low rate of pneumothorax in patients with isolated clavicular fractures with no serious preoperative pulmonary injury. Method(s): A retrospective review was performed identifying all patients undergoing clavicular ORIF with plate fixation at a single Level I trauma center by 3 board-certified orthopedic surgeons from 2009 to 2017. Patients without at least 1 postoperative chest radiograph were excluded. We determined patient demographics and rate of preoperative and postoperative pneumothorax. Result(s): We identified 89 patients without preoperative pneumothorax who underwent clavicular ORIF with at least 1 postoperative chest radiograph. Within this group, no patients (0%) had a new postoperative iatrogenic pneumothorax. Discussion/Conclusion: Within this series of 89 patients with isolated clavicular fractures without preoperative pneumothorax, no iatrogenic pneumothoraces occurred after plate fixation. Therefore, for patients undergoing ORIF of isolated clavicular fractures obtaining a postoperative chest radiograph may be an unnecessary practice, especially given their low sensitivity. Future high-powered studies are needed to validate this finding.Copyright Â© 2018 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees",Excluded

Method(s): The cases of 94 patients with stage I-II NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type in the upper aerodigestive tract who treated between May 2005 and Dec 2008 were reviewed. These patients received radiotherapy with or without induction chemotherapy. Definitive radiotherapy was conducted using 3DCRT in 47 patients and IMRT in the other 47 patients with a regional field and a total dose of 50 Gy. Dosimetric pmeters of radiation treatment plans, local control probability (LCP), overall survival (OS), and toxicities were analyzed and compared between 3DCRT and IMRT. Result(s): From the dosimetric analysis, IMRT demonstrated significantly better dose coverage and homogeneity than 3DCRT. However, after a median follow-up of 46 months, IMRT was not associated with improvements in 4y-OS (80.9% for 3DCRT vs. 82.7% for IMRT, p=0.87) or 4y-LCP (86.3% for 3DCRT vs. 88.9% for IMR p=0.85). Of the 18 patients who received cervical lymph node irradiation, those in the IMRT group received a lower mean parotid dose. Furthermore, at-risk organs were strictly kept within the safe dose range in both groups, and no severe late toxicity was observed. Conclusion(s): IMRT provided better dose coverage than 3DCRT, although it failed to provide LCP and OS benefits. Definitive radiotherapy with a regional field and a total dose of 50 Gy is efficient and safe for NK/T-cell lymphoma using either IMRT or 3DCRT. However, IMRT may have the potential to reduce parotid gland hypofunction following cervical irradiation. Â© 2013 Shen et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded

Three-dimensional rotational spinal angiography is an advanced tool that allows the surgeon to gain a better appreciation of the anatomy of these spinal vascular lesions and their relation to surrounding structures. This article describes the use of rotational angiography and 3D reconstructions in the diagnosis and management of spinal vascular malformations., METHODS: The authors present representative cases involving surgical treatment planning for spinal vascular malformations with focus on the utility and technique of rotational spinal angiography. They report the use of rotational spinal angiography for a heterogeneous collection of vascular pathological conditions., RESULTS: Eight patients underwent rotational spinal angiography in addition to digital subtraction angiography (DSA) for the diagnosis and characterization of various spinal vascular lesions. Postprocessed images were used to characterize the lesion in relation to surrounding bone and to enhance the surgeon's ability to precisely localize and obliterate the abnormality. The reconstructions provided superior anatomical detail compared with traditional DSA. No associated complications from the rotational angiography were noted, and there was no statistically significant difference in the amount of radiation exposure to patients undergoing rotational angiography relative to traditional angiography., CONCLUSIONS: The use of rotational spinal angiography provides a rapid and powerful diagnostic tool, superior to conventional DSA in the diagnosis and preoperative planning of a variety of spinal vascular pathology. A more detailed understanding of the anatomy of such lesions provided by this technique may improve the safety of the surgical approach.",Excluded
3936,"Management of extended radionecrosis in the pelvic area with repeated surgical debridement and omental transposition Extended radionecrosis in the pelvic area is a disaster occurring in a minority of patients treated with radiotherapy. Extensive excisional procedures, including pelvic exenteration, have been recommended, but carry high morbidity and mortality rates. Alternative treatment strategies are needed to improve survival and increase the quality of life in these patients. We retrospectively analysed the charts of eight patients treated for radionecrosis in the pelvic area between 1985 and 1991. During this period deviatory procedures, repeated but limited debridement and the early incorporation of an omental flap in the ischemic area were used in an attempt to avoid exenteration, but effectively stop further progression of infection and necrosis. The patients underwent a median of five surgical interventions (range: 2 to 21) for 10 sites of radionecrosis. The total of 61 procedures consisted of debridement (29), omental pedicle grafting (6), deviation of urinary tract (3) or intestinal tract (4) and including procedures due to complications (21). They were hospitalized for a median duration of 95 days (range 43-155) divided over several admissions (median 3, range 2-8). One patient died of sepsis during treatment. Complete recovery was achieved in all surviving patients with a median of 12 months (range: 9 to 20 months) after initial surgery. Early surgery, the limited extent of the procedures and omental transposition were the main components of our approach. We conclude that this approach has an acceptable morbidity and mortality rate, while a relatively good quality of life is achieved.",Excluded
4033,"Indications of future decreasing trends in skin-melanoma mortality among whites in the United States Trends in skin melanoma death rates during a 35-year period, 1950-84, were analyzed according to age, sex, and birth cohort for whites in the United States. In contrast to upward trends observed for older men and women (i.e., over 40), downward trends were noted for younger age groups. The risk of dying from skin melanoma appears to have peaked for male cohorts born during the 1950s and for female cohorts born during the 1930s. Assuming no future environmental or lifestyle changes, the upward trend in age-adjusted mortality rates, which averaged 2 to 3% per annum since 1950, is projected to discontinue and bend downward by the second decade of the 21st century. Skin melanoma incidence data, which was limited to a series of 12 years (1973-84) and inadequate for cohort analyses, were included to demonstrate that trends in age-specific rates were comparable with those observed for mortality during the overlapping time period. Incidence trends according to anatomical site are also described. These results indicate that baseline data necessary for assessing the potential effects on this disease from future depletions of the ozone layer, and predicted increases of solar ultra-violet radiation exposure, would be improved with the inclusion of cohort data and age-specific trend analyses.",Excluded

Purpose(s): To evaluate staff radiation exposure during PCP and the effect of adjunctive protective drapes on dose reduction. Method(s): The RADIANT study (NCT01974453) is a prospective, observational study evaluating operator radiation exposure during PCP using electronic dosimeter. In a sub-group of procedures all the staff members (II operator, nurse circulator and technologist) were also equipped with a dedicated electronic dosimeter. Result(s): From a total of 2028 procedures included in the RADIANT study, staff members' doses were available for 122 procedures (67 coronarography and 55 percutaneous coronary interventions). Median fluoroscopy time was 306 s (Interquartile range 155-526 s) and the dose area product (DAP) was 18.0 Gy*cm2 (10-35.5 Gy*cm2). The radiation exposure was highest for the operating physician (6.7 muSv) and progressively lower for the nurse circulator (1.8 muSv), the II operator (1 muSv) and the technologist (0.7 muSv, p < 0.001). Protective pelvic drapes were used in 43 procedures and associated with a lower radiation exposure for all staff members (14 muSv vs 2.2 muSv for operating physician, p < 0.001, 1.7 muSv vs 0.49 muSv for II operator, p < 0.001, 2.16 muSv vs 0.93 muSv for nurse circulator, p = 0.02 and 0.85 muSv vs 0.39 muSv for technologist, p = 0.01).

4710,"Solar urticaria Introduction. Solar urticaria (SU) is a rare photodermatosis induced by a broad spectrum of electromagnetic radiation. Theoretically it should not present a diagnostic problem, but in everyday practice it is quite frequently misdiagnosed. Objective. To characterize SU cases diagnosed in the photobiology unit of the Dermatological Department of WUM, with particular analysis of conformity of initial diagnosis with that established in the photobiology unit. Material and methods. Investigation was performed in 87 patients directed to the photobiology unit with diagnosis of solar urticaria (out of 12 041 patients with different forms of light hypersensitivity tested). In all patients in order to determine sensitivity to UVB and UVA phototests were performed. They included evaluation of minimal urticarial dose. As the light source fluorescent bulbs emitting a continuous spectrum of UVB or UVA were used. In 5 patients to evaluate sensitivity to visible light a slide projector was used. In 30 patients additionally photopatch tests were done. Results. Our results confirmed rare occurrence of solar urticaria. Diagnosis of US was confirmed only in 15 out of 87 patients with such initial diagnosis (17.2%); they represented 0.12% of all patients with photodermatoses tested. In this group there were 8 women and 7 men of mean age 26.2 years (M), 25.7 years (W). In the majority (9) of cases the disease lasted one year before testing. The US action spectrum in our patients was UVA + UVB in 9 cases, mainly UVA in 2, mainly UVB in 2, and in two patients urticarial wheals were provoked by UVA, UVB and visible light. We did not notice either delayed onset or prolonged duration of urticaria. Photopatch testing and longer (up to 2 weeks after UV exposure) observation of irradiated sites enabled us to make a proper diagnosis in further 52 patients. In 35 we disclosed polymorphic light eruptions, in 12 contact dermatitis to chromium, in 2 photocontact dermatitis to chlorpromazine and fragrance substances. In 3 patients we diagnosed chronic actinic dermatitis. In 20 cases it was not possible to establish a definite diagnosis. Wrong initial diagnosis was observed mainly in patients hypersensitive to UVA. Conclusions. In patients with oedemato-erythematous lesions after sun exposure lasting longer than 24 h, particularly in the elderly, diagnostic procedures should include additionally to phototesting patch and photopatch tests.",Excluded

4119,"Phase I dose-escalation study of endoscopic intratumoral injection of OBP-301 (Telomelysin) with radiotherapy in oesophageal cancer patients unfit for standard treatments PURPOSE: OBP-301 (Telomelysin) is an attenuated type-5 adenovirus that contains the human telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter to regulate viral replication. OBP-301 sensitises human cancer cells to ionising radiation by inhibiting DNA repair, and radiation enhances coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor-mediated OBP-301 infection on the contrary. We assessed OBP-301 with radiotherapy in oesophageal cancer patients unfit for standard chemoradiation treatments., METHODS: A phase I dose-escalation study of OBP-301 with radiotherapy was conducted in 13 histologically confirmed oesophageal cancer patients deemed unfit to undergo surgery or chemotherapy. Study treatment consisted of OBP-301 administration by intratumoural needle injection using a flexible endoscope on days 1, 18 and 32. Radiotherapy was administered concurrently over 6 weeks, beginning on day 4, to a total of 60 Gy., RESULTS: Of the 13 patients, 7, 3 and 3 patients were treated with 1010, 1011 and 1012 virus particles, respectively. Study group comprised 10 males and 3 females, with a median age of 82 years (range, 53-91 years). All patients developed a transient, self-limited lymphopenia.

Eight patients had local complete response (CR); all of them exhibited no pathologically viable malignant cells in biopsy specimens, and 3 patients had a partial response. The objective response rate was 91.7%. The clinical CR rate was 83.3% in stage I and 60.0% in stage II/III. Histopathological examination revealed massive infiltration of CD8+ cells and increased PD-L1 expression., CONCLUSION: Multiple courses of endoscopic intratumoural OBP-301 injection with radiotherapy are feasible and provide clinical benefits in patients with oesophageal cancer unfit for standard treatments.

4099,"Long-term outcomes of hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for refractory functional pituitary adenoma Objective: Refractory functional pituitary adenomas are often treated with single-session stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or conventionally fractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). While single-fraction SRS offers convenience and short time to biochemical remission, large tumors with cranial nerve or chiasmatic involvement often preclude single-fraction SRS, and toxicity may be worse following single-fraction SRS compared with IMRT. The purpose of our study was to explore the long-term outcomes of a unique hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT) regimen delivered in 2-5 fractions. Method(s): After approval, we studied 16 consecutive patients treated with HSRT for refractory functional pituitary adenoma. Study endpoints included local control, biochemical control, and toxicity. Descriptive statistics summarized endpoints and clinicopathologic factors. Result(s): Sixteen patients with adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion (n = 9, 56%), growth hormone secretion (n = 4, 25%), and prolactin secretion (n = 3, 19%) were studied with a median follow-up time after HSRT of 10 years (IQR 2-14 years). Patients were treated with two (n = 8), three (n = 1), or five (n = 7) fractions to median dose of 20.5 Gy (range 16-32 Gy). HSRT was well-tolerated with no acute side effects greater than CTCAE grade 1. Local control was 100%, and biochemical control at last follow-up was 58%. Over 142 years patient-years, no instances of optic neuropathy, secondary malignancy, malignant transformation, radionecrosis, cavernous sinus cranial neuropathy, or cerebrovascular complications were noted. Conclusion(s): HSRT for refractory pituitary adenoma is well-tolerated with long-term local and biochemical control comparable with single-fraction SRS or IMRT. Prospective studies should evaluate whether HSRT provides non-inferior biochemical control and improved toxicity compared with single-fraction SRS.Copyright Â© 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded

4085,"Outcomes and prognostic stratification of patients with recurrent glioblastoma treated with salvage stereotactic radiosurgery OBJECTIVE Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most malignant form of astrocytoma. The average survival is 6-10 months in patients with recurrent GBM (rGBM). In this study, the authors evaluated the role of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in patients with rGBMs. METHODS The authors performed a retrospective review of their brain tumor database (1997-2016). Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) after salvage SRS were the primary endpoints evaluated. Response to SRS was assessed using volumetric MR images. RESULTS Fifty-three patients with rGBM underwent salvage SRS targeting 75 lesions. The median tumor diameter and volume were 2.55 cm and 3.80 cm3, respectively. The median prescription dose was 18 Gy (range 12-24 Gy) and the homogeneity index was 1.90 (range 1.11-2.02). The median OS after salvage SRS was estimated to be 11.0 months (95% CI 7.1-12.2) and the median PFS after salvage SRS was 4.4 months (95% CI 3.7-5.0). A Karnofsky Performance Scale score >= 80 was independently associated with longer OS, while small tumor volume (< 15 cm3) and less homogeneous treatment plans (homogeneity index > 1.75) were both independently associated with longer OS (p = 0.007 and 0.03) and PFS (p = 0.01 and 0.002, respectively). Based on these factors, 2 prognostic groups were identified for PFS (5.4 vs 3.2 months), while 3 were identified for OS (median OS of 15.2 vs 10.5 vs 5.2 months). CONCLUSIONS SRS is associated with longer OS and/or PFS in patients with good performance status, small-volume tumor recurrences, and heterogeneous treatment plans. The authors propose a prognostic model to identify a cohort of rGBM patients who may benefit from SRS.Copyright Â©AANS 2019",Excluded
4694,"Management of oropharyngeal cancer: a cross-sectional review of institutional practice at a large Canadian referral centre BACKGROUND: Over the years, the treatment of oropharyngeal cancer has changed; in the past, first-line treatment consisted of surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy, today however, primary treatment typically involves concomitant chemoradiation, and reserves surgery for salvage. While chemoradiation is the modality of choice for primary management of oropharyngeal cancer, disease characteristics, institutional bias, and patient preferences influence treatment choice. This has lead to variation in the treatment of OPC, and has generated some uncertainly regarding the ideal therapeutic approach. The objective of this study was to describe the treatment of OPC a large Canadian referral center, highlighting trends in treatment choice and outcome., METHODS: This is a cross-sectional retrospective review of clinical practice at Sunnybrook Health Science Centre (Toronto, ON). This investigation documents type of first-line treatment, rates of treatment failure, rates of surgical salvage, and 5-year disease-free survival. This study also asses the therapeutic impact of free-flap reconstruction on the use of a postoperative tracheostomy and/or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube., RESULTS: The majority of oropharyngeal cancer patients presented with regionally metastatic disease (stage III-IV) and underwent concomitant chemoradiation as first-line treatment. Just over half of patients who failed chemoradiation were eligible for salvage surgery. Forty-six percent of salvage patients recurred at approximately 6 months, and died approximately 12 months following the first sign of disease recurrence. Five-year survival for salvage patients stage II, III, IVA, and IVB was 100%, 54.5%, 53.8%, and 50%, respectively. The incidence of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tubes and tracheostomies was comparable between patients who underwent free-flap reconstruction and patients who did not., CONCLUSION: The modality of choice for first-line treatment of oropharyngeal cancer is concomitant chemoradiation. The moderate failure rate following chemoradiation and the modest survival rate following salvage surgery could indicate that selected patients may benefit from undergoing surgery as first-line treatment. While this study did not show that functional outcomes were better for free-flap patients, it is highly likely that those who received a free-flap did better then they would have had they not undergone reconstructive surgery. More research regarding the therapeutic effects of free-flaps in OPC survivors is needed.",Excluded
4727,"Design of a motion simulation system to assist respiratory gating for radiation therapy Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) aims to deliver high doses of radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors in less than or equal to 6 fractions. However, organ motion during treatment is a challenging issue for this kind of technique. We develop a control system via Bluetooth technology to simulate and correct body motion during SABR. Method(s): Radiation doses were analyzed, and the radiation damage protection capability was checked by external beam therapy 3 (EBT3) films irradiated by a linear accelerator. A wireless signal test was also performed. A validation was performed with 8 previously treated patient respiratory pattern records and 8 healthy volunteers. Result(s): The homemade simulation system consisted of 2 linear actuators, one movable stage with a maximal moving distance of 6.5 cm x 12.5 cm x 5 cm to simulate the respiratory pattern of 8 patients precisely with a median error of 0.36 mm and a maximal motion difference of 1.17 mm, and 3.17 and chipset transited signals to display them as a waveform. From the test with 8 volunteers, the chip could detect deep respiratory movement up to 3 cm. The effect of the chip on a radiation dose of 400 monitor units (MUs) by 6 MV photons and 200 MUs by 10 MV photons showed high penetration rates of 98.8% and 98.6%, respectively. Conclusion(s): We invented a tubeless and wireless respiratory gating detection chip. The chip has minimal interference with the treatment angles, good noise immunity and the capability to easily penetrate a variety of materials. The simulation system consisting of linear actuators also successfully simulates the respiratory pattern of real patients.Copyright Â© 2021 American Association of Medical Dosimetrists",Excluded
4445,"Functional image-guided stereotactic body radiation therapy planning for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma The aim of the current planning study is to evaluate the ability of gadoxetate disodium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (EOB-MRI)-guided stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) planning by using intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) techniques in sparing the functional liver tissues during SBRT for hepatocellular carcinoma. In this study, 20 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were enrolled. Functional liver tissues were defined according to quantitative liver-spleen contrast ratios >=1.5 on a hepatobiliary phase scan. Functional images were fused with the planning computed tomography (CT) images; the following 2 SBRT plans were designed using a ""step-and-shoot"" static IMRT technique for each patient: (1) an anatomical SBRT plan optimization based on the total liver; and (2) a functional SBRT plan based on the functional liver. The total prescribed dose was 48 gray (Gy) in 4 fractions. Dosimetric parameters, including dose to 95% of the planning target volume (PTV D95%), percentages of total and functional liver volumes, which received doses from 5 to 30Gy (V5 to V30 and fV5 to fV30), and mean doses to total and functional liver (MLD and fMLD, respectively) of the 2 plans were compared. Compared with anatomical plans, functional image-guided SBRT plans reduced MLD (mean: plan A, 5.5Gy; and plan F, 5.1Gy; p<0.0001) and fMLD (mean: plan A, 5.4Gy; and plan F, 4.9Gy; p<0.0001), as well as V5 to V30 and fV5 to fV30. No differences were noted in PTV coverage and nonhepatic organs at risk (OARs) doses. In conclusion, EOB-MRI-guided SBRT planning using the IMRT technique may preserve functional liver tissues in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Copyright Â© 2017 American Association of Medical Dosimetrists",Excluded
4047,"Lower urinary tract function after intra-arterial chemotherapy with concurrent pelvic radiotherapy for invasive bladder cancer BACKGROUND: Intra-arterial chemotherapy with concurrent pelvic radiotherapy as a bladder-sparing regimen for invasive bladder cancer is highly promising for selected patients. However, lower urinary tract function after this treatment has not been fully investigated. METHOD(S): The urodynamic effects of intra-arterial chemotherapy with concurrent pelvic radiotherapy were retrospectively evaluated in 14 patients with organ-confined invasive bladder cancer. The post-treatment urodynamic findings were compared with the pretreatment ones (n = 7), and a comparison was made between the serial urodynamic findings after the treatment in another seven patients who were able to undergo the pretreatment urodynamic study (UDS). RESULT(S): The median follow-up period up to the latest UDS was 34 months. Of the 14 patients, the latest UDS revealed some storage dysfunctions in 11 (79%) and some emptying dysfunctions in three (23%). Uninhibited detrusor contraction and decreased bladder compliance were recorded in 29 and 43% at the pretreatment UDS and approximately 50-60 and 20-60% in the serial follow-up studies, respectively (n = 7). Impaired detrusor contractility lasted in one patient. In the seven patients without the pretreatment UDS, decreased maximum cystometric capacity and decreased compliance were recorded in approximately 50-60 and 20-60% at the serial UDS, respectively. Detrusor contractility was aggravated in one patient and completely lost in one with time. CONCLUSION(S): The urodynamic findings indicate that the bladder-sparing regimen might result in perpetuating the lower urinary tract dysfunctions due to invasive bladder cancer itself and/or transurethral surgery and might injure the infrasacral autonomic nerves and the bladder itself.",Excluded
3790,"Promising survival in patients with high-grade gliomas following therapy with a novel boronated porphyrin Current treatment strategies for high-grade gliomas are inadequate with high rates of disease recurrence and poor overall survival. Photodynamic therapy has been extensively investigated for a variety of tumours including high-grade gliomas. We have previously described a novel boronated porphyrin (BOPP) which has highly selective uptake by tumour cells. A Phase I study documented that BOPP at a dose of 4mg/kg was well tolerated. We report here the survival data arising from this Phase I study. Overall 28 patients (pts) with high-grade gliomas were treated with BOPP photodynamic therapy with a median overall survival (OS) of 14 months (2-48+ months). Sixteen pts had glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) with a median OS of 8 months (2-38+). Of 9 pts with recurrent GBM, the median OS was 11 months (3-38+), with 56% surviving at least 12 months.

4612,"Misdiagnosed male breast cancer with an unknown primary tumor: A case report Compared with female breast cancer, male breast cancer (MBC) has an extremely low morbidity, later staging and fewer breast tissues. The lumps are easier to invade in the center and the majority of the cases are positive for metastatic lymph node, with the typical clinical manifestation as a painless mass in partial breast. MBC with an unknown primary tumor is rare and is often prone to misdiagnosis, resulting in a delay in correct treatment. Such a case is extremely significant for clinical reference. The current study presents a 58-year-old male who developed a painless mass in the left armpit and received armpit mass biopsy and pathological examination which showed glandular cancer, with a high possibility of mammary primary tumor. The patient was administered four cycles of paclitaxel plus oxaliplatin chemotherapy. However, three months later, the patient identified novel disseminated lymph nodes in the left armpit. The initial pathological section and paraffin blocks were re-examined and the patient was finally diagnosed with breast invasive ductal carcinoma based on the metastases pathology and immunohistochemical examination. No breast mass was found on physical examination of the patient and the tumor markers, including cancer antigen 125 and carcinoembryonic antigen, were normal. No primary tumors were observed in the mammography and PET-CT and the primary tumor was not found following the left breast modified radical mastectomy.",Excluded
4381,"A new grading system for ototoxicity in adults Objective: This study aimed to propose an ototoxicity grading system sensitive to the effect of ototoxicity on specific daily life situations like speech intelligibility and the perception of ultra-high sounds and to test its feasibility compared to current criteria. Method(s): Pure tone averages (PTAs) for speech perception (1-2-4 kHz) and ultra-high frequencies (8-10-12.5 kHz) were incorporated. Threshold shift and hearing level posttreatment were taken into account. Criteria were tested on head and neck cancer patients treated with (chemo-)radiotherapy ([C]RT) and compared with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4 (CTCAEv4) and the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association criteria (ASHA). Result(s): Grades 1 and 2 were based on threshold shifts from baseline (in dB) and subjective complaints. Grades 3 and 4 were defined as treatment-induced hearing loss of >= 35 dB at PTA 1-2-4 kHz and >= 70 dB at PTA 1-2-4 kHz, respectively. In high-dose cisplatin CRT incidences by the new criteria, CTCAEv4 and ASHA were comparable (78%-88%). In RT and low-dose cisplatin CRT, incidences were 36% to 39% in the new criteria versus 22% to 53% in CTCAEv4 and ASHA. Conclusion(s): The new criteria show an increased sensitivity to ototoxicity compared to CTCAEv4 and ASHA and provide insight into the effect of hearing loss on certain daily life situations. The new grading system seems feasible for clinic and research purposes.Copyright Â© 2014 The Author(s).",Excluded

Method(s): Fifty-one patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx were included in this prospective study. The patients were treated with 3 courses of cisplatin (100 mg at 1 treatment, intra-arterial) and sodium thiosulfate (28 g at 1 treatment, intravenous) once every 2 weeks during concurrent radiotherapy (66 to 70 Gy, 2 Gy per fraction, daily for 5 days over 7 weeks). Nodal metastases larger than 3 cm in diameter were treated with an additional 50 mg of cisplatin. The patients with less than 50% tumor reduction after 40 Gy and 2 courses of chemotherapy were treated with surgery. Result(s): The protocol was completed for 49 patients. All living patients had a minimum follow-up period of 2 years. Including the 3 patients with salvage surgery, local disease-free control was achieved in 39 patients (80%). For 36 patients (73.5%), disease-free primary organs were preserved at 2 years after treatment. Locoregional disease-free control for 2 years was obtained for 38 patients (77.6%), in 30 of them without salvage surgery. The patients treated with surgery had an overall survival rate similar to that of the patients with a complete response (80% and 84.6%, respectively). The patients with a partial response had a worse prognosis (40%; p = .0069). Conclusion(s): This treatment regimen is feasible and effective for advanced resectable head and neck cancer.

3828,"Reduction of radiation exposure in cryoballoon ablation procedures: a single-centre study applying intracardiac echocardiography and other radioprotective measures Aims: The population treated with cryoballoon (CB) ablation is relatively young, and radiation protection is of major importance. We aimed to demonstrate that radiation exposure can be markedly reduced by intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) and optimized settings of the X-ray system., Methods and results: We analysed 100 patients undergoing CB pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) for treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. In 50 consecutive patients (25 male, 59 +/- 13 years; Group 1), we used ICE, skipped PV angiography prior to CB inflation, and avoided fluoroscopy whenever possible. Furthermore, we reduced the frame rate, minimized distance between patient and detector, and consequently applied collimation. These patients were compared with 50 similar preceding patients in Group 2 (29 male, 61 +/- 12 years). Total fluoroscopy time was reduced from 18 +/- 6 min in Group 2 to 12 +/- 5 min in Group 1 (P < 0.001). Moreover, the dose area product was significantly lower (1555 +/- 1219 vs. 4935 +/- 2094 cGycm2, P < 0.001), total freezing time was significantly shortened (1855 +/- 399 vs. 2121 +/- 756 s, P = 0.031), and contrast media use was significantly reduced (66 +/- 25 vs. 109 +/- 27 mL, P < 0.001). At the same time, total procedure duration and complication rates did not differ significantly between both groups. After a 12 months follow-up, a similar percentage of patients was free from recurrences (74% in Group 1 vs. 78% in Group 2, P = 0.640)., Conclusion: Radiation exposure in CB PVI can be markedly reduced without prolonging procedure times, affecting the outcome or complication rates. Moreover, ICE seems to shorten total freezing time. Copyright Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology. All rights reserved. Â© The Author 2016.

4903,"Inferior colliculus stimulation causes similar efferent effects on ipsilateral and contralateral cochlear potentials in the guinea pig The inferior colliculus (IC) is a processing center in both the ascending and descending auditory pathways. It has been demonstrated anatomically to send descending projections to the region of the medial olivocochlear (MOC) neurons in the auditory brainstem. Activation of MOC system produces reductions in cochlear neural activity. Individual MOC fibers innervate relatively restricted regions of the cochlea. Recent studies have shown that selective electrical stimulation within the IC central nucleus (ICC) produces frequency-specific reductions of neural activity in the contralateral cochlea (Ota, Y., Oliver, D.L., Dolan, D.F., 2004. Frequency-specific effects on cochlear responses during activation of the inferior colliculus in the guinea pig. J. Neurophysiol. 91, 2185-2193). This efferent effect is likely mediated through selective activation of MOC cells. In this study, we investigated the effects of selective stimulation of one ICC on cochlear output in both ears in anesthetized and paralyzed guinea pigs to explore possible differences in the effective efferent innervation of the two ears. ICC stimulation had a similar tonotopically tuned effect on the distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) and the cochlear whole-nerve action potential (CAP) in each cochlea. The bandwidth of the efferent effect in each ear was measured and compared at different stimulation levels. For a given ICC stimulation site, the efferent effects were larger for the CAP response. The effect on each response measure was greater in the contralateral than the ipsilateral ear. The effective bandwidth of the efferent effect on the CAP was current-level-dependent but less so for the DPOAE. The results of transections at various locations within the brainstem suggest that the effects were mediated by the MOC system. From the results presented here, the descending efferent system, which originates in the auditory cortex, has frequency-specific, spatially restricted, bilateral effects. The effects are greater in the contralateral ear.",Excluded
3982,"Dual-layer spectral computed tomography: Virtual non-contrast in comparison to true non-contrast images Purpose: To evaluate virtual-non-contrast (VNC) images obtained from clinical triphasic scans with a dual-layer spectral computed tomography system regarding accuracy of iodine subtraction. Material(s) and Method(s): From September to December 2016, 62 consecutive patients who underwent a clinical routine triphasic CT examination were included into this retrospective study. VNC images based on the arterial and portal venous phase were generated. For every patient and every contrast phase, a region-of-interest (ROI) was defined in aorta, liver, renal cortex, spongious bone, fat, muscle and fluid (i.e. gallbladder, urinary bladder), resulting in 2170 ROIs. VNC images were compared to true-non-contrast (TNC) images regarding difference in attenuation. Consistency between VNC images obtained from the arterial and portal venous phase as well as the influence of the initial attenuation on respective VNC images were evaluated. Result(s): Comparison of HU in VNC and TNC images showed a high accuracy of iodine elimination. Mean difference between TNC and VNC images was only 0.5 +/- 8.5 HU and >90% of all comparisons showed a difference of less than 15 HU. For all tissues but spongious bone, mean absolute difference between TNC and VNC images was below 10 HU. VNC images derived from the arterial and the portal venous phase showed excellent correlation. The quality of iodine removal in VNC images was not influenced by the original contrast enhancement. However, VNC images cannot be used for evaluation of iodine removal in bone as bone and iodine can hardly be differentiated via spectral CT. Conclusion(s): VNC imaging in DL-CT is a promising tool for daily clinical routine. As non-enhanced CT images are essential in multiple clinical situations, the permanent availability of VNC images with dual-layer spectral CT will result in a substantial reduction of radiation exposure and an increased diagnostic value of monophasic contrast-enhanced CT scans.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
3823,"Ewing's sarcoma and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor cells produce large quantities of bioactive tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) after radiation exposure PURPOSE: In the present study, we examined human Ewing's sarcoma (ES) and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (pPNET) cell lines that are able to produce TNF-alpha as part of the response to irradiation. Radiation-induced tumor cell production of TNF-alpha may enhance irradiation efficacy and improve the effect of local tumor irradiation. On the other hand, radiation-induced tumor cell production of TNF-alpha may adversely affect the normal tissue., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twelve different ES/pPNET cell lines were investigated in vitro and (after establishment as tumor xenografts in athymic nude mice) in vivo for their TNF-alpha mRNA expression (real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) and TNF-alpha protein production (in vitro: enhanced amplified sensitivity immunoassay; in vivo: immunohistochemistry) after exposure to different irradiation doses (2, 5, 10, 20, 30, or 40 Gy) and after different time intervals (1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, or 72 h after irradiation). The bioactivity of the TNF-alpha protein was evaluated in chromogenic cytotoxicity and neutralization assays., RESULTS: Nine out of 12 ES/pPNET cell lines express constitutively significant quantities of bioactive TNF-alpha in vitro. ES/pPNET cells originating from primary tumors secreted higher TNF-alpha levels than cells derived from metastatic lesions. In 5 of the 9 TNF-alpha-producing cell lines, TNF-alpha mRNA and protein levels were upregulated after irradiation exposure in a time- and dose-dependent manner. After establishment of the ES/pPNET cell lines in athymic nude mice, the radiation-induced TNF-alpha release could be demonstrated also in the xenograft tumors in vivo (analogous to the in vitro experiments). Using the same methods for quantitative analysis, it was determined that the TNF-alpha expression of the radiation-responsive tumor cells was up to 2000-fold higher compared to the maximal radiation-induced TNF-alpha release in normal lung tissue measured during the pneumonic phase., CONCLUSION: Certain ES/pPNET cell lines produce extremely large quantities of bioactive TNF-alpha after radiation exposure in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Radiation-induced TNF-alpha production of tumor cells may be of paramount importance in respect to not only tumor behavior, but also to potential damage to normal tissue and the clinical status of the host.",Included
4450,"Late temporal lobe necrosis in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma: evaluation with combined multi-section diffusion weighted and perfusion weighted MR imaging Late temporal lobe necrosis is a well-known and serious complication in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) following radiotherapy. Owing to the close proximity to the skull base, the medial temporal lobes are inevitably included in the target volume of irradiation. Patients with NPC provide a unique opportunity in study of delay radiation effect in normal human brain. The objective of this study was to evaluate late temporal lobe radiation injury by combined multi-section diffusion weighted and perfusion weighted MR imaging. We prospectively studied 16 patients with typical clinical symptoms of late temporal lobe necrosis or other abnormalities in the temporal lobes incidentally detected by conventional MR imaging. All patients had a previous history of radiotherapy for histologically proven NPC. Conventional T1- and T2-weighted images, fast gradient echo with echo-planar diffusion-weighted and perfusion-weighted MR imaging were performed. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) map were computed via commercially available software. MR diffusion and perfusion images were then analyzed and graded by two independent observers with focusing on the diffusion and perfusion mismatch. The temporal lobe lesions displayed marked high diffusion on the ADC map. The rCBV map also revealed marked hypoperfusion in these temporal lobe lesions in all patients. The areas of abnormality on the rCBV map were significantly larger than the lesions on the ADC map in 14 patients (observer 1) and 13 patients (observer 2). Since late temporal lobe necrosis is probably caused by damage of the endothelium of vessels and ischemia, perfusion and diffusion mismatch might imply injured tissue but potentially salvageable brain tissue. A mismatch may be potentially used to predict the response to treatment in-patients with late temporal lobe necrosis.",Excluded
4672,"Effects of Q-switched Nd:YAG laser irradiation on neural impulse propagation: I. Spinal cord We studied the effect of irradiation with Q-switched Nd:YAG laser light (1064 nm) on spinal cord dorsal column and dorsolateral white matter in anesthetized rats. To evoke a synchronous sensory input, the sciatic nerve was stimulated electrically and the resulting evoked spinal cord potential (SCP) recorded from the dorsal columns of the ipsilateral side. The waveshape of the SCP showed three components: an early positive peak (P1), representing the responses of the most rapidly conducting fibers, followed by two negative peaks (N1 and N2), which are mainly due to synaptic effects of the volley on dorsal horn cells located in dorsal grey matter. Laser irradiation at 50 mJ/pulse and above resulted in severe reduction in the amplitudes of N1 and N2. In contrast, there was either no reduction at all or only a slight decrease in the amplitude of P1. The selective loss of the synaptic field might be mediated by impairment of synaptic transmission or by loss of high threshold fiber input to dorsal horn neurones. In either event it is likely that the mechanism of the differential effects of laser irradiation on the components of the electrically evoked SCP is at least in part photothermally mediated, since intracord temperatures during laser application greatly exceeded the physiological range.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): Patients with non-metastatic cutaneous angiosarcoma diagnosed from 1998 to 2018 at two institutions were identified. In the CRT cohort, paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 weekly was given for up to 12 weeks and patients received radiotherapy (RT) during the final 6 weeks of chemotherapy. The RT dose was 50-50.4 Gy delivered in 1.8-2 Gy per fraction with an optional post-operative boost of 10-16 Gy. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank statistics were used to compare the outcomes between the two groups. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result(s): Fifty-seven patients were included: 22 CRT and 35 Non-CRT. The CRT cohort had more patients > 60 years (100% vs. 60%, p < 0.001) and tumors >5 cm (68.2% vs 54.3%, p = 0.023). The median follow-up was 25.8 (1.5-155.2) months. There was no significant difference in 2-year local control (LC), distant control (DC), or progression-free survival (PFS) between the two groups. The 2-year overall survival (OS) was significantly higher for the CRT cohort (94.1% vs. 71.6%, p = 0.033).

The incidence of brain tumors varies and it is higher in developed countries of Western Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand. In Serbia, according to data from 2009, malignant brain tumors account for 2.2 of all tumors, and from all cancer-related deaths, 3.2% is caused by malignant brain tumors. According to recent statistical reports, an overall incidence of brain tumors for benign and malignant tumors combined is 18.71 per 100,000 persons/year. The most common benign brain tumor in adults is meningioma, which is most present in women, and the most common malignant tumor is glioblastoma, which is most present in adult men. Due to high mortality, especially in patients diagnosed with glioblastoma and significant brain tumor morbidity, there is a constant interest in understanding its etiology in order to possibly prevent tumor occurrence in future and enable more efficient treatment strategies for this fatal brain disease. Despite the continuously growing number of epidemiological studies on possible factors of tumor incidence, the etiology remains unclear. The only established environmental risk factor of gliomas is ionizing radiation exposure. Exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields via cell phone use has gained a lot of attention as a potential risk factor of brain tumor development. However, studies have been inconsistent and inconclusive, so more definite results are still expected.",Excluded
4010,"Dose-response relationships for radiation-induced hyperparathyroidism It has been hard to establish with certainty that radiation exposure is a risk factor for developing hyperparathyroidism. In part this is because many cases of hyperparathyroidism remain asymptomatic and escape clinical detection. We present results from a study of 2555 subjects who received external beam radiotherapy to the head and neck area for benign conditions before their 16th birthday between 1939 and 1962. The average length of follow-up was 36.6 yr. There were 36 confirmed cases of hyperparathyroidism. Based on a relative risk model, the excess relative risk increased significantly by 0.11/centigray; however, the confidence interval was wide (95% confidence interval, 0.0-17.2). The hyperparathyroidism rates and dose-response relationships were not affected by gender or age at first radiation treatment. The demonstration of a dose-response relationship within an irradiated cohort supports an association between radiation exposure and hyperparathyroidism and suggests that the calcium levels of individuals irradiated to the head and neck area should be monitored.",Excluded
4924,"A useful intraoperative technique for transiliac-transsacral screws: a point-to-point coaxial guide apparatus BACKGROUND: The transiliac-transsacral screw placement is a clinical challenge for surgeons. This study explored a point-to-point coaxial guide apparatus assisting the transiliac-transsacral screw insertion and aimed to investigate the feasibility and accuracy of the guide apparatus in the treatment of posterior ring unstable pelvic fracture compared with a free-hand technique. METHOD(S): A retrospective study was performed to evaluate patients treated with transiliac-transsacral screws assisted by the point-to-point coaxial guide apparatus or free-hand technique. The intraoperative data of operative time and radiation exposure times were recorded. Postoperative radiographs and CT scans were performed to scrutinize the accuracy of screws position. The quality of the postoperative fracture reduction was assessed according to Matta radiology criteria. The pelvic function was assessed according to the Majeed scoring criteria at 6 months postoperatively. RESULT(S): From July 2017 to December 2019, a total of 38 patients were included in this study, 20 from the point-to-point guide apparatus group and 18 from the free-hand group. There were no significant differences between the two groups in gender, age, injury causes, pelvic fracture type, screws level, and follow-up time (P > 0.05). The average operative time of the guide apparatus group for each screw was significantly less than that in the free-hand group (25.8 +/- 4.7 min vs 40.5 +/- 5.1, P < 0.001). The radiation exposure times were significantly lower in the guide apparatus group than that in the free-hand group (24.4 +/- 6.0 vs 51.6 +/- 8.4, P < 0.001). The intraosseous and juxtacortical rate of screw placement (100%) higher than in the free-hand group (94.4%). CONCLUSION(S): The point-to-point coaxial guide apparatus is feasible for assisting the transiliac-transsacral screw in the treatment of posterior unstable pelvic fractures. It has the advantages of simple operation, reasonable design and no need for expensive equipment, and provides an additional surgical strategy for the insertion of the transiliac-transsacral screw.",Excluded
4650,"The application value of multi-material artifact reduction technique in maxillofacial CT images of patients with metallic dental implants Objective: To investigate the effect of multi-material artifact reduction (MMAR) technique on the maxillofacial CT images of patients with metallic dental implants. Method(s): The data of 30 patients with metal denture implants who underwent maxillofacial wide-detector CT scans in the Department of Radiology of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from March 2019 to February 2020 were retrospectively collected. The images of the lesion sites of patients were all affected by the metal implants artifacts. The 120 kV-like, virtual monoenergetic images (VMI) (70, 90, 110 keV), VMI (70, 90, 110 keV)+MMAR images were reconstructed at venous phase by energy spectrum scanning. A total of 7 image sequences were obtained for each patient. The CT value and noise value of the lesion and the longus capitis muscle on the same plane were measured, and the artifact index (AI) of lesion was calculated.Friedman test and Wilcoxon test were used to evaluate image quality objectively and subjectively. Result(s): There were significant differences in SD and AI among the 7 groups (chi2=133.800,P<0.001;chi2=92.147,P<0.001). The SD[10 (8, 12)] and AI [6 (5, 9)]of VMI 110 keV+M images were the lowest, but there were no significant differences in AI between VMI 110 keV+M and VMI 90 keV+M image (P= 0.271). The SD and AI of VMI+M group were lower than those in VMI group (all P<0.05). There was significant difference in image score among the 7 groups (chi 2 = 151.199, P<0.001). The image scores of VMI (70, 90, 110 keV)+M group were higher than those of VMI group (Z=-4.583, P = 0.000; Z=-3.742, P = 0.000; Z =-2.449, P = 0.014). The subjective score of VMI 90 keV+M [4 (3, 4)] was the highest, higher than those of other 6 groups (all P<0.05), in 26 out of 30 cases, lesions displayed clear contrast, and the artifacts eliminated completely. Conclusion(s): The MMAR technique of wide-detector CT might effectively remove the metallic dental implants artifacts and improve the image quality. VMI 90 keV+MMAR images could achieve the best artifact removal effect and good tissue contrast.Copyright Â© 2021 Chinese Medical Association",Excluded

4921,"Late-onset radiation-induced optic neuropathy after radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma Radiation-induced optic neuropathy (RION) is a rare but devastating late complication of radiotherapy, usually manifesting months to years after cancer treatment of the head and neck, resulting in rapidly progressive blindness in one or both eyes. The incidence of radiation-induced complications following radiotherapy, especially RION, is correlated with survival time of patients. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), the most common type of cancer in southern China, has been primarily treated with radiotherapy, with associated neural injuries. To our knowledge, there are few reports of RION among patients with NPC who have undergone radiotherapy. To study this further, we reviewed nine patients with NPC and RION after radiotherapy and examined the clinical manifestations of RION, characteristics of the ophthalmologic examination, MRI results and the treatments used. Of the nine patients with RION, the most frequent clinical presentation was a decline of vision with visual field defects in one or both eyes. Ophthalmologic examinations showed flame hemorrhages in the retina, optic nerve atrophy and cotton wool spots. T1-weighted enhanced MRI showed enhancement of the optic nerve and optic chiasm in six patients. Treatment with corticosteroids, anticoagulation and hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment did not reduce visual loss or blindness in patients. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

4654,"Developing a cancer-specific trigger tool to identify treatment-related adverse events using administrative data BACKGROUND: As there are few validated tools to identify treatment-related adverse events across cancer care settings, we sought to develop oncology-specific ""triggers"" to flag potential adverse events among cancer patients using claims data., METHODS: 322 887 adult patients undergoing an initial course of cancer-directed therapy for breast, colorectal, lung, or prostate cancer from 2008 to 2014 were drawn from a large commercial claims database. We defined 16 oncology-specific triggers using diagnosis and procedure codes. To distinguish treatment-related complications from comorbidities, we required a logical and temporal relationship between a treatment and the associated trigger. We tabulated the prevalence of triggers by cancer type and metastatic status during 1-year of follow-up, and examined cancer trigger risk factors., RESULTS: Cancer-specific trigger events affected 19% of patients over the initial treatment year. The trigger burden varied by disease and metastatic status, from 6% of patients with nonmetastatic prostate cancer to 41% and 50% of those with metastatic colorectal and lung cancers, respectively. The most prevalent triggers were abnormal serum bicarbonate, blood transfusion, non-contrast chest CT scan following radiation therapy, and hypoxemia. Among patients with metastatic disease, 10% had one trigger event and 29% had two or more. Triggers were more common among older patients, women, non-whites, patients with low family incomes, and those without a college education., CONCLUSIONS: Oncology-specific triggers offer a promising method for identifying potential patient safety events among patients across cancer care settings.

4923,"Less efficient g2-m checkpoint is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer in African Americans Cell cycle checkpoints play critical roles in the maintenance of genomic integrity. The inactivation of checkpoint genes by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms is frequent in all cancer types, as a less-efficient cell cycle control can lead to genetic instability and tumorigenesis. In an on-going case-control study consisting of 216 patients with non-small cell lung cancer, 226 population-based controls, and 114 hospital-based controls, we investigated the relationship of gamma-radiation-induced G2-M arrest and lung cancer risk. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were cultured for 90 hours, exposed to 1.0 Gy gamma-radiation, and harvested at 3 hours after gamma-radiation treatment. gamma-Radiation-induced G2-M arrest was measured as the percentage of mitotic cells in untreated cultures minus the percentage of mitotic cells in gamma-radiation-treated cultures from the same subject. The mean percentage of gamma-radiation-induced G2-M arrest was significantly lower in cases than in population controls (1.18 versus 1.44, P < 0.01) and hospital controls (1.18 versus 1.40, P = 0.01). When dichotomized at the 50th percentile value in combined controls (population and hospital controls), a lower level of gamma-radiation-induced G2-M arrest was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer among African Americans after adjusting for baseline mitotic index, age, gender, and pack-years of smoking [adjusted odd ratio (OR), 2.25; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.97-5.20]. A significant trend of an increased risk of lung cancer with a decreased level of G2-M arrest was observed (P(trend) = 0.02) among African Americans, with a lowest-versus-highest quartile adjusted OR of 3.74 (95% CI, 0.98-14.3). This trend was most apparent among African American females (P(trend) < 0.01), with a lowest-versus-highest quartile adjusted OR of 11.75 (95% CI, 1.47-94.04). The results suggest that a less-efficient DNA damage-induced G2-M checkpoint is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer among African Americans. Interestingly, we observed a stronger association of DNA damage-induced G2-M arrest and lung cancer among African Americans when compared with Caucasians. If replicated, these results may provide clues to the exceedingly high lung cancer incidence experienced by African Americans.",Included
3811,"Incidental gonadal radiation exposure in the prophylactic treatment of heterotopic ossification Purpose/Objective(s): Radiation therapy is commonly used for heterotopic ossification (HO) prophylaxis after the orthopedic repair of fractures involving the hip and femur. Given the young age of many of these patients presenting for treatment and the proximity of the reproductive organs to tissue requiring radiation therapy, incidental radiation exposure to the gonads must be considered for potential fertility issues. The purpose of this study was to report dosimetric gonadal exposure among a large cohort of patients who underwent 3-dimensional simulation and radiation therapy for HO prophylaxis. Materials/Methods: A total of 45 patients (38 males; 7 females) were identified that underwent volumetric CT-planned radiation therapy for HO prophylaxis using a single fraction dose of 700 cGy. The median age was 22 years (range, 12 - 55 years). Treatment plans were generated with the Pinnacle3 treatment planning system (Philips Radiation Oncology Systems, Milpitas, CA) with heterogeneity corrections accounted for via convolution/superposition dose calculation algorithm. Treatments were delivered post-operatively within 48 hours using opposed AP/PA fields that generally included the surgical prosthesis as well as the femoral head, ischial ramus, and greater/lesser trochanters. Three male patients received bilateral radiation for fractures involving both hips. The simulation CT scans were retrieved from archives, and the testicles and ovaries were delineated as paired structures on 3 millimeter axial sections so that dose-volume characteristics could be determined. Result(s): The proportion of male patients receiving ipsilateral testicular doses (maximum) greater than 15 cGy, 50 cGy, and 100 cGy was 63%, 24%, and 21%, respectively. Another 20% of male patients had both testicles exposed to maximum doses greater than 15 cGy, the number commonly cited to cause sperm abnormalities. The 3 men undergoing bilateral radiation received an average maximal testicular dose of 422 cGy (range, 187 - 686 cGy). Among female patients, 86% received maximal ipsilateral ovarian doses over 15 cGy. One of the seven women received a dose exceeding 15 cGy to both ovaries (778 cGy and 31.5 cGy). Conclusion(s): Gonadal doses exceeding historically recommended tolerances can result in patients undergoing radiation for HO prophylaxis. Scrotal shields, informing patients about possible fertility issues, and the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as an alternative to radiation therapy should be considered as appropriate in the management of this benign condition.",Excluded
4202,"Cetuximab plus chemoradiotherapy for HIV-associated anal carcinoma: A phase II AIDS malignancy consortium trial Purpose Squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal (SCCAC) is characterized by high locoregional failure (LRF) rates after definitive chemoradiation (CRT), associated with anogenital human papilloma virus, and often appears in HIV infection. Because cetuximab enhances the effect of radiation therapy in human papilloma virus-associated oropharyngeal SCC, we hypothesized that adding cetuximab to CRT would reduce LRF in SCCAC. Methods Forty-five patients with stage I to III SCCAC and HIV infection received CRT: 45 to 54 Gy radiation therapy to the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes plus eight once-weekly doses of concurrent cetuximab and two cycles of cisplatin and fluorouracil. The study was designed to detect at least a 50% reduction in 3-year LRF rate (one-sided a, 0.10; power, 90%), assuming a 35% LRF rate from historical data. Results The 3-year LRF rate was 42% (95% CI, 28% to 56%; one-sided P = .9) by binomial proportional estimate using the prespecified end point (LRF or alive without LRF and followed , 3 years), and 20% (95% CI, 10% to 37%) by Kaplan-Meier estimate in post hoc analysis using definitions and methods consistent with historical data. Three-year rates by Kaplan-Meier estimate were 72% (95% CI, 56% to 84%) for progression-free survival and 79% (95% CI, 63% to 89%) for overall survival. Grade 4 toxicity occurred in 26%, and 4% had treatment-associated deaths. Conclusion HIV-associated SCCAC is potentially curable with definitive CRT. Although addition of cetuximab may result in less LRF, the 20% recurrence and 26% grade 4 toxicity rates indicate the continued need for more-effective and less-toxic therapies.Copyright Â© 2016 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",Excluded
4766,"A Rare Case of Odontoameloblastoma in a Geriatric Patient Odontoameloblastoma is an extremely rare tumor derived from odontogenic epithelium and mesenchyme.

Here we report a case of a 73-year-old woman who presented to the dentist for routine cleaning and x-rays, which displayed a mandibular lesion. After referral to multiple providers, a biopsy of two involved teeth was obtained and computed tomography of the neck was performed, revealing a large, destructive lesion of the mandible. Histology was consistent with odontoameloblastoma. The patient underwent wide segmental mandibular resection and scapula tip free flap reconstruction. She recovered uneventfully and continues to have close follow-up, given the risk of recurrence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of odontoameloblastoma in a patient over age 50.

4205,"Comparison of 3D confromal radiotherapy and intensity modulated radiotherapy with or without simultaneous integrated boost during concurrent chemoradiation for locally advanced head and neck cancers Objective: Radiotherapy techniques have evolved from 3D conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) to intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) where boost fields are delivered either sequentially (IMRTseq) or with a simultaneous integrated boost (IMRT+SIB). Our goal was to compare the outcomes of patients treated with IMRT+SIB to traditional standards. Method(s): We analyzed the efficacy and toxicity of patients treated with concurrent chemoradiation using 3D-CRT, IMRTseq or IMRT+SIB. Between 1993 and 2012, 379 patients with non-metastatic Stage III-IV head and neck squamous cell cancer were treated with concurrent chemoradiation using 3D-CRT (n = 125), IMRTseq (n = 120) and IMRT+SIB (n = 134). Result(s): Patients treated with any technique had similar rates of 2y local control, 2y regional control, 2y progression free survival and 2y overall survival. Patients treated with IMRT +SIB had lower rates acute toxicity according to Grade 3 or greater mucositis (3D-CRT: 44.0% vs. IMRTseq: 36.7% vs. IMRT+SIB: 22.4%; P<.0001), dermatitis (3D-CRT: 44.0% vs. IMRTseq: 20.0% vs. IMRT+SIB: 7.5%; P<.0001) and feeding tube placement during radiotherapy (3D-CRT: 80.0% vs. IMRTseq: 50.8% vs. IMRT+SIB: 44.0%; P<.0001) as well as late toxicity as measured by feeding tube use (P<.0001) and tracheostomy use (P<.0001). On multivariate analysis, IMRT+SIB predicted for less mucositis, dermatitis and feeding tube use compared to 3D-CRT and for less dermatitis compared to IMRTseq. Conclusion(s): Compared to 3D-CRT and IMRTseq, IMRT+SIB provided similar outcomes and potentially less toxicity indicating it is a feasible technique for chemoradiation in locally advanced head and neck cancer.

Methods We retrospectively analyzed 99mTc-MIP-1404 SPECT/CT scans from 28 patients with metastatic prostate cancer examined before initiation and after completion of therapy. Eight of these patients had been treated with androgen deprivation therapy, 10 with docetaxel, and another 10 with external beam radiotherapy. On the CT images from SPECT/CT, treatment response was assessed according to RECIST 1.1 criteria; independently from that analysis, maximal standardized uptake values (SUVmax) were quantified in representative tumor lesions and treatment response assumed at differences in SUVmax greater than 30%. Radiographic response assessment was correlated to biochemical response (BR) based on prostate-specific antigen serum levels. Results The concordance rate between SPECT and BR was 75% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55-0.89) (Cohen kappa = 0.57; 95% CI, 0.29-0.85; P <= 0.01), higher than for that between SPECT and CT with 57% (95% CI, 0.37-0.76) (kappa = 0.40; 95% CI, 0.14-0.65; P <= 0.01), as well as that between CT and BR with 50% (95% CI, 0.31-0.69) (kappa = 0.31; 95% CI, 0.06-0.57, P <= 0.05). Discordant findings between SPECT and CT were most likely due to limitations of CT in assessing metastases in lymph nodes, as well as bone involvement, which was sometimes not detectable on CT scans. Conclusions The high agreement between treatment response, as assessed by 99mTc-MIP-1404 SPECT/CT and BR, suggests a possible role of that imaging tool for monitoring treatment in metastatic prostate cancer. Larger, ideally prospective trials are needed to help to reveal the full potential of SPECT imaging of PSMA expression in that regard.Copyright Â© 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",Excluded
4126,"A novel strategy of radiofrequency hyperthermia (neothermia) in combination with preoperative chemoradiotherapy for the treatment of advanced rectal cancer: A pilot study The safety of weekly regional hyperthermia performed with 8 MHz radiofrequency (RF) capacitive heating equipment has been established in rectal cancer. We aimed to standardize hyperthermia treatment for scientific evaluation and for assessing local tumor response to RF hyperthermia in rectal cancer. Forty-nine patients diagnosed with rectal adenocarcinoma were included in the study. All patients received chemoradiation with intensity-modulated radiation therapy 5 days/week (dose, 50 Gy/25 times) concomitant with 5 days/week for five times of capecitabine (1700 mg/m2 per day) and once a week for five times of 50 min irradiations by an 8 MHz RF capacitive heating device. Thirty-three patients underwent surgery 8 weeks after treatment. Three patients did not undergo surgery because of progressive disease (PD) and 13 refused. Eight (16.3%) patients had a pathological complete response (ypCR) after surgery. Among patients without surgery, 3 (6.1%) had clinical complete response (CR) and 3 (6.1%) had local CR but distant PD (CRPD). Ninety percent of ypCR + CR patients were shown in 6.21 W min-1 m-2/treatment or higher group of average total accumulated irradiation output with 429degreeC min-1 m-2 or higher group of total accumulated thermal output. However, a patient with CRPD was in the higher total accumulated thermal output group. We propose a new quantitative parameter for the hyperthermia and demonstrated that patients can benefit from mild irradiation with mild temperature. Using these parameters, the exact output, optimal thermal treatment, and contraindications or indications of this modality could be determined in a multi-institutional, future study.Copyright Â© 2015 The Authors.",Excluded
4880,"Knee medial and lateral contact forces in a musculoskeletal model with subject-specific contact point trajectories Contact point (CP) trajectory is a crucial parameter in estimating medial/lateral tibio-femoral contact forces from the musculoskeletal (MSK) models. The objective of the present study was to develop a method to incorporate the subject-specific CP trajectories into the MSK model. Ten healthy subjects performed 45 s treadmill gait trials. The subject-specific CP trajectories were constructed on the tibia and femur as a function of extension-flexion using low-dose bi-plane X-ray images during a quasi-static squat. At each extension-flexion position, the tibia and femur CPs were superimposed in the three directions on the medial side, and in the anterior-posterior and proximal-distal directions on the lateral side to form the five kinematic constraints of the knee joint. The Lagrange multipliers associated to these constraints directly yielded the medial/lateral contact forces. The results from the personalized CP trajectory model were compared against the linear CP trajectory and sphere-on-plane CP trajectory models which were adapted from the commonly used MSK models. Changing the CP trajectory had a remarkable impact on the knee kinematics and changed the medial and lateral contact forces by 1.03 BW and 0.65 BW respectively, in certain subjects. The direction and magnitude of the medial/lateral contact force were highly variable among the subjects and the medial-lateral shift of the CPs alone could not determine the increase/decrease pattern of the contact forces. The suggested kinematic constraints are adaptable to the CP trajectories derived from a variety of joint models and those experimentally measured from the 3D imaging techniques.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
4647,"Randomized controlled trial of dietary fiber for the prevention of radiation-induced gastrointestinal toxicity during pelvic radiotherapy Background: Therapeutic radiotherapy is an important treatment of pelvic cancers. Historically, low-fiber diets have been recommended despite a lack of evidence and potentially beneficial mechanisms of fiber. Objective(s): This randomized controlled trial compared low-, habitual-, and high-fiber diets for the prevention of gastrointestinal toxicity in patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy. Design(s): Patients were randomly assigned to low-fiber [<=10 g nonstarch polysaccharide (NSP)/d], habitual-fiber (control), or high-fiber (>=18 g NSP/d) diets and received individualized counseling at the start of radiotherapy to achieve these targets. The primary endpoint was the difference between groups in the change in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire- Bowel Subset (IBDQ-B) score between the starting and nadir (worst) score during treatment. Other measures included macronutrient intake, stool diaries, and fecal short-chain fatty acid concentrations. Result(s): Patients were randomly assigned to low-fiber (n = 55), habitual-fiber (n = 55), or high-fiber (n = 56) dietary advice. Fiber intakes were significantly different between groups (P < 0.001). The difference between groups in the change in IBDQ-B scores between the start and nadir was not significant (P = 0.093). However, the change in score between the start and end of radiotherapy was smaller in the high-fiber group (mean +/- SD: -3.7 +/- 12.8) than in the habitual-fiber group (-10.8 +/- 13.5; P = 0.011). At 1-y postradiotherapy (n = 126) the difference in IBDQ-B scores between the high-fiber (+0.1 +/- 14.5) and the habitualfiber (-8.4 +/- 13.3) groups was significant (P = 0.004). No significant differences were observed in stool frequency or form or in short-chain fatty acid concentrations. Significant reductions in energy, protein, and fat intake occurred in the low- and habitualfiber groups only. Conclusion(s): Dietary advice to follow a high-fiber diet during pelvic radiotherapy resulted in reduced gastrointestinal toxicity both acutely and at 1 y compared with habitual-fiber intake. Restrictive, non-evidence-based advice to reduce fiber intake in this setting should be abandoned.Copyright Â© 2017 American Society for Nutrition.",Excluded

4091,"Fast-neutron irradiation of glioblastoma multiforme. Neuropathological analysis Various modes of therapy, alone or in combination, have had little effect in improving the survival of patients with glioblastoma multiforme.

Following treatment, the patients became steroid-dependent and pursued a gradual downhill course with increasing obtundation. Although there was no improvement in the length or quality of survival of these patients, neuropathological studies in the 13 patients who came to autopsy showed the following: 1) extensive coagulative necrosis of much of the tumor mass; 2) dense infiltration by collagenous connective tissue; 3) minimal phagocytic reaction; 4) marked reduction in the amount of viable tumor; 5) abnormal astrocytic proliferation, which may represent either astrocytoma or a radiation-induced bizarre gliosis, and 6) areas of gliosis and white matter degeneration in the brain stem, remote form the tumor site.

4416,"Stress echocardiography in women The diagnosis of coronary heart disease in women has been thought to be more difficult than in men, owing to the overall lower prevalence and severity of disease in women, as well as more subtle clinical presentations. Exercise electrocardiography is associated with a high rate of false-positive results. In contrast, exercise and pharmacologic stress echocardiography have been shown to have high sensitivity, specificity, and prognostic value in women, comparable to that obtained in a male population. Although exercise thallium provides high diagnostic accuracy, due to its cost, availability, and radiation exposure, it may not be the ideal initial test in women. Thus, compared with other modalities, the advantages of stress echocardiography include its lower cost, availability, and high diagnostic accuracy. In the evaluation of women with chest pain, the initial step should involve clinical stratification into low, moderate, or high-probability groups based on symptoms, age, and cardiovascular risk factors. In women with atypical chest pain and a low probability of coronary heart disease, further testing should be avoided because any positive result is likely to be falsely positive. In those women with a moderate likelihood of disease, the most efficient and cost-effective strategy includes stress echocardiography as the initial test. This approach avoids the high rate of false-positive results with subsequent unnecessary angiography generated by exercise electrocardiography, as well as minimizing false-negative results, which would lead to delays and potential increase in morbidity and mortality from untreated coronary heart disease. The optimal strategy for women at high clinical risk may be either exercise echocardiography or cardiac catheterization as the initial test. Although the diagnosis of CAD in women is different than in men, it is not necessarily more difficult. Astute clinical evaluation, in conjunction with judicious use of diagnostic testing, yields excellent results.",Excluded

4426,"Preclinical and first-in-man studies of [11C]CB184 for imaging the 18-kDa translocator protein by positron emission tomography Objective: We performed preclinical and first-in-man clinical positron emission tomography (PET) studies in human brain using N,N-di-n-propyl-2-[2-(4-[11C]methoxyphenyl)-6,8-dichloroimidazol[1,2-a]pyridine-3-yl]acetamide ([11C]CB184) to image the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO), which is overexpressed in activated microglia in neuroinflammatory conditions. Method(s): In vitro selectivity of CB184 was characterized. The radiation absorbed dose by [11C]CB184 in humans was calculated from murine distribution data. Acute toxicity of CB184 hydrochloride in rats at a dose of 5.81 mg/kg body weight, which is >10,000-fold higher than the clinical equivalent dose of [11C]CB184, was evaluated. Acute toxicity of [11C]CB184 injection of a 400-fold dose to administer a postulated dose of 740 MBq [11C]CB184 was also evaluated after the decay-out of 11C. The mutagenicity of CB184 was studied with a reverse mutation test (Ames test). The pharmacological effect of CB184 injection in mice was studied with an open field test. The first PET imaging of TSPO with [11C]CB184 in a normal human volunteer was performed. Result(s): A suitable preparation method for [11C]CB184 injection was established. CB184 showed low activity in a 28-standard receptor binding profile. The radiation absorbed dose by [11C]CB184 in humans was sufficiently low for clinical use, and no acute toxicity of CB184 or [11C]CB184 injection was found. No mutagenicity or apparent effect on locomotor activity or anxiety status was observed for CB184. We safely performed brain imaging with PET following administration of [11C]CB184 in a normal human volunteer. A 90-min dynamic scan showed rapid initial uptake of radioactivity in the brain followed by prompt clearance. [11C]CB184 was homogeneously distributed in the gray matter. The total distribution volume of [11C]CB184 was highest in the thalamus followed by the cerebellar cortex and elsewhere. Although regional differences were small, the observed [11C]CB184 binding pattern was consistent with the TSPO distribution in normal human brain. Peripherally, [11C]CB184 was metabolized in humans: 30 % of the radioactivity in plasma was detected as the unchanged form after 60 min. Conclusion(s): [11C]CB184 is suitable for imaging TSPO in human brain and provides an acceptable radiation dose. Pharmacological safety was noted at the dose required for PET imaging.Copyright Â© 2016, The Japanese Society of Nuclear Medicine.",Excluded
4532,"Long term radiological features of radiation-induced lung damage Purpose: To describe the radiological findings of radiation-induced lung damage (RILD) present on CT imaging of lung cancer patients 12 months after radical chemoradiation. Material(s) and Method(s): Baseline and 12-month CT scans of 33 patients were reviewed from a phase I/II clinical trial of isotoxic chemoradiation (IDEAL CRT). CT findings were scored in three categories derived from eleven sub-categories: (1) parenchymal change, defined as the presence of consolidation, ground-glass opacities (GGOs), traction bronchiectasis and/or reticulation; (2) lung volume reduction, identified through reduction in lung height and/or distortions in fissures, diaphragm, anterior junction line and major airways anatomy, and (3) pleural changes, either thickening and/or effusion. Result(s): Six patients were excluded from the analysis due to anatomical changes caused by partial lung collapse and abscess. All remaining 27 patients had radiological evidence of lung damage. The three categories, parenchymal change, shrinkage and pleural change were present in 100%, 96% and 82% respectively. All patients had at least two categories of change present and 72% all three. GGOs, reticulation and traction bronchiectasis were present in 44%, 52% and 37% of patients. Conclusion(s): Parenchymal change, lung shrinkage and pleural change are present in a high proportion of patients and are frequently identified in RILD. GGOs, reticulation and traction bronchiectasis are common at 12 months but not diagnostic.Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
3854,"Novel mutation in keratin 10 causing autosomal dominant epidermolytic ichthyosis Epidermolytic ichthyosis (EI; OMIM 113800), previously termed bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma or epidermolytic hyperkeratosis, is a clinically heterogeneous disorder of keratinization caused by mutations in either of the KRT1 or KRT10 genes, which encode the suprabasal keratins K1 and K10, respectively. The condition is usually characterized clinically by severe neonatal erythroderma, blistering and fragile skin, with the subsequent development of generalized hyperkeratosis. Usually mutations are missense substitutions in the highly conserved alpha-helical rod domains of these keratins, which play a critical role in filament formation. The presence of palmoplantar keratoderma is suggestive of KRT1 mutations, whereas KRT10 mutations are associated with palmoplantar sparing. We report a seven-generation kindred with EI due to a novel mutation in KRT10. A 32-year-old woman presented with widespread ichthyosis and erythema affecting her trunk and limbs. She gave a history of scaling and erythroderma since birth but no blistering, erosions or collodion membrane. She had been maintained on oral isotretinoin 20-40 mg once daily from the age of 13 years, but had recently developed lower-back and hip pain. Examination revealed widespread fine scaling and erythema over the trunk and limbs with more significant hyperkeratosis at the elbows, knees and ankles. There was relative sparing of the palmoplantar skin. Her father, uncle and grandmother were more severely affected, but none was receiving oral retinoids. Four further generations were recorded as affected. Histology of affected elbow and upper-arm skin demonstrated acanthosis, marked overlying hyperkeratosis, vacuolar change of the upper epidermal cells in the upper epidermis with prominent clumping of keratohyaline granules and abnormal eosinophilic cytoplasm. X-rays of the lower lumbar spine and left hip demonstrated bridging osteophytes T11-L1 and flattening of the left femoral head, with magnetic resonance imaging confirming the presence of avascular necrosis. This required treatment with a left core decompression of the left hip, with good results. Mutation screening of KRT10 identified a novel heterozygous deletion extending from intron 5 into exon 6 (designated K10 c.1156-79- 1243del), abolishing the exon 6 acceptor splice site, resulting in a shorter aberrant K10 protein lacking a sequence motif critically important for keratin filament assembly. The mutation was present in her affected father. This finding adds to the evidence that K10 mutations are the principal cause of autosomal dominant EI with palmoplantar sparing. It also highlights the possible side-effects of long-term oral retinoid treatment in these inherited conditions.",Excluded
4888,"Intensity-Modulated Proton and Carbon-Ion Radiation Therapy in the Management of Head and Neck Sarcomas Purpose: We report our experience of intensity-modulated proton and carbon-ion radiotherapy (IMPT/IMCT) for head and neck sarcomas (HNS). Methods and Materials: An analysis of the ongoing prospective data registry from the Shanghai Proton and Heavy Ion Center (SPHIC) for patients with HNS was conducted. The 12- and 24-month rates of local recurrence-free, overall, distant metastasis-free, progression-free survival (LRFS, OS, DMFS, and PFS), and acute/late toxicities were calculated. The prognostic factors for the effectiveness of the treatment were also analyzed. Result(s): Between 7/2014 and 5/2018, 51 consecutive patients with HNS received definitive doses of IMCT (41 cases), IMPT (two cases), or their combination (eight cases). One patient had R0 resection and another treated on the Chinese Food and Drug Administration registration trial received IMPT only. Twenty-seven patients were treated according to various dose escalation trials or institutional protocols using IMCT or IMPT + IMCT boost. Twenty-two patients with locoregional recurrence (10 and four patients failed surgery or surgery followed by radiotherapy, respectively) or radiation-induced second primary sarcomas (eight patients) received salvage particle radiotherapy. With a median follow-up time of 15.7 months, four patients with second primary sarcoma died. The 1- and 2-year OS, PFS, LRFS, and DMFS rates for the entire cohort were 92.9% vs 90%, 73.6% vs 57.4%, 88.4% vs 78.9%, and 84.6% vs 76.5%, respectively. Those rates for patients without prior radiotherapy were 100% vs 100%, 82.1% vs 65.8%, 93.6% vs 85.3%, and 88.4% vs 79.5%, respectively. Multivariate analyses revealed that re-irradiation was an independent prognostic factor for both LRFS and PFS (P = 0.015 and 0.037, respectively). In addition, gross tumor volume (GTV) was an independent prognostic factor for PFS (P = 0.048). One patient experienced Grade 3 acute toxicity (oral mucositis); another experienced Grade 4 acute event (hemorrhage) which required embolization. He lately died from hemorrhage (Grade 5) at 3.4 months after the completion of treatment. No patient experienced radiation-induced acute/late toxicity of >= Grade 2 otherwise. Conclusion(s): With few observed acute/late toxicities, IMPT/IMCT provided effective short-term tumor control in our patients with HNS. Further investigations, preferably in a prospective fashion, will be required to confirm the efficacy and toxicities of IMPT/IMCT in this group of patients.Copyright Â© 2019 The Authors.

4864,"Surgeon-performed Ultrasound for the Staging of Acute Diverticulitis: Preliminary Results of a Prospective Study INTRODUCTION: Although contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CEACT) is still considered the gold standard for the assessment of suspected acute diverticulitis, in recent years the use of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has been spreading more and more in this setting. The aim of this study is to compare CEACT to POCUS for the diagnosis and staging of suspected acute diverticulitis. METHOD(S): This is a prospective study conducted on 55 patients admitted to the Emergency Department of two Italian Hospitals with a clinical suspicion of acute diverticulitis between January 2014 and December 2017. All the patients included underwent POCUS first and CEACT immediately afterwards, with the diagnosis and the staging reported according to the Hinchey (H) classification modified by Wasvary et al. Three surgeons performed all the POCUS and the same two radiologists retrospectively analyzed all the CEACT images. The radiologists were informed of the clinical suspicion but unaware of the POCUS findings. The CEACT was used as the gold standard for the comparison. RESULT(S): The final cohort included 30 (55%) females and 25 (45%) males. The median age was 62 (24-88) and the median body mass index was 26 (19-42).Forty-six out of 55 patients had a confirmed diagnosis of acute diverticulitis on both POCUS and CEACT, whereas in seven patients the diagnosis was not confirmed by both methods. POCUS sensitivity and specificity were 98% and 88% respectively. POCUS positive and negative predictive values were 98% and 88% respectively. POCUS accuracy was 96%.POCUS classified 33 H1a, 11 H1b, 1 H2 and 1 H3 acute diverticulitis. This staging was confirmed in all patients but three (93%) by CEACT. CONCLUSION(S): Point-of-care ultrasound appeared a reliable technique for the diagnosis and the staging of clinically suspected H1 and H2 acute diverticulitis. It could contribute in saving time and resources and in avoiding unnecessary radiation exposure to most patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.

4592,"Effects of beta radiation from organically bound tritium on cultured mouse embryonic mid brain cells Effects of beta radiation from four kinds of organically bound tritium compounds were investigated on cultured mouse embryonic mid brain cells, isolated from 11-d-old mouse embryos. The MBC showed a critical time when they were more radiosensitive. Although dose-dependent inhibition was found for both cellular proliferation and differentiation, the differentiation was more sensitive to radiation than proliferation when compared at ID50, the inhibitory dose that reduced assessment value by 50% of the control. Dose-dependent decrease of DNA and protein contents were also observed. The relative biological effectiveness values, ranging from 4.6 to 8.7, of beta ray from organically bound tritium compounds were obtained when compared with x irradiation at their ID50s on the inhibition of cell proliferation and differentiation, and on the decrease of DNA and protein contents of the cultures. The mixed exposure to x ray and one kind of organically bound tritium compound or to any two kinds of organically bound tritium compound resulted in a more efficiently inhibitory effect on differentiation than the exposure to x ray or to any one kind of organically bound tritium compound alone, especially when methyl-3H-thymidine was used. Doses as low as 0.05 Gy (5 cGy) from a mixed exposure resulted in detectable inhibitory effects.",Excluded

4023,"Brain Necrosis in Adult Proton Therapy Patients. Do Necrotic Regions Have Elevated Linear Energy Transfer? Purpose/Objective(s): To investigate if brain necrosis induction correlates with regions of high linear energy transfer (LET) for proton radiation therapy treatments with partial brain involvement for central nervous system (CNS) and head and neck (H&N) patients. Materials/Methods: Fifty patients irradiated between 2004-2016 with CT image changes indicative of brain necrosis after irradiation were collected. For each patient, the necrotic region was contoured using MRI imaging. To obtain the LET distributions in the patients, treatment plans were recalculated using Monte Carlo simulations with TOPAS version 3.0.1. For each patient, voxels in the necrotic region were dose-matched with randomly selected voxels in the non-necrotic region of the brain and analyzed for a correlation of LET and occurrence of necrosis. In addition, a simplified relative biological effectiveness (RBE) model assuming a linear increase of RBE with LET was applied. A multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression was used to assess the impact of LET, dose, and tumor site on voxel-based necrosis. Result(s): The probability of voxel necrosis was statistically significantly associated with increasing dose (p<0.0001) and tumor site (i.e., for the same dose H&N voxels are significantly more likely than CNS voxels to develop necrosis, p<0.0001). The LET was not associated with necrosis when adjusted for dose and tumor site, p=0.7. However, there are significant differences between patients (I2 statistics = 99.4%, p<0.0001) with some patients having significantly higher mean LET values in the necrotic regions (e.g., average LET 5.0 keV/mum vs 3.4 keV/mum, p<0.0001) while others having no difference or even lower LET values in the necrotic regions (e.g., 3.3 keV/mum vs 3.7 keV/mum, p<0.0001). The average difference in LET for dose-matched voxels was less than 0.2 keV/mum for the CNS and H&N cohorts as well as the average over the entire patient cohort. Selecting only high dose voxels (> 50 Gy) or the hottest 20 or 100 voxels also did not reveal any correlation between LET and onset of necrosis. The largest difference in LET was 1.8 keV/mum. The average difference in RBE over the patient cohort was less than 0.5 Gy(RBE), however, 13 patients had over 1 Gy(RBE) higher biological dose in the necrotic region and two patients showed a difference of over 4 Gy(RBE). Conclusion(s): Overall, we did not find any evidence for higher LET in necrotic voxels compared to non-necrotic voxels with the same dose (p=0.7). The LET (or RBE) variation alone cannot explain the induction of brain necrosis and there are other risk factors that need to be accounted for. Nevertheless, for some patients, high LET regions correlated with the necrotic region. These patients may benefit from LET optimization.Copyright Â© 2019",Excluded
3817,"Polymorphisms in DNA repair genes: Link with biomarkers of the CBMN cytome assay in hospital workers chronically exposed to low doses of ionising radiation Individual sensitivity to ionising radiation (IR) is the result of interaction between exposure, DNA damage, and its repair, which is why polymorphisms in DNA repair genes could play an important role. We examined the association between DNA damage, expressed as micronuclei (MNi), nuclear buds (NBs), and nucleoplasmic bridges (NPBs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms in selected DNA repair genes (APE1, hOGG1, XRCC1, XRCC3, XPD, PARP1, MGMT genes; representative of the different DNA repair pathways operating in mammals) in 77 hospital workers chronically exposed to low doses of IR, and 70 matched controls. A significantly higher MNi frequency was found in the exposed group (16.2+/-10.4 vs. 11.5+/-9.4; P=0.003) and the effect appeared to be independent from the principal confounding factor. Exposed individuals with hOGG1, XRCC1, PARP1, and MGMT wild-type alleles or APEX1, as well as XPD (rs13181) heterozygous showed a significantly higher MNi frequency than controls with the same genotypes. Genetic polymorphism analysis and cytogenetic dosimetry have proven to be a powerful tool complementary to physical dosimetry in regular health surveillance programmes.Copyright Â© 2015 Institute for Medical Research and Occupational Health.",Included
4683,"Multi-phase rotational angiography of the left ventricle to assist ablations: feasibility and accuracy of novel imaging AIMS: Interventional left ventricular (LV) procedures integrating static 3D anatomy visualization are subject to mismatch with dynamic catheter movements due to prominent LV motion. We aimed to evaluate the accuracy of a recently developed acquisition and post-processing protocol for low radiation dose LV multi-phase rotational angiography (4DRA) in patients., METHODS AND RESULTS: 4DRA image acquisition of the LV was performed as investigational acquisition in patients undergoing left-sided ablation (11 men; BMI = 24.7 +/- 2.5 kg/m2). Iodine contrast was injected in the LA, while pacing from the RA at a cycle length of 700 ms. 4DRA acquisition and reconstruction were possible in all 11 studies. Reconstructed images were post-processed using streak artefact reduction algorithms and an interphase registration-based filtering method, increasing contrast-to-noise ratio by a factor 8.2 +/- 2.1. This enabled semi-automatic segmentation, yielding LV models of five equidistant phases per cardiac cycle. For evaluation, off-line 4DRA fluoroscopy registration was performed, and the 4DRA LV contours of the different phases were compared with the contours of five corresponding phases of biplane LV angiography, acquired in identical circumstances. Of the distances between these contours, 95% were <4 mm in both incidences. Effective radiation dose for 4DRA, calculated by patient-specific Monte-Carlo simulation, was 5.1 +/- 1.1 mSv., CONCLUSION: Creation of 4DRA LV models in man is feasible at near-physiological heart rate and with clinically acceptable radiation dose. They showed high accuracy with respect to LV angiography in RAO and LAO. The presented technology not only opens perspectives for full cardiac cycle dynamic anatomical guidance during interventional procedures, but also for 3DRA without need for very rapid pacing.

Material(s) and Method(s): Twenty-four patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer were investigated pretherapeutically and during a defined course of radiochemotherapy (RCTh) with a total dose of 70 Gy given in 35 fractions over 9 weeks (2-week break after 30 Gy). In weeks 1 and 6, the patients received chemotherapy (5 FU and mitomycin C) concomitant with irradiation. The oxygen partial pressure measurements were carried out using polarographic needle probes in combination with a microprocessor-controlled device (pO2 histograph/KIMOC). Times of measurements were before therapy, at the end of week 3 (30 Gy), after a 2- week break (30 Gy) and at the end of therapy if measurable lesion was found (70 Gy). Result(s): There was a significant reduction in the median pO2 (P < 0.005, n = 18) and an increase in the hypoxic fraction (defined as the percentage of pO2 values of <5 mm Hg) after application of 30 Gy (P < 0.05, n = 18). This effect was partially reversed at the end of the 2-week break. During the break an increase in the median pO2 (P = 0.05, n = 12) and a decrease in the hypoxic fraction could be observed. Towards the end of therapy (70 Gy) a significant decrease (P = 0.02, n = 13) in the median pO2 occurred. Corresponding to this, the hypoxic fraction increased during the last 4 weeks of therapy (P = 0.06, n = 13). Conclusion(s): Statistically significant changes in oxygenation in locally advanced head and neck cancer were found during a split-course radiochemotherapy. This information was obtained in a homogenous group of patients under well-defined therapeutic conditions. The decrease in the tumor oxygenation status at doses of 30 and 70 Gy are important findings because they are in contrast to the concept of continuous improvement of the oxygenation status during fractionated radiotherapy.",Excluded
4368,"Prevention and Management of Radiation-induced Late Gastrointestinal Toxicity In the UK, about 90,000 cancer survivors will suffer from pelvic radiation disease (PRD) due to their curative treatment including radiotherapy. The National Cancer Survivorship Initiative aims to improve the understanding and management of PRD by the oncology community. This overview covers the prevention, investigation and treatment for late radiation-induced gastrointestinal symptoms in PRD. Multiple pharmacological and nutritional interventions have been studied, as prophylaxis for acute gastrointestinal toxicity (aiming to prevent late consequential effects), although predominantly only small randomised controlled trials have been conducted. These have produced mixed results, although promising signals for some agents have been observed. Evidence for the pharmacological prevention of late gastrointestinal toxicity is scarce. Even fewer randomised controlled trials have investigated the late gastrointestinal toxicity profile of advanced radiotherapy technologies. There are nationally agreed algorithms for the investigation and management of PRD, but a lack of awareness means patients still do not get referred appropriately. This overview outlines the management of radiation proctopathy and diarrhoea, and signposts other accessible resources. Finally, we provide recommendations for the management of late gastrointestinal symptoms in PRD and research in this field, especially the need for high-quality clinical trials.

Of these, 147 received no PCS (PCS-Off group), whereas 148 received low-dose PCS (starting dose, 15 mg/day of prednisolone) for 6 weeks (PCS-On group). We used magnetic resonance imaging to thoroughly evaluate GO before and 1 year after RAI therapy., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes of GO 1 year after RAI therapy were determined., RESULTS: GO exacerbation occurred in 29 patients (9.8%), and only 7 patients (2.4%) required ophthalmic treatment. No significant difference in the frequency of GO exacerbation was seen between the groups (PCS-On group: n = 18 [12.1%]; PCS-Off group: n = 11 [7.5%]; P = .17).

4586,"Impact of radiotherapy dose on dentition breakdown in head and neck cancer patients Purpose: To evaluate the severity of post-radiation dental lesions and possible correlation with radiation dose to the teeth in patients treated for head and neck cancers. Methods and Materials: Data from 93 head and neck radiotherapy patients treated between 1997 and 2008 were analyzed retrospectively. The main effect, radiation dose to the individual teeth, was evaluated with covariates of elapsed time after radiation, xerostomia, topical fluoride use, and oral hygiene status included. Patients' radiotherapy plans were used to calculate cumulative exposure for each tooth. Patients' teeth were evaluated using a validated index and then categorized as having none-slight or moderate-severe post-radiation damage. Result(s): Patients (31 females, 62 males) ranged in age from 18-82 years (mean 57). The number of teeth-patient ranged from 3-30 (mean 20) with a total of 1873 teeth evaluated. Overall, 51% of teeth had moderate-severe damage, with the remaining having little or none. Using odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals, the odds for moderate-severe damage were 2-3 times greater for teeth exposed to between 30 and 60 Gy as compared to no radiation. However, for teeth exposed to >= 60 Gy as compared to no radiation the odds of moderate-severe tooth damage was greater by a magnitude of 10 times. Conclusion(s): The results indicate that there is minimal tooth damage below 30 Gy (salivary gland threshold), a greater than 1:1 increased dose-response between 30 and 60 Gy likely related to salivary gland damage, and a critical threshold of >= 60 Gy, which may be linked to direct effects of radiation on tooth structure. These findings suggest that care should be taken during the treatment planning process to limit tooth dose, and when clinically possible to limit tooth dose to less than 60 Gy.

The aim of the present study was to assess the contribution of ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in deciphering such trauma. The study hypothesis was that MRI can confirm most diagnoses and reveal occult lesions. Method(s): 48 patients with a median age of 33 years (IQR, 22-48.75), admitted to the Emergency Department between February and September 2016, were prospectively included. All had normal X-ray and underwent emergency and deferred emergency (D + 7-10) clinical examination, and US and MRI at D + 7-14. The same examinations were repeated to establish diagnosis and initiate treatment. MRI was considered as gold-standard for definite diagnosis. Result(s): Diagnoses comprised: 14 shoulder contusions; 13 rotator cuff tears; 8 acromioclavicular sprains; 6 fractures: 3 greater tuberosity, 2 humeral head, 1 lateral quarter of the clavicle; 3 subluxations or anterior dislocations with spontaneous reduction; 1 posterior dislocation with spontaneous reduction; 1 case of resorption of calcification in the pectoralis major tendon; 1 case of coracobrachialis strain; and 1 partial pectoralis major detachment. Concordance with final diagnosis was 42% (20/48) on initial clinical examination and 52% (25/48) on reassessment. On US, concordance was 71% (34/48), with 82% positive predictive value for cuff tear and 0% for instability. MRI was contributive in all cases, revealing 48 abnormal signals in 41 patients, thus establishing 48 diagnoses. Conclusion(s): Except in precise diagnostic situations such as rotator cuff tear, US is not a contributive examination, completely overlooking shoulder instability and bone contusion. MRI should play an increasing role in deciphering these traumas. Level of Evidence: II; prospective cohort study.Copyright Â© 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS",Excluded
3946,"Changes in the redox state and endogenous fluorescence of in vivo human skin due to intrinsic and photo-aging, measured by multiphoton tomography with fluorescence lifetime imaging Ultraviolet radiation from solar exposure is a key extrinsic factor responsible for premature skin aging (i.e., photo-aging). Recent advances using in vivo multiphoton tomography (MPT) demonstrate the efficacy of this approach to assess intrinsic and extrinsic skin aging as an alternative to existing invasive techniques. In this study, we measured changes in epidermal autofluorescence, dermal collagen second harmonic generation (SHG), and the redox state of solar-exposed and solar-protected human skin by MPT with fluorescence lifetime imaging (MPT-FLIM). Twenty-four volunteers across four age categories (20 to 29, 30 to 39, 40 to 49, and 50 to 59 years old; six volunteers each) were recruited for MPT-FLIM imaging of the dorsal (solar-exposed; photo-damaged) and volar (solar-protected) forearm. We demonstrate a higher intensity of dermal collagen SHG within the volar forearm compared to dorsal solar-exposed skin. Redox imaging of each epidermal skin stratum by FLIM demonstrates an increase in fluorescence lifetime in the solar-exposed dorsal forearm that is more apparent in aged skin. The results of this study suggest the redox state of the viable epidermis is a key marker in assessing intrinsic and photo-damage skin aging, in combination with changes in autofluorescence and SHG.",Excluded
4079,"Is there a role for Ytrrium-90 in the treatment of unresectable and metastatic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma? Background: Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) with Ytrrium-90 (Y-90) has been used to treat hepatic malignancies with success. This study focuses on the efficacy and safety of Y-90 in the treatment of unresectable and metastatic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). Method(s): A single-institution retrospective case review was performed for patients with unresectable and metastatic ICC treated with Y-90 between 2006 and 2016. Result(s): Seventeen patients with ICC underwent 21 Y-90 treatments. Four patients had undergone prior liver resection, and six patients had extrahepatic disease at the time of treatment. Five year overall survival was 26.8%, with a median survival of 33.6 months. One patient underwent margin negative liver resection after a single treatment. Complications were appreciated in two cases. Ninety-day mortality was 0%. Conclusion(s): Treatment of ICC using Y-90 is a safe and promising procedure. Further research is needed to clarify its role in the treatment of unresectable and metastatic ICC.Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
4178,"The Artemis Program: An Overview of NASA's Activities to Return Humans to the Moon NASA is developing a two-phased approach to quickly return humans to the Moon and establish a sustainable presence in orbit and on the surface. The two phases run in parallel, and both have already begun, with selection of the first Gateway element, the Power and Propulsion Element, solicitation activities focused on an American-built, industry-provided Human Landing System, and discussions with industry and international partners about potential opportunities for collaboration. Phase 1 is driven exclusively by the administration's priority to land the first woman and the next man on the lunar South Pole by 2024. In this phase, NASA and its partners will develop and deploy two Gateway components: the Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) that will launch in 2022, and the Habitation and Logistics Outpost (HALO), a minimal habitation capability) that will launch in 2023. Both will launch on commercial rockets, as will Gateway logistics deliveries to outfit the ship and provide supplies for surface expeditions. This initial Gateway configuration represents the beginning of its capability buildup, and the primary components required to support the first human expedition to the lunar South Pole. NASA's baseline reference approach for human expeditions on the surface is for Human Landing Systems to aggregate and dock to the Gateway, then deploy to the lunar South Pole with two astronauts aboard. Phase 2 is focused on advancing the technologies that will foster a sustainable presence on and around the Moon - a lasting and productive presence enabled by reusable systems, access for a diverse body of contributing partners, and repeatable trips to multiple destinations across the lunar surface. In this Phase, we will advance sustainable systems to make surface expeditions more repeatable and affordable. While the Gateway is the first of its kind to be funded, the concept has been proposed for decades as a necessary and foundational capability for a sustainable return to the Moon, and a port for vehicles embarking to farther destinations. It supports every tenet of Space Policy Directive-1 and the infrastructure it provides is critical to an accelerated return to the Moon, and access to more parts of the Moon than ever before. The Gateway also provides a unique platform to conduct cross-discipline science. Science instruments, both internal and external to the Gateway, have the potential to reveal new findings in space science, Earth science, and biological research data from deep space. Additionally, the broad science community will be able to utilize the communications and data relay capabilities of the Gateway, beginning with the PPE in Phase 1. This paper will outline the cross-discipline activities NASA is currently conducting, and those the agency anticipates conducting in the future to successfully implement Phases 1 and 2 in the lunar vicinity, all while preparing for humanity's next giant leap: Mars. 2020 IEEE.",Excluded
4327,"Sparing bilateral neck level IB in oropharyngeal carcinoma and xerostomia outcomes OBJECTIVES: To assess whether sparing neck-level IB in target delineation of node-positive (N+) oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPC) can improve xerostomia outcomes without compromising locoregional control (LRC)., METHODS: A total of 125 N+ OPC patients with a median age of 57 years underwent chemoradiation between May 2010 and December 2011. A total of 74% of patients had T1-T2 disease, 26% T3-T4, 16% N1, 8% N2A, 48% N2B, 28% N2C; 53% base of tongue, 41% tonsil, and 6% other. Patients were divided into those who had target delineation sparing of bilateral level IB (the spared cohort) versus no sparing (the treated cohort). Sparing of contralateral high-level II nodes was also performed more consistently in the spared cohort. A prospective xerostomia questionnaire (patient reported) was given at each patient follow-up visit to this cohort of patients to assess late xerostomia. Clinical assessment (observer rated) at each patient follow-up visit was also recorded., RESULTS: The 2-year LRC for the spared and treated cohorts was 97.5% and 93.8%, respectively (median follow-up, 23.2 mo). No locoregional failures occurred outside of treatment fields. The spared cohort experienced significant benefits in patient-reported xerostomia summary scores (P=0.021) and observer-rated xerostomia scores (P=0.006). In addition, there were significant reductions in mean doses to the ipsilateral submandibular gland (63.9 vs. 70.5 Gy; P<0.001), contralateral submandibular gland (45.0 vs. 56.2 Gy; P<0.001), oral cavity (35.9 vs. 45.2 Gy; P<0.001), and contralateral parotid gland (20.0 vs. 24.4 Gy; P<0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: Target delineation sparing of bilateral level IB nodes in N+ OPC reduced mean doses to salivary organs without compromising LRC.

4265,"Combined use of automatic tube potential selection with tube current modulation and iterative reconstruction technique in coronary CT angiography Purpose: To analyze the effect of automatic tube potential selection with tube current modulation (APSCM) and iterative reconstruction on image quality, diagnostic accuracy, and radiation dose at computed tomographic (CT) angiography and compare it with APSCM-only and body mass index (BMI)-based examination protocols. Material(s) and Method(s): This study was approved by the institutional review board, and informed consent was obtained from all patients. Images from 185 patients who underwent a BMI-based protocol and 197 patients who underwent an APSCM protocol with filtered back projection (FBP) and an APSCM protocol with sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction (SAFIRE) were retrospectively evaluated. Diagnostic performance was compared with that of conventional coronary angiography in a subgroup of 51 patients. Statistical analysis was performed by using the independent or paired t test, Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon signed rank test, x2 statistics, linear weighted k statistics, and generalized estimating equation. Result(s): The APSCM group with SAFIRE had a significant reduction in image noise and a significant increase in CT number, contrast enhancement, signal-to-noise ratio, and contrast-to-noise ratio compared with the APSCM group with FBP (P < .0001) and the BMI-based group (P < .001, except P = .002 for image noise). Image quality and diagnostic accuracy showed no significant difference between the three groups. The use of APSCM resulted in a significant reduction in radiation dose compared with the BMI-based protocol. Conclusion(s): The combination of SAFIRE and APSCM at coronary CT angiography significantly improves objective image quality while maintaining diagnostic accuracy and reduced radiation dose.

4244,"Latent and lytic Epstein-Barr virus gene expression in the peripheral blood of astronauts Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent and replicative gene transcription was analyzed in peripheral blood B-lymphocytes from astronauts who flew on short-duration (~11 days) Shuttle missions and long-duration (~180 days) International Space Station (ISS) missions. Latent, immediate-early, and early gene replicative viral transcripts were detected in samples from six astronauts who flew on short-duration Shuttle missions, whereas viral gene transcription was mostly absent in samples from 24 healthy donors. Samples from six astronauts who flew on long-duration ISS missions were characterized by expanded expression of latent, immediate-early, and early gene transcripts and new onset expression of late replicative transcription upon return to Earth. These data indicate that EBV-infected cells are no longer expressing the restricted set of viral genes that characterize latency but are expressing latent and lytic gene transcripts. These data also suggest the possibility of EBV-related complications in future long-duration missions, in particular interplanetary travel. Â© 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Excluded

Background and purpose To evaluate the outcome of malignant salivary gland tumours treated with neutron therapy to assess the potential for other high linear energy transfer (LET) beams. Materials and methods Neutrons at iThemba LABS are produced by the reaction of 66 MeV protons on a beryllium target. A median dose 20.4 Gy, in 12 fractions in 4 weeks or 15 fractions in 5 weeks, was given to 335 patients with 176 irresectable, 104 macroscopically residual and 55 unresected tumours. Results Locoregional control was 60.6% at 5 years and 39.1% at 10 years and DSS was 66.8% and 53.7% at 5 and 10 years respectively. In the univariate analysis T4, >4 cm, high grade, squamous carcinoma, unresected and irresectable tumours, and positive nodes were significantly worse for LRC. In the multivariate analysis tumours >6 cm, squamous carcinoma, irresectable tumours and nodes were significantly worse for LRC. Tumours >6 cm, high grade, squamous carcinoma and nodes were significantly worse for DSS. Neither LRC nor DSS was influenced by age, sex, site, dose, fractionation or for initial or recurrent disease. Conclusions Neutron therapy appears to be the treatment of choice for macroscopically incompletely excised and irresectable salivary gland tumours with improved survival rates. Further improvement may be achieved with other high LET modalities with a superior dose profile, such as carbon ions. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
4299,"Cerebral metastases pathology after radiosurgery: a multicenter study BACKGROUND: To the authors' knowledge, comprehensive human pathologic investigations that explore fundamental radiosurgical effects on metastatic brain tumors are sparse in the literature. The objective of this study was to analyze histopathologic findings in a set of clinically recurrent cerebral metastases after patients underwent stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)., METHODS: In a series of 7500 patients who underwent radiosurgery, 2020 patients (27%) harbored cerebral metastases. Eighteen of 2020 patients (0.9%) underwent subsequent craniotomy for tumor removal anywhere from 1 month to 59 months after they received high-dose irradiation. Histologic and immunohistochemical investigations were performed on the surgically resected tissue specimens. These specimens were within the radiosurgical treatment volume of the metastatic tumor., RESULTS: Light microscopy revealed 3 basic categories of histologic responses: acute-type, subacute-type, and chronic-type tissue reactions. A moderate-to-intense inflammatory cell reaction was seen in the tissue responses of well controlled neoplasms (i.e., in patients who had neoplasms that required craniotomy for recurrent disease > 5 months after SRS), whereas the inflammatory reaction was missing or sparse in poorly controlled neoplasms (patients who required craniotomy for recurrent disease < 5 months after SRS). This reaction was seen within the irradiated tumor volume and not in the peritumoral area nor in areas remote from the radiosurgical treatment volume. Immunohistochemical characterization demonstrated the presence of prominent CD68-positive macrophage and CD3-positive T-lymphocyte populations. A progressively severe vasculopathy also was observed with increasing time after radiosurgery., CONCLUSIONS: Although causality has not been established, a brisk inflammatory response and more severe vasculopathy were observed in lesions in which recurrences were more delayed.

4386,"Long-term outcome of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in patients with acoustic neuromas Purpose: To evaluate the effectiveness and long-term outcome of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for acoustic neuromas (AN). Patients and Methods: Between 1990 and 2001, we treated 26 patients with 27 AN with SRS. Two patients suffered from neurofibromatosis type 2. Before SRS, a subtotal or total resection had been performed in 3 and in 5 patients, respectively. For SRS, a median single dose of 13 Gy/80% isodose was applied. Result(s): The overall actuarial 5-year and 10-year tumor control probability in all patients was 91%. Two patients developed tumor progression after SRS at 36 and 48 months. Nineteen patients (73%) were at risk of treatment-related facial nerve toxicity; of these, 1 patient developed a complete facial nerve palsy after SRS (5%). A total of 93% of the lesions treated were at risk of radiation-induced trigeminal neuralgia. Two patients (8%) developed mild dysesthesia of the trigeminal nerve after SRS. The hearing preservation rate in patients with useful hearing before SRS was 55% at 9 years. Conclusion(s):: Stereotactic radiosurgery results in good local control rates of AN and the risk of cranial nerve toxicities is acceptable. As toxicity is lower with fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy, SRS should be reserved for smaller lesions. Â© 2006 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
4463,"Persistence of chromatid aberrations in the cells of solid mouse tissues exposed to 137Cs gamma radiation Primary mouse ear and kidney cultures were established for determination of cytogenetic aberrations at short (3 days to 1 month) and long (12-23 months) times after exposure of their right sides to 7.5 Gy of (137)Cs gamma radiation. In every case, higher levels of aberrations were observed in primary cultures established from the irradiated tissues than in those established from the contralateral tissues. The most common aberrations in the contralateral tissues and those from nonirradiated mice were chromatid and isochromatid breaks and small chromatid fragments. Primary cells from irradiated tissues removed from animals within a month of exposure displayed a variety of unstable chromosome-type aberrations characteristic of recent exposure to ionizing radiation including rings, dicentrics, double minutes, and large acentric fragments. The percentages of cells exhibiting chromatid breaks and small chromatid fragments were also markedly elevated. Although the levels of chromosome-type aberrations found in primary cells from irradiated tissues dropped to near background levels a year or more after exposure, chromatid-type aberrations remained elevated. These results are consistent with long-term persistence of damage in the genomes of ionizing radiation-exposed cells in solid tissues and the induction of genomic instability in vivo.",Included

Exposure was measured using a personal exposure meter EME SPY 140. Mean values of exposure levels from different radiofrequency sources were calculated using both naive and robust regression on order statistics approaches. The total daily exposure from all radiofrequency electromagnetic field sources varied widely among participants depending on their location, the mobile network they use, their activities, and their mode of transportation, ranging from about 0.2 V m to 0.9 V m. The average total daily exposure of all participants was about 0.48 V m. The main contribution to the mean exposure was from WiFi 2G (45%), GSM900 uplink (19%), GSM900 downlink, and FM radiobroadcasting (each by 11%). Other sources including GSM1800, UMTS2100, WiFi 5G, DECT, TETRA, WiMAX, and TV bands all together contributed 14%. During different activities, participants were exposed to the highest exposure level while traveling and to the lowest exposure while they were sleeping.

4627,"Long-term quality of life and tumour control following gamma knife radiosurgery for vestibular schwannoma Introduction: Gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) has for the last decades been an established treatment option for patients with small- or medium-sized vestibular schwannomas (VS), although little data is reported on long-term outcome regarding quality of life (QOL) and tumour control in this patient category. The objective of this study was to investigate long-term QOL and tumour control in GKRS-treated VS patients at our institution. Method(s): Data was reviewed from a consecutive cohort of 128 patients, 62 men and 66 women, diagnosed with VS and treated with GKRS at Karolinska University Hospital between 1997 and 2003. Patients previously treated for VS, patients from abroad, and patients with neurofibromatosis were excluded from the study. Median age at the time of treatment was 66 years (range 23-89), with a median follow-up time of 104 months (range 11-165) and radiological median follow-up of 86 months (range 5-170). Five patients were lost to follow-up. Result(s): Data on QOL (EQ-5D score) was obtained in 90 % (98/109) of all cases at the end of follow-up, showing low morbidity and a high QOL with median index of 0.91 (max. score 1.0) in these patients. Tumour control was achieved in 92 % (118/128) of patients after a single GKRS treatment. Ten patients had loss of tumour control, either radiologically seen as growth progression, or due to the need for salvage treatment. Neither pre-treatment growth of the vestibular schwannoma, or a large tumour size (Koos grade 3 & 4) was correlated with a higher degree of treatment failure (p = 0.695 and p = 0.647, respectively). There was no difference in tumour control in young (<60 y/o) vs. elderly (>=60 y/o) patients (p = 0.167). Conclusion(s): We report a high QOL and low morbidity at long-term follow-up after GKRS treatment in VS patients. Furthermore, a high tumour control rate was achieved independent of tumour size, patient age or pre-treatment evidence of tumour growth. Â© 2013 Springer-Verlag Wien.",Excluded
3745,"Basal cell nevus syndrome with unusual associated findings: A case report with 17 years of follow-up Background: Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS), also known as Gorlin-Goltz syndrome (GGS), is an inherit-ed autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the patched (PTCH) tumor-suppressor gene, which has high penetrance and variable phenotypic expressivity. In 1960, Gorlin and Goltz defined the condition by 3 main characteristics: multiple basal cell carcinomas, odontogenic keratocyst (OKC), and skeletal anomalies. Nowadays, many neurologic, ophthalmic, endocrine, and genital manifestations are known to be associated with this syndrome. Considering the complexity of the clinical manifestations, a multidisciplinary approach is necessary for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with NBCCS. Case Report: We report the case of a 27-year-old woman who presented with multiple maxillary and mandibular OKCs, as well as mandibular dentigerous cysts, all detected by X-ray. The medical records of the patient reported other findings such as falx cerebri calcification, osteolysis in femoral bones, and focal bone alteration suggestive of simple bone cysts. Based on the presented manifestations, it was concluded that the patient had characteristics of NBCCS. A multidisciplinary approach was necessary, and odontological intervention was used in man-aging treatment of the jaw cysts. Conclusion(s): In view of this combination of findings, it is of primary importance for dental surgeons and physicians to be able to recognize the signs and symptoms of NBCCS in order to achieve an early diagnosis and avoid the progression of oral cysts, the metastasis of skin lesions, and progression of other less frequent manifestations.Copyright Â© Am J Case Rep, 2021;.",Excluded

Several dose-volume histogram metrics including absolute lung volume spared from a 5 Gy dose (VS5) were analyzed for an association with RP above NCI-CTC grade 3 (RP >= G3). Clinical factors including pulmonary fibrosis score (PFS) and pulmonary emphysema score on baseline chest computed tomography (CT) were also analyzed., RESULTS: Fourteen patients (11.4%) developed RP greater than or equal to G3. On univariate analysis, all dose-volume histogram metrics, sex, and PFS on baseline CT were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with occurrence of RP greater than or equal to G3. Multivariate analysis revealed that V20 greater than or equal to 26%, VS5 less than 1500 cc, age greater than or equal to 68 years, and PFS on baseline CT greater than or equal to 2 were significant risk factors. Thus, we defined a new predictive risk score (PRS) that combines these factors. The cumulative incidence of RP greater than or equal to G3 at 12 months were 0%, 7.8%, 26.6%, and 71.4% when the PRS was 0, 3-5, 6-8, and 9-14, respectively (p < 0.001). This PRS was superior at predicting RP than both V20 and VS5 combined, or V20 alone by receiver operating characteristic analysis (area under the curve, 0.888 versus 0.779 versus 0.678)., CONCLUSIONS: V20, VS5, age, and PFS on baseline CT are independent and significant risk factors for occurrence of severe RP. Combining these factors may improve the predictability of severe RP.",Excluded
4432,"The influence of radiotherapy techniques on the plan quality and on the risk of secondary tumors in patients with pituitary adenoma Background: This planning study compares different radiotherapy techniques for patients with pituitary adenoma, including flatness filter free mode (FFF), concerning plan quality and secondary malignancies for potentially young patients. The flatness filter has been described as main source of photon scatter. Material(s) and Method(s): Eleven patients with pituitary adenoma were included. An Elekta SynergyTM linac was used in the treatment planning system Oncentra and for the measurements. 3D plans, IMRT, and VMAT plans and non-coplanar varieties were considered. The plan quality was evaluated regarding homogeneity, conformity, delivery time and dose to the organs at risk. The secondary malignancy risk was calculated from dose volume data and from measured dose to the periphery using different models for carcinoma and sarcoma risk. Result(s): The homogeneity and conformity were nearly unchanged with and without flattening filter, neither was the delivery time found substantively different. VMAT plans were more homogenous, conformal and faster in delivery than IMRT plans. The secondary cancer risk was reduced with FFF both in the treated region and in the periphery. VMAT plans resulted in a higher secondary brain cancer risk than IMRT plans, but the risk for secondary peripheral cancer was reduced. Secondary sarcoma risk plays a minor role. No advantage was found for non-coplanar techniques. The FFF delivery times were not shortened due to additional monitor units needed and technical limitations. The risk for secondary brain cancer seems to depend on the irradiated volume. Secondary sarcoma risk is much smaller than carcinoma risk in accordance to the results of the atomic bomb survivors. The reduction of the peripheral dose and resulting secondary malignancy risk for FFF is statistically significant. However, it is negligible in comparison to the risk in the treated region. Conclusion(s): Treatments with FFF can reduce secondary malignancy risk while retaining similar quality as with flattening filter and should be preferred. VMAT plans show the best plan quality combined with lowest peripheral secondary malignancy risk, but highest level of second brain cancer risk. Taking this into account VMAT FFF seems the most advantageous technique for the treatment of pituitary adenomas with the given equipment.Copyright Â© 2020 The Author(s).",Excluded

Patients and Methods: In 2005 and 2006, 55 patients (43 men, 12 women; median age 60 years) with locally advanced oesophageal cancer (cT3-4 Nx M0; 24 with squamous cell carcinoma, 31 with adenocarcinoma) underwent transthoracic en bloc oesophagectomy after completion of treatment with cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and radiotherapy ad 36 Gy in a prospective clinical trial. Of the 55 patients, 21 (38%) were classified as histopathological responders (<10% vital residual tumour cells) and 34 (62%) as nonresponders. FDG-PET was performed before (PET 1) and 3-4 weeks after the end (PET 2) of radiochemotherapy with assessment of maximum and average standardized uptake values (SUV) for correlation with histopathological response and survival. Result(s): Histopathological responders had a slightly higher baseline SUV than nonresponders (p<0.0001 between PET 1 and PET 2 for responders and nonresponders) and the decrease was more prominent in responders. Except for SUVmax in patients with squamous cell carcinoma neither baseline nor preoperative SUV nor percent SUV reduction correlated significantly with histopathological response. Histopathological responders had a 2-year overall survival of 91+/-9% and nonresponders a survival of 53+/-10% (p=0.007). Conclusion(s): Our study does not support recent reports that FDG-PET predicts histopathological response and survival in patients with locally advanced oesophageal cancer treated by neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy.

Material(s) and Method(s): Between January 1, 2000 and February 17, 2013, 10 patients were confirmed to have HGNE carcinoma of the rectum or anal canal and treated with pelvic chemoradiation (radiation dose >=45 Gy). Overall survival (OS), locoregional control (LRC), progression-free survival (PFS), and patterns of failure were evaluated. Result(s): Eight had pure HGNE carcinoma and 2 had HGNE carcinoma with minor component of adenocarcinoma. Median age was 62 years. Median follow-up was 15 months (range, 3 to 128 mo). Tumor stages included TxN0M0 (1), II (1), III (4), and IV (4) including 2 with only inguinal involvement. Median tumor size was 5.5 cm (range, 3 to 7 cm). Patients received postoperative chemoradiation (1), preoperative chemoradiation (2), and chemoradiation without surgery (7). Median dose was 50.4 Gy (range, 45 to 60 Gy). All patients received chemotherapy before or after chemoradiation. Seven had pelvic LRC; 2 had possible and 1 had confirmed local progression. Both patients who had preoperative chemoradiation only had microscopic focus of residual carcinoma at surgery. Seven had disease progression; of which all developed distant progression, with distant progression occurring as the first event in 6 (liver, lung, bone, and abdominal nodes). Actuarial 2-year PFS and OS were 30% and 46%, respectively. One patient received prophylactic cranial irradiation; only one of the other 9 patient developed brain metastasis. Conclusion(s): Pelvic chemoradiation provided LRC for the majority of the patients' lifetime. Most patients had distant failure, but patterns of distant failure do not support routine prophylactic cranial irradiation.Â© Copyright 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
3735,"Racial Disparities in Lung Cancer Screening: An Exploratory Investigation Background/Purpose: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Black Americans have the highest rate of lung cancer mortality, due to being diagnosed at later stage. Lung Cancer Screening (LCS) facilitates earlier detection and has been associated with a reduction in cancer death. We investigated LCS utilization and explored racial disparities (Black vs. non-Black) in LCS among patients for whom LCS is clinically indicated. Method(s): Using electronic medical records from the Lifespan Medical System, we randomly selected 200 patients who were likely to meet U. S. Preventive Services Taskforce (USPSTF) guidelines for LCS and mailed each patient a survey to assess LCS eligibility and uptake. Result(s): Nearly three-quarters (n = 146, 73%) completed the survey and, of survey respondents, 92% (n = 134) were eligible for the study. Among eligible patients, 35% met criteria for LCS; non-Black patients were 90% more likely to meet criteria for LCS than Black patients (44% vs. 27%). Of the patients meeting USPSTF criteria, only 21% reported being screened; eligible non-Black patients were 2.8 times more likely to have had LCS than eligible Black patients (30% vs. 12%). Conclusion(s): LCS utilization is low despite coverage provided through the Affordable Care Act. Black patients are less likely to qualify for screening and disproportionately less likely to be screened for lung cancer compared with non-Black patients. Targeted intervention strategies are needed to increase referral for and uptake of LCS in patients who are at high risk for developing lung cancer, and for Black patients in particular.Copyright Â© 2017 National Medical Association",Excluded
4931,"Analysis of acute radiation-induced esophagitis in non-small-cell lung cancer patients using the Lyman NTCP model PURPOSE: To analyze acute esophagitis (AE) in a Chinese population receiving 3D conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), combined or not with chemotherapy (CT), using the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman (LKB) normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model., MATERIALS AND METHODS: 157 Chinese patients (pts) presented with NSCLC received 3DCRT: alone (34 pts) or combined with sequential CT (59 pts) (group 1) or with concomitant CT (64 pts) (group 2). Parameters (TD(50), n, and m) of the LKB NTCP model predicting for>grade 2 AE (RTOG grading) were identified using maximum likelihood analysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses using a binary regression logistic model were performed to identify patient, tumor and dosimetric predictors of AE., RESULTS: Grade 2 or 3 AE occurred in 24% and 52% of pts in group 1 and 2, respectively (p<0.001). For the 93 group 1 pts, the fitted LKB model parameters were: m=0.15, n=0.29 and TD(50)=46 Gy. For the 64 group 2 pts, the parameters were: m=0.42, n=0.09 and TD(50)=36 Gy. In multivariate analysis, the only significant predictors of AE were: NTCP (p<0.001) and V(50), as continuous variable (RR=1.03, p=0.03) or being more than a threshold value of 11% (RR=3.6, p=0.009)., CONCLUSIONS: A LKB NTCP model has been established to predict AE in a Chinese population, receiving thoracic RT, alone or combined with CT. The parameters of the models appear slightly different than the previous one described in Western countries, with a lower volume effect for Chinese patients. Copyright Â© 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

4890,"DNA damage-induced PARP1 activation confers cardiomyocyte dysfunction through NAD+ depletion in experimental atrial fibrillation Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common clinical tachyarrhythmia with a strong tendency to progress in time. AF progression is driven by derailment of protein homeostasis, which ultimately causes contractile dysfunction of the atria. Here we report that tachypacing-induced functional loss of atrial cardiomyocytes is precipitated by excessive poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) activation in response to oxidative DNA damage. PARP1-mediated synthesis of ADP-ribose chains in turn depletes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), induces further DNA damage and contractile dysfunction. Accordingly, NAD+ replenishment or PARP1 depletion precludes functional loss. Moreover, inhibition of PARP1 protects against tachypacing-induced NAD+ depletion, oxidative stress, DNA damage and contractile dysfunction in atrial cardiomyocytes and Drosophila. Consistently, cardiomyocytes of persistent AF patients show significant DNA damage, which correlates with PARP1 activity. The findings uncover a mechanism by which tachypacing impairs cardiomyocyte function and implicates PARP1 as a possible therapeutic target that may preserve cardiomyocyte function in clinical AF.Copyright Â© 2019, The Author(s).",Excluded
4734,"Percutaneous Vertebroplasty with Side-Opening Cannula or Front-Opening Cannula in the Treatment of Kummell Disease? OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of bone cement distribution, cement leakage, and clinical outcomes with side-opening cannula for bone cement injection in percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) in treatment of Kummell disease., METHODS: A prospective study of patients with Kummell disease undergoing PVP was conducted from April 2012 to September 2017. In total, 43 patients (11 males, 32 females) with Kummell disease who received bilateral PVP were included in the study. The patients were divided into front-opening cannulas (FOC) group with front-opening cannulas and side-opening cannulas (SOC) group with side-opening cannulas. All patients were followed up for 6 months. The patient general information such as gender, age, bone density, compression ratio, operative time, and location of fracture vertebrae were recorded. Visual analogue scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), bone cement distribution, radiation exposure time, bone cement leakage rate and vertebral height, and kyphosis angle were measured and compared for two groups before surgery, 1 day and 6 months after surgery., RESULTS: A total of 43 patients were enrolled, including 11 males and 32 females, aged 61-84 years. The bone density (T value) was 2.5 +/- 0.6 in FOC group and 2.4 +/- 0.6 in SOC group (P > 0.05). The compression ratio and operative time were 36.1% +/- 13.0%, 39.3 +/- 7.9 min in FOC group and 35.2% +/- 13.7%, 40.0 +/- 10.7 min in SOC group (P > 0.05). There was no significance between FOC and SOC groups in the location of fracture vertebrae. All patients underwent at least 6 months of follow-up. At 6 months postoperatively, the VAS and ODI were significantly higher in the FOC group (3.0 +/- 0.8, 35.7% +/- 2.1%) than in the SOC group (1.3 +/- 0.4, 18.6% +/- 2.4%) (P < 0.05). The cement leakage rate of the SOC group was 4.8%, which was lower than that of the FOC group (31.8%, P < 0.05), and the bone cement distribution ratio was higher than that of the FOC group (63.1% +/- 7.9% vs 40.5% +/- 8.6%, P < 0.05). At 6 months after operation, the height of the anterior and posterior vertebral bodies of the patients in the SOC group restored better than the FOC group (anterior SOC: FOC 5.1 +/- 0.5 mm vs 4.5 +/- 0.5 mm; posterior SOC: FOC 0.6 +/- 0.1 mm vs 0.3 +/- 0.1 mm, P < 0.05), and the kyphosis correction was more obvious than patients in FOC group (SOC: FOC 8.5degree +/- 1.4degree vs 4.6degree +/- 0.8degree, P < 0.05)., CONCLUSION: Percutaneous vertebroplasty with side-opening cannula is safe and effective in avoiding bone cement leakage, improving bone cement distribution, and restoring vertebral height.

4552,"Ocular toxicity after 3D-conformal radiotherapy for non-hodgkin orbital lymphoma Purpose: The orbital Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a rare malignancy, usually localized and low aggressive, which management requires the irradiation of whole orbital cavity. This involves structures, as lens, particularly sensible to radiation effects. This single institution study wants to evaluate the acute and late siDe effects of conformal 3D irradiation for primary NHL. Materials: We retrospectively evaluated 59 consecutive patients (20 women and 39 men, mean age 59 +/- 16 yrs) with stage IEA NHL from 1986 to 2010. The disease was localized in the left eye in 34 (58%) patients, in the right in 21 (35%), bilateral in 4 (7%), and involved the orbit in 30 (51%), the conjunctiva in 18 (31%) and other orbital structures in 11 (18%). All patients underwent 3D-conformal radiotherapy after diagnosis (by pathological or cytological examination), staging (haematological tests, total body CT, bone marrow biopsy, orbital CT or MR) and in 4 cases after chemotherapy. The median dose was 30.6 Gy (range 30-40 Gy) with a standard fractioning (1.8 Gy per day) and the PTV consisted of whole orbital cavity. The bolus (thickness 0.5-1 cm) was used only in case of superficial localizations (25%). We described acute and late toxicity incidence and calculated the risk factors for cataract, using chi-square or Fisher test as appropriate. Result(s): The mean follow up was 68.3 +/- 55 months. It was performed by clinical and radiological examinations (total body CT, lymphatic stations US) and by ophthalmic visits, every 46 months during the first 5 years and then once a year. The local control was obtained in 58 (98.3%) patients. According to the RTOG scale, the graDe (G) 1 and 2 acute effects were 37% and 24% respectively, no G3-4 were observed in 39%. Thirty-six (61%) patients had no late toxicity, 22(37%) presented low effects (G1-2) and only 1 (2%) had retinopathy and bilateral cataract (G3). The table 1 reports the adverse effects. The cataract developed in 20 (34%) patients 2-7 yrs after radiotherapy was the more common late effect. It was easily treated by surgery. We considered as possible risk factors for cataract: age >60 yrs, Karnofsky performance status < 90%, total dose > 30.6 Gy, use of bolus and chemotherapy association. Total dose > 30.6 Gy resulted significantly associated (p<0.005). Cataract was developed in 13 of 24 patients (54%) treated with dose >30.6 (median 36 Gy), in 7 of 35 (20%) with dose <= 30.6. (Table presented) Conclusion(s): 3D conformal radiotherapy was effective and well tolerated, with low-graDe acute and late toxicity, for patients with orbital lymphoma. Cataract was the more frequent siDe effect, it was associated with a total dose > 30.6 Gy and easily treated with surgery. Eyesight was well preserved.",Excluded
4197,"MediGuide in supraventricular tachycardia: Initial experience from a multicentre registry AimsCurrently, fluoroscopy-based catheter visualization is the standard modality in invasive electrophysiological procedures. Recently a new technology for non-fluoroscopic visualization of diagnostic (since 2010) and ablation catheters (since May 2012) has been introduced. The MediGuideTM-Technology (MediGuide) projects catheter tips on prerecorded cine loops in a high time resolution.Methods and resultsWe report on MediGuide-based supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) cases [atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT), atrioventricular reentry tachycardia (AVRT), Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW), ectopic atrial tachycardia (EAT) and typical atrial flutter) from two European centres. In all patients, diagnostic and/or ablation catheters with a special sensor were used to perform the ablation procedures. All procedural data such as acute success, duration of the procedure, fluoroscopy time, and dose and patients' characteristics were analyzed and compared with conventionally ablated patients (n = 1865). Procedure-related complications during the hospital stay were recorded. A total of 24 consecutive patients were analyzed: no significant difference to the control group was seen in the baseline characteristics. The MediGuide patients were predominantly male (66%), aged 58 +/- 14 years and were ablated for 6 AVNRT (25%), 4 AVRT/WPW (17%), 1 EAT (4%), and 13 typical atrial flutter (54%). The acute success rate was 100% (98% in the control group, n.s.). The median fluoroscopy time was 0.5 +/- 1.4 min (10.2 +/- 9.6 in the control group, P < 0.001), the median fluoroscopy dose was 187 +/- 554 cGy cm2 (996 +/- 2593 cGy cm2, P < 0.05). Mean procedure time was 70 +/- 25 min (60 +/- 36 min, n.s.). No complications during the hospital stay were recorded.ConclusionIn several different forms of supraventricular tachycardias the MediGuide-Technology contributed to a dramatic reduction in irradiation exposure. With a median fluoroscopy time of 30 s all SVT cases were effectively performed with no complications; the fluoroscopy burden can be significantly reduced not only for the patient but also for the nurses and the physicians performing the case. The overall procedure times are not prolonged due to the use of MediGuide Technology compared with a control group of >1800 patients undergoing conventional ablation procedures.

Method(s): We inspected the results of 106 patients with the diagnoses of idiopathic neuralgia that treated with percutaneous radiofrequency trigeminal rhizotomy retrospectively. The scores of visual analog scale(VAS) were noted preoperative and postoperative periods at 1st, 3rd, 6th and 12th months and were used for statistical analysis. Result(s): Mean age of 106 patients was 67.31+/-8.85 years. Duration of symptoms was 19.1+/-13.1 months. Duration of symptoms did not change significantly according to gender (p=0.755), or site of trigeminal pain (p=0.158). There was not any statistical significance between gender, effected branch of trigemial nerve and side of the pain. Preoperative mean VAS score was 9.6+/-0.75. Postoperative mean VAS score values were 3.25+/-2.44 at first month, 3.23+/-2.43 at third months, 3.12+/-2.78 at sixth months and 2.59+/-3.18 at postoperative twelfth months. We found statistically significant difference between preoperative and postoperative 1st, 3rd, 6th and 12th months VAS scores (p<0.001). Conclusion(s): Percutaneous radiofrequency trigeminal rhizotomy is the minimally invasive treatment modality with lower complication rates and it has a high rate of efficacy when compared with invasive methods. It is most cost-effective procedure to choose if the pain recurs.Copyright Â© 2018, AVES Ibrahim KARA. All rights reserved.",Excluded

4124,"Therapeutic action of radioprotector indometofen The experiments on mice and dogs have shown the effectiveness of indomethofene administration after total acute radiation exposure. Introduction of indomethofene at doses of 15 and 30 mg/kg during time from 30 min to 3 days after irradiation resulted in reliable increase of mice survivability, 40-60% on average. Mice survival rate after single peroral introduction of indomethofene radioprotective doses was comparable with that resulting from referencing preparation estrofeme, which is estradiol oral dosage from (under the assumption that in contrast to indometafene estrofeme was introduced repeatedly every other day from 3 till 21 day after irradiation). Therapeutic action of indomethofene was confirmed in the experiments on dogs. After radiation exposure at a dose which caused the death of all dogs of control group, survival rate of experimental animals which received single oral dosage form of indomethofene at radioprotective dose in 1 and 3 days after irradiation was 40%.

4599,"Promising clinical outcomes of sequential and ""Sandwich"" chemotherapy and extended involved-field intensity-modulated radiotherapy in patients with stage IE/IIE extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma Background: The optimal treatment for the rare subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL), nasal-type, has not been clearly defined. The purpose of the study was to investigate the efficacy of sequential and ""Sandwich"" chemotherapy and extended involved-field intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in patients with stage IE/IIE extranodal ENKTL, nasal-type. Method(s): One hundred and fifty-five patients with stage IE/IIE nasal-type ENKTL were enrolled in the study, including 99 patients treated with sequential chemotherapy and extended involved-field IMRT (SCRT) and 56 patients with ""Sandwich"" chemotherapy and extended involved-field IMRT and chemotherapy (SCRCT). All patients were treated with extended involved-field IMRT with median dose of 54.6 Gy to the primary tumor and positive lymph nodes. Ninety-four patients had Ann Arbor stage IE disease, and 61 patients had stage IIE disease. Result(s): The 5-year rates of loco-regional recurrence (LRR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were 17.0%, 78.5%, and 84.7%, respectively. Univariate analysis revealed that EBV DNA copy after treatment (normal vs elevated level) was significant prognostic factor for LRR, PFS, and OS (P < 0.001); therapeutic method (SCRT vs SCRCT) was significant prognostic factor for PFS (71.0% vs 91.8%, P = 0.011), but there was no significant effect on 5-year LRR and OS (22.2% vs 8.2%, P = 0.051 for LRR; 80.9% vs 91.8%, P = 0.199 for OS). Conclusion(s): Compared with SCRT, SCRCT was significantly associated with higher PFS rates and showed a trend toward improved loco-regional control. EBV DNA copy after treatment is a good index for recurrence and prognosis for stage IE/IIE ENKTL patients.Copyright Â© 2018 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Excluded

3949,"Tuberculosis among migrant populations in sicily: A field report Background. In the EU, tuberculosis (TB) mainly affects vulnerable people, including migrants. From 2014 to 2017, we have estimated the frequency of both tuberculosis and latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) among the migrant population hosted in 41 reception centers in western Sicily (ITaCA network). Materials and Methods. All migrants were consecutively recruited for the screening of TB infection with physical examination and TST in 1,020 migrants and with IGRA in the others 2,690. The screening was carried out 4-8 weeks after landing in Sicily. For all migrants with a positive screening test, chest X-ray and smear examination were performed. LTBI was defined by positivity of TST or IGRA with negative X-ray chest, clinical, and smear examination. Active TB was defined by radiological and/or clinical and/or sputum positivity in a patient with a TST or IGRA positivity. Results. We evaluated a total of 3,710 migrants, of which 89% came from Sub-Saharan countries; 2,811 were males, 899 were females, with a median age of 22 years (IQR: 18-25). TB infection was diagnosed in 501 persons (13.5%) of which 440 (11.8%) had LTBI and 61 had active TB (1.6%): 1 had lymph node TB, 1 had intestinal TB, and 59 had pulmonary TB (38 sputum smear positive TB; no drug-resistant TB were observed).

We examined the association between citrus consumption and subsequent incident malignant melanoma among participants in the Nurses' Health Study (1984-2010) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1986-2010). Among 105,437 participants over 2 million person-years of follow-up, we documented 1857 incident melanomas. The pooled multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio for melanoma comparing the extreme total citrus consumption categories (1.5 or more serving per day vs. less than twice per week) was 1.30 (95 confidence interval [CI], 1.08 to 1.57) (P=0.003 for trend). Grapefruit and orange juice were two individual citrus products that showed significant associations with risk of melanoma.

4913,"The outcomes of one-stage treatment for multiple knee ligament injuries combined with extensor apparatus rupture Background: Multiple knee ligament injuries combined with extensor apparatus rupture are serious and complex knee injuries that are rare in clinical practice. The management is extremely challenging and controversial. The aim of this study is to describe a patient collective with multiple knee ligament injuries combined with extensor apparatus injuries in detail and to report the mid-term outcomes of a one-stage surgical treatment regarding subjective outcome scores, complications, knee instability, and ROM. Method(s): Eleven of 425 patients with multiple knee ligament injuries combined with extensor apparatus injuries admitted to our hospital were reviewed from July 2008 to May 2017. All patients underwent one-stage repair and reconstruction of multiple knee ligaments and extensor apparatus. The Lysholm knee score and the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score were adopted to evaluate the surgical effect preoperatively and at a minimum of 2 years' follow-up. Clinical data, including range of motion and knee stability, were also recorded at the final follow-up. Result(s): Ten patients were followed up with a mean time of 40 (range, 24-60) months. At the last follow-up, 8 patients had joint flexion range of motion greater than or equal to120 degrees, 2 patients had joint flexion range of motion of 100-120 degrees, and 1 patient had active knee extension limitation of 5 degrees. Stress radiographs showed that the mean differences in posterior displacement were reduced from 10.8 +/- 3.0 mm preoperatively to 2.0 +/- 2.5 mm at the last follow-up. There were significant improvements in stress radiographs from pre- to postoperative states for all patients with multiple knee ligament injuries. The Lysholm score ranged from 85 to 96, with a mean of 92.1 (compared with 33 before surgery, P < 0.05). The final IKDC scores were A in 2 patients (20%), B in 7 (70%), and C in 1 (10%). Nine of the 10 patients (90%) returned to their former activity level. Conclusion(s): Multiple knee ligament injuries combined with extensor apparatus rupture are rare.

3786,"Multilocus inheritance determines predisposition to alpha-radiation induced bone tumourigenesis in mice In a recent study, we presented evidence for genetic predisposition governing radiation osteosarcomagenesis in mice. Following the incorporation of the bone-seeking alpha emitter 227Th, approximately 25% of the variance in osteosarcoma incidence was determined by inherited genetic factors. We have now mapped 5 susceptibility loci in crosses between the more susceptible BALB/c and the more resistant CBA/Ca strains. The major QTL on chromosome 14 overlaps with a locus that was already found in our previous study, using different strains of mice. Here, we investigate the effect by which the major susceptibility locus and 4 minor modifier loci interact to influence osteosarcoma predisposition. Following incorporation of the bone-seeking isotope, 100% of mice that harbour high-risk genotypes at all 5 susceptibility loci develop osteosarcoma with an average of 472 days latency times. In 10 mice inheriting exclusively low-risk genotypes only 1 osteosarcoma was found, arising after 733 days latency time. Inheritance of distinct combinations of BALB/c and CBA/Ca alleles at the susceptibility loci confer more extreme phenotypes in terms of susceptibility or resistance than observed in either of the two parental inbred strains. From the present study, we demonstrate that additive effects of multiple alleles, each making only a minor phenotypic contribution, can combine and significantly alter tumour risk.

4731,"Identification of ERp29 as a biomarker for predicting nasopharyngeal carcinoma response to radiotherapy Radioresistance continues to be a major problem in the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). This study aimed to identify novel proteins associated with NPC radio-resistance. We used a mass spectrometry driven-proteomic strategy to identify novel proteins associated with NPC radio-resistance, and differential proteins were subsequently processed by bio-informatic analysis. As a result, twelve proteins were identified with aberrant expression in radioresistant (RR) NPC tissues compare to radiosensitive (RS) NPC tissues. Among these proteins, ERp29, Mn-SOD, HSP27 and GST omega1 were found to be significantly up-regulated in RR NPC tissues, and ERp29 was selected for further validation. Immunohistochemistry analysis confirmed that ERp29 was overexpressed in RR NPC tissues compared with RS NPC tissues. To prove the role of ERp29 in the induction of NPC radioresistance, ERp29 was down-regulated in the ERp29 enriched NPC cells CNE-1 and 6-10B by specific shRNA. Radiosensitivity was measured using cell proliferation assay and clonogenic survival assay, and cell apoptosis was measured using flow cytometric analysis. We found that ERp29 knockdown attenuated CNE-1 and 6-10B cell radioresistance and enhanced cell apoptosis. These results suggest that ERp29 associates with radioresistance in NPC, and ERp29 could be a potential biomarker for predicting NPC response to radiotherapy.",Included

In head and neck cancer (HNC) patients, long-term treatment-related complications include radiotherapy (RT)-induced carotid vasculopathy and stroke. The current study investigated the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics of the carotid wall in long-term HNC survivors treated with RT.Methods. MRI of the carotid arteries was performed within a prospective cohort of 42 HNC patients on average 7 years after RT. Two independent radiologists assessed maximal vessel wall thickness of common and internal carotid arteries. In case of wall thickening (>= 2 mm) the MRI signals as well as length of the thickened segment were assessed.Results. Mean (SD) age of the 42 patients at baseline was 53 (13) years and mean (SD) follow-up time after RT was 6.8 (1.3) years. In total 62% were men and 60% had one or more cerebrovascular risk factors. Mean (SD) dose of RT on the common carotid arteries and internal carotid arteries was 57 Gy (11) and 61 Gy (10), respectively. Wall thickening was observed in 58% of irradiated versus 27% of non-irradiated common carotid arteries and 24% of irradiated versus 6% of non-irradiated internal carotid arteries (p < 0.05). Mean (SD) thickness of the irradiated and non-irradiated common carotid arteries was 2.5 (0.9) and 2 (0.7) mm (p = 0.02). Mean thickness of the irradiated and non-irradiated internal carotid arteries was 1.8 (0.8) and 1.5 mm (0.3) (n.s.).

Subacute to subchronic (30-40 days) exposure resulted in a cumulative radiation dose of 1.2-1.6 Gy ( approximately 0.04 Gy/day). Mice were sampled prior to introduction into the enclosures and again after removal from the enclosures. Nucleotide variation (site heteroplasmy) in 306 pre-exposure Mtcyb gene copies (122400 base pairs) was compared to variation in 354 postexposure gene copies (141600 base pairs). Five mutant copies, each characterized by a single nucleotide substitution, were observed (four in the pre-exposure samples, one in a postexposure sample). The frequencies of mutant gene copies and nucleotide substitutions in pre-exposure and postexposure samples were not significantly different. This suggests that this type of exposure (i.e. low dose rate) does not pose a significant mutation risk to the Mtcyb gene in digit tissue. Furthermore, no significant radiation risk to analogous human tissues may exist when occupational exposures involve low dose rates such as these. Finally, linear, cumulative models of genetic risk currently used to estimate radiation-induced effects are likely to be inappropriate for low-dose-rate exposures and need to be re-evaluated critically.",Included

4623,"Value of lung perfusion in stage III non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with three dimensional conformal radiotherapy Objective: To investigate the value of lung perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scans in patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with three dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT). Method(s): Eight patients with stage III NSCLC who were candidated for 3DCRT were enrolled. All the patients had PET-CT scans and SPECT scans. The imagings were accurately co-registered in the planning system. The PET-CT images were used to define the gross tumor volume, and the SPECT images were used to define a volume of perfused ""functioning"" lung (FL). The planning objective was to minimize the dose to FL. Statistical analysis was made for the difference between the two sets of 3DCRT plans. Result(s): After 3DCRT was optimized, both the percentage of whole lung volume received dose >=xGy (WLVx) and the percentage of functional lung volume received dose >=xGy (FLVx) were decreased. However, the FLVx was decreased significantly. There were significant differences in WLV10, WLV15, WLV20, WLV25, WLV30 and FLV10, FLV15, FLV20, FLV25, FLV30 between before and after the 3DCRT was optimized (P=0.001, 0.002, 0.014, 0.046, 0.017 and 0.000, 0.000, 0.004, 0.027, 0.023).

4718,"Radioiodide (131I) therapy for the treatment of canine thyroid carcinoma OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of radioactive iodine treatment (131I) for canine thyroid carcinoma, as both the sole therapeutic modality and as an adjunct to surgery. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of case records from the Gladesville Veterinary Hospital Nuclear Medicine Service, Sydney, between August 1988 and December 2001. CASE DETAILS: The records of 65 dogs with thyroid carcinoma were analysed according to therapy and outcome. Forty-three dogs received radioiodide therapy, either as the sole therapeutic modality (32) or as an adjunct to surgery (11). Radioisotope therapy consisted of one to three doses of 131I with a dose range of 555 to 1850 MBq. For analysis, dogs were divided into groups according to therapy: no treatment, surgery alone, surgery with radioiodide therapy or radioiodide therapy alone. Mode of therapy, dosage of 131I, clinical staging and age were all independently analysed according to survival to compare efficacy or predictive value respectively. RESULT(S): When radioiodide therapy was used as an adjunct to surgery, median survival was 34 months. Censored median survival time for dogs that received radioiodide alone was 30 months. Dogs that did not receive treatment had a median survival of only 3 months. Log rank statistical analysis indicated that mode of therapy was significantly correlated with survival but that clinical stage of disease was not. CONCLUSION(S): The authors conclude that 131I therapy is effective at extending survival time, both as a sole therapeutic modality and as an adjunct to surgery, in dogs with invasive canine thyroid carcinoma. Incomplete surgical resection may not prolong survival in dogs also receiving 131I therapy, however surgical resection with curative intent should be recommended as the first line of therapy for mobile thyroid carcinomas. Radioisotope therapy can be recommended for cases where surgery alone is considered unlikely to be curative because of metastatic disease or local invasion, or for cases where surgery has been attempted but complete surgical removal has not been achieved.",Excluded
4902,"Efficacy and safety of intensity-modulated radiotherapy following transarterial chemoembolization in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy in combination with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has been beneficial in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). There have been few clinical reports on the use of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in combination with TACE for these patients. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy and toxicity of IMRT following TACE in unresectable HCC. The medical records of consecutive patients with unresectable HCC, who underwent IMRT following TACE from January 2009 to June 2014, were retrospectively reviewed in order to assess the overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), tumor response, and treatment-associated toxicity. A total of 64 lesions in 54 patients were included in the analysis. IMRT was delivered at a median dose of 50 Gy (range 44-70 Gy) at 1.8 to 2.0 Gy per fraction. The overall response rate was achieved in 64.8% of patients with complete response in 20.4% of patients at 3 months after completion of IMRT. The median OS was 20.2 months (95% CI=8.6-31.9), and the actuarial 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS rates were 84.6%, 49.7%, and 36.7%, respectively. The median PFS was 10.5 months (95% CI=7.3-13.7) and the 1-, 2-, and 3-year PFS rates were 44.2%, 23.4%, and 14.6%, respectively. The responders had a significantly higher OS rate than the nonresponders (3-year OS 48.0% vs 14.4%, P=0.001). During and the first month following IMRT, 10 (18.5%) patients developed grade 3 hematological toxicity, and 3 (5.6%) developed grade 3 hepatic toxicity. No patient experienced grade 4 or 5 toxicity. Radiation-induced liver disease was not observed. Our findings suggest that IMRT following TACE could be a favorable treatment option for both its safety profile and clinical benefit in patients with unresectable HCC.Copyright Â© 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",Excluded

Patients in the CAIR group received radiotherapy (RT) with 2 Gy/fraction per day at 7 d/wk with a total dose of 50-70 Gy (average dose 64.2 Gy). The overall time of irradiation was 3.6-5.0 wk (average 4.6 wk). RT in the CR group was 2 Gy/fraction per day at 5 d/wk with a total dose of 40-70 Gy (average dose 61.7 Gy). The overall time of irradiation was 4.0-7.0 wk (average 6.4 wk)., RESULTS: The data showed that the immediate tumor response to RT was better in the CAIR group than in the CR group. Efficiency rates (CR plus PR) were 82.8% (24/29) and 58.6% (17/29), respectively (P = 0.047). In both groups the incidences of esophagitis and tracheitis were insignificant (P = 0.376, 0.959), and no patient received toxicity that could not be tolerated., CONCLUSION: CAIR shortens overall treatment time and is well tolerated by patients. It may be superior to CR in enhancing the local response of tumor, but its remote effect for esophageal carcinoma awaits further follow-up.",Excluded

Method(s): Included in the study were 19 patients (4 men, 15 women) with intracranial meningioma remnants who received hypofractionated high-energy proton beam treatment. Patients were examined with 11C-l-methionine PET and MRI prior to treatment and after 6 months, and 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10 years. Temporal changes in methionine uptake ratio, meningioma volume, meningioma regrowth and clinical symptoms throughout the follow-up period were evaluated. Result(s): In 17 patients the tumour volume was unchanged throughout the follow-up. The methionine uptake ratio on PET decreased over the years in most patients. In two patients the tumour remnant showed progression on MRI. In these patients, prior to the volume increase on MRI, the methionine uptake ratio increased. One patient experienced transient clinical symptoms and showed radiological evidence of a radiation-induced reaction close to the irradiated field. Conclusion(s): Proton beam treatment is a safe and effective treatment for achieving long-term growth arrest in meningioma remnants. Follow-up with 11C-l-methionine PET may be a valuable adjunct to, but not a replacement for, standard radiological follow-up.Copyright Â© 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
4949,"Histopathological examination of spine tumors after treatment with radiosurgery OBJECTIVE Increased survival time after diagnosis of neoplastic disease has resulted in a gradual increase in spine tumor incidence. Radiosurgery is frequently a viable alternative to operative management in a population with severe medical comorbidities. The authors sought to assess the histopathological consequences of radiosurgery in the subset of patients progressing to operative intervention. METHODS Eighteen patients who underwent radiosurgery for spine tumors between 2008 and 2014 subsequently progressed to surgical treatment. A histopathological examination of these cases was performed. Indications for surgery included symptomatic compression fractures, radiographic instability, and symptoms of cord or cauda equina compression. Biopsy samples were obtained from the tumor within the radiosurgical zone in all cases and were permanently fixated. Viable tumor samples were stained for Ki 67. RESULTS Fifteen patients had metastatic lesions and 3 patients had neurofibromas. The mean patient age was 57 years. The operative indication was symptomatic compression in 10 cases (67%). The most frequent metastatic lesions were breast cancer (4 cases), renal cell carcinoma (3), prostate cancer (2), and endometrial cancer (2). In 9 (60%) of the 15 metastatic cases, histological examination of the lesions showed minimal evidence of inflammation. Viable tumor at the margins of the radiosurgery was seen in 9 (60%) of the metastatic cases. Necrosis in the tumor bed was frequent, as was fibrotic bone marrow. Vascular ectasia was seen in 2 of 15 metastatic cases, but sclerosis with ectasia was frequent. No evidence of malignant conversion was seen in the periphery of the lesions in the 3 neurofibroma cases. In 1 case of neurofibroma, the lesion demonstrated some small areas of remnant tumor in the radiosurgical target zone. CONCLUSIONS This case series demonstrates important histopathological characteristics of spinal lesions treated by SRS. Regions with the highest exposure to radiation appear to be densely necrotic and show little evidence of tumor growth, whereas peripheral regions distant from the radiation dosage are more likely to demonstrate viable tumor in malignant and benign neoplasms. Physiological tissue appears to be similarly affected. With additional investigation, a more homogenized field of hypofractionated radiation exposure may allow for tumor obliteration with relative preservation of critical anatomical structures.",Excluded

3730,"Reliability and validity of a telephone questionnaire for estimating lifetime personal sun exposure in epidemiologic studies Our Australia-wide case-control study of ocular melanoma diagnosed in 1996 to 1997 needed a short telephone interview on sun exposure. We constructed one by examining data from 700 controls ages 40 to 64 years in the Geraldton Skin Cancer Survey in 1988; they had answered a ""whole-of-life"" questionnaire in a face-to-face interview. Sun exposure in their first 4 decade years of age best predicted their lifetime annual average sun exposure, so the shortened questionnaire asked about sun exposure in these 4 decade years only. Retesting 60 participants 1 year later with the whole-of-life questionnaire gave an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.65 (95% confidence interval, 0.48-0.78) for ranked total sun exposure between the two interviews; the intraclass correlation coefficient was higher in men (0.73) than in women (0.54). Correlations were also high between parallel measurements of sun exposure on working days in the decade years and in outdoor occupations throughout life in the telephone interview of the ocular melanoma study (Spearman's R = 0.75) and in another study of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (R = 0.71). Agreement between simultaneous parallel measures of total exposure (nonworking + working day and recreational + occupational exposure) was slightly weaker and of nonworking day and recreational exposure much weaker. Occupational exposure in women was much less strongly correlated with total exposure than it was in men possibly because of their frequently combined work and family roles, which the questionnaires did not try to separate. Research is needed into how this might be done to improve sun exposure measurement in women.",Excluded
4557,"Determination of crystallinity and crystal structure of Hylamer polyethylene after in vivo wear Hylamer polyethylene is a crystalline form of polyethylene of 70% crystallinity whereas conventional polyethylene (PE) has 50% crystallinity. Crystallinity is the percentage by weight of the crystalline phase present in the whole polymer, which comprises both amorphous and crystalline phases.Clinical experience has shown that Hylamer components used in joint prostheses, if sterilized by gamma rays in the presence of oxygen, are easily affected by wear, which leads to osteolysis. The authors have analyzed the crystallinity of polyethylene liners removed from seven patients who had received Hylamer polyethylene implants sterilized by gamma rays in air and had suffered prosthetic loosening, using Raman spectroscopy coupled with partial least squares (PLS) analysis. The results have been compared to those of two controls who had received Hylamer polyethylene implants sterilized by gamma irradiation in a nitrogen atmosphere. The crystal structure of wear particles released into the tissues from the Hylamer liners sterilized by gamma rays in air is also studied. The materials undergoing two different types of sterilization methods show different crystallinity values (71.50 vs. 69.43), but the crystallinity do not change according to wear (worn and unworn liner region). Both monoclinic and orthorhombic phases are present in the liner, while in wear debris prevalently monoclinic crystals are found in both types of sterilized liners. Different crystallinity rates can explain different wear rates observed in vivo.",Excluded
4590,"Implications for preserving neural stem cells in whole brain radiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation: A review of 2270 metastases in 488 patients This study delineated the incidence of metastatic involvement of neural stem cell (NSC) regions and further aimed to explore the feasibility of selectively sparing the NSC compartments during whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). A total of 2270 intracranial metastases in 488 patients were identified. Lesions were classified according to locations, including lesions in the NSC compartments (subventricular zone, SVZ, or hippocampus) and those in the rest of the brain/brainstem. The incidence of involvement of NSC regions was compared between oligometastatic patients (those with 14 lesions) and non-oligometastatic patients (those with 5 or more lesions) using a chi-square test. The volume of the NSC regions accounted for 2.23% of the whole brain, and the overall rate of metastatic lesions in NSC regions was 1.1% in 2270 metastases (25/2270), and 4.7% in 488 patients (23/488). Of the NSC region metastases, 7 (0.3%) involved the hippocampus and 18 (0.8%) occurred in the SVZ. Among the 7 hippocampal metastases identified in this study, 1/7 (14.3%) were found in oligometastatic patients, while 6/7 (85.7%) metastases were in non-oligometastatic patients. For metastases in the SVZ, all lesions occurred in non-oligometastatic patients with none in oligometastatic patients. Metastatic involvement of the NSC compartments was significantly lower in oligometastatic patients (0.15%, 1/670) than in non-oligometastatic patients (1.5%, 24/1600) (P < 0.001). Our retrospective review of 2270 metastases in 488 patients is that the volume of the compartments of NSC regions was 2.23% relative to the whole brain, but the incidence of involvement of the NSC compartments was 1.1%, and the vast majority of NSC lesions were found in nonoligometastatic patients. We believe our data supports selective reduction of doses for these aforementioned structures, when treating oligometastatic patients with WBRT and locally advanced-stage small-cell lung cancer patients with PCI.

It has been postulated that, in the short term, this immunosuppression prevents autoimmune responses to ultraviolet-radiation damaged skin. Patients with polymorphic light eruption (PLE) demonstrate abnormal responses to ultraviolet-radiation suggestive of an immune response to an ultraviolet-radiation-induced antigen. We investigated whether PLE patients (n=22) were resistant to ultraviolet-radiation-induced immunosuppression compared to skin-type, aged-matched controls (n=23). Groups of patients and controls (six subjects per group) received a single dose of solar-simulated ultraviolet-radiation of either 0, 0.6, 1 or 2 minimal erythema doses (MED). Erythema was quantified using a reflectance meter and all volunteers were sensitised on the irradiated site with dinitrochlorobenzene. Contact hypersensitivity responses (CHS) to dinitrochlorobenzene were quantified after challenge using ultrasound. Ultraviolet-radiation-induced erythema was comparable in patients and controls. CHS was comparable in unirradiated patients and controls. UVR-induced a dose-dependent suppression of CHS in all volunteers but patients were more resistant to immunosuppression after 1MED. Exposure to 1MED suppressed CHS by 78% in controls but induced less suppression in patients (44%, p < 0.01).

4103,"Subsequent cooling-circulation after radiofrequency and microwave ablation avoids secondary indirect damage induced by residual thermal energy PURPOSE We aimed to investigate the exact role of residual thermal energy following microwave ablation (MWA) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) at the final ablation and transition zones and determine whether residual thermal energy could be dissipated by subsequent cooling-circulation. METHODS In an ex vivo study, MWA and RFA were performed on fresh porcine liver, and central and border temperatures were compared. In an in vivo study, MWA and RFA were performed to the livers of New Zealand white rabbits. Tissue samples were stained with alpha-NADH-diaphorase. The coagulation zones (NADH-negative) and transition zones (lightly NADH-stained) of different groups were compared at different time points. RESULTS In the ex vivo model, the residual thermal energy after MWA and RFA could be dispersed by subsequent cooling-circulation due to the temperature decreasing rapidly. In the in vivo study, the coagulation volume in the ablation group was larger than that in the cooling-circulation group (P < 0.05) 2 days after ablation. In the ablation group, the damaged zone (the transition zone plus the coagulation zone) on alpha-NADH-diaphorase-stained images increased rapidly within 2 hours after ablation and slowly reached the maximum on day 2. However, the damaged zones did not change significantly at the three time points observed in the cooling-circulation group. CONCLUSION The residual thermal energy in MWA and RFA induced secondary damage beyond the direct coagulation zone, and it could be dissipated by subsequent cooling-circulation, contributing to smaller ablation and transition zones.Copyright Â© Turkish Society of Radiology 2019.",Excluded

We aimed to examine the association between pancreatic cancer and markers of exposure to solar UVR, namely skin type, treatment of skin lesions, ambient UVR and time outdoors on work days. Method(s): We used data from an Australian case-control study. Location at birth, residential location during adulthood, outdoors work, history of skin lesion treatment and sensitivity of the skin to the sun were obtained by questionnaire. We limited the analyses to Caucasians who answered the questionnaire about UVR (controls = 589/711 recruited; cases = 496/705 recruited). We used NASA's Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer to estimate ambient UVR. Result(s): Being born in or living in areas of higher ambient UVR (compared to lower ambient UVR) was associated with about 30-40% lower risk of pancreatic cancer. People with fair skin colour had 47% lower risk of pancreatic cancer than those with dark skin colour (95% CI 0.37-0.75). There was some suggestion of increased risk with increased average number of hours spent outside at work. Conclusion(s): This study suggests that people with light skin colour or those born or living in areas of high ambient UVR have lower risk of pancreatic cancer. Our analysis supports an association between UVR and pancreatic cancer, possibly mediated through production of vitamin D. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Excluded

4451,"Heavy ion radiotherapy in lung cancer (Introduction) In radiotherapy of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), carbon ion beams offer improved dose distributions as compared to photon beams and thus enable dose escalation within a target while sparing the surrounding normal tissues. Furthermore, carbon ions being heavier than protons provide a higher biological effectiveness, which increases with depth, reaching the maximum at the end of the range. At the National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS), clinical research on carbon ion radiotherapy (C-ion RT) was started in 1994 using carbon-ions generated by Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC). So far, almost 6,000 patients have been treated, where the benefit of C-ion RT over other modalities has been demonstrated in terms of high local control rates and a significant reduction in overall treatment time with acceptable toxicities in most cases. In this paper, the results of treatment for Stage I NSCLC using 9 and 4 fractions are reviewed, as well as preliminary results of single fraction treatment is described. Also, results of other RT reported in the literatures are compared. (Methods and materials) Stage I lung cancer is divided into two types depending on tumor location: peripheral-type and central-type. This classification is made on the assumption that the two types may tolerate radiation differently. Therefore, different fractionation regimens were investigated for each type. The patients eligible for either treatment are those for whom surgery was not indicated due to medical reasons or refusal. From 1999 to 2003, a total of 131 tumors in129 patients received C-ion RT with 9 fractions and 4 fractions, including 94 males and 37 females with an average age of 74.5 years. Out of the 131 foci, there were 72 T1 tumors and 59 T2 tumors. There were 85 adenocarcinomas, 43 epidermoid cancers and 3 other types. Regarding dose fractionations, 51 cases were treated with 72.0GyE/9 fractions, and 80 cases were treated with 52.8GyE/4fr for stage IA and 60.0GyE/4fr for stage IB. Since 2003, a doseescalation study using single fraction treatment has been conducted for peripheral-type NSCLC. The initial dose was 28.0 GyE, which was then escalated at increments of 5%. At each dose level, about 10 to 30 patients were registered for evaluation of toxicity and local control with carbon ions. C-ion RT has also been applied to locally advanced lung cancers and hilar-type cancers, and case studies are being accumulated. The locally advanced lung cancers included Pancoast tumors and mediastinal-type tumors in stages II-IIIA. (Results) All of the patients treated with 9 fractions/3 weeks (50 patients) and 4 fractions/1 week (79 patients) developed no evidence of severe toxicities. The 5-year local control rates were 98.6% for stage-IA cases and 89.7% for stage- IB cases, and the 5-year survival rates were 63.1% for stage-IA cases and 50.0% for stage-IB cases. In single fraction treatment, a total of 218 patients have been registered, in which the total dose has been escalated from 28.0 to 48.0 GyE. So far, no serious adverse events have been observed, and local control appears to be improving with increasing total dose. For skin reactions, six grade 2 toxicity (3.3%) but no grade 3 or higher was observed. For radiation pneumonitis, only one grade 1 was reported, and no toxicities greater than grade 2 occurred. The overall local control rate was 91.8%, and the causespeci fic survival rate at 5-years was 71.8%. The superficial lesions arising at the hilar region have been successfully treated with acceptable toxicities. Similarly, in the preoperative radiotherapy for patients with chest wall invasion, high anti-tumor effect was confirmed in the pathological findings after the lung was surgically removed. (Discussion) Only at NIRS, Japan, NSCLC has been treated with carbon ions. For peripheral tumor, we have been conducting clinical studies to establish a short-course, hypo-fractionated radiotherapy. We first performed a dose-escalation study using 18 fractions/6 weeks. The number of fractions and treatment times were subsequently reduced to 9 fractions over 3 weeks, 4 fractions over one week, and eventually to a single fraction treatment. The preliminary data suggested favorable local control and very few toxic reactions with a median follow up time of about 16 months. Compared with pulmonary damage reported for stereotactic radiotherapy in stage I lung cancer, the incidence and severity in our patients seemed to be remarkably low. The decreased adverse effects on the lung are likely achieved due to the small volume irradiated. When comparing proton vs C-ion RT, local control results are comparable for T1 tumors, but for T2 tumors 2-5 year local control rates are higher in C-ion RT. It is of note that in most reported data for proton therapy, follow-up periods are short relative to the time required for full evaluation of TCP, late NTCP and survival. Considering that the average age of the patients receiving C-ion RT was about 75 years, about 10 years older than that of 65 years in the operated patients, the results of C-ion RT for stage-I lung cancer may be comparable to surgical results. Thus, the single-fraction irradiation method may be described as the ultimate type of treatment using carbon ion, and would be a valid alternative to surgery, especially for elderly and inoperable patients.",Excluded

Methods and Materials: Between 2004 and 2009, we performed airway stenting followed by EBRT in 43 patients for symptomatic primary lung cancer (n = 31) or other thoracic malignancies (n = 12). The median time interval between stent placement and first irradiation was 14 days. A median total dose of 50 Gy was delivered. Sixty-seven percent of the patients had reduced performance status (Karnofsky performance score, <=70). Result(s): EBRT had to be stopped prematurely in 16 patients (37%), at a median total dose of 17 Gy, for various reasons. In this group of patients, the survival was poor, with a median overall survival (OS) of only 21 days. Twenty-seven patients (63%) completed radiotherapy as planned, with a median OS of 8.4 months. Fourteen of 43 patients (33%) developed at least one Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event of grade 3 to 5. The most common event was a malignant restenosis of the stent leading to asphyxia (n = 7), followed by fistula formation (n = 4), necrosis (n = 3), mediastinitis with abscess (n = 1), secondary nonmalignant airway stenosis (n = 1), and hemoptysis (n = 1). With the exception of one event, all events were associated with a local progression of the tumor. Conclusion(s): Although the long-term prognosis for patients with malignant airway obstruction is poor, airway stenting combined with EBRT offers a possible therapeutic option, achieving fast relief of acute respiratory distress with an associated antitumor effect, resulting in a potential survival benefit. However, due to local advanced tumor growth, increased rates of adverse events are to be expected, necessitating careful monitoring. Â© 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

We retrospectively analyzed the efficacy and safety of immediate three-fraction electron radiotherapy after operation for resistant earlobe keloids. From 2011 to 2017, three-fraction electron radiotherapy with single dose of 5 Gy was given postoperatively to 23 patients with 30 keloids in our hospital. The first fraction of adjuvant radiotherapy was administered within 2 h of surgery, and the other two sessions were completed within the next day or two. Five (16.7%) primary keloids and 25 (83.3%) recurrent keloids were examined in this study. The primary endpoint was the local control rate, which was 86.7% after a median follow-up of 26 months (14-93 months). Secondary endpoints were acute and late procedure-related complications, and no severe complications were observed after combination therapy. Our results suggest that three-fraction electron radiotherapy after excision within 2 days of surgery is a safe and effective protocol for the prevention of earlobe keloid recurrence that can also improve patient compliance and comfort.Copyright Â© 2019, The Author(s).",Excluded
4804,"Impact of Radiation Dose on Survival for Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Treated With Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy Purpose: Radiation dose used in the neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) for patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) varies in different trials and clinical practice. Methods and Materials: Data from patients diagnosed with ESCC receiving NCRT followed by esophagectomy were retrospectively collected from February 2013 to December 2017. Lower dose (LD) radiotherapy was defined as <=45 Gy, and >45 Gy was considered as higher dose (HD). Survival rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with long-rank test. Multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify variables associated with survival. Result(s): A total of 118 patients treated with NCRT were included in our analysis: 62 patients received LD radiotherapy, and 56 patients received HD radiotherapy. The median follow-up time was 24.3 months (0.67-65.3 m). Two-years overall survival (OS) rates were 75.0 and 79.0% in HD and LD group, respectively (P = 0.360), and complete pathological remission (pCR) rates in two groups were 42.9 and 30.6%, respectively (P = 0.17). The incidences of toxic effects including post-operative complications were not significantly different between two groups. Multivariate analysis showed that tumor T stage, M1a disease, smoking history, and pCR rate were significantly associated with OS. Conclusion(s): In ESCC patients treated with NCRT followed by surgery, higher radiation dose was not significantly associated with a higher pCR rate and longer survival. Lower radiation dose might be a preferable time-dose fraction scheme. Our finding needs to be further validated by randomized trials.Â© Copyright Â© 2020 Yang, Xu, Zhou, Bao, Zhang, Gu, Du, Chen and Qiu.",Excluded
4376,"Evaluation of S100B in the diagnosis of suspected intracranial hemorrhage after minor head injury in patients who are receiving platelet aggregation inhibitors and in patients 65 years of age and older OBJECT: Cranial CT (CCT) scans and hospital admission are increasingly performed to rule out intracranial hemorrhage in patients after minor head injury (MHI), particularly in older patients and in those receiving antiplatelet therapy. This leads to high radiation exposure and a growing financial burden. The aim of this study was to determine whether the astroglial-derived protein S100B that is released into blood can be used as a reliable negative predictive tool for intracranial bleeding in patients after MHI, when they are older than 65 years or being treated with antiplatelet drugs (low-dose aspirin, clopidogrel)., METHODS: The authors conducted a prospective observational study in 2 trauma hospitals. A total of 782 patients with MHI (Glasgow Coma Scale Score 13-15) who were on medication with platelet aggregation inhibitors (PAIs) or were age 65 years and older, independent of antiplatelet therapy, were included. Clinical examination, bloodwork, observation, and CCT were performed in the traumatology emergency departments. When necessary, patients were admitted and observation took place on the ward; in these patients, CCT was performed during their hospital stay. Patients with severe trauma, focal neurological deficits, posttraumatic seizures, anticoagulant therapy, alcohol intoxication, coagulation disorder, blood sampling more than 3 hours after trauma, and unknown time of the trauma were excluded from the study. The median age of the patients was 83 years, and 69% were female. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of S100B with reference to CCT findings were calculated. The cutoff of S100B was set at 0.105 mug/L., RESULTS: Of the 782 patients, 50 (6.4%) had intracranial bleeding. One patient with positive results on CCT scan showed an S100B level below 0.105 mug/L. Of all patients, 33.1% were below the cutoff. S100B showed a sensitivity of 98.0% (CI 89.5%-99.7%), a negative predictive value of 99.6% (CI 97.9%-99.9%), a specificity of 35.3% (CI 31.9%- 38.8%), and a positive predictive value of 9.4% (CI 7.2%-12.2%)., CONCLUSIONS: Levels of S100B below 0.105 mug/L can accurately predict normal CCT findings after MHI in older patients and in those treated with PAIs. Combining conventional decision criteria with measurement of S100B can reduce the CCT scan and hospital admission rates by approximately 30%.",Excluded
3834,"Residential radon and lung cancer in Sweden: risk analysis accounting for random error in the exposure assessment A large epidemiologic study on residential radon exposure and lung cancer has been conducted in Sweden. An attempt is now made to quantify the impact of random error in the exposure assessment on the risk estimate for lung cancer in this study. The study included 1,360 lung cancer cases, diagnosed from 1980 to 1984, and 2,847 population controls. Radon measurements were performed in 8,992 dwellings occupied by the study subjects some time since 1947. Questionnaires provided information on smoking and other risk factors. Imprecision in the retrospective exposure assessment for radon was estimated from a Monte Carlo technique modeling Swedish conditions. Adjusted risk estimates were obtained from regression analyses based on expected values for true time-weighted average residential radon concentration (TWA), conditional on observed TWA. Without adjustment for random error in the TWA estimates, the linear excess relative risk coefficient was 0.10 per 100 Bq m(-3), but an excess relative risk of about 0.15 to 0.20 per 100 Bq m(-3) was suggested following adjustment. The potentially significant consequences of errors in the retrospective radon exposure assessment should be taken into consideration in the risk estimation as well as in comparisons of results of different studies and in future pooled analyses.",Excluded
4769,"Incidence of dementia among atomic-bomb survivors--Radiation Effects Research Foundation Adult Health Study Radiotherapy has been reported to cause neuropsychological dysfunction. Here we examined whether exposure to atomic bomb radiation affected the incidence of dementia among 2286 atomic bomb survivors and controls - all members of the Adult Health Study cohort. Study subjects were non-demented and aged >or=60 years at baseline examination and had been exposed in 1945 at >or=13 years of age to a relatively low dose (<or=4 Gy), compared with total dose from radiotherapy. Dementia diagnoses were made during biennial health examinations with a two-phase procedure. DSM IV criteria were used for diagnosing dementia, NINCDS-ADRDA for Alzheimer disease, and NINDS-AIREN for vascular disease. To estimate the effect of radiation on the dementia incidence rate, we applied Poisson regression analysis. Incidence per 1000 person-years was 16.3 in the <5 mGy group, 17.0 in the 5-499 mGy group, and 15.2 in the >or=500 mGy group. Alzheimer disease was the predominant type of dementia in each dose category. After adjustment for potential risk factors, radiation exposure did not affect the incidence rate of either all dementia or any of its subtypes. No case of dementia had a history of therapeutic cranial irradiation. Although we found no relationship between radiation exposure and the development of dementia among atomic bomb survivors exposed at >or=13 years old in this longitudinal study, effects on increased risk of early death among atomic bomb survivors will be considered.",Included
4894,"Pretreatment MRI radiomics analysis allows for reliable prediction of local recurrence in non-metastatic T4 nasopharyngeal carcinoma Background: To identify a radiomics signature to predict local recurrence in patients with non-metastatic T4 nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Method(s): A total of 737 patients from Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (training cohort: n = 360; internal validation cohort: n = 120)and Wuzhou Red Cross Hospital (external validation cohort: n = 257)underwent feature extraction from the largest axial area of the tumor on pretreatment magnetic resonance imaging scans. Feature selection was based on the prognostic performance and feature stability in the training cohort. Radscores were generated using the Cox proportional hazards regression model with the selected features in the training cohort and then validated in the internal and external validation cohorts. We also constructed a nomogram for predicting local recurrence-free survival (LRFS). Finding(s): Eleven features were selected to construct the Radscore, which was significantly associated with LRFS. For the training, internal validation, and external validation cohorts, the Radscore (C-index: 0.741 vs. 0.753 vs. 0.730)outperformed clinical prognostic variables (C-index for primary gross tumor volume: 0.665 vs. 0.672 vs. 0.577; C-index for age: 0.571 vs. 0.629 vs. 0.605)in predicting LRFS. The generated radiomics nomogram, which integrated the Radscore and clinical variables, exhibited a satisfactory prediction performance (C-index: 0.810 vs. 0.807 vs. 0.753). The nomogram-defined high-risk group had a shorter LRFS than did the low-risk group (5-year LRFS: 73.6% vs. 95.3%, P <.001; 79.6% vs 95.8%, P =.006; 85.7% vs 96.7%, P =.005). Interpretation(s): The Radscore can reliably predict LRFS in patients with non-metastatic T4 NPC, which might guide individual treatment decisions.

3842,"A Serum Small Molecule Biosignature of Radiation Exposure from Total Body Irradiated Patients The potential for radiological accidents and nuclear terrorism has increased the need for the development of new rapid biodosimetry methods. In addition, in a clinical setting the issue of an individual's radiosensitivity should be taken into consideration during radiotherapy. We utilized metabolomics and lipidomics to investigate changes of metabolites in serum samples following exposure to total body ionizing radiation in humans. Serum was collected prior to irradiation, at 3-8 h after a single dose of 1.25-2 Gy, and at 24 h with a total delivered dose of 2-3.75 Gy. Metabolomics revealed perturbations in glycerophosphocholine, phenylalanine, ubiquinone Q2, and oxalic acid. Alterations were observed in circulating levels of lipids from monoacylglycerol, triacylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylglycerol lipid classes. Polyunsaturated fatty acids were some of the most dysregulated lipids, with increased levels linked to proinflammatory processes. A targeted metabolomics approach for eicosanoids was also employed. The results showed a rapid response for proinflammatory eicosanoids, with a dampening of the signal at the later time point. Sex differences were observed in the markers from the untargeted approach but not the targeted method. The ability to identify and quantify small molecules in blood can therefore be utilized to monitor radiation exposure in human populations.",Included
4260,"The Relationship between Media Consumption and Health-Related Anxieties after the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Disaster Background:The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster caused a global panic by a release of harmful radionuclides. In a disaster setting, misusage of contemporary media sources available today can lead to disseminated incorrect information and panic. The study aims to build a scale which examines associations between media and individual anxieties, and to propose effective media usages for future disaster management. Method(s):The University of Tokyo collaborated with the Fukushima local government to conduct a radiation-health-seminar for a total of 1560 residents, at 12 different locations in Fukushima. A 13 item questionnaire collected once before and after a radiation-seminar was used on factor analysis to develop sub-scales for multiple regression models, to determine relationships between the sub-scales and media type consumed. A paired t-test was used to examine any changes in sub-scale of pre- and post-seminar scores. Result(s):Three sub-scales were revealed and were associated with different media types: was with rumors, while concern for the future was positively associated with regional-newspapers and negatively with national-newspapers. Anxiety about social-disruption was associated with radio. The seminar had a significant effect on anxiety reduction for all the three sub-scales. Conclusion(s):Different media types were associated with various heightened concerns, and that a radiation seminar was helpful to reduce anxieties in the post-disaster setting. By tailoring post-disaster messages via specific media types, i.e., radio, it may be possible to effectively convey important information, as well as to calm fears about particular elements of post-disaster recovery and to combat rumors.

4011,"Reduction of radiation exposure during ablation of atrial fibrillation AIMS: Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) during ablation of atrial fibrillation (Afib) may be associated with long fluoroscopy duration. Although most current publications report on fluoroscopy time (FT), the dose-area product (DAP) may be a more valuable parameter for depicting radiation exposure. The aim of our study was to describe a method to reduce DAP by simple means during ablation of Afib., METHODS: Patients undergoing Afib ablation using a three-dimensional (3D) mapping system were assigned to two fluoroscopy protocols: (1) standard settings with 7.5 pictures/s and collimation to the heart, fluoroscopy as needed for the convenience of the operator (standard group, SG); and (2) strict collimation to the left atrium, a frame rate of 4 pictures/s, shortened pulmonary vein angiography sequences, and maximal orientation by the 3D mapping system (redDAP group). The primary endpoint was DAP., RESULTS: The study comprised 206 patients, who were assigned to the SG (n = 101, 49 %) or to the redDAP group (n = 105, 51 %). Mean FT was significantly reduced from 29.9 +/- 11.3 min (SG) to 13.3 +/- 8.3 min (redDAP group); mean DAP was reduced by approximately 90 % from 8,690 +/- 5,727 to 837 +/- 647 cGycm(2). The groups did not differ significantly in body mass index (28.8 +/- 4.1 vs. 29.0 +/- 5.0). PVI could be achieved in 98 of 101 patients (97 %) from the SG group and in all patients (100 %) from the redDAP group. Procedure time was significantly longer in the redDAP group (160.9 +/- 35.7 vs. 138.1 +/- 34.3 min)., CONCLUSION: Radiation exposure during Afib ablation procedures can be reduced with simple means by strict collimation to the left atrium, a frame rate of 4 pictures/s, shortened pulmonary vein angiography sequences, and maximal 3D orientation.",Excluded
3734,"Pleomorphic adenomas: post-operative radiotherapy is unnecessary following primary incomplete excision: a retrospective review BACKGROUND: Current standard treatment of Pleomorphic Salivary Adenoma (PSA) of the Parotid Gland is by surgical excision. The management of incomplete excision remains undecided with post-operative radiotherapy advocated by some and observation by others., METHODS: 190 patients who underwent resection of PSA of the parotid gland within the West of Scotland region from 1981 to 2008 were identified and data collected., RESULTS: 78/190 patients had a primary incomplete excision. 25/78 received post-operative radiotherapy and 53 were observed. Recurrences occurred in 11/53 in those observed and in 1/25 of those who received radiotherapy. 21/25 complained of significant side effects from the radiotherapy. 38 surgeons performed 190 procedures, with a range of experience from 1 to28 procedures., CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy does appear to reduce recurrence with incomplete excision, however it is associated with significant side effects. We therefore feel radiotherapy should not be routinely recommended. Subspecialisation should be adopted to increase the operating surgeon's experience.

3993,"The secondary sex ratio in Italy over the past eighty years (1940 to 2019) and potential impact of radiological contamination after atmospheric nuclear testing and after Chernobyl: Temporal change-point analysis using Markov Chain Monte Carlo In Europe, the male to female ratio at birth (secondary sex ratio: SSR; sex odds: SO) is 1.04-1.06, is influenced by many factors and is declining in industrialized countries. This study was carried out to identify possible impacts of fallout by atomic bomb tests or by the Chernobyl event on SSR in Italy. Italy is a country without commercial nuclear power generation for the last four decades and thus nearly free of radiological confounders. Counts of annual male and female live births in Italy are provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) and by the Italian Istituto Nazionale di Statistica (ISTAT). This study included 57.7 million live births (1940-2019) with overall SSR 1.05829. The Italian SSR trend was modelled with linear and non-linear logistic regression. Trend changes, i.e., periods with level shifts were estimated with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Two distinct idealized level shifts were identified superimposed on a uniform secular downward trend. The first one is seen towards the end of the 1960s with a jump sex odds ratio (SOR) 1.00681, p < 0.0001. The second one occurred in 1987 with SOR 1.00474, p < 0.0001. In each of the 3 periods separated by the two jumps, SSR uniformly decreased with trend SOR per 100 years of 0.98549, p < 0.0001. In conclusion, the secular trend in the Italian SSR showed two marked level shifts, at the end of the 1960s and from 1987 onward. These follow the release of radioactivity by atmospheric atomic bomb tests during the 1960s and by Chernobyl in 1986 and corroborate the hypothesis that ionizing radiation increases SSR.Copyright Â© 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

This cross-sectional study was conducted on 102 beta-thalassemia (beta-thal), patients. Zinc level was evaluated in subjects using the atomic absorption method. The results were analyzed through descriptive statistics, chi 2 and Mann-Whitney U tests. Of 102 cases, 92 patients were eligible and evaluated. The mean age was 23 (minimum 11, maximum 43) years. Forty-six percent of cases were males and 54.0% were females. Of the 92 patients taking iron chelators, 29.3% used deferoxamine (DFO), 16.3% deferasirox (DFX), 20.6% DFO and deferiprone (DFP), and 33.8% DFO and DFP. All cases had zinc deficiency, 89.1% had zinc levels <40.0 mg/dL, and 10.9% with zinc levels >40.0 mg/dL. There was a significant relationship between gender and group with zinc levels greater than 40.0 mg/dL and those with less than 40.0 mg/dL.

Bone cement as the most commonly used filling material is disputed on its clinical effects of different viscosity. OBJECTIVE(S): To compare the efficacy and safety of different viscosity bone cement vertebroplasty in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. METHOD(S): One hundred and eighty-three patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture were randomly divided into four groups: percutaneous vertebroplasty with high viscosity bone cement group (group A), percutaneous vertebroplasty with low viscosity bone cement group (group B), percutaneous kyphoplasty with high viscosity bone cement group (group C), and percutaneous kyphoplasty with low viscosity bone cement group (group D). RESULTS AND CONCLUSION(S): (1) The operative time and X-ray exposure time were longer in the two low viscosity bone cement groups than the two corresponding high viscosity bone cement groups, respectively. (2) After operation, visual analogue scale scores and disability index scores were gradually decreased in the all the groups. Compared with the group A, the visual analogue scale score and disability index score were lower in the group C; compared with group B, the visual analogue scale score and disability index score were lower in the group D. (3) After operation, the kyphosis Cobb angle was gradually reduced and the sagittal index of injured vertebrae were gradually increased in all the groups. The postoperative Cobb angle value was ranked as follows: group A > group C > group D. (4) Compared with two low viscosity bone cement groups, two high viscosity bone cement group had lower incidence of adverse events. These findings indicate that high viscosity bone cement has better safety and effectiveness in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. The clinical efficacy of percutaneous kyphoplasty with high viscosity bone cement is the best among the four systems.Copyright Â© 2018, Journal of Clinical Rehabilitative Tissue Engineering Research.

Method(s): We determined the genotype and allele distributions of rs1800469 (C-509T), rs1800470 (C869T), rs189037 (A-111G), and rs373759 (126713 G>A) in 141 Han Chinese patients who underwent definitive thoracic radiotherapy (50 to 77 Gy, 5 days/wk) for lung cancer (small cell or non-small cell tumors, n = 97), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC, n = 27), or mediastinal cancer (n = 17). Clinical variables were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression models to calculate the relative risk of RP associated with the clinical variables, and a Pearson correlation analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between the SNP genotypes and alleles and the incidence of RP for the various risk factors. Result(s): The T alleles of rs1800470 (CT/TT) and rs1800469 (CT/TT) and the G allele of rs189037 (GA/GG) were associated with the risk of >= grade-2 RP in the ESCC patients (P = 0.0006, P = 0.0127, and P = 0.0412, respectively), and that the A alleles of rs189037 (AG/AA) and rs373759 (AG/AA) were associated with the risk of >= grade-2 RP in the patients with mediastinal cancer (P = 0.0063 and P = 0.0003, respectively). None of the SNP genotypes were associated with the risk of RP in lung cancer patients. Conclusion(s): The T alleles of the rs1800470 (CT/TT) and rs1800469 (CT/TT) SNPs of TGFbeta1 and the G allele of the rs189037 (GA/GG) SNP of ATM are independent risk factors for RP in Chinese ESCC patients, and the A alleles of the rs189037 (AG/AA) and rs373759 (AG/AA) SNPs of ATM are independent risk factors for RP in Chinese patients with mediastinal cancer. These SNPs might represent useful biomarkers for personalizing radiotherapy regimens for Chinese patients with ESCC or mediastinal cancer to reduce the incidence of RP. Large-cohort studies of these SNPs in thoracic cancer patients are warranted.Copyright Â© 2015, E-Century Publishing Corporation. All rights reserved.",Excluded
4808,"Prevalence of incidental or unexpected findings on low-dose CT performed during routine SPECT/CT nuclear medicine studies INTRODUCTION: In nuclear medicine, single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) is often combined with 'simultaneous' low-dose CT (LDCT) to provide complementary anatomical and functional correlation. As a consequence, numerous incidental and unexpected findings may be detected on LDCT. Recognition of these findings and appropriate determination of their relevance can add to the utility of SPECT/CT. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence and categorise the relevance of incidental and unexpected findings on LDCT scans performed as part of routine SPECT/CT studies., METHODS: All available LDCT scans performed as part of SPECT/CT studies at St. Vincent's Hospital Melbourne in the year 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Two qualified radiologists independently reviewed the studies and any previous available imaging and categorised any detected incidental findings., RESULTS: A total of 2447 LDCT studies were reviewed. The relevance of the findings was classified according to a modified version of a scale used in the Colonography Reporting and Data System: E1 = normal or normal variant (28.0%); E2 = clinically unimportant (63.5%); E3 = likely unimportant or incompletely characterised (6.2%); E4 = potentially important (2.5%)., CONCLUSION: Imaging specialists need to be cognisant of incidental and unexpected findings present on LDCT studies performed as part of SPECT/CT. Appropriate categorisation of findings and communication of potentially important findings to referring clinicians should form part of routine practice. The overall prevalence of potentially significant incidental and unexpected findings in our series was 8.7% (E3, 6.2%; E4, 2.5%) and was comparable to rates in other published imaging series.

3983,"A sensitive abeta oligomer assay discriminates Alzheimer's and aged control cerebrospinal fluid A hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain is the amyloid beta (Abeta) plaque, which is comprised of Abeta peptides. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that Abeta oligomers are more toxic than other peptide forms. We sought to develop a robust assay to quantify oligomers from CSF. Antibody 19.3 was compared in one-site and competitive ELISAs for oligomer binding specificity. A two-site ELISA for oligomers was developed using 19.3 coupled to a sensitive, bead-based fluorescent platform able to detect single photons of emitted light. The two-site ELISA was >2500x selective for Abeta oligomers over Abeta monomers with a limit of detection ~ 0.09 pg/ml in human CSF. The lower limit of reliable quantification of the assay was 0.18 pg/ml and the antibody pairs recognized Abeta multimers comprised of either synthetic standards, or endogenous oligomers isolated from confirmed human AD and healthy control brain. Using the assay, a significant 3- to 5-fold increase in Abeta oligomers in human AD CSF compared with comparably aged controls was demonstrated. The increase was seen in three separate human cohorts, totaling 63 AD and 54 controls. CSF oligomers ranged between 0.1 and 10 pg/ml. Abeta oligomer levels did not strongly associate with age or gender, but had an inverse correlation with MMSE score.

4311,"Boron neutron capture therapy using cyclotron-based epithermal neutron source and borofalan (10B) for recurrent or locally advanced head and neck cancer (JHN002): An open-label phase II trial Background and purpose: Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) can be performed without reactors due to development of cyclotron-based epithermal neutron source (C-BENS), which is optimized for treatment for deeper-seated tumors. The purpose of this study was to evaluate efficacy and safety of cyclotron-based BNCT with borofalan (10B) for recurrent or locally advanced head and neck cancer. Material(s) and Method(s): In this open-label, phase II JHN002 trial of BNCT using C-BENS with borofalan (10B), patients with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma (R-SCC) or with recurrent/locally advanced non-squamous cell carcinoma (R/LA-nSCC) of the head and neck were intravenously administered 400 mg/kg borofalan (10B), followed by neutron irradiation. The tumor dose was determined passively as the mucosal maximum dose of 12 Gy-Eq. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR). Post-trial observational JHN002 Look Up study was planned for evaluating locoregional progression-free survival (LRPFS). Result(s): Eight R-SCC and 13 R/LA-nSCC patients were enrolled. All R-SCC patients had prior radiotherapy with a median dose of 65.5 Gy (range, 59.4-76.0 Gy). The ORR for all patients was 71%, and complete response/partial response were 50%/25% in R-SCC and 8%/62% in R/LA-nSCC. The 2-year overall survival for R-SCC and R/LA-nSCC were 58% and 100%, respectively. The median LRPFS was 11.5 months for R-SCC. Frequently observed adverse events included alopecia (95%), hyperamylasemia (86%), and nausea (81%). Conclusion(s): These data suggest that BNCT using C-BENS with borofalan (10B) is a promising treatment option for patients with R-SCC or R/LA-nSCC of the head and neck.Copyright Â© 2020 The Authors",Excluded
4131,"Analysis of radiological factors promoting degeneration in adjacent disc levels after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion Objective: Adjacent segment disease (ASD) is considered an important prognostic factor of long-term results after cervical anterior fusion. However, factors contributing to ASD are not clearly understood. The objective of this study was to evaluate the radiological factors contributing to ASD after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF). Method(s): Disc levels (145) of 72 patients who underwent ACDF and had radiological observation for more than 5 years after surgery were included in this study. There were 49 males and 23 females, with a mean age of 54.3 years at the time of surgery. All patients underwent the modified Smith-Robinsons method using titanium cages. Radiological assessments were performed by dynamic X-ray and MRI prior to surgery, 1 or 2 weeks postoperatively, and at final follow-up. When any radiological degeneration was detected at follow-up, ASD was judged as present at the level of interest. Radiological factors (e.g., range of motion, pre-operative status, post-operative change) were analyzed on all operated levels and adjacent disc levels and on cervical alignment of all patients. Intra-operative needle placement to the disc space for marking was also studied to determine contribution to ASD. Result(s): ASD was significantly related to canal stenosis (p = 0.00328, Chi square test), pre-operative larger segmental range of motion (ROM) of adjacent segments (p = 0.00911), and preoperative intensity change of adjacent discs on MRI (p = 0.000527). None of the factors on operated levels and cervical alignment statistically contributed to ASD. Intra-operative needle insertion to the non-operated disc levels was more frequently related to ASD (p = 0.00330). Conclusion(s): ASD may be related to adjacent disc levels not the operated level or cervical alignment. Patients with canal stenosis, preoperative degeneration or larger ROM of adjacent levels have a significantly higher incidence of ASD. Although ACDF is a useful and widely accepted method for cervical spondylosis, careful post-operative observation is needed.",Excluded

3818,"Multidetector row computed tomography of acute pancreatitis: Utility of single portal phase CT scan in short-term follow up Objective: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the question of whether nonenhanced CT or contrast enhanced portal phase CT can replace multiphasic pancreas protocol CT in short term monitoring in patients with acute pancreatitis. Material(s) and Method(s): This retrospective study was approved by the Institutional Review Board. From April 2006 to May 2010, a total of 52 patients having acute pancreatitis who underwent initial dual phase multidetector row CT (unenhanced, arterial, and portal phase) at admission and a short term (within 30 days) follow up dual phase CT (mean interval 10.3 days, range 3-28 days) were included. Two abdominal radiologists performed an independent review of three sets of follow up CT images (nonenhanced scan, single portal phase scan, and dual phase scan). Interpretation of each image set was done with at least 2-week interval. Radiologists evaluated severity of acute pancreatitis with regard to pancreatic inflammation, pancreatic necrosis, and extrapancreatic complication, based on the modified CT severity index. Scores of each image set were compared using a paired t-test and interobserver agreement was evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficient statistics. Result(s): Mean scores of sum of CT severity index on nonenhanced scan, portal phase scan, and dual phase scan were 5.7, 6.6, and 6.5 for radiologist 1, and 5.0, 5.6, and 5.8 for radiologist 2, respectively. In both radiologists, contrast enhanced scan (portal phase scan and dual phase scan) showed significantly higher severity score compared with that of unenhanced scan (P < 0.05), while portal phase and dual phase scan showed no significant difference each other. The trend was similar regarding pancreatic inflammation and extrapancreatic complications, in which contrast enhanced scans showed significantly higher score compared with those of unenhanced scan, while no significant difference was observed between portal phase scan and dual phase scan. In pancreatic necrosis analysis, there was no significant difference between the three image sets for both radiologists. However, when only the patients having pancreatic necrosis (n = 13) was separately analyzed, significant differences were observed between the unenhanced and portal phase scan (P = 0.04, for radiologist 1), or unenhanced and dual phase scan (P = 0.013, for radiologist 2). Conclusion(s): For short-term follow up imaging in assessment of patients with acute pancreatitis, single portal phase CT images without adding unenhanced or arterial phase images provide sufficient information, and thereby reduce radiation exposure.

4485,"Comparison of Middle and Lower Calyceal Access for Renal Pelvis Stone in Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy: A Prospective Randomized Study Objective: The aim of the study was to evaluate the possible effects of calyceal choice for renal puncture under sonographic guidance on the outcomes of percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL). Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 70 patients for whom ultrasound-guided PNL was planned for 20-30-mm single renal pelvic stones were prospectively allocated to group 1 (n:35) with middle calyx entry or group 2 (n:35) with lower calyx entry. Procedure-related parameters such as duration of operation, stone-free rates, complication rates, and radiation exposure time were analyzed in detail. Result(s): The mean age of the patients was 45.67 +/- 1.50 years and the mean stone size was 316.4 +/- 17.95 mm2. There was no significant difference regarding the age, BMI, stone burden, and the grade of hydronephrosis between the groups. Skin to collecting system distance was significantly shorter in the middle calyx entrance (p = 0.021). Total duration of the procedure was again significantly shorter in group 1 cases (74.69 +/- 2.94 min) than in group 2 (84.29 +/- 4.25 min) (p = 0.003). Regarding the success rates, the postoperative stone-free rate was higher in group 1 (91.4% in group 1, 80.0% in group 2, p = 0.305). Last, there was no statistically significant difference in hemoglobin reduction rates, blood transfusion requirements, and complication rates between the 2 groups. Conclusion(s): Getting access to the renal pelvis through the middle calyx during ultrasonic guided PNL procedure is more advantageous to lower the calyceal approach by reducing both the duration of the PNL procedure with significantly higher stone-free and comparable complication rates.Â© 2020 S.

4038,"Determining the burden of tuberculosis in Eritrea: A new approach Objective: To obtain an estimate of the prevalence of new cases of smear-positive tuberculosis in Eritrea using a new low-cost approach. Method(s): The study was designed to include a sample of 35 000 people divided between 40 clusters. The clusters were selected by sampling proportional to population size. In each cluster, census data were obtained from eligible individuals. Individuals aged 15 years or more were questioned about cough and its duration and smoking and were asked to provide two samples of sputum (spot and morning) for examination by fluorescence microscopy. Finding(s): A total of 38 032 individuals were included in the study. Of the 19 197 individuals aged 15 years or more, 18 152 (94.6%) provided at least one sample of sputum. Fifteen individuals fulfilled the case definition, providing a prevalence of new cases of smear-positive tuberculosis of 90 per 100 000 (95% confidence interval, CI, 35-145 per 100 000) individuals aged 15 years or more and 50 per 100 000 (95% CI, 19-80 per 100 000) in the total population. Conclusion(s): The estimated prevalence of new cases of smear-positive tuberculosis obtained from our study is considerably lower than the estimate published by the World Health Organization. The new methodology for surveys to determine the prevalence of tuberculosis that we used is feasible in the field. This methodology should be validated in other countries and compared with other methods for measuring prevalence.",Excluded
4022,"Combined radiochemotherapy with paclitaxel in the treatment of malignant glioma BACKGROUND: Paclitaxel is a radiosensitizing agent that shows a synergistic effect with radiation in malignant glioma cells. A phase I/II trial was performed in order to evaluate both feasibility and outcome of combined radiochemotherapy in malignant glioma., PATIENTS AND METHODS: 56 patients were included in the trial. Paclitaxel was administered on days 1-4, 15-18 and 29-32 18 to 24 hours prior to irradiation. Radiotherapy with 60 Gy in conventional fractionation was initiated on day 2.31 patients were included in a dose-escalation trial starting with 20 mg/m2/d and increasing up to 60 mg/m2/d in 10-mg steps. Additional 25 patients were treated with 50 mg/m2/d., RESULTS: The regimen was very well tolerated with minimal subjective impairment such as sickness or weakness. Maximal tolerable dose was 50 mg/m2/d, with neutropenia being the dose-limiting toxicity. There were four allergic reactions and five thromboembolisms; furthermore, one patient with a normal blood count died due to pneumonia. The median survival was 12 months, and significantly favorable factors were a young age, a lower tumor grade (grade 3) and a complete resection. Varying the paclitaxel dose had no influence on outcome., CONCLUSIONS: Combined radiochemotherapy with paclitaxel in the treatment of malignant glioma was well tolerated. Maximal tolerable dose was 50 mg/m2/d. There was no increase in survival compared with results reported in the literature.",Excluded
4844,"Generation of boundary manikin anthropometry The purpose of this study was to develop 3D digital 'boundary manikins' that are representative of the anthropometry of a unique population. These digital manikins can be used by designers to verify and validate that the components of the spacesuit design satisfy the requirements specified in the Human Systems Integration Requirements (HSIR) document. Currently, the HSIR requires the next generation space suit to accommodate the 1st percentile American female to the 99th percentile American male. The manikin anthropometry was derived using two methods: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Whole Body Posture Based Analysis (WBPBA). PCA is a statistical method for reducing a multidimensional data set by using eigenvectors and eigenvalues. The goal was to create a reduced data set that encapsulates the majority of the variation in the population. WBPBA is a multivariate analytical approach that was developed by the Anthropometry and Biomechanics Facility (ABF) to identify the extremes of a population for a given body posture. WBPBA is a simulation-based method that finds extremes in a population based upon anthropometry and posture; whereas PCA is based solely on anthropometry. Both methods yielded a list of subjects and their anthropometry from a target population; PCA resulted in 20 female and 22 male subjects' anthropometry and WBPBA resulted in 7 subjects' anthropometry representing the extreme subjects in the target population. The subjects' anthropometry was then used to 'morph' a baseline digital scan of a person with the same body type to create a 3D digital model that can be used as a tool for designers.

Daily radiation emitted by 12 cats who had received a range of doses of I(131) (80-200 MBq) was measured and average background radiation readings deducted. The effective half-lives of the I(131) in the cats were found to have a median of 2.54 days (range 1.40-3.24 days). Cats treated with 200 MBq emitted 5 microGy/day more exposure than cats treated with lower doses throughout the study period (P=0.032). All cats were found to emit a total radiation dose exposure less than 100 microGy (range 0-43 microGy) during days 18-21 of isolation. The potential additional dose exposure to owners was calculated at various days that might be considered for the cats to be returned to their owners. Using this provisional data, maximum isolation periods at this institution could be safely reduced to 17 days as long as certain precautions are followed. This preliminary study demonstrated that this novel cage-side monitoring system can be used to calculate the effective half-life of I(131) and to measure gamma radiation exposure from treated cats, which may assist other institutions in determining appropriate isolation times for individual cats.Copyright British Veterinary Association.",Excluded
4785,Cord blood transplantation using minimum conditioning regimens for patients with hematologic malignancies complicated by severe infections Patients with severe infections are thought to be ineligible for cord blood stem cell transplantation (CBT) because the conventional 5-6 day-conditioning regimens potentially makes them susceptible to fatal infections by the time neutrophil engraftment occurs. Two patients were treated with minimum conditioning regimens consisting of 30 mg/m2 fludarabin (Flu) and 2 g/m2 cyclophosphamide (CY) on day-1 and total body irradiation (TBI) of 2 or 4 Gy on day -1 or 0 followed by single unit CBT. The reasons for adopting such weak regimen were febrile neutropenia due to the rejection of the first cord blood (CB) graft given to a patient with follicular lymphoma resistant to chemotherapy and pulmonary aspergillosis in another patient with AML who relapsed after CBT. The AML patient received 40 mg/m2 of melphalan on day-2 to reduce the leukemia burden. Both patients achieved 100% donor chimerism by day 19 and day 20 after CBT without an apparent exacerbation of the infections and remained in remission at 23 and 18 months after the CBT. These findings suggest that the 1-2 day regimens excluding antihuman thymocyte globulin may be sufficiently potent to ensure engraftment of CB in immunocompromised patients and safely administered even when patients are complicated by active infections.

4597,"Hormonal suppression restores fertility in irradiated mice from both endogenous and donor-derived stem spermatogonia Irradiation interrupts spermatogenesis and causes prolonged sterility in male mammals. Hormonal suppression treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues has restored spermatogenesis in irradiated rats, but similar attempts were unsuccessful in irradiated mice, monkeys, and humans. In this study, we tested a stronger hormonal suppression regimen (the GnRH antagonist, acyline, and plus flutamide) for efficacy both in restoring endogenous spermatogenesis and in enhancing colonization of transplanted stem spermatogonia in mouse testes irradiated with a total doses between 10.5 and 13.5 Gy. A 4-week hormonal suppression treatment, given immediately after irradiation, increased endogenous spermatogenic recovery 1.5-fold, and 11-week hormonal suppression produced twofold increases compared with sham-treated irradiated controls. Furthermore, 10-week hormonal suppression restored fertility from endogenous surviving spermatogonial stem cells in 90% of 10.5-Gy irradiated mice, whereas only 10% were fertile without hormonal suppression. Four-and 11-week hormonal suppression also enhanced spermatogenic development from transplanted stem spermatogonia in irradiated recipient mice, by 3.1-and 4.8-fold, respectively, compared with those not given hormonal treatment. Moreover, the 10-week hormonal suppression regimen, but not a sham treatment, restored fertility of some 13.5-Gy irradiated recipient mice from donor-derived spermatogonial stem cells. This is the first report of hormonal suppression inducing recovery of endogenous spermatogenesis and fertility in a mouse model treated with anticancer agents. The combination of spermatogonial transplantation with hormonal suppression should be investigated as a treatment to restore fertility in young men after cytotoxic cancer therapy. Â© The Author 2010.

Method(s): Patients radiographically defined with potentially resectable pancreatic cancer were eligible. A preoperative, short-course, dose-escalation study was performed with fixed 8 fractions in 2 weeks. The dose of irradiation was increased by 5% increments from 30 grays equivalents (GyE) to 36.8 GyE. Surgery was to be performed 2 to 4 weeks after the completion of CIRT. Result(s): The study enrolled 26 patients. At the time of restaging after CIRT, disease progression with distant metastasis or refusal ruled out 5 patients from surgery. Twenty-one of 26 patients (81%) patients underwent surgery. The pattern of initial disease progression was distant metastasis in 17 patients (65%) and regional recurrence in 2 patients (8%). No patients experienced local recurrence. The 5-year survival rates for all 26 patients and for those who underwent surgery were 42% and 52%, respectively.

4480,"Cardiac and Renal Delayed Effects of Acute Radiation Exposure: Organ Differences in Vasculopathy, Inflammation, Senescence and Oxidative Balance We have previously shown significant pathology in the heart and kidney of murine hematopoietic-acute radiation syndrome (H-ARS) survivors of 8.7-9.0 Gy total-body irradiation (TBI). The goal of this study was to determine temporal relationships in the development of vasculopathy and the progression of renal and cardiovascular delayed effects of acute radiation exposure (DEARE) at TBI doses less than 9 Gy and to elucidate the potential roles of senescence, inflammation and oxidative stress. Our results show significant loss of endothelial cells in coronary arteries by 4 months post-TBI (8.53 or 8.72 Gy of gamma radiation). This loss precedes renal dysfunction and interstitial fibrosis and progresses to abnormalities in the arterial media and adventitia and loss of coronary arterioles. Major differences in radiation-induced pathobiology exist between the heart and kidney in terms of vasculopathy progression and also in indices of inflammation, senescence and oxidative imbalance. The results of this work suggest a need for different medical countermeasures for multiple targets in different organs and at various times after acute radiation injury to prevent the progression of DEARE.",Included

The esophagectomy specimens were sampled at the resection margins, the edge of irradiated length, 1 cm from the proximal and distal edge of visible tumor, the center of the tumor, and the lymph nodes., RESULTS: Radiation change in the form of fibrosis was limited to the submucosa at the resection margins, the circular muscle layer at the edge of irradiated length, and full thickness at 1 cm from the edge of the visible tumor and the center of the tumor. Surface epithelium did not show any changes at the resection margins but did show basal cell hyperplasia at the edge of the irradiated length and ulceration at 1 cm from the edge of the visible tumor and the center of the tumor. Endarteritis obliterans was seen only 1 cm from the edge of the visible tumor and the center of the tumor. Necrosis, intense keratin formation, and giant cell reaction were observed at the center of the tumor. When compared with the preradiotherapy biopsies, the amount of keratin in the postradiotherapy specimens was extensive. HDRILBT may cause induction of the keratin gene in the irradiated cells to stimulate differentiation toward better differentiated cells., CONCLUSIONS: HDRILBT may cause the keratin gene in the irradiated cells to induce differentiation toward better differentiated cells.

The aim of this study was to determine how frequently this happened and what caused these conditions. Method(s): Electronic medical records and x-rays from 281 ventilator episodes in the medical intensive care unit were reviewed to determine the characteristics of patients requiring ventilation and the number of patients meeting the criteria for ventilatorassociated conditions (VACs). Result(s): This cohort included 257 patients (55.4% men) who required 281 episodes of mechanical ventilation. The mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Healthy Evaluation II score was 13.5 +/- 5.9. The initial mean PaO2/FiO2 was 210 +/- 110. The median number of ventilator days was 4 (interquartile range: 3-9). The overall mortality was 32.3%. Nineteen patients (11.7% of eligible episodes) met the CDC criteria for a VAC; 6 met FiO2 criteria (31.6%) and 13 met positive end expiratory pressure criteria (68.4%). Twelve patients (63.2%) had an increased white blood cell count (>12k/muL) during the event. Eleven patients had an increase in temperature (.38degreeC) during this period. The etiology of these conditions included pneumonia (n = 4), atelectasis (n = 4), congestive heart failure (n = 5), acute respiratory distress syndrome (n = 2), and miscellaneous reasons (n = 4).

Background: Neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy has improved the local control rate and overall survival in locally advanced rectal cancers. The purpose of this retrospective study is to evaluate the correlation between the final pathologic stage and survival in these patients. Method(s): Patients with biopsy-proven rectal carcinoma, pretreatment staging by magnetic resonance imaging such as T3 or T4 tumors, or node-positive disease were treated with preoperative concomitant 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy and radiation, followed by radical surgical resection. Clinical outcome with survival, disease-free survival, recurrence rate, and local recurrence rate were compared with each T and N findings using the American Joint Committee on Cancer Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) staging system. Result(s): A total of 248 patients were enrolled in this study. Overall survival and disease-free survival at 1, 3, and 5 years were 97.1, 92, and 89.9% and 87.5, 71.1, and 69.5%, respectively. Thirty-six patients (14.5%) had a pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant therapy. The recurrence rate was significantly different between the pathologic complete response group and residual group (5.6 vs 31.1%; P = .002). Five-year disease-free survival was significantly better in the complete response group than the residual tumor group (93 vs 66%; P = .0045). There was no statistical difference in survival or locoregional recurrence rate between these two groups. Conclusion(s): Posttreatment pathologic TNM stage is correlated to disease-free survival and tumor recurrence rate in locally advanced rectal cancer after preoperative chemoradiation.

Method(s): Adult patients from four primary care clinics who had an x-ray, CT, MRI, or ultrasound in the 12 months before recruitment participated in a single semistructured interview to recount their imaging experience. Interview transcripts were analyzed thematically. Result(s): Four themes related to PCOs were identified from 45 interviews. Participants' mean age was 53 years (25-83 years), 30 had undergone a diagnostic imaging test, and 15 underwent imaging for screening or monitoring. Themes included knowledge gained from the imaging test, its contribution to their overall health care journey, physical experiences during the test procedure, and impacts of the testing process on emotions. Conclusion(s): Patients identified various imaging test outcomes that were important to them. Measurement and reporting these outcomes should be considered more often in diagnostic research. Tools for providers and patients to discuss and utilize these outcomes may help promote shared decision making around the use and impact of imaging tests.Copyright Â© 2018",Excluded
4462,"Machined cervical interfacet allograft spacers for the management of atlantoaxial instability Background: The use of cervical interfacet spacers (CISs) to augment stability and provide solid arthrodesis at the atlantoaxial joint has not been studied in detail. The aim of this work is to report the outcomes with the use of machined allograft CISs at C1-2. Method(s): A retrospective review of 19 patients who underwent an atlantoaxial fusion with the use of CISs was performed. All patients had instability documented with flexion and extension lateral radiographs. This instability was due to trauma, degenerative stenosis, symptomatic C1-2 arthropathy, and os odontoideum. Clinical and radiological outcomes were assessed. Fusion was determined based on a lack of hardware failure, absence of motion on flexion and extension plain X-ray films, and presence of bridging trabecular bone which was most often demonstrated by a computed tomography. Result(s): The mean age was 69.1 +/- 12.9 years. Eight patients had traumatic fractures, six patients had degenerative stenosis, two patients had C2 neuralgia due to C1-2 arthropathy, two patients had C1-2 ligamentous subluxation, and one patient had an unstable os odontoideum. The occiput or subaxial spine was included in the arthrodesis in 10 patients. Rib autograft was utilized in most patients. No patient had postoperative neurological worsening, malposition of hardware, or vertebral artery injury and there were no mortalities. The fusion rate was 95%. The mean follow-up was 12.1 +/- 5.5 months. Conclusion(s): CIS is a promising adjuvant for the treatment of atlantoaxial instability.Copyright Â© 2017 Journal of Craniovertebral Junction and Spine Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",Excluded
4568,"Neoadjuvant radiotherapy combined with capecitabine and sorafenib in patients with advanced KRAS-mutated rectal cancer: A phase I/II trial (SAKK 41/08) Background KRAS mutation occurs in ~40% of locally advanced rectal cancers (LARCs). The multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib has radiosensitising effects and might improve outcomes for standard preoperative chemoradiotherapy in patients with KRAS-mutated LARC. Methods Adult patients with KRAS-mutated T3/4 and/or N1/2M0 LARC were included in this phase I/II study. The phase I dose-escalation study of capecitabine plus sorafenib and radiotherapy was followed by a phase II study assessing efficacy and safety. Primary end-points were to: establish the maximum tolerated dose of the regimen in phase I; determine the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate in phase II defined as Dworak regression grade 3 and 4. Results Fifty-four patients were treated at 18 centres in Switzerland and Hungary; 40 patients were included in the single-arm phase II study. Recommended doses from phase I comprised radiotherapy (45 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks) with capecitabine 825 mg/m2 twice daily x 33 plus sorafenib 400 mg/d. Median daily dose intensity in phase II was radiotherapy 100%, capecitabine 98.6%, and sorafenib 100%. The pCR rate (Dworak 3/4) was 60% (95% CI, 43.3-75.1%) by central independent pathologic review. Sphincter preservation was achieved in 89.5%, R0 resection in 94.7%, and downstaging in 81.6%. The most common grade 3 toxicities during phase II included diarrhoea (15.0%), skin toxicity outside radiotherapy field (12.5%), pain (7.5%), skin toxicity in radiotherapy field, proctitis, fatigue and cardiac ischaemia (each 5%). Conclusions Combining sorafenib and standard chemoradiotherapy with capecitabine is highly active in patients with KRAS-mutated LARC with acceptable toxicity and deserves further investigation. www.clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00869570.Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
4482,"Treatment of postherpetic trigeminal neuralgia with the gamma knife Object. Postherpetic neuralgia is a syndrome characterized by intractable pain. Treatment of this pain has not yet been successful. Patients with postherpetic neuralgia will therefore benefit from any progress in the treatment strategy. The authors performed gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS) as a noninvasive treatment for postherpetic trigeminal neuralgia (TN) and evaluated the success rate for pain relief. Methods. Between 1995 and February 1999, six men and 10 women were treated for postherpetic TN; conservative treatment failed in all of them. The median follow up was 33 months (range 8-34 months). The radiation was focused on the root of the trigeminal nerve in the vicinity of the brainstem (maximal dose 70-80 Gy in one fraction, 4-mm collimator). The patients were divided into five groups according to degree of pain relief after treatment. A successful result (excellent, very good, and good) was reached in seven (44%) patients and radiosurgery failed in nine (56%). Pain relief occurred after a median interval of 1 month (range 10 days-6 months). No radiation-related side effects have been observed in these patients. Conclusions. These results suggest that GKS for postherpetic TN is a relatively successful and safe method that can be used in patients even if they are in poor condition. In case this method fails, other treatment options including other neurosurgical procedures are not excluded.",Excluded
4685,"Multivariable normal-tissue complication modeling of acute esophageal toxicity in advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with intensity-modulated (chemo-)radiotherapy Background and purpose The majority of normal-tissue complication probability (NTCP) models for acute esophageal toxicity (AET) in advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer (AS-NSCLC) patients treated with (chemo-)radiotherapy are based on three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT). Due to distinct dosimetric characteristics of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), 3D-CRT based models need revision. We established a multivariable NTCP model for AET in 149 AS-NSCLC patients undergoing IMRT. Materials and methods An established model selection procedure was used to develop an NTCP model for Grade >=2 AET (53 patients) including clinical and esophageal dose-volume histogram parameters. Results The NTCP model predicted an increased risk of Grade >=2 AET in case of: concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCR) [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 14.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.70-42.19; p < 0.001], increasing mean esophageal dose [Dmean; OR 1.12 per Gy increase, 95% CI 1.06-1.19; p < 0.001], female patients (OR 3.33, 95% CI 1.36-8.17; p = 0.008), and >=cT3 (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.12-6.50; p = 0.026). The AUC was 0.82 and the model showed good calibration. Conclusions A multivariable NTCP model including CCR, Dmean, clinical tumor stage and gender predicts Grade >=2 AET after IMRT for AS-NSCLC. Prior to clinical introduction, the model needs validation in an independent patient cohort.Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
3743,"Effect of the Prophylactic Use of Proton-Pump Inhibitors on the Pattern of Gastrointestinal Symptoms in Patients Late After Kidney Transplant OBJECTIVES: Although immunosuppressive drugs have been recognized as leading causes of gastrointestinal symptoms after kidney transplant, other widely used medications such as proton-pump inhibitors recently have been implicated. Our aim was to study the effects of chronic proton-pump inhibitor therapy on gastrointestinal symptoms in clinically stable patients late after kidney transplant., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study comprised 100 kidney transplant recipients (66 men and 34 women, mean age of 49 +/- 12 y, mean time after transplant of 56 +/- 46 mo). All patients completed the Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale and the Quality of Life Questionnaire SF-8 surveys., RESULTS: The most commonly reported symptoms included borborygmus (27%), flatulence (23%), abdominal distension (18%), urgent need of defecation (17%), and heartburn, acid reflux, and eructation (13%). Proton-pump inhibitors were chronically used by 50% of patients and sporadically by 33%. Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale scores were higher in patients who used proton-pump inhibitors (mean score of 7.8 +/- 5.5 vs 4.6 +/- 3.0; P = .013). Total score of items representing diarrhea in the Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale (increased passage of stools, loose stools, urgent need of defecation, incomplete evacuation) was higher in patients treated with proton-pump inhibitors than in those not treated (2.3 +/- 2.2 vs 1.3 +/- 1.9; P = .04)., CONCLUSIONS: Chronic use of proton-pump inhibitors may increase the prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly diarrhea, in patients late after kidney transplant.",Excluded
4414,"The First Female Dry Immersion (NAIAD-2020): Design and Specifics of a 3-Day Study This article describes procedures and some results of the first study of females undergoing 3-day Dry Immersion. The experiment ""NAIAD-2020"" was carried out at the Institute of Biomedical Problems (Moscow, Russia) with the participation of six healthy women volunteers (age 30.17 +/- 5.5 years, height 1.66 +/- 0.1 m, weight 62.05 +/- 8.4 kg, BMI 22.39 +/- 2.2 kg/m2) with a natural menstrual cycle. During the study, a standard protocol was used, the same as for men, with a minimum period of time spent outside the immersion bath. Before, during and after Immersion, 22 experiments were carried out aimed at studying the neurophysiological, functional, metabolic and psychophysiological functions of the body, the results of which will be presented in future publications. The total time outside the bath for women did not exceed that for men. Systolic and diastolic pressure did not significantly change during the immersion. In the first 24 h after the end of the immersion, heart rate was significantly higher than the background values [F(4,20) = 14.67; P < 0.0001]. Changes in body temperature and water balance were consistent with the patterns found in men. No significant changes in height and weight were found during immersion. All women reported general discomfort and pain in the abdomen and back. The results of this study did not find significant risks to women's health and showed the feasibility of using this model of the effects of space flight in women of reproductive age.Â© Copyright Â© 2021 Tomilovskaya, Amirova, Nosikova, Rukavishnikov, Chernogorov, Lebedeva, Saveko, Ermakov, Ponomarev, Zelenskaya, Shigueva, Shishkin, Kitov, Riabova, Brykov, Abu Sheli, Vassilieva and Orlov.",Excluded
4093,"Trans sodium crocetinate with temozolomide and radiation therapy for glioblastoma multiforme obJective A new drug, trans sodium crocetinate (TSC), has been developed to enhance the delivery of oxygen to hypoxic tissues. Cancerous tumors, such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), are very hypoxic, and it has been suggested that radiation therapy (RT) is more beneficial if tumors are better oxygenated. A Phase I/II clinical trial was conducted to determine the effect of adding TSC to RT sessions. MethoDs An open, single-arm clinical trial incorporating the standard of care (SOC) for GBM was conducted at 18 clinical sites. There were 6 weeks of RT consisting of 2 Gy/day for 5 days/week, beginning after an initial resection or stereotactic biopsy to confirm GBM. Temozolomide (TMZ), 75 mg/m2, was given before each RT session. The TSC, 0.25 mg/kg, was intravenously administered around 45 minutes before an RT session 3 days/week, usually on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. A Phase I run-in period included 2 cohorts. The first cohort contained 3 patients who were given a half dose of the intravenous TSC (that is, 0.25 mg/kg, 3 times per week for only the first 3 weeks of RT). After a Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) had verified that no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) had occurred, a second cohort of 6 patients was given the same dosage of TSC but for the full 6 weeks of RT. After the SMC verified that no DLTs had occurred, Phase II began, with the administration of the full 18 doses of TSC. Fifty additional patients were enrolled during Phase II. Following the completion of RT, the patients rested for a month. After that, SOC TMZ chemotherapy (150-200 mg/m2) was administered for 5 days of the 1st week of 6 monthly cycles. No TSC was administered during this chemotherapy phase or later in the trial. Any other follow-up therapies were administered at the discretion of the individual investigators. resUlts Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that 36% of the full-dose TSC patients were alive at 2 years, compared with historical survival values ranging from 27% to 30% for the SOC. Survival for the biopsy-only subset of patients was 40%, as compared with 42.9% for those patients having a complete resection before treatment. In addition, 2 of the 3 Phase I, Cohort 1 patients survived at 2 years. Contrast MRI data suggested that considerable pseudoprogression had occurred. Both Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) scores and quality of life (QOL) questionnaires indicated that a good quality of life existed for most patients throughout the trial. No serious adverse events occurring in the trial were attributed to TSC. conclUsions This trial contained a single arm consisting of 59 patients. The results strongly suggested that adding TSC during RT is beneficial for the treatment of GBM. Trans sodium crocetinate offers a novel, easily implemented way to combat hypoxia in tumor tissue.Copyright Â© AANS, 2017",Excluded
4761,"Clinical Efficacy of Vertical or Parallel Technique of a Micro-Locking Plate for Treatment of Dubberley B-Type Capitellar Fractures Objective: To evaluate the clinical efficacy of micro-locking plate through vertical or parallel technique for treatment of Dubberley B-type capitellar fractures. Method(s): A retrospective analysis was performed in 24 patients (17 males and seven females, with an average age of 44.9 years, range from 19 to 75 years) with capitellar fractures that were treated with micro-locking plate using vertical or parallel technique between January 2016 to January 2019. The inclusion criteria include closed capitellar fracture, normal anterior elbow joint movement before injury, and recent capitellar fracture with injury within past 3 weeks. Fractures classified according to Dubberley included four cases of type IB, eight cases of type IIB, and 12 cases of type IIIB. Radiographic evaluation was performed. Surgery time, blood loss, range of motion of the elbow, forearm rotation, and complications were recorded. Elbow joint function was evaluated by Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS). Result(s): The mean follow-up period was 19.6 months (range, 12-36 months). The average clinical healing time for fractures was 11.2 +/- 3.2 weeks (range, 8-20 weeks). Fracture united in all patients. Two patients showed slight delayed union, but union was achieved eventually. The mean time from injury to surgery was 6.3 +/- 3.1 days (range, 2-15 days). The average surgical time was 68.1 +/- 11.5 min (range, 50-90 min), and the mean blood loss was 75.2 +/- 26.5 mL (range, 40-120 mL). The mean range of flexion was 122.5degree +/- 10.5degree(range, 95degree-140degree). The mean range of extension was 8.5degree +/- 5.8degree(range, 0degree-20degree). The mean range of pronation was 79.7degree +/- 8.0degree(range, 65degree-90degree). The mean range of supination was 80.5degree +/- 7.1degree(range, 60degree-90degree). The mean MEPS at final follow-up was 89.8 +/- 9.0 (range, 60-100). Based on the MEPS, 18 (75%) patients had excellent, five (20.8%) patients had good, and one (4.2%) patient had fair. None of the 24 patients suffered vascular or nerve injury. One patient showed superficial infection, which was treated with surgical dressing. Conclusion(s): The vertical or parallel technique of the micro-locking plate is an excellent method for treating Dubberley B-type capitellar fractures.Copyright Â© 2021 The Authors.

4492,"Patient-reported voice and speech outcomes after whole-neck intensity modulated radiation therapy and chemotherapy for oropharyngeal cancer: Prospective longitudinal study Purpose To describe voice and speech quality changes and their predictors in patients with locally advanced oropharyngeal cancer treated on prospective clinical studies of organ-preserving chemotherapy-intensity modulated radiation therapy (chemo-IMRT). Methods and Materials Ninety-one patients with stage III/IV oropharyngeal cancer were treated on 2 consecutive prospective studies of definitive chemoradiation using whole-field IMRT from 2003 to 2011. Patient-reported voice and speech quality were longitudinally assessed from before treatment through 24 months using the Communication Domain of the Head and Neck Quality of Life (HNQOL-C) instrument and the Speech question of the University of Washington Quality of Life (UWQOL-S) instrument, respectively. Factors associated with patient-reported voice quality worsening from baseline and speech impairment were assessed. Results Voice quality decreased maximally at 1 month, with 68% and 41% of patients reporting worse HNQOL-C and UWQOL-S scores compared with before treatment, and improved thereafter, recovering to baseline by 12-18 months on average. In contrast, observer-rated larynx toxicity was rare (7% at 3 months; 5% at 6 months). Among patients with mean glottic larynx (GL) dose <=20 Gy, >20-30 Gy, >30-40 Gy, >40-50 Gy, and >50 Gy, 10%, 32%, 25%, 30%, and 63%, respectively, reported worse voice quality at 12 months compared with before treatment (P=.011). Results for speech impairment were similar. Glottic larynx dose, N stage, neck dissection, oral cavity dose, and time since chemo-IMRT were univariately associated with either voice worsening or speech impairment. On multivariate analysis, mean GL dose remained independently predictive for both voice quality worsening (8.1%/Gy) and speech impairment (4.3%/Gy). Conclusions Voice quality worsening and speech impairment after chemo-IMRT for locally advanced oropharyngeal cancer were frequently reported by patients, underrecognized by clinicians, and independently associated with GL dose. These findings support reducing mean GL dose to as low as reasonably achievable, aiming at <=20 Gy when the larynx is not a target. Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
4704,"Case report: Asymptomatic ventricular fibrillation and ineffective high energy therapy in a patient with left ventricular non compaction cardiomyopathy and left ventricular assist device BACKGROUND We present a case of asymptomatic ventricular fibrillation and ineffective defibrillation in a patient with left ventricular non compaction cardiomyopathy after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) Heart Mate III. Non compaction cardiomyopathy is a rare, congenital cardiomyopathy resulting from abnormal embryogenesis of myocardium with characteristic multiple trabeculations in ventricular apex. Its lethal character comes from frequent ventricular arrhythmias, often also with atrio ventricular conduction block. The main role of treatment is to improve cardiac efficiency, reduce the risk of arrhythmias, implant of an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator for prevention of sudden cardiac death, ventricular assist device and heart transplant in cases of serious heart failure. CASE REPORT 61 year old patient with severe heart failure (LVEF 16%), diagnosed in 2012. In the course of non compaction cardiomyopathy after cardiac resynchronization therapy with defibrillation function in February 2018 and implantation left ventricular mechanical cardiac assistant LVAD with Heart Mate III system on 27.06.2019. The patient had 5 discharges of the device in a church without loss of consciousness and symptoms of apparent circulatory failure on 27.10.2019. The patient was admitted to the Emergency Department in fair general condition, with basal crepitations over the lungs audible, slight dyspnea at rest, with ongoing Torsade de pointes in electrocardiographic examination, with ventricular rate 300/min, and blood pressure 100/60 Hg mm. Ventricular fibrillation was interrupted by external defibrillator, achieving sinus rhythm return. Basic examination results showed elevated proBNP values (4362 ng/l), features of pulmonary stasis on X ray. CRT D device memory showed 5 unsuccessful discharges of the device, followed by external effective defibrillation after exhausting all available high energy therapies, which restored sinus rhythm and synchronous biventricular stimulation. The patient was discharged home in good condition. CONCLUSIONS Ineffective high energy therapy in many cases ends in death. In this case, despite the abnormal electrical heart rate, LVAD was working correctly and ensured proper cardiovascular function.",Excluded
4600,"Gamma Knife radiosurgery combined with stereotactic aspiration as an effective treatment method for large cystic brain metastases In the present study, the efficacy and clinical outcomes of stereotactic aspiration combined with the Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) method were evaluated retrospectively for patients with large cystic brain metastases. This combined method aims to decrease the tumor weight (volume) and increase the possible radiation dose. The present study involved 48 patients who were diagnosed with cystic metastatic brain tumors between January 2008 and December 2012 in the Department of Neurosurgery of Nanfang Hospital Southern Medical University (Guangzhou, China). Every patient underwent Leksell stereotactic frame, 1.5T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided stereotactic cyst aspiration and Leksell GKRS. Subsequent to the therapy, MRI was performed every 3 months. The results indicated that 48 cases were followed up for 24-72 months, with a mean follow-up duration of 36.2 months. Following treatment, 44 patients (91.7%) exhibited tumor control and 4 patients (8.3%) experienced progression of the local tumor. During this period, 35 patients (72.9%) succumbed, but only 2 (4.2%) of these succumbed to the brain metastases. The total local control rate was 91.7% and the median overall survival time of all patients was 19.5 months. The 1-year overall survival rate was 70.8% and the 2-year overall survival rate was 26.2%. In conclusion, these results indicated that the method of stereotactic cyst aspiration combined with GKRS was safe and effective for patients with large cystic brain metastases. This method is effective for patients whose condition is too weak for general anesthesia and in whom the tumors are positioned at eloquent areas. This method enables patients to avoid a craniotomy, and provides a good tumor control rate, survival time and quality of life.Copyright Â© 2016, Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.",Excluded

4075,"Radiation exposure among patients with the highest CT scan utilization in the emergency department The risk of cancer from computed tomography (CT) scan radiation is a rising concern in the medical field. Our objectives were to determine how many patients received more than ten CT scans in an academic emergency department (ED) over the course of 7 years and to quantify their radiation exposure and lifetime attributable risk of cancer. An electronic chart review was performed at our urban academic institution with an annual census of 110,000 patients. All patients who underwent a CT scan performed during ED management between the dates of January 2001 and December 2007 were identified. Specific predetermined data elements (e.g., subject demographics, type of CT scan) were extracted by two researchers blinded to hypothesis, using a preformatted data form. After identifying patients with more than ten CTs performed during the study period, radiation exposure was calculated based on accepted and reported radiation doses for the respective anatomic CTs, and lifetime attributable cancer risk was calculated based on the seventh report of the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR VII) projections. Over the 7-year study period, 24,393 patients received 34,671 CT scans. The vast majority of patients (17,909) received a single CT. Twenty-six (0.1 %) patients received more than ten CTs totaling 374 scans with an average radiation exposure of 83.4 mSv. The maximum lifetime attributable risk for any individual in this cohort was 1.7 % above the baseline cancer risk. Among those undergoing CT imaging in our ED, high-exposure patients (greater than ten scans) constituted a significant minority, while more than one in four patients underwent more than one CT scan during the study period. While the presumed overall risk of radiation-induced cancer continues to be low, it is important for the emergency physician to use clinical knowledge as well as concern for the patient when utilizing radiographic imaging. Increasing attributable cancer risk may have important public health implications in the future, regardless of the low individual risk.",Excluded
4048,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma gene polymorphism in psoriasis and its relation to obesity, metabolic syndrome, and narrowband ultraviolet B response: A case-control study in Egyptian patients Background: Psoriasis is a common dermatologic disease with multifactorial etiology in which genetic factors play a major role. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma is expressed in keratinocytes and is known to affect cell maturation and differentiation in addition to its role in inflammation. Aim(s): To study the association between PPAR-gamma gene polymorphism and psoriasis vulgaris in Egyptian patients to explore if this polymorphism influenced disease risk or clinical presentation. Method(s): Forty-five patients with psoriasis vulgaris and 45 age, sex and body mass index matched healthy volunteers who have no present, past or family history of psoriasis as a control group were enrolled. Selected cases included obese and nonobese participants. Detection of PPAR-gamma gene polymorphism was done with restriction fragment length polymorphism polymerase chain reaction. Narrow-band ultraviolet B (NBUVB) was given for every case three times/week for 12 weeks. Result(s): Homopolymorphism, heteropolymorphism, and Ala allele were significantly associated with cases (P = 0.01, P = 0.01, and P = 0.004, respectively) and increased risk of occurrence of psoriasis by 5.25, 3.65, and 3.37 folds, respectively. Heteropolymorphism was significantly associated with nonobese cases compared to obese ones (P = 0.01). Ala allele was significantly associated with obese cases (P = 0.001) and increased risk of occurrence of psoriasis in obese participants by 1.14 folds. Homopolymorphism, heteropolymorphism, and Ala allele were more prevalent among obese cases without metabolic syndrome (MS) than obese cases with MS but without statistical significance. Percentage of decrease of mean Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score before and after 3 months of treatment with NBUVB was higher in cases with heteropolymorphism with no significant difference between homo- and heteropolymorphism. Conclusion(s): PPAR-gamma gene polymorphism is associated with and increased the risk of psoriasis and its associated obesity in Egyptian patients. It has no role in NBUVB response in those patients.

4315,"Proton beam therapy combined with selective intra-arterial infusion chemotherapy for locally advanced tongue cancer Background: The standard treatment for locally advanced tongue cancer is surgery. However, the patient's quality of life is lost. As a newly non-operative treatment, we report the efficacy and toxicity of proton beam therapy combined with selective intra-arterial infusion chemotherapy (PBT-IACT) for locally advanced tongue cancer. Method(s): Between February 2009 and August 2012, 45 cases of stage III-IV(M0) squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue (28 men and 17 women) were treated by PBT-IACT at Southern TOHOKU Proton Therapy Center. Median age was 58 years (range:24-83 years), and clinical stage III/IVA/IVB were 11/32/2 respectively. In case of surgery, the patients required subtotal or total resection of the tongue. Initially, 2 courses of systemic chemotherapy and prophyractic whole neck irradiation (36Gy/20fr.) were performed. Subsequently, for gross tumor targets, PBT (33Gy/15fr.) and IACT were administered via the superficial temporal artery by continuous infusion of cisplatin with sodium thiosulphate. For PBT, 1 or 2 portals of 210 MeV proton beam were arranged in optimal angles to avoid overdosing the risk organ. Systemic chemotherapy was performed only for age of 70 years or younger. Result(s): The median follow-up was 27 months (range:8-48 months). Over all survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and local control (LC) rates at 2 years were 88%,78%, 80%, respectively. LC of cervical lymph node metastases at 2 years was 86%. As the early toxic event, grade 3 mucositis (32/45) and blood/bone marrow toxicity (22/45) were observed. Within 6 months after this therapy, mandibular osteomyelitis occurred in 1 case. Conclusion(s): PBT-IACT appeared to be safe and has a good LC rate for locally advanced tongue cancer. Furthermore, it is not inferior to surgery and can be one of the new effective treatment options for locally advanced tongue cancer.",Excluded
4296,"Intraoperative electron radiation therapy as an important treatment modality in retroperitoneal sarcoma Background: Local recurrence (LR) rates in patients with retroperitoneal sarcoma (RPS) are high, ranging from 40% to 80%, with no definitive studies describing the best way to administer radiation. Intraoperative electron beam radiation therapy (IOERT) provides a theoretical advantage for access to the tumor bed with reduced toxicity to surrounding structures. The goal of this study was to evaluate the role of IOERT in high-risk patients. Method(s): An institutional review board approved, single institution sarcoma database was queried to identify patients who received IOERT for treatment of RPS from 2/2001 to 1/2009. Data were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, Cox regression, and Fisher Exact tests. Result(s): Eighteen patients (median age 51 y, 25-76 y) underwent tumor resection with IOERT (median dose 1250 cGy) for primary (n = 13) and recurrent (n = 5) RPS. Seventeen patients received neoadjuvant radiotherapy. Eight high-grade and 10 low-grade tumors were identified. Median tumor size was 15 cm. Four patients died and two in the perioperative period. Median follow-up of survivors was 3.6 y. Five patients (31%) developed an LR in the irradiated field. Three patients with primary disease (25%) and two (50%) with recurrent disease developed an LR (P = 0.5). Four patients with high-grade tumors (57%) and one with a low-grade tumor (11%) developed an LR (P = 0.1). The 2- and 5-y OS rates were 100% and 72%. Two- and 5-y LR rates were 13% and 36%. Conclusion(s): Using a multidisciplinary approach, we have achieved low LR rates in our high-risk patient population indicating that IOERT may play an important role in managing these patients.

4180,"Triiodothyronine increases calcium loss in a bed rest antigravity model for space flight Bed rest has been used as a model to simulate the effects of space flight on bone metabolism. Thyroid hormones accelerate bone metabolism. Thus, supraphysiologic doses of this hormone might be used as a model to accelerate bone metabolism during bed rest and potentially simulate space flight. The objective of the study was to quantitate the changes in bone turnover after low doses of triiodothyronine (T(3)) added to short-term bed rest. Nine men and 5 women were restricted to bed rest for 28 days with their heads positioned 6 degrees below their feet. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or oral T(3) at doses of 50 to 75 microg/d in a single-blind fashion. Calcium balance was measured over 5-day periods; and T(3), thyroxine, thyroid-stimulating hormone, immunoreactive parathyroid hormone, osteocalcin, bone alkaline phosphatase, and urinary deoxypyridinoline were measured weekly. Triiodothyronine increased 2-fold in the men and 5-fold in the women during treatment, suppressing both thyroxine and thyroid-stimulating hormone. Calcium balance was negative by 300 to 400 mg/d in the T(3)-treated volunteers, primarily because of the increased fecal loss that was not present in the placebo group. Urinary deoxypyridinoline to creatinine ratio, a marker of bone resorption, increased 60% in the placebo group during bed rest, but more than doubled in the T(3)-treated subjects (P < .01), suggesting that bone resorption was enhanced by treatment with T(3). Changes in serum osteocalcin and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, markers of bone formation, were similar in T(3)- and placebo-treated subjects. Triiodothyronine increases bone resorption and fecal calcium loss in subjects at bed rest.",Excluded
4060,"Robotic stereotactic ablative radiotherapy for renal cell carcinoma in patients with impaired renal function Background: Robotic stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is currently under investigation as a noninvasive treatment option for patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). For radiation therapy of RCC, tumor motion and the need for high ablative doses while preserving the remaining renal parenchyma is a challenge. We aimed to analyze the safety and efficacy of robotic radiosurgery in RCC in a specific difficult subgroup of patients with impaired renal function. Method(s): We retrospectively identified all patients with RCC, treated with robotic SABR and motion compensation in our institution between 2012 and 2017. Either single fraction SABR of 24 or 25 Gy or 3 fractions of 12 Gy prescribed to the 70% isodose line was applied. Local control, overall survival, radiation side effects were evaluated together with renal function and tumor motion. Result(s): We analyzed data of 13 lesions treated in 10 patients with clear cell RCC and a mean age of 70.5 +/- 13.6 years (range: 48-87). Prior to SABR, 8 patients underwent previous complete and/or partial nephrectomy, 7 patients presented with chronic kidney disease >= stage 3. The median of minimum, mean and maximum planning target volume doses were 23.2, 29.5 and 35.0 Gy for single fraction and 24.4, 42.5 and 51.4 Gy for the three fractions regime. Persistent local control by robotic SABR was achieved in 9 out of 10 patients (92.3% of all lesions) within a median follow-up period of 27 month (range: 15-54). One patient underwent nephrectomy due to progressive disease and sufficient renal function of the contralateral kidney. Renal function remained stable with a mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 51.3 +/- 19.7 ml/min at baseline and 51.6 +/- 25.8 ml/min at follow-up. The largest respiratory-induced tumor motion was seen in superior-inferior direction, compensated by the CyberKnife with mean targeting errors of maximal 2.2 mm. Conclusion(s): Robotic SABR is technically feasible for the treatment of RCC in preexisting kidney disease with good local tumor control at about 2 years follow-up. Robotic SABR with motion tracking offers a valid treatment option for patients, who are at increased risk for progression to end-stage renal disease due to partial nephrectomy or ablative techniques.Copyright Â© 2019 The Author(s).",Excluded
4573,"The Price of Tumor Control: An Analysis of Rare Side Effects of Anti-CTLA-4 Therapy in Metastatic Melanoma from the Ipilimumab Network Background: Ipilimumab, a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) blocking antibody, has been approved for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and induces adverse events (AE) in up to 64% of patients. Treatment algorithms for the management of common ipilimumab-induced AEs have lead to a reduction of morbidity, e.g. due to bowel perforations. However, the spectrum of less common AEs is expanding as ipilimumab is increasingly applied. Stringent recognition and management of AEs will reduce drug-induced morbidity and costs, and thus, positively impact the cost-benefit ratio of the drug. To facilitate timely identification and adequate management data on rare AEs were analyzed at 19 skin cancer centers. Methods and Findings: Patient files (n = 752) were screened for rare ipilimumab-associated AEs. A total of 120 AEs, some of which were life-threatening or even fatal, were reported and summarized by organ system describing the most instructive cases in detail. Previously unreported AEs like drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), granulomatous inflammation of the central nervous system, and aseptic meningitis, were documented. Obstacles included patients delay in reporting symptoms and the differentiation of steroid-induced from ipilimumab-induced AEs under steroid treatment. Importantly, response rate was high in this patient population with tumor regression in 30.9% and a tumor control rate of 61.8% in stage IV melanoma patients despite the fact that some patients received only two of four recommended ipilimumab infusions. This suggests that ipilimumab-induced antitumor responses can have an early onset and that severe autoimmune reactions may reflect overtreatment. Conclusion(s): The wide spectrum of ipilimumab-induced AEs demands doctor and patient awareness to reduce morbidity and treatment costs and true ipilimumab success is dictated by both objective tumor responses and controlling severe side effects.

4596,"Association Between Radiation Dose and Outcomes With Postoperative Radiotherapy for N0-N1 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer PURPOSE: To review trends in the use of postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) in the modern era for N0-N1 margin-negative non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) following surgical resection and evaluate the association between PORT dose and overall survival., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of nonmetastatic stage II and III N0-N1 margin-negative NSCLC surgically treated patients within the National Cancer Data Base from 2003 to 2011. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed for multivariable analyses of overall survival and PORT dose. Radiation modalities included nonconformal beam radiation, 3-dimensional conformal radiation (3D-CRT), and intensity-modulated radiation therapy., RESULTS: We identified 2167 (6.7%) and 30,269 (93.3%) patients with surgically resected stage II or III N0-N1 margin-negative NSCLC who were treated with and without PORT, respectively. The proportion of patients treated with PORT (dose range, 45 to 74 Gy) decreased from 8.9% in 2003 to 2006 to 4.1% in 2010 to 2011. Among patients receiving PORT, the use of high-dose (60 to 74 Gy) PORT rose throughout the study period, starting at 34.8% in 2003 to 2006 and rising to 49.3% in 2010 to 2011.Overall, patients who received PORT had worse survival (hazards ratio=1.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-1.40) compared with those not receiving PORT. This association was unchanged when limited to patients receiving modern treatment with 3-CRT or intensity-modulated radiation therapy (hazards ratio=1.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.65)., CONCLUSIONS: The use of PORT for N0-N1 margin-negative NSCLC decreased from 2003 to 2011. We found no evidence of benefit from PORT for resected N0-N1 margin-negative NSCLC, regardless of dose or technique. PORT should be approached with caution in this group of patients, regardless of radiotherapy technique.",Included

Progesterone receptor immunoreactivity was detected in 70% of tumors. Estrogen receptor immunoreactivity was not detected. An inverse correlation was found between detection of progesterone receptors and the PFPCNA index. The overall 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 68%. The only prognostic factor that significantly affected PFS rate was the PFPCNA index. The 2-year PFS was 42% for tumors with a high PFPCNA index (value > or = 24%) and 91% for tumors with a low PFPCNA index (value < 24%). Tumors with a high PFPCNA index were 9.1 times as likely to recur as were tumors with a low PFPCNA index., CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study confirms the value of irradiation for dogs with incompletely resected meningiomas. Prognostic value of the PFPCNA index suggests-that duration of treatment and interval from surgery to start of irradiation may affect outcome. Loss of progesterone receptors in some tumors may be responsible for an increase in PFPCNA index and may indirectly affect prognosis after radiation therapy.",Included
3956,"Evaluation of routine low dose CT chest imaging performed during whole body I-131 imaging post remnant ablation for thyroid cancer Background: Radioactive Iodine (I-131) forms part of conventional treatment for thyroid cancer after thyroid surgery. The lungs are one of the common site for metastatic disease for thyroid malignancy, which can have a very protracted course. Often at subsequent follow-up, incidental lung nodules are identified. The significance of these are often unclear, due to the lack of baseline imaging. The Introduction of SPECT/CT cameras, has allowed the acquisition of low dose CT Chest (ldCT) during normal nuclear medicine studies, with minimal additional discomfort or inconvenience to the patient. Our department added routine SPECT/CT of the neck and chest, with formal reconstructions of the CT chest, as standard practice during whole body imaging post I-131 ablative therapy. We aim to review the usefulness and radiation burden of this practice at our institution. Method(s): We respectively reviewed the imaging I-131imaging and dose records of all the patients who underwent radioactive ablation treatment for thyroid malignancy from Aug 2011 to Dec 2015. We also reviewed the reconstructed CT chest imaging and dose records performed as part of the SPECT/CT to determine its usefulness. Result(s): 256 patients underwent I-131 ablation at our institution. 196 patients who present for initial ablation had ldCT that encompassed the majority of the chest, and 26 with findings. Average therapy dose in initial I-131 therapy was 104mCi. On the assumption of no residual thyroid present, the estimated dose was 160mSv. The additional radiation exposure from the ldCT Chest is estimated at 1.08mSv. Conclusion(s): Based on our calculations routine ldCT chest performed as part of SPECT/CT post I-131 ablation has resulted in increased dose of approximately 1.1mSv (at worse about 1%). This minimal additional dose, provides baseline for follow-up at the expense of incidental findings. Longer term follow-up, will be required to determine to usefulness of these additional ldCT studies.",Excluded

Eighty-four patients with esophageal cancer located in the upper or middle esophagus who were treated in our institute from 2005 to 2013 were diagnosed with cT4 at the time of admission. Eight (9.5%) of those 84 cT4 patients developed the esophago-bronchial/tracheal fistula. Out of eight patients, four (50%) who responded to prior chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy received esophageal bypass operations to manage their QOL and continue the following therapy. Not only nutrition and quality of life but also fighting spirit were maintained by allowing oral intake and resulted in completion of postoperative chemoradiotherapy in all 4 patients.

CMI., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors retrospectively analysed objective (contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR)) and subjective (4-point Likert scale) image quality of CTs after i.o. (n = 4, mean age (y) 57.0+/-11.0) versus i.v. (n = 20, mean age (y) 58.8+/-4.4) CMI. All patients underwent a native head CT scan, a cerebral CT angiography (CTA) and CTA of the supra-aortic vasculature as well as a chest and abdominal CT scan in the venous phase; one patient with an i.o. access additionally received a CTA of the lower limbs. Electronic patient records have been reviewed to determine i.o. access related complications., RESULTS: Both groups were consistent in age, heart rate, scan parameters including the flow rate of the contrast agent, resulting in comparable radiation dose levels. The image noise and CNR had no significant difference between the two groups. Scoring the delineation of the main vessels after i.o. CMI showed no significant difference to the i.v. group. There were no CT or i.o. access related complications observed., CONCLUSION: The i.o. access is a safe and suitable alternative for emergency CMI in CT. Using established protocols good to very good image quality can be achieved, comparable to i.v. CMI. We show for the first time, that i.o. CMI is also feasible for CTA imaging of the head and neck region as well as of pelvic and leg vessels.",Excluded

3768,"The relative frequency in which empiric dosages of radioiodine would potentially overtreat or undertreat patients who have metastatic well-differentiated thyroid cancer The dosage of (131)I for the treatment of metastatic well-differentiated thyroid cancer is typically selected empirically. Benua and Leeper implemented a method to estimate the maximum dosages of (131)I that could be administered to a patient so as not to exceed a maximum tolerated radiation absorbed dose (MTD), which was defined as 200 rads (cGy) to the blood. The objective of this study was to determine the frequency of (131)I treatments in which the patient (1) would have exceeded the MTD (i.e., overtreatment) or (2) would have been able to receive higher dosages of (131)I thereby delivering a potentially higher radiation absorbed dose to their metastases (i.e., undertreatment) had the patient been administered various assumed empiric dosages of (131)I. The dosimetrically-determined maximum tolerated radioactivities (MTA) to deliver 200 rads to the blood (MTD) were tabulated at our facility. Data were then grouped to determine the percentage of patients who would have received less than or more than the MTD for various assumed empiric dosages of (131)I. A total of 127 dosimetries were performed. For assumed empiric dosages of (131)I (100 mCi, 150 mCi, 200 mCi, 250 mCi, and 300 mCi), the percentage of treatments for which patients would have exceeded the MTD were less than 1%, 5%, 11%, 17%, and 22%, respectively, and could have received a higher dosage of (131)I were more than 99%, 95%, 89%, 83%, and 78%, respectively. A significant number of patients receiving various empiric dosages of (131)I may exceed 200 rads (cGy) to the blood (potential overtreating). Likewise, the majority of patients may be able to receive much higher dosages of (131)I relative to empiric dosages thereby delivering potentially higher radiation absorbed doses to the metastases without exceeding 200 rads (cGy) to the blood (potential undertreating).",Excluded
4562,"A single-institution phase I feasibility study of dose-escalated IMRT for non-operative locally advanced esophageal carcinoma Background and purpose: Radiation dose escalation to improve poor outcomes with chemoradiation in locally advanced esophageal carcinoma is limited in part by increased toxicity. This Phase I study investigates the use of IMRT to improve tolerability of dose escalation. Material(s) and Method(s): A single-institution, prospective study was conducted between 2007 and 2013 for individuals with inoperable esophageal carcinoma. Gross disease received 60 Gy in 30 fractions and at-risk sites received 54 Gy with simultaneous integrated boost. Concurrent chemotherapy primarily consisted of cisplatin/5-FU. The primary objective was to assess feasibility (<15% rate of grade 4-5 toxicity). Secondary objectives included assessment of overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), and locoregional (LRR) and distant recurrence. Result(s): Twenty-six patients were enrolled with median follow up of 17.6 months (range 0.1 to 152.0). The majority were AJCC 7th edition Stage III (54%), distal esophagus primary (81%), and adenocarcinoma histology (85%). Twenty-one patients (81%) completed their course of radiation therapy, while only 55% received 2 cycles of concurrent cisplatin/5-FU. One grade 5 and one grade 4 cardiac event occurred, both during chemoradiation and before receiving 50 Gy. The 3-year OS was 48.6% (95% CI: 32.5 to 72.2%) and PFS was 28.5% (95% CI: 14.6 to 55.5%). Half developed distant failure with LRR occurring in 10 patients (38%), isolated in 5 patients.

METHOD(S): Randomized double-blinded crossover study to evaluate the effect of topical oral application of 2 per thousand morphine solution in patients suffering from radiotherapy- and/or chemotherapy-induced OM. Participants assigned to either the morphine solution or a placebo mouthwash received one of the solutions days 1-3 and were then switched over to the other treatment for days 4-6. RESULT(S): Nine patients were randomized in both groups. All patients (mean age, 55.1 +/- 3.0) except one had head and neck cancers. Mean intensity of pain associated with mucosal injury (World Health Organization [WHO] mucositis > or =2) was on a 10-point visual analogue scale: 6.0 +/- 2.7). The analysis of variance (ANOVA) model that included morphine or placebo, day and time of mouthwash, and mouthwash effect shows that pain alleviation 1 hour after mouthwash was significantly influenced by the gesture of the mouthwash (p < 0.001 with either morphine or placebo) and almost by the efficiency of morphine (p = 0.020). Duration of pain relief was 123.7 (standard deviation [SD] +/- 98.2) minutes for morphine. Most other reported symptoms were present at the baseline and were probably associated with the main disease and not secondary to the morphine mouthwash. CONCLUSION(S): Our results suggest a possible analgesic effect of topical morphine in line with previous studies. However, more efforts must be made for the adjustment of systemic analgesics and the development of new alternatives to treat locally OM-associated pain.",Excluded
3801,"Patients' Perceptions of Proton Pump Inhibitor Risks and Attempts at Discontinuation: A National Survey OBJECTIVES: Little is known about how reports on the adverse effects of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) impact patients' perceptions of these drugs and medication use. We sought to determine patients' level of concern about PPI adverse effects and its association with attempts to discontinue these drugs., METHODS: This study is an online survey of US adults who use PPIs for gastroesophageal reflux disease. Topics included awareness of and concern about PPI adverse effects, prior discussion with providers, and attempts to stop PPI because of concern about adverse effects. For the primary analysis, we used logistic regression to identify associations between having attempted to stop PPI and concern about PPI-related adverse effects, a provider's recommendation to stop, risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), age, and gender., RESULTS: Among 755 patient participants, mean age was 49 years (s.d. 16), 71% were women, and 24% were at high risk of UGIB. Twenty percent of patients were able to write in >=1 reported adverse effect, and 46% endorsed awareness of >=1 adverse effect when presented with a list, most commonly chronic kidney disease (17%). Thirty-three percent of patients were slightly concerned, 32% somewhat concerned, and 14% extremely concerned about adverse effects. Twenty-four percent of patients had discussed PPI risks and benefits with a provider, and 9% had been recommended to stop. Thirty-nine percent had attempted to stop their PPI, most (83%) without a provider recommendation. Factors associated with an attempt at stopping PPI included: (i) provider recommendation to stop (odds ratio [OR] 3.26 [1.82-5.83]); (ii) concern about adverse effects (OR 5.13 [2.77-9.51] for slightly, 12.0 [6.51-22.2] for somewhat, and 19.4 [9.75-38.7] for extremely concerned); and (iii) female gender (OR 1.64 [1.12-2.39]). Patients at high risk of UGIB were as likely to have attempted to stop as others (OR 0.98 [0.66-1.44])., CONCLUSIONS: Concern about PPIs is common and strongly associated with attempts at discontinuation, even without a provider's recommendation. Notably, individuals at high risk of UGIB, who benefit from PPIs, were equally likely to have tried stopping PPIs as others. Providers should proactively discuss the risks and benefits of PPIs with their patients, who may otherwise make unwise decisions about PPI management on their own.",Excluded
4640,"A statewide teleradiology system reduces radiation exposure and charges in transferred trauma patients BACKGROUND: Trauma transfer patients routinely undergo repeat imaging because of inefficiencies within the radiology system. In 2009, the virtual private network (VPN) telemedicine system was adopted throughout Oregon allowing virtual image transfer between hospitals. The startup cost was a nominal $3,000 per hospital., METHODS: A retrospective review from 2007 to 2012 included 400 randomly selected adult trauma transfer patients based on a power analysis (200 pre/200 post). The primary outcome evaluated was reduction in repeat computed tomography (CT) scans. Secondary outcomes included cost savings, emergency department (ED) length of stay (LOS), and spared radiation. All data were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U and chi-square tests. P less than .05 indicated significance. Spared radiation was calculated as a weighted average per body region, and savings was calculated using charges obtained from Oregon Health and Science University radiology current procedural terminology codes., RESULTS: Four-hundred patients were included. Injury Severity Score, age, ED and overall LOS, mortality, trauma type, and gender were not statistically different between groups. The percentage of patients with repeat CT scans decreased after VPN implementation: CT abdomen (13.2% vs 2.8%, P < .01) and cervical spine (34.4% vs 18.2%, P < .01). Post-VPN, the total charges saved in 2012 for trauma transfer patients was $333,500, whereas the average radiation dose spared per person was 1.8 mSV. Length of stay in the ED for patients with Injury Severity Score less than 15 transferring to the ICU was decreased (P < .05)., CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a statewide teleradiology network resulted in fewer total repeat CT scans, significant savings, decrease in radiation exposure, and decreased LOS in the ED for patients with less complex injuries. The potential for health care savings by widespread adoption of a VPN is significant. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
4449,"Post-Fukushima radiation education for Japanese high school students in affected areas and its positive effects on their radiation literacy In post-Fukushima Japan, radiation education is very important, and the subject is being actively discussed. However, little information is available about the amount of knowledge students initially had about radiation or about how well radiation education improves their understanding. Using the questionnaire results of 717 students completed before and after radiation lectures held in three high schools in Fukushima, we examined the number of answers to the questionnaire aligned with the evidence base, and classified the students into clusters based on radiation-related behavior and attitudes to assess the effectiveness of the lecture. The contents of the lectures consisted of (i) scientific knowledge relating to radiation, (ii) results of radiation examinations conducted locally following the disaster and (iii) measures and precautions for daily radiation protection. Associations between the type of knowledge and radiation-related behavior and attitude were also examined to determine which type of knowledge was more important for deepening students' understanding of radiation. This study revealed that radiation education in high schools was effective for students with respect to acquiring relevant basic and practical knowledge; however, the effects of the radiation lecture differed greatly between schools, presumably due to differences in the delivery and atmosphere of the lecture. The present study also suggested that radiation education may positively transform student attitudes and behaviors related to radiation. To enable such a change in awareness, the acquisition of scientific knowledge is essential, for it enables individuals to make better decisions about important matters in their daily lives.",Excluded

Method(s): We included 157 consecutive patients who underwent SBRT alone for stage I non-small-cell lung cancer and whose pretreatment lung computed tomography images were available for retrospective review. The pretreatment computed tomography images were evaluated retrospectively for the presence of ILD. The incidence of RP, overall survival (OS) rate, and the incidence of disease progression and local progression were evaluated between patients with ILD (ILD[+]) and without ILD (ILD[-]). Result(s): Pre-existing ILD was identified in 20 patients. The median follow-up period was 39.5 months. The incidences of RP worse than grade 2 (>= Gr2 RP) and worse than grade 3 (>= Gr3 RP) were significantly higher in ILD(+) than ILD(-) (1 year >= Gr2 RP rate, 55.0% versus 13.3%; p < 0.001 and 1year >= Gr3 RP rate 10.0% versus 1.5%; p = 0.020). Multivariate analysis also indicated that ILD(+) was a risk factor for >= Gr2 and >= Gr3 RP, and the volume of the irradiated lung. The OS rate tended to be worse in ILD(+) than ILD(-) (3-year OS, 53.8% versus 70.8%; p = 0.28). No difference was observed in the disease progression or local progression rates. Conclusion(s): Pre-existing ILD was a significant risk factor for symptomatic and severe RP. Prescreening for ILD findings is important for determining the radiation pneumonitis risk when planning SBRT.Copyright Â© 2014 by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.",Excluded

The 3-year local control rate was 68.1% (RT 64.4% vs. CCRT 77.7%; p = 0.165). The 3-year DMFS rate was 56.1% (RT 52.6% vs. CCRT 61.7%; p = 0.314). In multivariate analysis, age >=66 years and pathologic stage III were significant poor prognostic factors for OS. Treatment failure occurred in 40 patients. Four patients had radiologically confirmed grade 3 radiation pneumonitis. Conclusion(s): In NSCLC, adjuvant RT or CCRT after curative surgery is a safe and feasible modality of treatment. OS gain was seen in patients less than 66 years. Postoperative CCRT showed a propensity of achieving better local control and improved disease-free survival compared to RT alone according to our data.Copyright Â© 2014 The Korean Society for Radiation Oncology.",Excluded
4080,"Optimization of CT protocols for thyroid and parathyroid SPECT/CT imaging The first national survey of patient exposures from hybrid imaging in Nuclear Medicine, performed in Bulgaria in 2014, revealed that SPECT/CT imaging of either thyroid or parathyroid glands was performed by applying a CT scan of the whole anatomical region, neck and chest, subject to SPECT. In most cases it was not necessary to perform a CT scan matching the whole SPECT region. The aim of this study is to propose an optimized CT protocol by reducing the CT scan length. The standard CT protocols for both types of examinations included neck and chest scan with the same exposure data. After the optimization the CT scan was restricted to the region of radiopharmaceutical uptake. Comparison of scan length, dose-length product (DLP) and effective dose from the old and the new protocols was performed. Software was used to estimate effective dose from the CT scan separately for males and females. A total of 17 patients undergoing either thyroid or parathyroid examination received CT of the neck and chest before the optimization. After the introduction of the optimized protocol, data were collected for a total of 70 patients. The mean scan length for males was reduced from 39 to 22 cm (42% reduction) and for females the reduction was from 44 to 22 cm (50%). The mean DLP was decreased by about 34% (from 138 to 91 mGy.cm) for * males and 48% (from 147 to 77 mGy.cm) for females respectively. The effective dose was reduced by 67 % (from 1.8 to 0.6 mSv) for males and 79% (from 2.8 to 0.6 mSv) ! for females. f The introduction of the optimized CT protocol for hybrid SPECT/CT imaging of the thyroid or parathyroid glands led to significant decrease of the total effective dose of the patients from these examinations.Copyright Â© 2018 Izdatelstvo Medicina i Fizkultura.

Method(s): Seventy-eight lesions of brain metastases in 49 lung cancer patients treated by stereotactic radiotherapy between September 2003 and December 2006 were analyzed. In the treatment planning, the planning target volume (PTV) was defined as an enhanced lesion plus 3 mm margin. A total dose of 39-42 Gy in three fractions was delivered to the isocenters of the PTV. Result(s): The median survival time after stereotactic radiotherapy was 17.4 months. The 1- and 2-year survival rates were 61% and 32%, respectively. The presence of extracranial tumors, the pre-treatment performance status, and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group recursive partitioning analysis class were significant prognostic factors. The 1-and 2-year local recurrence rates were 14% and 17%, respectively, with no serious acute toxic effect. Injuries involving brain necrosis were observed in six patients. New brain metastases or meningeal carcinomatosis was seen in more than half of the patients following treatment with stereotactic radiotherapy. Conclusion(s): Hypofactionated stereotactic radiotherapy with mMLC is considered to be an effective and safe modality for the treatment of brain metastases in lung cancer patients.

Patients and Methods: The records of elderly patients (age >75 years) with histologicallyconfirmed BCC, T1-2, treated to a total radiation dose of 25-30 Gy over 5-6 weeks, were retrospectively analyzed. Result(s): From February 2007-December 2010, 134 ambulatory patients with 159 BCCs were treated. Their median age was 82.5 years (range=75-103). Grade 1-2 skin acute toxicities were observed in 30.6% of patients (41/134). Complete responses were observed in 157 tumors in 132 patients. At the last follow-up, June 2014, no late toxicities had been noted; three patients had local recurrent disease.

4026,"Hedgehog pathway inhibitor in combination with radiation therapy for basal cell carcinomas of the head and neck: First clinical experience with vismodegib for locally advanced disease Background: Definitive radiotherapy and vismodegib, an oral inhibitor of the hedgehog pathway, are both established treatment options for locally advanced basal cell carcinomas (BCC). Both have shown good results in local tumor control; however, the effects concerning advanced tumors are often not of a lasting nature and to date no systematic data about the combination of the two modalities are available. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed four patients who received vismodegib and radiotherapy in combination. Radiation doses varied between 50.4 Gy and 66.0 Gy. Three patients had recurrent BCC. One patient had locoregional lymph node involvement. Vismodegib was taken once a day (150 mg) during the entire time of irradiation and beyond upon instructions of the attending dermatologist. Result(s): In three cases a persistent complete response was observed, in one case the tumor remained stable for approximately 6 months until further tumor progression was documented. The combined therapy was well tolerated in all cases. No exceptional side effects pointing at a drug-radiation interaction were observed. Conclusion(s): The combination of vismodegib and radiation seems feasible and the initial results are promising. In our cohort, there was no increase in unexpected side effects. Further research is needed to evaluate the significance of this combined therapy.Copyright Â© 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
4110,"The origin of Europeans is not rooted in the Middle East but in Southern East Asia The study of tooth crown variables has proven useful in the assessment of human origin and dispersal. I show that multivariate analysis of quantified total tooth structure from dental X-rays is a powerful phylogenetic methodology. From an analysis of the complex global dental phenotype ('GDP,' composed of ~ 30 root, pulp, crown, and enamel variables per tooth), a representative Western European population was found to associate with Southeast Asians, while Mongolians formed a tight cluster with all Native Americans. The results suggest that either an emigrant wave, or waves, of modern humans emerged from Africa and with time segregated into at least three groups: Australian aborigines, Europeans, and Southeast Asians, or less likely due to genetic and archaeologic observations, a southern Asia origin of all modem humans from an emigrant African hominid. Both hypotheses portend an early evolution of the European genotype and support the argument that Europeans are principally derived from Upper Paleolithic hunter-gatherers, and thus Middle East Neolithic people did not have a major genetic impact on Europeans.",Excluded
4826,"Alterations in expression and structure of the DNA repair gene XRCC1 The repair-associated gene XRCC1 was previously cloned by complementing the hamster mutant EM9, which has a high rate of spontaneous SCE and hypersensitivity to DNA damaging agents. In analyzing XRCC1 gene expression, similar levels of steady-state mRNA were found in normal cells, Bloom's syndrome cells with altered SCE, and in squamous carcinoma cells with differential X-ray sensitivity. An EcoRI restriction fragment-length polymorphism previously identified in XRCC1 did not correlate with the repair phenotypes of these cells. The mRNA of XRCC1 decreased to 20-40% after treatment of cells with a DNA damaging agent. XRCC1 also showed tissue specific expression in rats. The mRNA levels were high in testis (7-8 fold), ovary (3-4 fold) and brain (4-5 fold), when compared with those in intestine, liver and spleen (1-2 fold). These data and the high levels of XRCC1 protein detected in testis indicate that XRCC1 may play an important role in DNA processing during meiogenesis and recombination in germ cells.",Excluded
4621,"Ultraviolet-B induces ERCC6 repression in lens epithelium cells of age-related nuclear cataract through coordinated DNA hypermethylation and histone deacetylation Background: Ultraviolet-B (UVB) exposure attributes to the formation of age-related nuclear cataract (ARNC), which is mediated with DNA damage. DNA damage, an important factor for pathogenesis of ARNC, is induced by UVB, and is generally resolved by the nucleotide excision repair (NER) repair mechanism. Cockayne syndrome complementation group B (CSB) protein coded by ERCC6 is a vital component for NER. However, we found no association between selected ERCC6 polymorphisms and ARNC. In this study, we investigated whether UVB exposure could alter ERCC6 expression and the process could involve epigenetic changes of DNA methylation and/or histone acetylation of ERCC6 in the lens epithelial cells (LECs). We also assessed the involvement of those coordinated changes in lens tissue from ARNC patients. Result(s): mRNA and protein expression of ERCC6 in lens tissue (LECs) were lower in ARNCs than those in the controls. This reduction corresponded to methylation of a CpG site at the ERCC6 promoter and histone modifications (methylation and acetylation) nearby this site. UVB-treated human lens epithelium B3 (HLE-B3) and 239T cell presented (1) increased apoptosis, suggesting reduced UV-damage repair, (2) hypermethylation of the CpG site located at position -441 (relative to transcription start site) within the binding region for transcriptional factor Sp1 in the ERCC6 promoter, (3) the enhancement of histone H3K9 deacetylation, (4) induction in DNA methyltransferases 3b (DNMT3b) and histone deacetylase1 (HDAC1) associated to the CpG site of ERCC6 by CHIP assay. Conclusion(s): These findings suggest an orchestrated mechanism triggered by UVB radiation where the concurrent association of specific hypermethylation CpG site, H3K9 deacetylation of ERCC6, and repression of ERCC6 gene expression. Taken together, with the similar changes in the lens tissue from ARNC patients, our data unveiled a possible mechanism of epigenetic modification of DNA repair gene in the pathogenesis of ARNC.Copyright Â© 2016, The Author(s).",Excluded
4184,"Radon testing in rapid access lung clinics: an opportunity for secondary prevention Background: Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas and a level 1 carcinogen. It acts synergistically with cigarette smoke to cause lung cancer. In Ireland, radon is estimated to be associated with 13 % of all lung cancers. Rapid access lung cancer clinics (RALC's) were established in the UK and Ireland to improve lung cancer management outcomes. There has been no attempt to date to provide advice on household radon exposure assessments in this setting. Aim(s): We performed a prospective feasibility study of radon assessment in our RALC to test the hypothesis that patients would avail of this service and that it would provide an opportunity for secondary prevention in at risk persons. Method(s): We investigated household radon levels in consecutive patients who were newly referred with symptoms of lung cancer to the RALC in Galway University Hospital, Ireland over a 6-month period. Result(s): Of 50 patients enrolled, 42 returned valid results. Overall 21 % of patients had radon levels recorded above the national reference level. Only 5 % of patients were aware of the association between radon gas and lung cancer. Smokers were significantly less likely to engage fully in radon testing. Conclusion(s): The development of RALC's offers a novel opportunity to integrate the concepts of radon exposure, cigarette smoking and the development of lung cancer, and to reinforce this message in the minds of at risk patients.Copyright Â© 2016, Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland.",Excluded
4720,"The effectiveness of radiotherapy for painful humeroscapular periarthritis (PHS) Study aim. The analysis of radiotherapy effectiveness as a treatment modality for periarthritis humeroscapularis (PHS) Material and method. 30 patients irradiated because of PHS (1 Gy per fraction up to 6 Gy). Follow-up ranged from 1 to 216 months. The arm mobility and pain relief were assessed at the completion of radiotherapy and during follow-up examinations. Correlation between some biological factors evaluated before radiotherapy and the aforementioned endpoints was assessed using Spearman's test. Results. The mean degree of pain relief ranged from 42% to 93%. Mean improvement of arm abduction, flexion and reflexion angles ranged from 24degree to 83degree, from 47degree to 91degree and from 4degree to 13degree, respectively. The sole prognostic factor found in this study was the degree of orthopedic disability before the treatment. Small impairment at the onset correlated with significant improvement after radiotherapy. No radiation toxicity or secondary malignancies were observed. Conclusion. Radiotherapy of PHS is an effective, safe and economical treatment modality, which could form an alternative for standard orthopedic and pharmacological treatment in recurrent or persistent disease.",Excluded
3909,"Pelvis and total hip arthroplasty acetabular component orientations in sitting and standing positions: measurements reproductibility with EOS imaging system versus conventional radiographies INTRODUCTION: The literature has recently underlined the interest of pelvic and acetabular component orientation measurements in the standing and sitting position. Radiographic follow-up of total hip arthroplasty (THA) is based on standard AP and lateral X-rays. The use of EOS TM 2D imaging system reduces patient's radiation exposure compared to conventional X-rays. However, using this system, the validity and reproducibility of angular measurements, have not been studied yet for the measurement of pelvic and acetabular parameters in patients with THA., HYPOTHESIS: The EOS TM 2D imaging system offers similar advantages to conventional X-rays in the measurement of pelvic and acetabular orientation parameters which are commonly used., PATIENTS AND METHOD: Five angular parameters characterizing pelvic tilt and acetabular cup orientation were determined using the same digital measurement Imagika TM software based on two series of standard X-rays and EOS TM 2D images acquired in both standing and sitting positions. Radiographs from 50 patients with unilateral THA were measured three times by two observers. Intra- and interobserver reproducibility using each method was independently studied then paired comparison was performed., RESULTS: The ICC and Spearman rank correlation coefficient demonstrated an excellent EOS/conventional X-ray correlation. According to the parameters, the mean difference between these two imaging modalities ranged from 0.30degree to 3.43degree (P<0.05). The intra- and interobserver variability ranged from +/- 2.97degree to +/- 6.46degree using the EOS TM imaging system and from +/- 4.26degree to +/- 10.22degree using conventional X-rays (P<0.05)., DISCUSSION: The EOS TM 2D imaging system may replace conventional X-rays in the assessment and monitoring of pelvic and acetabular cup orientation in THA., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.

4332,"Early Experience and Lessons Learnt with Customized Fenestrated Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Reconstruction for Aortic Arch Pathology in an Asian Population Purpose: Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is the preferred treatment of descending thoracic aorta pathology. However, TEVAR in the aortic arch remains challenging. Customized fenestrated TEVAR (fTEVAR) allows extension of the proximal seal zone, while preserving the involved supra-aortic vessels. There is a paucity of information on fTEVAR; hence, we aim to evaluate our early experience and lessons learnt with fTEVAR in the aortic arch. Method(s): This is a retrospective single-centre review of fTEVAR endografts for aortic arch pathology over 24 months. Seven patients with mean age of 72.8 years (range 63-84 years) were included. A total of 15 supra-aortic branches were treated [left subclavian artery (n = 7), left carotid artery (n = 5), innominate artery (n = 1), bovine origins (n = 2)], involving a total of nine fenestrations and six scallops. No supra-aortic debranching was required. Result(s): Median follow-up was 15 months. Technical success was 86%, and one patient had malalignment of the fTEVAR endograft requiring salvage with double chimney technique. There were no early endoleaks with one type 2 endoleak detected in the follow-up period. Two access site pseudoaneurysms required intervention. There was a learning curve involved reflected by higher than average mean operative time of 224 min with average radiation dose of 3029.86 mGy and mean contrast volume of 283 mls. Conclusion(s): fTEVAR in the aortic arch is feasible in Asian patients, although there was a learning curve involved, and careful patient selection is advised. Longer term data in a larger population are required to assess its durability.Copyright Â© 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature and the Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe (CIRSE).",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): Twenty-two consecutive patients with clinical symptoms of neurovascular thoracic outlet syndrome were examined by 1.0 T MR unit. Examinations were studied by three-dimensional contrast-enhanced MR angiography with the arms positioned in abduction and adduction in the same patients.

A common mouthwash comprising diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid is also widely used., Objective: To evaluate the effect of doxepin mouthwash or diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash for the treatment of oral mucositis-related pain., Design, Setting, and Participants: A phase 3 randomized trial was conducted from November 1, 2014, to May 16, 2016, at 30 US institutions and included 275 patients who underwent definitive head and neck radiotherapy, had an oral mucositis pain score of 4 points or greater (scale, 0-10), and were followed up for a maximum of 28 days., Interventions: Ninety-two patients were randomized to doxepin mouthwash (25 mg/5 mL water); 91 patients to diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid; and 92 patients to placebo., Main Outcome and Measures: The primary end point was total oral mucositis pain reduction (defined by the area under the curve and adjusted for baseline pain score) during the 4 hours after a single dose of doxepin mouthwash or diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash compared with a single dose of placebo. The minimal clinically important difference was a 3.5-point change. The secondary end points included drowsiness, unpleasant taste, and stinging or burning. All scales ranged from 0 (best) to 10 (worst)., Results: Among the 275 patients randomized (median age, 61 years; 58 [21%] women), 227 (83%) completed treatment per protocol. Mucositis pain during the first 4 hours decreased by 11.6 points in the doxepin mouthwash group, by 11.7 points in the diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash group, and by 8.7 points in the placebo group. The between-group difference was 2.9 points (95% CI, 0.2-6.0; P = .02) for doxepin mouthwash vs placebo and 3.0 points (95% CI, 0.1-5.9; P = .004) for diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash vs placebo. More drowsiness was reported with doxepin mouthwash vs placebo (by 1.5 points [95% CI, 0-4.0]; P = .03), unpleasant taste (by 1.5 points [95% CI, 0-3.0]; P = .002), and stinging or burning (by 4.0 points [95% CI, 2.5-5.0]; P < .001).

Method(s): Between January 2012 and May 4, 2019, 4,659 CTO PCIs were included in the PROGRESS-CTO registry, of which 935 (20%) had a prior unsuccessful attempt. Of those 935 patients, 119 (13%) had prior SPM. We analyzed the outcomes of the 58 SPM procedures for which data were available, as well as the outcomes of the 60 subsequent CTO PCI attempts. Result(s): Mean patient age was 67 +/- 9 years and 86% were men. Patients had high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors such as dyslipidemia (91%), hypertension (93%) diabetes (48%), prior PCI (61%), and prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery (47%). The target CTO lesions often had proximal cap ambiguity (54%), moderate/severe calcification (73%), moderate/severe tortuosity (63%), and high J-CTO score (mean 3.2 +/- 1.1). The technical and procedural success of subsequent CTO PCI were high (83% for both) with an acceptable rate of in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular events (3.3%). Technical and procedural success were higher for repeat attempts that were performed >=60 days after the index CTO PCI (94% vs. 69%, p =.015).

Method(s): One hundred and sixteen patients were retrospectively evaluated. Group A (n = 59) was examined on second-generation DSCT with automated TVA and filtered back projection. Group B (n = 57) was examined on a third-generation DSCT with automated TVA and ADMIRE. Age, body diameter, attenuation of several anatomic structures, noise, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), radiation dose (CTDIvol) and size-specific dose estimates (SSDE) were assessed. Diagnostic acceptability was rated by three readers. Result(s): Age (p = 0.87) and body diameter (p = 0.075) did not differ significantly. Tube voltage in Group A was set automatically to 100 kV for all patients (n = 59), and to 70 kV (n = 2), 80 kV (n = 5), and 90 kV (n = 50) in Group B. Noise was reduced and CNR was increased significantly (p < 0.001). Diagnostic acceptability was rated high in both groups, with better ratings in Group B (p < 0.001). SSDE was reduced by 34 % in Group B (20.38 +/- 1.63 mGy vs. 13.04 +/- 1.50 mGy, p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Combination of automated TVA and ADMIRE in neck CT using third-generation DSCT results in a substantial radiation dose reduction with low noise and increased CNR. Key Points: * Third-generation DSCT provides automated tube voltage adaptation with an increment of 10 kV. * 10 kV increment optimizes scans to the patient's neck anatomy. * TVA combined with ADMIRE significantly lower radiation dose in contrast-enhanced neck CT. * TVA in combination with ADMIRE reduces noise and increases SNR and CNR. * Image analysis quoted less noise and better diagnostic acceptability in third-generation DSCT.Copyright Â© 2015, European Society of Radiology.",Excluded
3841,"Late gastrointestinal complications after pelvic radiotherapy: radiation enteritis INTRODUCTION: Radiation enteritis is a complication of radiation therapy for pelvic tumours. It appears after a variable period of time and is often progressive. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyse our experience of 77 cases (52 females and 25 males) diagnosed with radiation enteritis or proctitis between 1986 and 2006. RESULT(S): The most frequent location of radiation injury is ileum (55 patients, 71%), followed by rectum (22 patients, 28%). Twenty-eight patients (36%) were medically managed and 49 (64%) required surgical treatment. In 41 (53%) of the patients the affected region was resected, in 5 (7%) a by-pass was performed and in 3 (4%) a terminal colostomy. Surgical mortality was 4% (3 cases) and the complication rate 9% (7 cases). Twelve patients (16%) presented recurrence of radiation-related illness. Excluding those cases deceased because of tumoral progression, 5-year survival rate was 90% and 10-year survival rate 83%. CONCLUSION(S): Radiation enteritis must be initially conservatively managed, but in those cases without response, surgery is indicated. Surgical treatment should not be delayed fearing postoperative complications, which are more susceptible to appear in deteriorated patients. If technically possible, the affected region should be resected, because complications may appear later at this damaged location.",Excluded

4112,"Postoperative low-dose follow-up computed tomography for patients with stomach cancer: Optimal blending ratio of adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction for image quality and diagnostic performance OBJECTIVE: To compare the diagnostic performance of adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction applied low-dose computed tomography (CT) (LDCT) with that of the standard-dose CT (SDCT) for local recurrence in patients with stomach cancer. METHOD(S): Seventy-nine consecutive patients who had undergone surgical resection for stomach cancer were enrolled. To monitor recurrence, SDCT (120 kilovolt peak [kVp], 200mAs) had been performed. The LDCT (120 kVp, 100 mA s) was taken, and images were reconstructed with 4 levels of adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) blending (0%, 30%, 50%, and 70%). Two blinded radiologists recorded the diagnostic confidence scores for local recurrence in each data set using a 5-point scale. Endoscopic biopsy results served as the reference standard. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to calculate the diagnostic performance. RESULT(S): The diagnostic performance of LDCT with variable ASIR blending ratios was comparable to that of SDCT (area under ROC curve, 0.727-0.734, 0.687, respectively, P > 0.05). CONCLUSION(S): The diagnostic performance of ASIR applied LDCT is comparable to that of SDCT. Copyright Â© 2014 by Lippincott Williams &Wilkins.",Excluded
3967,"Dosimetric Predictors of Hypothyroidism After Radical Intensity-modulated Radiation Therapy for Non-metastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma AIMS: To investigate dosimetric predictors of hypothyroidism after radical intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for non-metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with non-metastatic NPC treated with radical IMRT from 2008 to 2013 were reviewed. Serum thyroid function tests before and after IMRT were regularly monitored. Univariable and multivariable analyses were carried out for predictors of biochemical and clinical hypothyroidism., RESULTS: In total, 149 patients were recruited. After a median follow-up duration of 3.1 years, 33 (22.1%) and 21 (14.1%) patients developed biochemical and clinical hypothyroidism, respectively. Eight (24.2%) patients who had biochemical hypothyroidism developed clinical hypothyroidism later. Univariable and multivariable analyses revealed that the volume of the thyroid (P=0.002, multivariable), VS60 (the absolute thyroid volume spared from 60 Gy or less) (P<0.001, multivariable) and VS45 (P<0.001, multivariable) of the thyroid were significant predictors of biochemical hypothyroidism. The freedom from biochemical hypothyroidism was longer for those whose VS60 >= 10 cm(3) (mean 90.9 versus 62.6 months; P<0.001) and VS45 >= 5 cm(3) (mean 91.9 versus 65.2 months; P=0.001). Similarly multivariable analyses revealed that VS60 (P=0.001) and VS45 (P=0.003) were significant predictors of clinical hypothyroidism. The freedom from clinical hypothyroidism was longer for those whose VS60 >= 10 cm(3) (91.5 versus 73.3 months; P=0.002) and VS45 >= 5 cm(3) (91.5 versus 75.9 months; P=0.007)., CONCLUSIONS: VS60 and VS45 of the thyroid should be considered important dose constraints against hypothyroidism without compromising target coverage during IMRT optimisation for NPC.

3759,"The Assessment of the Integrated Antioxidant System of the Body in the Course of Radon Therapy: A Pilot Study Introduction. The sources of Reactive Oxidative Species (ROS) in the organism are the respiratory processes occurring in cells catalyzed by different enzymes. Operation of ROS is balanced by antioxidants, the compounds; although present in low concentrations, they significantly inhibit the degree of oxidation of particular molecules. The Aim of the Study. The aim of this study was to assess the changes in the integrated antioxidant system under the influence of radon therapy in osteoarthritis patients. Material and Methods. Observation included 35 patients suffering from degenerative joints and disc disease (mean age 56.5 years) undergoing radon water therapy and control group that consisted of 15 osteoarthritis patients (mean age 54.2) without contact with radon water. Before therapy and after 18 days of treatment, serum total antioxidant status (TAS) was assessed with the use of standard colorimetric assay. Results. In the study group, we observed trends to increase TAS concentration, whereas, in the control group, TAS concentration was decreasing. Conclusions. (1) Radon waters treatment influenced the level of TAS of osteoarthritis patients treated with the radon water. (2) The change in TAS concentrations in the study group may be the result of low doses of ionizing radiation, but further studies on larger patient's groups are demanded.

3970,"Lifetime cancer risks from occupational radiation exposure among workers at interventional radiology departments PURPOSE: Interventional medical radiation workers represent an under-studied population worldwide, although they receive relatively high occupational radiation doses. This study aimed to estimate the lifetime cancer risk from occupational radiation exposure among workers at interventional radiology departments. METHOD(S): A field survey of interventional medical workers in nationwide branches of the Korean Society of Interventional Radiology was conducted in 2017. Organ-specific radiation doses were estimated using national dose registry data and conversion coefficients provided by the International Commission on Radiological Protection. Lifetime attributable risk (LAR) and lifetime fractional risk (LFR) were calculated based on realistic exposure scenarios using a radiation risk assessment tool. RESULT(S): LARs from occupational radiation exposure until the age of retirement for all cancers combined were 338 (90.3-796.1), 121 (33.5-288.7), and 156 (41.1-390.6) per 100,000 individuals for male radiologists, male radiologic technologists, and female nurses, respectively. LFR for all cancers combined ranged from 0.22% (0.06-0.53) to 0.63% (0.17-1.47). Regarding the organ site, the highest LAR and LFR among all groups were observed for thyroid cancer. CONCLUSION(S): This study provides timely evidence of potential cancer burden from the current levels of occupational radiation exposure among workers at interventional radiology departments. The risks varied by occupational groups, and workers, particularly interventional radiologists, need to be carefully monitored for radiation.",Included

The aim of the present study was to estimate the biodistribution and clinical radiation dosimetry of18F-P3BZA in healthy volunteers and perform a preliminary clinical application for PET/CT imaging in melanoma patients. Method(s):18F-P3BZA was produced efficiently with a radiosynthesizer. Six healthy volunteers were injected with18F-P3BZA (211.7 +/- 15.4 MBq) followed by serial whole-body PET/CT scans and blood tests to assess biodistribution, pharmacokinetic, and radiation dosimetry at 10 min, 1 h, 2 h, and 4 h after injection. The vital signs of volunteers were recorded in regular intervals during the imaging sessions. The effective dose for each subject after the medical internal radiation dosimetry schema was calculated with OLINDA/EXM software. For the preliminary clinical application, 5 patients with suspected melanomas underwent18F-P3BZA PET/CT imaging at 10 min and 1 h after injection. All patients also underwent18F-FDG PET/CT scans on the third day to compare the potential diagnostic ability of18F-P3BZA with18F-FDG. Result(s): The radiochem-istry yield of18F-P3BZA labeling was 12.3% +/- 3.9%, and the purity of18F-P3BZA after purification and formulation was higher than 99.5%. The highest uptake of18F-P3BZA was in the liver with an SUVmean of 8.3 +/- 1.0 at 10 min after injection. The resultant whole-body effective dose was 0.0193 mSv/MBq.18F-P3BZA showed high uptake and suggested an ability for specific imaging of melanoma and its metastasis in patients. The average SUVmean of18F-P3BZA and18F-FDG in tumors was 19.7 +/- 5.3 and 10.8 +/- 2.7 at 60 min after injection. Conclusion(s): Our study suggests that18F-P3BZA is safe and compatible for clinical use. The first-in-human clinical application to melanoma showed favorable delineated tumors in patients, demonstrating the potential of18F-P3BZA for diagnostic PET imaging of melanoma.Copyright Â© 2019 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging.",Excluded

4172,"Radical radiation treatment of invasive and locally advanced bladder carcinoma in elderly patients A total of 146 patients with invasive or locally advanced carcinoma of the bladder (T2-T4) underwent radiation treatment. A significantly higher complete response rate was observed with doses equal to or above 55 Gy and with doses corresponding to cumulative radiation effect (CRE) values of 1700 radiation effect units (reu) or more. In multivariate analysis, decreasing time from the first diagnosis of bladder carcinoma to radiation treatment and 1 or more transurethral resections was associated with a significant increase in survival; increases in T category and sedimentation rate were negative prognostic factors. Although both radiation dose and CRE levels had a significant effect on survival in univariate analysis, an increase in CRE levels alone was associated with a significant increase in survival in multivariate analysis. However, the most important predictor of survival was whether the patient showed a complete local response or not. This study emphasises the importance of treating patients with an adequate radiation dose over a short period of time in order to achieve the maximum radiobiological effect and thereby increase the possibility of cure.",Excluded
4827,"The use of autologous platelet and plasma products in salvage neck dissections: a prospective clinical study evaluating early and late wound healing OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of autologous platelet and plasma adhesives (APA) on postoperative drainage and soft-tissue fibrosis following neck dissections., DESIGN: This was a blinded comparative prospective cohort study done as two parts: part one evaluated early post-surgical outcomes and part two evaluated late tissue fibrosis., METHOD: Salvage neck dissections were stratified into two groups based on severity of prior treatment. High risk patients were defined as those who had previously undergone chemoradiation therapy and autologous platelet adhesives were administered to the surgical wound intraoperatively. The low risk group consisted of patients undergoing salvage neck dissections following radiation only and acted as controls. Part one evaluated postsurgical wound drainage as the primary outcome as well as length of hospital stay and complications. Part two evaluated late postoperative tissue fibrosis by comparing neck skin using the Cutometer. R2 and F0 were the specific Cutometer parameters for quantifying the viscoelastic properties of the skin., RESULTS: Postoperative wound drainage was significantly less (253.7 vs. 345.8) in the autologous platelet adhesive group as compared to the control group (p less than 0.03). Length of stay in the APA group versus the control group was 3.13 and 3.86 days respectively (p less than 0.004). Both R2 and F0 measurements showed improved viscoelastic properties of the skin in the APA group (R2 p less than 0.05, F0 p less than 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: APA application following salvage neck dissections may reduce early postperative wound drainage and improve long-term skin quality.",Excluded
4645,"Shifts in broadband power and alpha peak frequency observed during long-term isolation Prolonged periods of social isolation and spatial confinement do not only represent an issue that needs to be faced by a few astronauts during space missions, but can affect all of us as recently shown during pandemic situations. The fundamental question, how the brain adapts to periods of sensory deprivation and re-adapts to normality, has only received little attention. Here, we use eyes closed and eyes open resting-state electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings to investigate how neural activity is altered during 120 days of isolation in a spatially confined, space-analogue environment. After disentangling oscillatory patterns from 1/f activity, we show that isolation leads to a reduction in broadband power and a flattening of the 1/f spectral slope. Beyond that, we observed a reduction in alpha peak frequency during isolation, but did not find strong evidence for isolation-induced changes that are of oscillatory nature. Critically, all effects reversed upon release from isolation. These findings suggest that isolation and concomitant sensory deprivation lead to an enhanced cortical deactivation which might be explained by a reduction in the mean neuronal population firing rate.",Excluded
4238,"Combined FET PET/MRI radiomics differentiates radiation injury from recurrent brain metastasis Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of combined textural feature analysis of contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) and static O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) PET for the differentiation between local recurrent brain metastasis and radiation injury since CE-MRI often remains inconclusive. Method(s): Fifty-two patients with new or progressive contrast-enhancing brain lesions on MRI after radiotherapy (predominantly stereotactic radiosurgery) of brain metastases were additionally investigated using FET PET. Based on histology (n = 19) or clinicoradiological follow-up (n = 33), local recurrent brain metastases were diagnosed in 21 patients (40%) and radiation injury in 31 patients (60%). Forty-two textural features were calculated on both unfiltered and filtered CE-MRI and summed FET PET images (20-40 min p.i.), using the software LIFEx. After feature selection, logistic regression models using a maximum of five features to avoid overfitting were calculated for each imaging modality separately and for the combined FET PET/MRI features. The resulting models were validated using cross-validation. Diagnostic accuracies were calculated for each imaging modality separately as well as for the combined model. Result(s): For the differentiation between radiation injury and recurrence of brain metastasis, textural features extracted from CE-MRI had a diagnostic accuracy of 81% (sensitivity, 67%; specificity, 90%). FET PET textural features revealed a slightly higher diagnostic accuracy of 83% (sensitivity, 88%; specificity, 75%). However, the highest diagnostic accuracy was obtained when combining CE-MRI and FET PET features (accuracy, 89%; sensitivity, 85%; specificity, 96%).

3807,"Association of time of occurrence of electrical heart storms with environmental physical activity Aim Many publications in recent decades have reported a temporal link between medical events and environmental physical activity. The aim of this study was to analyze the time of occurrence of electrical heart storms against levels of cosmological parameters. Methods The sample included 82 patients (71 male) with ischemic cardiomyopathy treated with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator at a tertiary medical center in 1999-2012 (5,114 days). The time of occurrence of all electrical heart storms, defined as three or more events of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation daily, was recorded from the defibrillator devices. Findings were analyzed against data on solar, geomagnetic, and cosmic ray (neutron) activity for the same time period obtained from space institutions in the United States and Russia. Results Electrical storms occurred in all months of the year, with a slight decrease in July, August, and September. Most events took place on days with lower-than-average levels of solar and geomagnetic activity and higher-than-average levels of cosmic ray (neutron) activity. There was a significant difference in mean daily cosmic ray activity between the whole observation period and the days of electrical storm activity (P = 0.0001). Conclusion These data extend earlier findings on the association of the timing of cardiac events and space weather parameters to the most dangerous form of cardiac arrhythmia-electric storms. Further studies are needed to delineate the pathogenetic mechanism underlying this association. Â© 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
4287,"Preoperative radiotherapy contributes to induction of proliferative activity of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating T-cells in oral squamous cell carcinoma In order to evaluate host immune response to cancer, many methods have been applied. However, in the field of oral squamous cell carcinoma, evaluation of host immune response on the basis of proliferative activity of tumor-infiltrating T-cells (TIL) has not been reported. Therefore, we applied double immunohistochemical staining of proliferation markers Ki-67 and CD8 to surgically resected and paraffin-embedded tissue sections for 35 cases of oral squamous cell carcinoma. With this method, there was a significant correlation between the percentage of Ki-67+CD8+TIL and the intra-tumor epithelium infiltration rate of CD8+TIL (P=0.0237). In the process of analysis, we found that the proliferative activity of CD8+TIL tended to correlate (P=0.0859) with clinical N factor (lymph node metastasis), which was previously reported to suppress host immune response. We therefore assumed there was another factor inducing host immune response. The proliferative activity of CD8+TIL was well correlated with preoperative radiotherapy (P=0.0200) while there was no significant correlation between the proliferative activity of CD8+TIL and other clinical factors; age, tumor size, clinical stage, pathological N factor (P=0.5410, 0.7769, 0.1041, and 0.1072, respectively).

We previously demonstrated the efficacy of BCP and total fresh bone marrow (TBM) in regenerating irradiated bone defect. The aim of this study was to know if adding MSC to BCP + TBM mixture could improve the bone formation in irradiated bone defects. Twenty-four Lewis 1A rats received a single dose of 20 Gy to the hind limbs. MSC were sampled from non-irradiated donors and amplified in proliferative, and a part in osteogenic, medium. 3 weeks after, defects were created on femurs and tibias, which were filled with BCP alone, BCP + TBM, BCP + TBM + uncommitted MSC, or BCP + TBM + committed MSC. 3 weeks after, samples were removed and prepared for qualitative and quantitative analysis. The rate of bone ingrowth was significantly higher after implantation of BCP + TBM mixture. The adding of a high concentration of MSC, committed or not, didn't improve the bone regeneration. The association BCP + TBM remains the most efficient material for bone substitution in irradiated areas.Copyright Â© 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Excluded

To evaluate the efficiency of DVT in comparison with OPG in the assessment of bony condylar changes in patients of TMJ pain. Methods. 100 temporomandibular joints of 62 patients with the complaint of temporomandibular joint pain were included in the study. DVT and OPG radiographs were taken for all the 100 joints. Three observers interpreted the DVT and OPG radiograph for the bony changes separately for two times with an interval of one week. The bony changes seen in the condyle were given coding from 0 to 6. (0: Normal, 1: Erosion, 2: Flattening, 3: Osteophyte, 4: Sclerosis, 5: Resorption, and 6: other changes). Interobserver and intraobserver variability was assessed with one-way ANOVA statistics. Z test was used to see the significant difference between OPG and DVT. Results . In the present study the interexaminer reliability for OPG and DVT was 0.903 and 0.978, respectively. Intraexaminer reliability for OPG and DVT was 0.908 and 0.980, respectively. The most common condylar bony change seen in OPG and DVT was erosion followed by flattening and osteophyte. There was significant difference between OPG and DVT in detecting erosion and osteophytes. The other changes observed in our study were Ely's cyst, pointed condyle, and bifid condyle. All the bony changes are more commonly seen in females than males. Conclusion . DVT provides more valid and accurate information on condylar bony changes. The DVT has an added advantage of lesser radiation exposure to the patient and cost effectiveness and could be easily accessible in a dental hospital.",Excluded
4192,"Mortality from solid cancers other than lung, liver, and bone in relation to external dose among plutonium and non-plutonium workers in the Mayak Worker Cohort Exposure to ionizing radiation has well-documented long-term effects on cancer rates and other health outcomes in humans. While in vitro experimental studies had demonstrated that the nature of some radiation effects depend on both total dose of the radiation and the dose rate (i.e., the pattern of dose distribution over time), the question of whether or not the carcinogenic effect of radiation exposure depends on the dose rate remains unanswered. Another issue of interest concerns whether or not concomitant exposure to external gamma rays and inhaled plutonium aerosols has any effect on the external exposure effects. The analyses of the present paper focus on the risk of solid cancers at sites other than lung, liver, and bone in Mayak workers. Recent findings are reviewed indicating that there is no evidence of plutonium dose response for these cancers in the Mayak worker cohort. Then the evidence for differences in the external dose effects among workers with and without the potential for exposure to alpha particles from inhaled plutonium is examined. It is found that there is no evidence that exposure to plutonium aerosols significantly affects the risk associated with external exposure. While the Mayak external dose risk estimate of an excess relative risk of 0.16 per Gy is somewhat lower than an appropriately normalized risk estimate from the Life Span Study of Japanese atomic bomb survivors, the uncertainties in these estimates preclude concluding that the external dose excess relative risks of this group of solid cancers differ in the two cohorts.",Included

4702,"Determinants of model of renarrowing after beta radiation for in-stent restenosis UNLABELLED: It is unknown whether model of renarrowing after beta-radiation for in-stent restenosis (ISR) is influenced by the type of geographic miss (GM)., METHODS: In 166 ISR treated with Galileo, serial quantitative coronary angiographic analysis was done. Minimal lumen diameters and lengths were measured for (1) stent, (2) peri-stent subsegments subjected to angioplasty with/without irradiation, and (3) irradiation margins. GM was defined as: (Type 1) edge injury within the 32P source dose fall-off: 2.0 mm inside and outside the source end marker or (Type 2) overt, nonirradiated injury: beyond the outer 2.0-mm long dose fall-off zone., RESULTS: Restenosis rate was 28.3% at 8.9+/-4.5 months with 60% located exclusively outside the stent. Type 1 GM was present in 24.7% of proximal edges, whereas Type 2 in 18.1%. Respective percentages for distal edges were 23.5% and 15.7%. Regardless of presence and type of GM, significant late lumen loss occurred only outside the stent. However, the biggest late lumen loss at the proximal edge was induced by the Type 1 GM (0.65+/-0.79, p<0.001), while proximal Type 2 GM was not associated with edge renarrowing (-0.04+/-0.48, p=NS). Both reference lumen diameter and proximal Type 1 GM influenced restenosis independently (OR 0.47; 95%CI 0.24-0.90; p=0.023 and OR 2.46; 95%CI 1.12-5.40; p=0.025)., CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of presence and type of geographic miss, late lumen loss after beta-radiation occurs only outside the stent.

3720,"Good genes and the maternal effects of polyandry on offspring reproductive success in the bulb mite Genetic benefits are potentially the most robust explanation of the controversial issue of evolutionary maintenance of polyandry, but the unambiguous demonstration of such benefits has been hindered by the possibility of their confusion with maternal effects. Previous research has shown that polyandrous bulb mite females produce daughters with higher fecundity than monandrous females. Here, we investigate whether this effect arises because polyandrous females invest more in their offspring, or because their offspring inherit 'good genes' from their fathers. Females were mated with either one or four (different) males. However, by sterilizing three of the four males with ionizing radiation, we eliminated any chance of sexual selection (in the polyandrous treatment) so that any differences in the female mating regimes must have been owing to maternal effects. Polyandry had no significant effect on daughter fecundity, thus indicating that any previously documented effects must have been genetic. This was further supported by a significant association between fathers' offensive sperm-competitive ability and the fecundity of their daughters. The association with fathers' sperm defensive ability was not significant, and neither was the association between fathers' sperm competitiveness and sons' reproductive success. However, sons of polyandrous females had lower reproductive success than sons of monandrous females. This shows that the maternal effects of polyandry should be taken into account whenever its costs and benefits are being considered.",Excluded

Heliotherapy (HT) may heal atopic dermatitis (AD) but its effect on vitamin D balance has not been examined., OBJECTIVES: To study the effect of HT on serum calcidiol (25-hydroxyvitamin D) concentration and on healing of AD., METHODS: Twenty-three adult patients with AD received a 2-week course of HT in the Canary Islands in either January or March 2005. Daily solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation was measured and personal UV exposure calculated as standard erythema doses (SED). Blood samples were taken during HT and during a 1-2 month follow-up. Serum calcidiol concentration was measured by radioimmunoassay. Healing of AD was examined by SCORAD index., RESULTS: Before HT 17 (74%) AD patients had vitamin D insufficiency (calcidiol < 50 nmol L(-1)) and four patients high (> 80 nmol L(-1)) serum calcidiol values. The median personal UV dose during the 2-week HT course was 60 SED in the January group and 109 SED in the March group. Serum calcidiol concentration increased significantly in both groups, by 13.4 and 24.0 nmol/L(-1), respectively, and after HT only four (17%) patients had vitamin D insufficiency. SCORAD improved from 34 to 9 in the January HT group and from 30 to 9 in the March group., CONCLUSIONS: A 2-week course of HT significantly improved vitamin D balance by increasing serum calcidiol concentration, and caused a marked healing of AD. These parallel positive responses should be taken into account when the benefits of HT are considered.",Excluded
4141,"Establishing the European diagnostic reference levels for interventional cardiology Interventional cardiac procedures may be associated with high patient doses and therefore require special attention to protect the patients from radiation injuries such as skin erythema, cardiovascular tissue reactions or radiation-induced cancer. In this study, patient exposure data is collected from 13 countries (37 clinics and nearly 50 interventional rooms) and for 10 different procedures. Dose data was collected from a total of 14,922 interventional cardiology procedures. Based on these data European diagnostic reference levels (DRL) for air kerma-area product are suggested for coronary angiography (CA, DRL = 35 Gy cm2), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI, 85 Gy cm2), transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI, 130 Gy cm2), electrophysiological procedures (12 Gy cm2) and pacemaker implantations. Pacemaker implantations were further divided into single-chamber (2.5 Gy cm2) and dual chamber (3.5 Gy cm2) procedures and implantations of cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemaker (18 Gy cm2). Results show that relatively new techniques such as TAVI and treatment of chronic total occlusion (CTO) often produce relatively high doses, and thus emphasises the need for use of an optimization tool such as DRL to assist in reducing patient exposure. The generic DRL presented here facilitate comparison of patient exposure in interventional cardiology.Copyright Â© 2018 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica",Excluded
4759,"Lymphopenia During Definitive Chemoradiotherapy in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma: Association with Dosimetric Parameters and Patient Outcomes Background: The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between clinical characteristics, as well as dosimetric parameters, and the risk of treatment-related lymphopenia in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Material(s) and Method(s): Clinical characteristics and dosimetric parameters were collected from 436 patients with ESCC who received definitive CRT from 2010 through 2017. Absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs) were obtained before, during, and 1 month after CRT. Grade 4 (G4) lymphopenia was defined as ALC <0.2 x 109/L during CRT. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the effect of each factor on predicting G4 lymphopenia. The relationship between lymphopenia and overall survival (OS) was examined, and a nomogram was developed to predict OS. Result(s): G4 lymphopenia was observed in 103 patients (23.6%) during CRT. Multivariate analysis indicated that planning target volume (PTV), lung V10, heart V10, performance status, and pretreatment lymphopenia were significant risk factors for G4 lymphopenia. Patients with G4 lymphopenia had significantly worse survival than those without. Based on multivariate analysis, clinical TNM stage, radiotherapy modality, pretreatment ALC, and G4 lymphopenia were predictive of OS and were incorporated into the nomogram, yielding a concordance index of 0.71. Conclusion(s): G4 lymphopenia during definitive CRT was associated with larger PTVs, higher lung V10 and heart V10, and worse survival. Implications for Practice: The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between clinical characteristics, as well as dosimetric parameters, and the risk of treatment-related lymphopenia in 436 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who received definitive chemoradiotherapy. Grade 4 (G4) lymphopenia was observed in 23.6% of patients during radiotherapy. G4 lymphopenia was associated with larger planning target volumes, higher lung V10 and heart V10, and worse survival. Then, a nomogram was built based on multivariate analysis, yielding excellent performance to predict overall survival. Prospective studies are needed to investigate potential approaches for mitigating severe lymphopenia, which may ultimately convert into survival benefits.Copyright Â© AlphaMed Press 2020",Excluded

4679,"Failure of cardioxane (ICRF-187, dexrazoxane) to limit peroxidative heart damage in rats after gamma irradiation or farmorubicin (4'- epidoxorubicin) treatment The ability of Cardioxane to protect against the peroxidative type of heart damage induced by a single treatment with farmorubicin (10 mg/kg ip) or ionizing radiation (20 Gy gamma rays) as well was investigated in WAG strain rats. Cardioxane in doses 20 mg/kg was applied ip 1 h before and 20 h after farmorubicin treatment or 30 min before and 20 h after irradiation. The early markers of peroxidative damage were thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBA-RS) in serum and heart homogenate, and the cytoplasmic enzyme creatine kinase CK (CPK) activity in serum. Results indicate that Cardioxane in clinically relevant doses did not exert a protective effect against oxidative reactions and did not significantly influence the changes of serum enzyme level observed after both cardiotoxic agents. Furthermore, Cardioxane alone induced a small but significant increase of TBA-RS in serum and heart tissue, providing additional toxicity.",Excluded
4895,"Relation between clinical mature and immature lymphocyte cells in human peripheral blood and their spatial label free scattering patterns A single living cell's light scattering pattern (LSP) in the horizontal plane, which has been denoted as the cell's ""2D fingerprint,"" may provide a powerful label-free detection tool in clinical applications. We have recently studied the LSP in spatial scattering planes, denoted as the cell's ""3D fingerprint,"" for mature and immature lymphocyte cells in human peripheral blood. The effects of membrane size, morphology, and the existence of the nucleus on the spatial LSP are discussed. In order to distinguish clinical label-free mature and immature lymphocytes, the special features of the spatial LSP are studied by statistical method in both the spatial and frequency domains. Spatial LSP provides rich information on the cell's morphology and contents, which can distinguish mature from immature lymphocyte cells and hence ultimately it may be a useful label-free technique for clinical leukemia diagnosis.",Excluded

Method(s): This phase III trial comprises two cohorts of patients deemed fit to receive cisplatin (100 mg/m2 Q3W) (cohort 1) or unfit to cisplatin (cohort 2). The SOC was Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) with cisplatin in cohort 1 (arm A) and with weekly cetuximab in cohort 2 (arm D). In both cohorts, experimental arms (arms B and C) were IMRT with cetuximab and avelumab (10 mg/kg day 7 and every 2 weeks) followed by avelumab every two weeks for 12 months. A safety phase was planned among the first 41 patients in experimental arms by monitoring grade >=IV adverse events (AEs) with an unacceptable rate of 35%. Result(s): Between September 2017 and August 2018, 82 patients with LA-SCCHN were randomised including 41 patients in experimental arms. All patients of experimental arms except one (arm C) received entire radiotherapy as planned. Most common grade >=III AEs were mucositis, radio-dermatitis, and dysphagia. Grade >=IV AEs occurred in 5/41 (12%) patients, all in arm C (no grade V). This rate was acceptable according to the hypotheses of the safety phase. In the SOC arms, grade >=IV AEs occurred in 3/21 patients (14%) in arm A and 2/20 (10%) in arm D. One grade V haemorrhage occurred in arm A. Conclusion(s): The avelumab-cetuximab-RT combination was tolerable for patients with LA-SCCHN, and the approval was given for continuing the trial without modification.

4950,"Vitamin K status in spaceflight and ground-based models of spaceflight Bone loss is a well-documented change during and after long-duration spaceflight. Many types of countermeasures to bone loss have been proposed, including vitamin K supplementation. The objective of this series of studies was to measure change in vitamin K status in response to microgravity under a variety of spaceflight and spaceflight analog (model) conditions, including long-duration spaceflight studies (n = 15), three bed rest studies (n = 15, 49, and 24), and a 14-day saturation dive (n = 6). In crew members who flew 2-6 months on the International Space Station, in-flight and postflight plasma phylloquinone concentrations were unchanged from the preflight mean. Consistent with this finding, urinary I-carboxyglutamic acid (GLA), a measure of vitamin K-dependent protein turnover, did not change in response to flight. Serum undercarboxylated osteocalcin (%ucOC), a measure of vitamin K function, was generally unchanged in response to flight. Spaceflight findings were corroborated by findings of no changes in phylloquinone, urinary GLA, or %ucOC during or after bed rest in three separate bed rest studies (21-90 days in duration) or after a 14-day saturation dive. The data presented here do not support either a need for vitamin K supplementation during spaceflight or the suggestion of using vitamin K as a bone loss countermeasure in spaceflight.

3776,"Diagnostic accuracy of high-definition CT coronary angiography in high-risk patients Aim To assess the diagnostic accuracy of computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) using a combination of high-definition CT (HD-CTCA) and high level of reader experience, with invasive coronary angiography (ICA) as the reference standard, in high-risk patients for the investigation of coronary artery disease (CAD). Materials and methods Three hundred high-risk patients underwent HD-CTCA and ICA. Independent experts evaluated the images for the presence of significant CAD, defined primarily as the presence of moderate (>=50%) stenosis and secondarily as the presence of severe (>=70%) stenosis in at least one coronary segment, in a blinded fashion. HD-CTCA was compared to ICA as the reference standard. Results No patients were excluded. Two hundred and six patients (69%) had moderate and 178 (59%) had severe stenosis in at least one vessel at ICA. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 97.1%, 97.9%, 99% and 93.9% for moderate stenosis, and 98.9%, 93.4%, 95.7% and 98.3%, for severe stenosis, on a per-patient basis. Conclusion The combination of HD-CTCA and experienced readers applied to a high-risk population, results in high diagnostic accuracy comparable to ICA.

4781,"Optimal scan parameters for ct fluoroscopy in lung interventional radiologic procedures: Relationship between radiation dose and image quality Purpose: To evaluate the relationship between radiation doses and lung computed tomographic (CT) fluoroscopic scan parameters and to determine optimal scan parameters for performance of lung interventional radiologic (IR) procedures. Material(s) and Method(s): The institutional review board approved this prospective study, which included 32 patients with a single lung tumor;written informed consent was obtained. CT fluoroscopic images were obtained with three tube voltages (80,120,135 kV) and three tube currents (10, 20, 30 mA) in each patient. The signal-to-noise ratios(SNRs) and the contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were measured quantitatively. To evaluate the feasibility of performing lung IR procedures, four readers visually scored the image quality. Acceptable CT fluoroscopic images were determined by using agreement of at least three of the four readers. The weighted CT dose index for each CT scan parameter was measured. A piecewise linear regression equation was obtained from the relationship between radiation doses and visual image scores. Result(s): Both the SNR and the CNR improved as the radiation dose increased, leading to improvement in the image quality. Acceptable image quality was achieved in 94% (30 of 32) of patients when the radiation dose was 1.18 mGy/sec (120 kV, 10 mA) and in all patients when it was greater than 1.48 mGy/sec (135 kV, 10 mA). The piecewise linear curve showed rapid improvement in image quality until the radiation dose increased to 1.48 mGy/sec (135 kV, 10 mA). When the radiation dose was increased greater than 1.48 mGy/sec, improvement in the image quality became more gradual. Conclusion(s): Results of this study can be used to guide the determination of optimal scan parameters in lung CT fluoroscopy. Â© RSNA, 2010.",Excluded
4340,"Evaluation of gait speed after applying kinesio tape on quadriceps femoris muscle in patients with knee osteoarthritis BACKGROUND: Knee osteoarthritis is a chronic degenerative disease, known as the most common cause of difficulty walking in older adults and subsequently is associated with slow walking. Functional decline, increased risk of falls and the presence of pain are, in many studies, related to the muscle weakness caused by osteoarthritis especially weakness of the quadriceps muscles. Many studies have shown that the strength of the quadriceps femoris muscle can affect gait, by improving or weakening it. Kinesio Tape is a physiotherapeutic technique, which reduces pain and increases muscular strength by irritating the skin receptors. AIM: This study aimed to verify if the application of Kinesio Tape on quadriceps femoris muscle increases gait speed while decreasing the time needed to accomplish the 10-meter walk test in patients with knee osteoarthritis and also in subjects without knee osteoarthritis. METHOD(S): In this study, we observed the change of gait speed with the help of the 10-meter walk test before, one day and three days after the application of Kinesio Tape in quadriceps femoris muscle. We compared the results of the time needed to perform the 10-meter walk in two groups. In the first group, the Patients group, participated 102 out-patients with a clinical diagnosis of primary knee osteoarthritis, while in the second group, the Control group, participated 73 subjects with a main excluding criterion a clinical diagnosis of primary knee osteoarthritis. RESULT(S): Our results indicated that there was a significant decrease of time needed to perform the 10-meter walk test in both groups three days after application of Kinesio Tape on quadriceps femoris muscle. However, there was not a significant change one day after the application of Kinesio Tape compared before its application in both groups. CONCLUSION(S): Our results indicated that there was a significant decrease in time needed to accomplish the 10-meter walk test. Kinesio Tape is a technique that can be used especially when changing walking stereotypes is a long-term goal of the treatment.Copyright Â© 2018 Klejda Tani, Irena Kola, Vjollca Shpata, Fregen Dhamaj.

3973,"The radiologic technologists' health study in South Korea: study design and baseline results PURPOSE: To describe the study design, methods, and baseline results of a prospective cohort of radiologic technologists which we have initiated in South Korea., METHODS: The cohort participants were enrolled through a self-administered questionnaire survey administered from April 2012 to May 2013. Survey data were linked with radiation dosimetry, a cancer registry, and health insurance data by personal identification numbers. A nationwide representative survey was also conducted using a stratified random sampling design with face-to-face interviews., RESULTS: A total of 12,387 radiologic technologists were enrolled, which accounted for approximately 63% of all diagnostic radiologic technologists working in South Korea. For nationwide survey, 585 workers were interviewed using the detailed questionnaire, and buccal cells were also collected by scraping the inside of the cheek. The majority of study subjects were under 50-year-old and male workers. The average annual effective dose of radiation declined both men (from 2.75 to 1.43 mSv) and women (from 1.34 to 0.95 mSv) over the period of 1996-2011. A total of 99 cancers (66 cancers in men and 33 in women) were reported from 1992 to 2010. The standardized incidence ratio of all cancer combined was significantly lower in men (SIR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.58-0.96) than general population, but the ratios for thyroid cancer were significantly higher than expected among both men and women., CONCLUSIONS: This cohort provides comprehensive information on work activities and health status of diagnostic radiologic technologists.

4062,"The association between chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease risk factors in atomic bomb survivors Atomic bomb (A-bomb) radiation is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and metabolic CVD risk factors. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also known to be a risk factor for CVD and little is known whether CKD is associated with A-bomb radiation. To examine whether CKD is associated with CVD risk factors or with A-bomb radiation in A-bomb survivors, we classified renal dysfunction in 1,040 A-bomb survivors who were examined in 2004-2007 as normal [n = 121; estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >= 90 ml/min/1.73 m(2)]; mild (n = 686; eGFR 60-89 ml/min/1.73 m(2)); moderate (n = 217; eGFR 30-59 ml/min/1.73 m(2)); or severe (n = 16; eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). Also, we diagnosed subjects in the moderate and severe renal dysfunction groups as having CKD (n = 233; eGFR <59 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). After adjusting for age, gender, and smoking and drinking habits, we looked for an association between renal dysfunction and hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperlipidemia, and metabolic syndrome (MetS), and between renal dysfunction and A-bomb radiation. Hypertension [odds ratio (OR), 1.57; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.12-2.20, P = 0.009]; DM (OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.23-2.61, P = 0.002); hyperlipidemia (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.12-2.14, P = 0.008); and MetS (OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.32-2.63, P < 0.001) were associated with CKD (moderate/severe renal dysfunction), and hyperlipidemia and MetS were also associated with mild renal dysfunction. CKD (OR/Gy, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.01-1.63, P = 0.038) and severe renal dysfunction (OR/Gy, 3.19; 95% CI, 1.63-6.25, P < 0.001) were significantly associated with radiation dose.

4925,"Impact of chemical exposure on cancer mortality in a French cohort of uranium processing workers BACKGROUND: Nuclear workers may be exposed to a variety of chemical hazards, in addition to radiation. We examined the effect of chemical exposures on cancer mortality among French uranium processing workers at the AREVA NC Pierrelatte facility., METHODS: A cohort of 2,897 uranium processing workers employed for at least 6 months was followed from 1968 through 2006. Exposure to uranium and potentially carcinogenic chemicals was assessed with a plant-specific job-exposure matrix. Mortality hazard ratios (HRs) for cancers of the lung, lymphohematopoietic system, kidney and bladder, brain and central nervous system (BCNS), and prostate were estimated for each specific chemical exposure, with Cox regression models stratified for sex and calendar period and adjusted for socioeconomic status. Additional adjustments enabled us to examine the effect of co-exposure to uranium and other chemicals., RESULTS: Exposure to aromatic solvents was associated with increased risk of BCNS malignancies after adjustment for other chemicals (HR=6.53, 95% CI=1.14-37.41; n=6) and for other chemicals and uranium (HR=7.26, 95% CI=0.90-58.19) in the annual exposure status model. Selected groups of lymphohematopoietic cancers were found associated with solvent exposure. Inconclusive results were found regarding chromium (VI) exposure, since only 2 workers died from lung cancer among 109 exposed., CONCLUSION: Based on our pilot study, it seemed important to take into account chemical exposures in the analyses of cancer mortality among French uranium processing workers.

4684,"Heterogeneity in the clastogenic response to X-rays in lymphocytes from ataxia-telangiectasia heterozygotes and controls A coded analysis of X-ray-induced chromatid aberrations in lymphocyte cultures from 45 control individuals and 19 ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) heterozygotes was performed. The distribution of chromatid breaks induced in the late G2 portion of the cell cycle by 60 cGy of X-rays appeared bimodal in the study population. In six controls (13 percent) and in 12 of 19 (63 percent) A-T heterozygotes, the yields of X-ray-induced breaks observed were within the higher mode of the distribution. However, lymphocytes from A-T heterozygotes sensitive to the induction of chromatid breaks by 60 cGy did not contain increased numbers of aberrations following exposure to 20 cGy. The radio-resistant inhibition of DNA synthesis that occurs in A-T homozygotes was not observed in heterozygotes. Co-cultivation experiments showed an increased G2 delay in lymphocytes from an A-T heterozygote whose lymphocytes contained increased X-ray-induced chromatid breaks. The results show a significant association of A-T heterozygosity with G2 chromosomal sensitivity (P less than 0.001; Wilcoxon rank sum test). The measurement of X-ray-induced breaks, however, failed to identify 37 percent of A-T heterozygotes tested. The predicted prevalence of increased sensitivity to X-rays in controls is approximately three- to 30-fold greater than the estimated frequency of A-T heterozygotes in the general population. Therefore, although the increased sensitivity to X-ray-induced chromatid breaks appears to be associated with the A-T-gene, it is not a reliable indicator of A-T heterozygosity. Genetic or environmental factors other than the A-T gene also must be involved in the increased clastogenic response.",Included

4302,"Melanocortin 1 Receptor-Targeted alpha-Particle Therapy for Metastatic Uveal Melanoma New effective therapies are greatly needed for metastatic uveal melanoma, which has a very poor prognosis with a median survival of less than 1 y. The melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) is expressed in 94% of uveal melanoma metastases, and a MC1R-specific ligand (MC1RL) with high affinity and selectivity for MC1R was previously developed. Methods: The 225Ac-DOTA-MC1RL conjugate was synthesized in high radiochemical yield and purity and was tested in vitro for biostability and for MC1R-specific cytotoxicity in uveal melanoma cells, and the lanthanum-DOTA-MC1RL analog was tested for binding affinity. Non-tumor-bearing BALB/c mice were tested for maximum tolerated dose and biodistribution. Severe combined immunodeficient mice bearing uveal melanoma tumors or engineered MC1R-positive and -negative tumors were studied for biodistribution and efficacy. Radiation dosimetry was calculated using mouse biodistribution data and blood clearance kinetics from Sprague-Dawley rat data. Results: High biostability, MC1R-specific cytotoxicity, and high binding affinity were observed. Limiting toxicities were not observed at even the highest administered activities. Pharmacokinetics and biodistribution studies revealed rapid blood clearance (<15 min), renal and hepatobillary excretion, MC1R-specific tumor uptake, and minimal retention in other normal tissues. Radiation dosimetry calculations determined pharmacokinetics parameters and absorbed alpha-emission dosages from 225Ac and its daughters. Efficacy studies demonstrated significantly prolonged survival and decreased metastasis burden after a single administration of 225Ac-DOTA-MC1RL in treated mice relative to controls. Conclusion: These results suggest significant potential for the clinical translation of 225Ac-DOTA-MC1RL as a novel therapy for metastatic uveal melanoma.

Method(s): We included 578 lung cancer screening trial participants who were examined by CT twice within 3 months to follow indeterminate pulmonary nodules. On these CTs, AVC and MC were measured in cubic millimetres. One hundred CTs were examined by five observers to determine the inter-observer variability. Reliability was assessed by kappa statistics (kappa) and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs). Variability was expressed as the mean difference +/- standard deviation (SD). Result(s): Inter-examination reliability was excellent for AVC (kappa=0.94, ICC=0.96) and MC (kappa=0.95, ICC=0.90). Inter-examination variability was 12.7+/-118.2 mm3 for AVC and 31.5+/-219.2 mm3 for MC. Inter-observer reliability ranged from kappa=0.68 to kappa=0.92 for AVC and from kappa=0.20 to kappa=0.66 for MC. Inter-observer ICC was 0.94 for AVC and ranged from 0.56 to 0.97 for MC. Inter-observer variability ranged from -30.5+/-252.0 mm3 to 84.0+/-240.5 mm3 for AVC and from -95.2+/-210.0 mm3 to 303.7+/-501.6 mm 3 for MC. Conclusion(s): AVC can be quantified with excellent reliability on ungated unenhanced low-dose chest CT, but manual detection of MC can be subject to substantial inter-observer variability. Lung cancer screening CT may be used for detection and quantification of cardiac valve calcifications. Key points: * Low-dose unenhanced ungated chest computed tomography can detect cardiac valve calcifications. * However, calcified cardiac valves are not reported by most radiologists. * Inter-observer and inter-examination variability of aortic valve calcifications is sufficient for longitudinal studies. * Volumetric measurement variability of mitral valve and annulus calcifications is substantial.

In the Ames test for mutagenicity, 2-F-A-85380 was without effect in five bacterial strains. No evidence of gross pathology or histopathological changes occurred in either 2-day acute (0.4-4000 nmol/kg i.v.) or 14-day expanded acute (40-4000 nmol/kg i.v.) toxicity studies in mice. Similarly, hematology and serum chemistry values in rhesus monkeys administered 60 nmol/kg i.v. were not affected over 14 days. Like nicotine, 2-F-A-85380 produced convulsions in mice at very high doses. The ED(50) value of 2-F-A-85380 for eliciting tonic-clonic convulsions (5.0 micromol/kg i.v.) was nearly 4 times greater than that of nicotine (ED(50) = 1.4 micromol/kg i.v.). Lower doses of 2-F-A-85380 (30-300 nmol/kg i.v.) and nicotine (20-400 nmol/kg i.v.) increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac contractility in rats. Notably, the PR, QRS, or QTc intervals of the rat electrocardiogram were unaffected by either drug.

4587,"An action spectrum (290-320 nm) for TNFalpha protein in human skin in vivo suggests that basal-layer epidermal DNA is the chromophore Terrestrial solar UVB radiation (=295-320 nm) readily induces cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) in human skin DNA that result in characteristic mutations associated with nonmelanoma skin cancer. The proinflammatory cytokine TNFalpha is important in mouse skin chemical carcinogenesis and is thought to also play a role in UVR-induced skin cancer by its immunomodulatory properties. There is some in vitro evidence that CPDs initiate the production of TNFalpha, and we tested this hypothesis by comparing the wavelength dependence (action spectrum) for TNFalpha protein induction in human skin in vivo with our earlier in vivo action spectra for CPD induction in four different epidermal layers of human skin. Normal volunteers (n = 35) were irradiated with physiologically relevant doses of monochromatic UVB (290-320 nm), and TNFalpha concentration was assessed, by high-sensitivity ELISA, in exudates from skin suction blisters raised 8 h after irradiation. An action spectrum, constructed from the slopes of the dose-response curves at the different wavelengths, showed maximal efficacy at 300 nm. An excellent match was observed for TNFalpha and the CPD action spectrum for cells in the lower basal epidermis. These data strongly suggest that UVB-induced photodamage to DNA in the epidermal basal layer is a major trigger for TNFalpha production. The TNFalpha may originate directly from the keratinocytes in this layer or inflammatory cells that are rapidly recruited into the upper dermis (e.g., neutrophils) as a consequence of DNA photodamage to basal-layer keratinocytes.

4725,"Phase I trial of trametinib with neoadjuvant chemoradiation in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer Purpose: The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway is critical to the development of colorectal cancers, and KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF mutations foster resistance to radiation. We performed a phase I trial to determine the safety of trametinib, a potent MEK1/2 inhibitor, with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) chemoradiation therapy (CRT) in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). Patients and Methods: Patients with stage II/III rectal cancer were enrolled on a phase I study with 33 study design, with an expansion cohort of 9 patients at the MTD. Following a 5-day trametinib lead-in, with pre- and posttreatment tumor biopsies, patients received trametinib and CRT, surgery, and adjuvant chemotherapy. Trametinib was given orally daily at 3 dose levels: 0.5 mg, 1 mg, and 2 mg. CRT consisted of infusional 5-FU 225 mg/m2/day and radiation dose of 28 daily fractions of 1.8 Gy (total 50.4 Gy). The primary endpoint was to identify the MTD and recommended phase II dose. IHC staining for phosphorylated ERK (pERK) and genomic profiling was performed on the tumor samples. Result(s): Patients were enrolled to all dose levels, and 18 patients were evaluable for toxicities and responses. Treatment was well tolerated, and there was one dose-limiting toxicity of diarrhea, which was attributed to CRT rather than trametinib. At the 2 mg dose level, 25% had pathologic complete response. IHC staining confirmed dose-dependent decrease in pERK with increasing trametinib doses. Conclusion(s): The combination of trametinib with 5-FU CRT is safe and well tolerated, and may warrant additional study in a phase II trial, perhaps in a RAS/RAF-mutant selected population.Copyright Â© 2020 American Association for Cancer Research.",Excluded
4413,"The role of cross-cultural factors in long-duration international space missions: lessons from the SFINCSS-99 study UNLABELLED: The role of cross-cultural factors in long-duration international space missions was examined during an isolation study that simulated many of the conditions aboard the International Space Station., METHODS: Interactions involving two heterogeneous crews and one homogeneous crew staying in isolation from 110 to 240 days were studied. Data consisted of post-isolation interviews with crewmembers, ground support personnel and management, observational data, and public statements by crewmembers. Data was analyzed using the techniques of linguistic anthropology and ethnography., RESULTS: Sub-cultural (organizational and professional) differences played a larger role than national differences in causing misunderstandings in this study. Conversely, some misunderstandings and conflicts were escalated by participants falsely assuming cultural differences or similarities. Comparison between the two heterogeneous crews showed the importance of training, personality factors, and commander and language skills in preventing and alleviating cultural misunderstandings., CONCLUSION: The study revealed a number of ways that cultural differences, real as well as assumed, can play a role and interact with other, non-cultural, factors in causing and/or precipitating conflict situations. It is postulated that such difficulties can be avoided by selecting culturally adaptive crewmembers and by cross-cultural and language training. Also the crew composition and role of commander were found to be important in mitigating conflict situations. Copyright c2002 Lister Science.",Excluded
4693,"UVR2 ensures transgenerational genome stability under simulated natural UV-B in Arabidopsis thaliana Ground levels of solar UV-B radiation induce DNA damage. Sessile phototrophic organisms such as vascular plants are recurrently exposed to sunlight and require UV-B photoreception, flavonols shielding, direct reversal of pyrimidine dimers and nucleotide excision repair for resistance against UV-B radiation. However, the frequency of UV-B-induced mutations is unknown in plants. Here we quantify the amount and types of mutations in the offspring of Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type and UV-B-hypersensitive mutants exposed to simulated natural UV-B over their entire life cycle. We show that reversal of pyrimidine dimers by UVR2 photolyase is the major mechanism required for sustaining plant genome stability across generations under UV-B. In addition to widespread somatic expression, germline-specific UVR2 activity occurs during late flower development, and is important for ensuring low mutation rates in male and female cell lineages. This allows plants to maintain genome integrity in the germline despite exposure to UV-B.",Excluded
4360,"Comparing different analysis methods for quantifying the MRI amide proton transfer (APT) effect in hyperacute stroke patients Amide proton transfer (APT) imaging is a pH mapping method based on the chemical exchange saturation transfer phenomenon that has potential for penumbra identification following stroke. The majority of the literature thus far has focused on generating pH-weighted contrast using magnetization transfer ratio asymmetry analysis instead of quantitative pH mapping. In this study, the widely used asymmetry analysis and a model-based analysis were both assessed on APT data collected from healthy subjects (n = 2) and hyperacute stroke patients (n = 6, median imaging time after onset = 2 hours 59 minutes). It was found that the model-based approach was able to quantify the APT effect with the lowest variation in grey and white matter (<= 13.8 %) and the smallest average contrast between these two tissue types (3.48 %) in the healthy volunteers. The model-based approach also performed quantitatively better than the other measures in the hyperacute stroke patient APT data, where the quantified APT effect in the infarct core was consistently lower than in the contralateral normal appearing tissue for all the patients recruited, with the group average of the quantified APT effect being 1.5 +/- 0.3 % (infarct core) and 1.9 +/- 0.4 % (contralateral). Based on the fitted parameters from the model-based analysis and a previously published pH and amide proton exchange rate relationship, quantitative pH maps for hyperacute stroke patients were generated, for the first time, using APT imaging.

4105,"Randomized trial of hyperfractionated radiation therapy with or without concurrent chemotherapy for stage III non-small-cell lung cancer Purpose: To investigate the efficacy of combined hyperfractionated radiation therapy (HFX RT) and concurrent chemotherapy (CHT) in stage IIIA or IIIB non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) compared with that of HFX RT alone. Patients and Methods: Between January 1988 and December 1989, 169 patients were divided randomly into the following groups: group I, HFX RT with 1.2 Gy twice daily to a total dose of 64.8 Gy (n = 61); group II, same HFX RT with CHT consisting of 100 mg of carboplatin (CBDCA) on days 1 and 2 and 100 mg of etoposide (VP-16) on days 1 to 3 of each week during the RT course (n = 52); and group III, same HFX RT with CHT consisting of 200 mg of CBDCA on days 1 and 2 and 100 mg of VP-16 on days 1 to 5 of the first, third, and fifth weeks of the RT course (n = 56). Result(s): The median survival time (MST) was 8 months for group I, 18 months for group II, and 13 months for group III. The 3-year survival rates were 6.6%, 23%, and 16%, respectively. There was a significant difference in the survival rate between groups I and II (P = .0027, log-rank test), but not between groups I and III (P = .17) or between groups II and III (P = .14). The relapse-free survival rate in group II was also higher than that in group I (P = .0024), which was largely due to improved local control in group II patients. Patients in groups II and III showed a higher incidence of acute and/or late high-grade toxicity compared with group I patients, but no patient died of treatment-related toxicity. Conclusion(s): The combination of HFX RT and continuous CBDCA/VP-16 CHT was tolerable and substantially increased the survival rate.",Excluded
4933,"Statistical analysis of observational study of the influence of radon and other risk factors on lung cancer incidence An observational study is a type of epidemiological study when the researcher observes the situation but is not able to change the conditions of the experiment. The statistical analysis of the observational study of the population of Lermontov city (North Caucasus) was conducted. In the initial group, there were 121 people with lung cancer diagnosis and 196 people of the control group. Statistical analysis was performed only for men (95 cases and 76 controls). The use of logistic regression with correction on age gives the value of odds ratio 1.95 (0.87/4.37; 90% CI) per 100 working levels per month of combined (occupational and domestic) radon exposure. It was demonstrated that chronic lung diseases are an additional risk factor for uranium miners but it is not a significant risk factor for general population. Thus, the possibility of obtaining statistically reliable results in the observational studies when using the correct methods of analysis is demonstrated.Copyright Â© The Author 2014.

4111,"The Free-Hand Technique for S2-Alar-Iliac Screw Placement: A Safe and Effective Method for Sacropelvic Fixation in Adult Spinal Deformity BACKGROUND: Spinopelvic fixation is an integral part of achieving solid fusion across the lumbosacral junction, especially in deformity procedures requiring substantial correction or long-segment constructs. Traditional S2-alar-iliac (S2AI) screw-placement techniques utilize fluoroscopy, increasing operative time and radiation exposure to the patient and surgeon. We describe a novel free-hand technique for S2AI screw placement in patients with adult spinal deformity., METHODS: We reviewed the records of 45 consecutive patients who underwent spinopelvic fixation performed with use of S2AI screws by the senior surgeon and various fellows or residents over a 12-month period (2015 to 2016). In each case, the S2AI screws were placed utilizing a free-hand technique without fluoroscopic or image guidance. Screw position and accuracy were assessed by intraoperative O-arm imaging and analyzed using 3-dimensional interactive manipulation of computed tomography images., RESULTS: A total of 100 screws were placed, 51 by the senior surgeon and 49 by trainees. The mean patient age was 57.4 +/- 12.7 years at the time of surgery; 37 (82.2%) of the patients were female. Preoperative diagnoses included adult idiopathic scoliosis (n = 19), adult degenerative scoliosis (n = 15), flatback syndrome (n = 2), fixed sagittal imbalance (n = 6), and distal junctional kyphosis (n = 3). Five (5%) of the screws were placed with moderate to severe cortical breaches, all of which perforated the pelvis posteriorly, with no clinically notable neurovascular or visceral complications. The breach rate did not differ significantly between the senior surgeon and trainees., CONCLUSIONS: The free-hand technique for S2AI screw placement, when performed in a standardized manner, was demonstrated to be safe and reliable in constructs requiring spinopelvic fixation. The accuracy of screw placement relies on visible and palpable anatomic landmarks that obviate the need for intraoperative fluoroscopy or image guidance, potentially reducing operative time and radiation exposure., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level IV.

3822,"Amelioration of pain and histopathologic joint abnormalities in the Col1-IL-1beta(XAT) mouse model of arthritis by intraarticular induction of mu-opioid receptor into the temporomandibular joint OBJECTIVE: To evaluate opioid receptor function as a basis for novel antinociceptive therapy in arthritis., METHODS: We induced human mu-opioid receptor (HuMOR) expression in arthritic joints of mice, using the feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) vector, which is capable of stably transducing dividing, growth-arrested, and terminally differentiated cells. Male and female Col1-IL-1beta(XAT)-transgenic mice developed on a C57BL/6J background and wild-type littermates were studied., RESULTS: A single injection of FIV(HuMOR) into the temporomandibular joints of Col1-IL-1beta(XAT)-transgenic mice 1 week prior to induction of arthritis prevented the development of orofacial pain and joint dysfunction, and reduced the degree of histopathologic abnormality in the joint. In addition, FIV(HuMOR) prevented the attendant sensitization of trigeminal sensory neurons and activation of astroglia in brainstem trigeminal sensory nuclei. These effects were mediated by the transduction of primary sensory neurons via transport of FIV vectors from peripheral nerve endings to sensory ganglia, as evidenced by HuMOR expression in neuronal cell bodies located in the trigeminal ganglia, as well as in their proximal and distal nerve branches located in the main sensory and subnucleus caudalis of the brainstem and joints, respectively. The presence of MOR ligands predominantly in the descending trigeminal nucleus suggested that the observed antinociception occurred at the subnucleus caudalis. Articular chondrocytes and meniscal tissue were also infected by FIV(HuMOR), which presumably exerted an antiinflammatory effect on cartilage., CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that prophylactic therapy with MOR overexpression in joints can successfully prevent the development of pain, dysfunction, and histopathologic abnormalities in the joints in arthritis. These findings may provide a basis for the future development of spatiotemporally controlled antinociceptive and antiinflammatory therapy for arthritis.",Excluded
4738,"A mice radiation-induced liver disease model for stereotactic body radiation therapy validated in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma Purpose/Objective(s): Lower radiation tolerance of the whole liver hinders dose escalations of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment. This study was conducted to define the exact doses resulting in radiation-induced liver diseases (RILD) and dose constraints for the critical organs at risk (OARs) in mice, which are still undefined in HCC SBRT. Materials/Methods: This study was consisted of 2 phases. In the primary phase, mice treated with helical tomotherapy based SBRT were stratified according to escalating radiation doses to the livers. Pathological differences, signs, such as mouse performance status (MPS), and serum aspartate/ alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT)/albumin levels were observed. Radiation-induced disease severities of OARs were scored using systematic evaluation standards. In the validation phase in human, 13 patients with HCC who had undergone radiation therapy before hepatectomy were enrolled to validate RILD pathological changes in mice study. Result(s): Evaluation criteria of mouse liver radiation therapy relating signs were as follows: MPS >=2.0+/-0.52, AST/ALT >=589.2+/-118.5/137.4+/-15.3 U/L, serum albumin <=16.8+/-2.29 g/L. Preliminary dose constraints of OARs had also been obtained, such as livers: average dose <=26.36+/-1.71 Gy and gastrointestinal tract: maximum dose <=22.63 Gy. Mouse RILD models could be developed when livers were irradiated with the average doses >=31.76+/-1.94 Gy (single fraction). RILD pathological changes in mice had also been validated in HCC patients. Conclusion(s): Mouse RILD models could be developed with SBRT based on the dose constraints for OARs and evaluation criteria of mice liver radiation therapy relating signs, which will favor the study of further approaches of treating HCC with SBRT.",Excluded
4208,"Retrospective analysis of the superior vena cava syndrome in irradiated cancer patients Background: A carcinoma is the underlying cause of superior vena cava syndrome (SVCS) in 95-97% of patients. The aim of our study is to retrospectively analyse the outcome of patients after local radiotherapy compared to literature data. Patients and Methods: In 35 consecutively registered patients, irradiated because of SVCS, different primary carcinomas (lung, breast, head-and-neck, Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) were ascertained. Distant metastases had already been diagnosed in 33 patients. Chemotherapy had previously been given in seven patients. Result(s): In 30 patients, radiotherapy obtained a reduction of symptoms within 5-9 days. However, in seven patients, radiotherapy had to be stopped early because of local progress and tumor induced complications. Local recurrences were observed in six patients. The 1-year overall survival rate was 15.6%. Survival rate depended significantly on the performance status (p<0.004). Conclusion(s): Based on literature data our results are comparable regarding the incidence, the radio-oncological procedure and the response to treatment. These data confirm that radiotherapy is the standard treatment in most patients suffering from SVCS. However, it should be determined if endovascular stenting, which is more frequently considered in the last few years in patients with a tumor induced SVCS, may be a useful option as a simultaneous or sequentially given treatment to optimize the palliative effect.",Excluded

Methods From December 10, 2014 to March 20, 2015, 84 consecutive patients with coronary artery disease who underwent coronary intervention in our institution were retrospectively collected and then divided into two groups: the LR group (fluoroscopy at 7.5 frames per second) and the OR group (fluoroscopy at 15 frames per second), according to the frame rate of fluoroscopy that was used in their treatment. Results There were no differences in the patient backgrounds or the procedural characteristics of the two groups. Although there were no differences in the contrast volume or fluoroscopy time, the total air kerma at the interventional reference point, which is used to monitor the patient's radiation dose, was significantly lower in the LR group than in the OR group (701.4+/-427.9 vs. 936.8+/-623.9 mGy, p=0.02).

4326,"Interaural intensity difference and ear advantage in listening to dichotic consonant-vowel syllable pairs The right-ear advantage (REA) is typically observed in verbal dichotic listening, indicating a left hemisphere superiority for speech processing. The REA could be thought of as a bottom-up, stimulus-driven laterality effect, caused by the preponderance of the contralateral neural fibers from the right ear to the auditory/speech processing areas in the left temporal lobe. The REA can, however, be modified by explicitly requiring the listeners to focus their attention alternatively on the left or right-ear stimuli, thus either countering or enhancing the bottom-up processes through top-down attentional control. In the present study, we manipulated the strength of the bottom-up REA by inducing an intensity difference between the right-ear and left-ear speech inputs in order to make the REA either weaker (left-ear input>right-ear input) or stronger (left-ear input<right-ear input) and also examined how this manipulation affected the top-down attention modulation effects. Twenty healthy participants listened to dichotic presentations of consonant-vowel syllable pairs with different attention instructions. The results showed that the interaural intensity difference significantly affected the ear advantage in the predicted way. It also interacted with the top-down control effects, attentional control having a stronger effect when attending to the ear that had a weaker sound intensity, as compared to when the intensities were equal.",Excluded

Methods and Study design: 38 patients with histologically proven muscle-invasive bladder cancer treated at our department between January 2008 and December 2013 were analyzed retrospectively. Age, gender, pathology, stage, 3-year overall survival, 3-year disease-free survival, radiotherapy (RT) dose, genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity scores and response evaluation of the patients were recorded. 3-year overall survival and 3-year disease-free survivals were calculated by Kaplan-Meier method along with the analysis of gender, pathology, stage and therapy response of the study group. Result(s): 33 patients (86.8%) were managed with concomitant chemoradiotherapy whereas 5 patients (13.2%) received only radiation therapy due to renal insufficency and comorbid diseases. 6 (15.8%) out of 38 patients had partial response (PR) and remaining 32 (84.2%) patients experienced complete response (CR). The PR group underwent salvage cystectomy and CR group had been followed-up after radical radiotherapy. Mean age of the group was 70.9 (range 45-90) years. 26 of all patients were male (68.4%) and 12 were female (31.6%). Mean follow-up time after completion of radiotherapy was 24.7 months (range 12-40). Mean RT dose was 64 Gy (range 60-66). 3-year overall survival was 64% and 3-year disease free survival was 73%.

4369,"Improved local control for early T-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma--a tale of two hospitals PURPOSE: To study the efficacy of intracavitary brachytherapy (ICT) in early T-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: All early T-stage (T1 and T2 nasal cavity tumour) NPC treated with a curative intent up to 1996 were analyzed (n=743), 163 from the Prince of Wales Hospital (PWH) and 25 from Tuen Mun Hospital (TMH) were given ICT after radical external radiotherapy (ERT; group A). They were compared with 555 patients treated with ERT alone (group B). The radiotherapy techniques were identical between the two hospitals. The ERT delivered the tumoricidal dose (uncorrected biological equivalent dose (BED)-10, > or = 75 Gy) to the primary tumour, and this did not differ in technique or dosage between the two groups. The ICT delivered a dose of 18-24 Gy in three fractions over 15 days to a point 1 cm perpendicular to the midpoint of the plane of the sources., RESULTS: The local failure was significantly less (crude rates, 6.9 vs. 13.0%; 5-year actuarial rates, 5.8 vs. 11.7%) and the disease-specific mortality was significantly lower (crude rates, 13.8 vs. 18.9%; 5-year actuarial rates, 12.2 vs. 15.2%) in group A compared with group B. ICT was the only significant independent prognostic factor predictive of fewer local failures. When ICT was excluded from the Cox regression model, the total physical dose or the total BED-10 uncorrected for tumour repopulation became significant in predicting the ultimate local failure rate. The two groups were comparable in the rate of the chronic radiation complications. A significant dose-tumour-control relationship existed, plotting the local failure as a function of the total physical dose or the total BED., CONCLUSIONS: Supplementing ERT, which delivered the tumoricidal dose (uncorrected BED-10, > or = 75 Gy), with ICT significantly enhanced ultimate local control in early T-stage (T1/T2 nasal infiltration) NPC. A significant dose-tumour-control relationship exists above the conventional tumoricidal dose level.",Excluded
4916,"Effectiveness of salvage radiation therapy following subtotal and gross total resection of atypical meningiomas Purpose/Objective(s): Postoperative management of WHO Grade II (atypical) meningioma remains controversial. Radiation therapy (RT) has been shown to improve local control in several retrospective studies, but outcomes of adjuvant versus salvage RT after a gross total resection (GTR) are not well understood.We reviewed the outcomes of patients treated with RT after GTR and subtotal resection (STR) at our institution, where radiation therapy (RT) has typically been reserved for salvage. Materials/Methods: Between 1997 and 2014, 76 patients with WHO Grade II meningiomas were treated at our institution. One patient with NF2 was excluded from this analysis. Of the 75 remaining patients, 62 underwent GTR (Simpson grade I e III) and 13 STR (Simpson IV-V). No patient with GTR received adjuvant RT. A total of 22 patients received RT: 10 as salvage of recurrence following GTR, 10 as salvage following STR, and 2 adjuvantly, each after biopsy only. Fractionated RT was employed in 18 patients, with doses ranging from 50.4-60 Gy (median 59.4 Gy) in 28-33 fractions, and stereotactic radiosurgery in 4 patients, with a single fraction of 15-18 Gy (median 17 Gy). Result(s): Extent of surgery was significantly predictive of progression-free survival (PFS). Following GTR and STR respectively, 2-year PFS was 75% versus 33%, and 4-year PFS 68% versus 17% (P = 0.0008). Despite a significant improvement in PFS after GTR, patients who recurred following GTR had a poor response to salvage RT, with 6 of the 10 patients continuing to progress despite RT. Conversely, none of the 12 patients who had undergone STR or biopsy experienced progression following RT. Respectively for GTR and STR, PFS following RT was 77% and 100% at 1 year, and 39% and 100% after 2 years (P = 0.04). Radiation dose was not significantly different between patients who progressed (median 56.7 Gy) and those who did not (median 60 Gy) following RT (P = 0.42). Likewise there was no difference in RT dose for those with GTR versus STR (median 60 Gy versus 59.4 Gy respectively, P = 0.94). Conclusion(s): In our patient cohort, salvage RT for recurrence following GTR was associated with a high rate of failure (61% at 2 years), whereas salvage or adjuvant RT following STR was effective, with no failures at 2 years. This data suggests that tumors recurring after GTR are biologically distinct from tumors that progress following STR. While extent of resection is predictive of PFS, the 4-year local failure following GTR alone was still 32%; therefore, adjuvant RT should be considered in this setting. Whether routine adjuvant RT following GTR of Grade II meningioma will significantly reduce subsequent failures remains to be determined. A randomized, prospective comparison of adjuvant RT after GTR is needed to resolve this question.",Excluded
4691,"Phase II trial of induction gemcitabine and carboplatin followed by conformal thoracic radiation to 74 Gy with weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin in unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer Introduction: The survival for patients with locally advanced, unresectable non-small cell lung cancer receiving standard of care concomitant chemoradiation remains disappointingly low. A reduction in both local and distant recurrence is needed to improve patients' outcome. Performing molecular studies on serially collected tumor specimens may result in a better selection of therapeutic options. Method(s): We conducted a phase II single-institution trial of two cycles of induction chemotherapy with gemcitabine and carboplatin followed by high-dose conformal radiation concomitant with weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin in 39 patients. The trial required a dedicated tumor biopsy before treatment initiation. In addition, tumor biopsies were requested, if safely feasible, before initiation of chemoradiation and 2 months after completion all therapy. Result(s): Induction chemotherapy was well tolerated, and 38 patients proceeded with chemoradiation. The mean delivered radiation dose was 70.2 Gy, 23 patients received the full dose of 74 Gy, and 19 patients completed all treatment on schedule without dose reductions or delays. Median overall and progression-free survivals were 22.7 and 14.3 months, respectively. A total of 82 procedures, including 46 transthoracic core needle biopsies, were performed. Thirteen patients had all three serial tumor biopsies. Three of these procedures resulted in complications that required an intervention; all for the treatment of a biopsy-induced pneumothorax. Conclusion(s): We conclude that induction gemcitabine/carboplatin followed by concurrent paclitaxel/carboplatin with conformal radiation to 74 Gy is safe and tolerable with promising efficacy. We demonstrated that dedicated and serial tumor collections are safe, feasible, and acceptable for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

4790,"Characteristics, sources and health risk assessment of airborne particulate PAHs in Chinese cities: A review Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are organic compounds composed of at least two benzene rings. This paper reviews the characteristics, sources and health risk of airborne particulate PAHs in Chinese cities. The airborne particulate PAH concentrations varied from 3.35 to 910ngm-3, with an average of 75.0ngm-3, and the pollution level of PAHs in northern cities was generally higher than that in southern cities. The PAH concentrations in different cities underwent similar seasonal variations, with high concentrations in the winter and relatively low concentrations in the summer. Many factors, such as meteorological conditions and source emissions, influenced the spatiotemporal pattern of PAHs. High temperatures, frequent flow exchanges, abundant rainfall and strong solar radiation reduced the level of particulate PAHs in the atmosphere. The historical changes in the level of airborne particulate PAHs in four cities were analyzed. The PAH concentrations in Beijing and Taiyuan presented a trend of first increasing and then decreasing, while the level of particulate PAHs in Nanjing and Guangzhou had a decreasing tendency from year 2000-2015. The airborne particulate PAHs in cities were derived from several sources, including coal combustion, vehicle emissions, coking industries, biomass burning and petroleum volatilization. The results of a health risk assessment indicated that the incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) for people in the northern cities was higher than that for people in the other regions, especially during the cold season. Moreover, adults were at greater risk than people in other age groups, and the health risk to females was slightly higher than that to males. The potential risk of airborne particulate PAH exposure was relatively high in some cities, and controlling PAH emissions at the source should be required to prevent pollution.

The resection rate was 61% and 72% (P = .058). The R0 resection rate was 71% (51 of 72) in patients who received preoperative chemoradiotherapy and 40% (37 of 92) in patients assigned to immediate surgery (P, .001). Preoperative chemoradiotherapy was associated with significantly better disease-free survival and locoregional failure-free interval as well as with significantly lower rates of pathologic lymph nodes, perineural invasion, and venous invasion. Survival analysis of patients who underwent tumor resection and started adjuvant chemotherapy showed improved survival with preoperative chemoradiotherapy (35.2 v 19.8 months; P = .029). The proportion of patients who suffered serious adverse events was 52% versus 41% (P = .096). CONCLUSION Preoperative chemoradiotherapy for resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer did not show a significant overall survival benefit. Although the outcomes of the secondary end points and predefined subgroup analyses suggest an advantage of the neoadjuvant approach, additional evidence is required.Copyright Â© 2020 by American Society of Clinical Oncology",Excluded
4269,"Is selective nerve root block necessary for learning percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy: a comparative study using a cumulative summation test for learning curve Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of lumbar spine selective nerve root block (SNRB) experience on the learning efficiency of percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy (PELD) for junior trainees. Method(s): A total of 480 patients undergoing single-level PELD performed by eight junior trainees were included. The trainees were divided into two groups based on whether they had previous SNRB experience (group A, yes; group B, no). Surgical proficiency was defined as total operation time less than 65 minutes and cumulative radiation exposure time no more than 40 seconds. The learning curve was analyzed by cumulative summation (CUSUM) test. Clinical evaluations included Macnab classification, visual analog scale (VAS)-low back score, VAS-leg score, and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Follow-up information at 12 months was also obtained. Result(s): Integral number of cases before achieving an acceptable surgical level in group A (47.75 +/- 2.50 cases) was significantly smaller than that in group B (56.50 +/- 1.29 cases, p < 0.05), along with less accumulated failure (18.75 +/- 0.96 cases vs. 25.50 +/- 1.75 cases, p < 0.05). The two groups were comparable in clinical outcomes. Forty-seven cases of complications were observed, with 17 in group A and 30 in group B (p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Previous experience of SNRB improved the performance of PELD with shorter operation time and less radiation exposure. SNRB practice may reduce the complication rate without a significant effect on the recurrence of symptoms and reoperation.Copyright Â© 2020, SICOT aisbl.",Excluded
4083,"Posterior intersegmental fusion of unstable Jefferson fracture Introduction The patient was a 37-year-old man who was a victim of a motor-vehicle accident. On arrival at the emergency department, the patients' vital signs were all within normal physiological range. His GCS was 15/15. He had suffered from neck pain. In physical examination, he had upper cervical spine tenderness but there was no abnormal palpable deformity. Other physical examinations were normal. Plain X-ray of the cervical spines was nonconclusive. Cervical-spine CT scan demonstrated an isolated unstable Jefferson fracture associated with Spence's criteria. Cervical CT angiography was normal. Materials and Methods The patient was placed in the prone position and the alignment and the position of the atlantoaxial complex was verified by the use of real-time fluoroscopy. The cervical spine was exposed subperiosteally from the occiput to the level of C3-4. The C1-2 articulation was exposed. After the dorsal root ganglion of C2 was retracted inferiorly, the middle of the junction of the posterior arch of C1 and the midpoint of the inferoposterior part of the C1 lateral mass was exposed. The screws were placed via Magerl trans-facet screw technique. Then screws were connected with a rod and nuts to reduce lateral spread of the lateral masses. Results Postoperative cervical CT scan showed that the screws are in favorable position. Conclusion The treatment of unstable Jefferson fractures remains controversial. Conservative treatment usually associates with the longtime of immobilization in halo vest, whereas conventional posterior surgical treatments generally eliminate the range of motion of the upper cervical spines. With the posterior intersegmental fusion of unstable atlas fracture, the stabilization of anterior arch of atlas can be achieved while at the same time atlantoaxial rotation is preserved.",Excluded
4886,"Effectiveness of postoperative radiotherapy on atypical meningioma patients: A population-based study Purpose: It is controversial whether atypical meningioma patients undergoing gross-total resection (GTR) can benefit from postoperative radiotherapy (PORT). This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of PORT on atypical meningioma patients. Method(s): Patients diagnosed with atypical meningioma from 2008 to 2015 were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated, and the log-rank test was used to compare the differences among groups. Univariable and multivariable COX regressions were conducted for survival analyses. Result(s): A total of 1,014 patients were enrolled. The 5-years survival rate of the overall patients was 79.0%. PORT was performed in 315 (31.1%) patients. The utilization rates of PORT in patients undergoing GTR and undergoing subtotal resection (STR) were 26.7% and 42.2%, respectively. For patients undergoing STR, log-rank test showed that overall survival (OS) time was significantly longer in patients receiving PORT than those not (p = 0.026). For patients undergoing GTR, OS time did not show significant association with PORT (p = 0.339). In addition, patients undergoing STR with PORT had no significantly different OS time compared with those undergoing GTR with PORT (p = 0.398). Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that receipt of PORT (p = 0.187) was not an independent predictor of OS after adjustment. Conclusion(s): PORT may not prolong the OS in atypical meningioma patients undergoing GTR. However, patients undergoing STR may benefit from PORT and achieve similar OS to those undergoing GTR.Copyright Â© 2019 Zeng, Shi and Guo.",Excluded
4307,"The effects of radiofrequency hyperthermia on pain and function in patients with knee osteoarthritis: a preliminary report BACKGROUND: The clinical evidence of the efficacy of hyperthermia on osteoarthritis (OA) has not yet been clearly established. In addition, the application of a modality that can control the temperature inside the joints has not been reported. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of percutaneous radiofrequency hyperthermia, which could safely raise the temperature of the body core, in patients with OA knees., METHODS: Temperature changes inside the knee joint without OA were measured during exposure to radiofrequency. Radiofrequency hyperthermia was performed on 12 OA knees by exposure to 8 MHz and 200 W for 20 min, 3 times, at 1-week intervals. The clinical outcome was evaluated by use of the Lequesne index (LI) and the Japan Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scale. The osteoarthritis research society international (OARSI) responder criteria were also analyzed., RESULTS: Radiofrequency hyperthermia of 8 MHz and 200 W for 20 min increased the temperature inside the joint from 34.4 to 39.4degreeC. The LI decreased by 3.55 points from baseline during the 3 weeks. The JOA scale improved significantly during the period, reaching 86.25 points at the final examination from baseline of 67.5 points. 67% of patients had a response to the therapy according to OARSI criteria. No side effects were observed., CONCLUSIONS: Radiofrequency hyperthermia can safely increase the temperature inside the knee joint. Radiofrequency hyperthermia on OA knees provides a remarkable pain relief effect and can improve the patients' daily life. In the future, clinical studies should be performed with a protocol containing more cases, with appropriate control groups.",Excluded
4493,"Evaluation of endogenous control gene(s) for gene expression studies in human blood exposed to 60Co gamma-rays ex vivo In gene expression studies, it is critical to normalize data using a stably expressed endogenous control gene in order to obtain accurate and reliable results. However, we currently do not have a universally applied endogenous control gene for normalization of data for gene expression studies, particularly those involving (60)Co gamma-ray-exposed human blood samples. In this study, a comparative assessment of the gene expression of six widely used housekeeping endogenous control genes, namely 18S, ACTB, B2M, GAPDH, MT-ATP6 and CDKN1A, was undertaken for a range of (60)Co gamma-ray doses (0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 Gy) at 8.4 Gy min(-1) at 0 and 24 h post-irradiation time intervals. Using the NormFinder algorithm, real-time PCR data obtained from six individuals (three males and three females) were analyzed with respect to the threshold cycle (Ct) value and abundance, DELTACt pair-wise comparison, intra- and inter-group variability assessments, etc. GAPDH, either alone or in combination with 18S, was found to be the most suitable endogenous control gene and should be used in gene expression studies, especially those involving qPCR of gamma-ray-exposed human blood samples.

4335,"Treatment of skin laxity using multisource, phase-controlled radiofrequency in Asians: visualized 3-dimensional skin tightening results and increase in elastin density shown through histologic investigation BACKGROUND: A new multisource phase-controlled radiofrequency (MPCRF) device is widely used for skin tightening and rejuvenation in Asia., OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of MPCRF objectively and histologically., METHODS: An MPCRF device with real-time impedance control was evaluated. Ten Japanese patients were treated one side of the face, and the untreated side served as a control. Three-dimensional (3-D) imaging was performed to evaluate the posttreatment volume change. An independent observer assessed the 3-D images. Histologic evaluations of elastin were performed by Victoria Blue staining in 5 Japanese patients., RESULTS: Objective assessments evaluated by a 3-D color schematic representation showed improvement in skin laxity after the final treatment in all patients. The treated side improved markedly compared with the untreated side; however, even the untreated side slightly improved. The elastin density was significantly increased compared with controls in all 5 Japanese patients (p = .0013). Induced elastin appeared to be relatively thin elastic fibers without irregular elastic fibers, such as solar elastosis. Side effects were not observed, and the patients reported feeling comfortable throughout the study., CONCLUSION: Multisource phase-controlled radiofrequency treatments provide stimulation of elastin and skin-tightening results safely and effectively, and thus are beneficial for improving skin laxity and rhytides.",Excluded
4796,"Imaging quality and diagnostic reliability of low-dose computed tomography lumbar spine for evaluating patients with spinal disorders BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Computed tomography (CT) scans of the lumbar spine (CTLS) have demonstrated a higher level of accuracy than plain films and have been used to assess patients with spinal disorder when magnetic resonance imaging is not available. Nevertheless, radiation exposure remains a serious safety concern. Iterative reconstruction (IR) decreases the CT radiation dose for diagnostic imaging. However, the feasibility of using IR in CTLS is unclear., PURPOSE: To evaluate the imaging quality and diagnostic reliability of CTLS with IR., STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study., PATIENT SAMPLE: All patients from outpatient departments who suffered from spinal disorders and were referred for CTLS., OUTCOME MEASURES: In acquired CT images, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the dural sac (DS), intervertebral disc (IVD), psoas muscle (PM), and L5 vertebral body, the contrast-to-noise ratio between the DS and IVD (D-D CNR), and the subjective imaging qualities were compared across groups. Interobserver agreement was evaluated with kappa values., METHODS: Patients receiving low radiation CTLS were divided into three groups. A 150 mAs tube current with 120 kVp tube voltage was used with Group A and a 230 mAs tube current with 100 kVp tube voltage with Group B. Intended end radiation exposure was 50% less than that of the control group. Tube modulation was active for all groups. The images of the two low-radiation groups were reconstructed by IR; those of the control group by filtered back-projection (FBP)., RESULTS: The SNRs of the DS, IVD, PM, BM, and D-D CNR of Group A were not inferior to those of the control group. All SNRs and D-D CNRs for Group B were inferior to those of the control group. Except for that of the facet joint, all subjective imaging ratings for anatomic regions were equivalent between Groups A and B. Interobserver agreement was highest for the control group (0.72-0.88), followed by Group A (0.69-0.83) and B (0.55-0.83)., CONCLUSIONS: Fifty percent tube current reduction combined with IR provides equivalent diagnostic accuracy and improved patient safety when compared with conventional CTLS. Our results support its use as a screening tool. With the tube modulation technique, further adjustments in weighting IR and FBP algorithms based on body mass index become unnecessary.Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Method(s): Data for patients with recurrent HGGs who received SRT and Bv (n = 29) or Bv (n = 29) between June 2014 and September 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients received conventional radiotherapy (total, 60 Gy) before this study. SRT was administered at a median dose of 42 Gy in 3-7 fractions. The recurrence pattern was classified into 3 groups: in-field, marginal, and out-field. Result(s): The median overall survival in the SRT-Bv group was significantly longer than that in the Bv group (10.4 vs. 5.6 months; P = 0.02). In patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type tumors, the SRT-Bv treatment significantly prolonged survival more than the Bv treatment (10.9 vs. 8.2 months; P = 0.01). The World Health Organization grade and presence or absence of SRT were significant prognostic factors in the univariate analysis. Besides brain edema in 2 cases and asymptomatic subdural hematoma in 1 case, no other severe adverse effect due to SRT-Bv treatment was recorded. The pattern of recurrence was as follows: in-field, 2 cases (7%); marginal, 8 cases (28%); out-field, 11 cases (38%); no recurrence on radiologic findings, 6 cases (21%); and uncertain, 2 cases (7%). Conclusion(s): SRT-Bv treatment significantly prolonged survival duration more than Bv treatment and provides good local control in patients with recurrent HGGs, especially those with isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type tumors.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

Urine samples provided by workers are tested directly to analyze the tritium concentrations and estimate internal exposure dose. Since 2004, an average of approximately 1600 workers have been monitored annually, with an average annual monitoring frequency of approximately 11 000. Since 2004, the average annual collective dose of tritium internal exposure was 149.62 person.mSv, accounting for 19.07% of the total annual collective dose. A total of 18 workers' annual individual internal tritium radiation doses exceeded 2 mSv, of which 5 workers' internal tritium radiation doses in a single intake exceeded 2 mSv. The occupational population with the largest total internal tritium radiation doses consists of maintenance personnel, fuel operators, and radiation protection personnel, whose collective doses of internal exposure account for 75.51% of the total collective doses within the plant. Over 15 years of operation, the internal tritium radiation doses of workers in the Third Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant have been strictly controlled within the national regulatory limit and power plant management target, ensuring the health and safety of the workers.Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2019.",Excluded
4190,"Residential randon exposure and lung cancer risk in Misasa, Japan: a case-control study In order to investigate an association between residential radon exposure and risk of lung cancer, a case-control study was conducted in Misasa Town, Tottori Prefecture, Japan. The case series consisted of 28 people who had died of lung cancer in the years 1976-96 and 36 controls chosen randomly from the residents in 1976, matched by sex and year of birth. Individual residential radon concentrations were measured for 1 year with alpha track detectors. The average radon concentration was 46 Bq/m3 for cases and 51 Bq/m3 for controls. Compared to the level of 24 or less Bq/m3, the adjusted odds ratios of lung cancer associated with radon levels of 25-49, 50-99 and 100 or more Bq/m3, were 1.13 (95% confidence interval; 0.29-4.40), 1.23 (0.16-9.39) and 0.25 (0.03-2.33), respectively. None of the estimates showed statistical significance, due to small sample size. When the subjects were limited to only include residents of more than 30 years, the estimates did not change substantially. This study did not find that the risk pattern of lung cancer, possibly associated with residential radon exposure, in Misasa Town differed from patterns observed in other countries.",Excluded

Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed the data of 57 patients with malignant cancer-associated venous obstruction. Nineteen patients underwent the placement of a stent combined with a linear strand of 125I seeds (group A), and 38 patients underwent the placement of a bare stent (group B). The following parameters were compared between the 2 groups of patients: symptom relief rate, duration of venous patency, survival time, quality of life, and adverse events. Result(s): A total of 34 stents and 527 seeds were implanted in group A, while a total of 57 stents were implanted in group B. The surgery success rate was 96.5%, and no serious complication related to the surgery was reported. Symptoms of venous obstruction improved significantly after surgery. The score of group A decreased from 14.74 +/- 0.562 points before surgery to 2.79 +/- 1.357 points after surgery(P <.001), and the score of group B decreased from 13.79 +/- 1.398 points before surgery to 5.55 +/- 3.674 points after surgery (P <.001). The patency rate of group A was significantly higher than that of group B at 1 to 6 months after surgery (100%, 84.2%, 68.4%, 63.2%, 36.8%, 21.1% vs 68.4%, 23.7%, 18.4%, 7.9%, 5.3%, 2.6%, respectively; P <.05). Before treatment, there was no statistically significant difference in the Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score between the groups (P =.791). After 1 to 6 months of treatment, the KPS score was significantly higher in group A than in group B (P =.013). The median patency duration in groups A and B was 125 days (95% CI: 80.018-169.982) and 35 days (95% CI: 20.501-49.499), respectively (P <.001). The median survival time of group A was 155 days (95% CI: 110.406-199.594), and that of group B was 98 days (95% CI: 55.712-140.288; P =.325). Multivariate analysis showed that the implantation of a stent combined with a linear strand of 125I seeds and the KPS score (>=80 points) were independent factors of long-term patency after stent placement. Conclusion(s): The placement of a stent combined with a linear strand of 125I seeds is a safe and effective treatment for venous obstruction caused by malignant tumors. This treatment provides prolonged patency compared with the placement of bare stent, and while it does not significantly improve the survival time of patients, it can improve their quality of life.Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2020.",Excluded
4253,"Image quality from high-resolution CT of the lung: comparison of axial scans and of sections reconstructed from volumetric data acquired using MDCT OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to compare the image quality of reconstructed thin sections obtained from a 16-MDCT scanner with that of axial high-resolution CT scans of the same patient. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fifty consecutive patients referred for CT of the chest underwent 16-MDCT and, subsequently, axial high-resolution CT. The volumetric raw data from the MDCT scans were reconstructed into slices 2-mm thick using a high-spatial-frequency reconstruction algorithm. Two blinded reviewers independently rated the images from both methods for subjective image-quality criteria. The results were tested for statistical significance using Wilcoxon's signed rank test, and p values of less than 0.05 were considered significant. The effective dose for axial high-resolution CT and volumetric MDCT was calculated. RESULT(S): Motion artifacts were significantly more common on high-resolution CT scans than on reconstructed thin-section images (p < 0.001). The two methods differed significantly in lung attenuation (p = 0.008), mainly because of the presence of ground-glass opacities. The assessment of ground-glass attenuation was superior on axial high-resolution CT. The effective doses were 3.8 mSv for MDCT and 0.9 mSv for high-resolution CT. CONCLUSION(S): Reconstructed high-resolution images generated from a single MDCT data acquisition are of comparable quality to images obtained using conventional axial high-resolution CT. However, contiguous MDCT is not recommended for diseases showing predominantly ground-glass patterns, because axial high-resolution CT delineates ground-glass attenuation significantly better.",Excluded
4905,"Seeds screening aqueous synthesis, multiphase interfacial separation and in situ optical characterization of invisible ultrathin silver nanowires We report a multi-step synthetic method to obtain ultrathin silver nanowires (Ag NWs) from an aqueous solution with a ~17 nm diameter average, and where some of them decreased down to 9 nm. Carefully designed seed screening processes including LED irradiation at high temperature for a short time, and then continuous H2O2 etching, and relative growth mechanisms of high-yield five-twinned pentagonal seeds and ultrathin Ag NWs in aqueous environment are detailed. Then, a rapid and simple multiphase interfacial assembly method particularly suitable for the separation of ultrathin Ag NWs from various by-products was demonstrated with a clear mechanism explanation. Next, a unique optical interaction between light and individual AG NWs, as well as feature structures in the AG NWs film, was investigated by a micro-domain optical confocal microscope measurement in situ together with a theoretical explanation using modal transmission theory. That revealed that the haze problem of AG NWs films was not only arising from the interaction between light and individual or crossed Ag NWs but was also greatly dependent on a weak coupling effect of leaky modes supported by adjacent Ag NWs with large distances which had not been considered before. We then provided direct experimental evidence and concluded how to obtain haze-free films with 100% transparency in the whole visible range based on ultrathin Ag NWs. This breakthrough in diameter confinement and purification of Ag NWs is a highly expected step to overcome the well-focused light diffusion and absorption problems of Ag NWs-based devices applied in various fields such as flexible electronics, high-clarity displays, visible transparent heaters, photovoltaics and various optoelectronic technologies.",Excluded
3712,"Analysis of age as a factor in NASA astronaut selection and career landmarks NASA's periodic selection of astronauts is a highly selective process accepting applications from the general population, wherein the mechanics of selection are not made public. This research was an effort to determine if biases (specifically age) exist in the process and, if so, at which points they might manifest. Two sets of analyses were conducted. The first utilized data requested via the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) on NASA astronaut applicants for the 2009 and 2013 selection years. Using a series of multinomial and logistic regressions, the data were analyzed to uncover whether age of the applicants linearly or nonlinearly affected their likelihood of receiving an invitation, as well as their likelihood of being selected into the astronaut program. The second used public data on age at selection and age at other career milestones for every astronaut selected from 1959 to 2013 to analyze trends in age over time using ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression and Pearson's correlation. The results for the FOIA data revealed a nonlinear relationship between age and receiving an interview, as well as age and selection into the astronaut program, but the most striking observation was the loss of age diversity at each stage of selection. Applicants younger or older than approximately 40 years were significantly less likely to receive invitations for interviews and were significantly less likely to be selected as an astronaut. Analysis of the public-source data for all selections since the beginning of the astronaut program revealed significant age trends over time including a gradual increase in selectee age and decreased tenure at NASA after last flight, with average age at retirement steady over the entire history of the astronaut program at approximately 48 years.",Excluded
4871,"Lung cancer and cigarette smoking in Europe: An update of risk estimates and an assessment of inter-country heterogeneity Ten case-control studies have been carried out in 6 European countries to investigate the major risk factors for lung cancer. Carcinogenic effect from cigarette smoke was the most relevant interest in our study, which has included 7,609 cases of lung cancer and 10,431 controls, mainly population based. The results indicate elevated odds ratios (ORs; 23.9 among men and 8.7 among women) with attributable risks exceeding 90% for men and close to 60% for women. A large, and statistically significant, variability of the results across countries was detected after adjusting for the most common confounding variables, and after controlling, at least in part, for the instability of the ORs due to the small number of non-smokers in some of the study subsets. This pattern of lung cancer risk associated with cigarettes smoke, across different European regions, reflects inherent characteristics of the studies as well as differences in smoking habits, particularly calender periods of starting, and it is likely to have been influenced by effect modifiers like indoor radon exposure, occupation, air pollution and dietary habits.

4651,"Radiation-induced sarcoma of head and neck: 50 years of experience at a single institution in an endemic area of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in China Radiation-induced sarcoma in the head and neck (RISHN) is a rare condition whose clinical presentation and management remain difficult because of its low incidence. In this retrospective study, we analyzed the symptoms, diagnosis, and the treatment of 16,634 patients with head and neck disease, who received radiotherapy between 1960 and 2010 at the Affiliated Tumor Hospital and its predecessor, Guangxi Medical University, China. Among these patients, 16 with a first tumor of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and 1 with squamous carcinoma of the tongue met the criteria of RISHN in the head and neck. Our epidemiological data showed that the incidence of RISHN rose from 0.06 to 0.17% from 1960 to 2010; the 3-year overall survival rate was 19.1%, and 3-year diseasefree survival rate was 11.1%. The mean latency (SD) period was 93.2 (33) months. Based on the experiences at our institution, we suggest that RISHN is a rare complication after radiotherapy for head and neck tumors, especially NPC. Owing to its low incidence, it should not be a major factor affecting decisions about radiotherapy. Nevertheless, there may be a possibility of increasing incidence of RISHN after radiotherapy of NPC, as shown in our epidemiological results. Given the poor prognosis of RISHN, this possibility should be taken into serious consideration before determination of high-dose radiotherapy for patients with NPC and other head and neck tumors.

4874,"Irradiation of male mammary gland for the prevention of hormone induced gynecomastia Treatment of carcinoma of the prostate with female sex hormones causes not only impotence but also swollen, painfully mammary glands. The radiobiological response of the mammary glands renders it possible to prevent hormone induced gynecomastia by means of radiotherapy. On this indication, 121 patients treated with female sex hormones between 1961 and 1972 for carcinoma of the prostate were subjected to irradiation of both mammary glands. On 4 successive days, daily doses of 300 r surface dose were administered to each mammary gland, corresponding to a focal dose of 840 r at 3 cm tissue depth. The parameters were: roentgen radiation, 150 kV, 20 mA, 0.5 mm Cu, focus skin distance 40 cm, field size 6 x 6 m. 84 patients could be followed up more than 6 mth after the treatment. In 67 cases (79.8%), development of gynecomastia was completely suppressed, while in 16 cases, a slight degree of gynecomastia had occurred in spite of the irradiation. In one case, the gynecomastia that had already been completely developed at the time of the radiotherapy, had remained uninfluenced apart from a mitigation of the sensation of tension. In 6 of the patients who were free from gynecomastia (8.9%) the hormone treatment had been started prior to the radiotherapy. This proportion was considerably larger among the patients with mild gynecomastia, viz. 75% (12 cases). The lesser effect of the radiotherapy is considered to be correlated with the duration and dosage of the hormone treatment started prior to the radiotherapy, and may also be correlated with the duration of the interval between the end of the hormone treatment and the start of the irradiation.",Excluded

4290,"Radiation esophagitis in the treatment for lung cancer We retrospectively studied the 62 patients with primary lung cancer (56 males and 6 females) who were admitted to our department from January 1990 to December 1996. They were treated with radiation therapy (twice daily) for the chest, including the esophagus. The total radiation dose was 55.6Gy (mean). Esophagitis occurred in 48 patients (77%) after 29.7Gy (mean) of radiation. The symptoms of esophagitis included pharyngeal or chest pain, especially during swallowing. The incidence of esophagitis in the patients (n=46) who received chemotherapy before radiation was significantly higher than that in the patients (n=16) who did not receive it (87% vs. 50%; p<0.05). Esophagitis occurred in 22 (81%) among 27 patients who were given the preventive medicine. In spite of the optimal or supplemental administration of mucosal coating agents, esophagitis improved only in six patients (12%). Severe esophagitis was also observed in some patients, including two patients whose irradiation was terminated and one patient who was treated with intravenous hyperalimentation. Although radiation esophagitis is a very common complication in the treatment for lung cancer, it is refractory to usual treatments. Consequently, it is necessary to develop more effective prophylactic and treatment methods for radiation esophagitis.",Excluded
3940,"Reduced acute bowel toxicity in patients treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy for rectal cancer PURPOSE: We have previously shown that intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) can reduce dose to small bowel, bladder, and bone marrow compared with three-field conventional radiotherapy (CRT) technique in the treatment of rectal cancer. The purpose of this study was to review our experience using IMRT to treat rectal cancer and report patient clinical outcomes., METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective review was conducted of patients with rectal cancer who were treated at Mayo Clinic Arizona with pelvic radiotherapy (RT). Data regarding patient and tumor characteristics, treatment, acute toxicity according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v 3.0, tumor response, and perioperative morbidity were collected., RESULTS: From 2004 to August 2009, 92 consecutive patients were treated. Sixty-one (66%) patients were treated with CRT, and 31 (34%) patients were treated with IMRT. All but 2 patients received concurrent chemotherapy. There was no significant difference in median dose (50.4 Gy, CRT; 50 Gy, IMRT), preoperative vs. postoperative treatment, type of concurrent chemotherapy, or history of previous pelvic RT between the CRT and IMRT patient groups. Patients who received IMRT had significantly less gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. Sixty-two percent of patients undergoing CRT experienced >=Grade 2 acute GI side effects, compared with 32% among IMRT patients (p = 0.006). The reduction in overall GI toxicity was attributable to fewer symptoms from the lower GI tract. Among CRT patients, >=Grade 2 diarrhea and enteritis was experienced among 48% and 30% of patients, respectively, compared with 23% (p = 0.02) and 10% (p = 0.015) among IMRT patients. There was no significant difference in hematologic or genitourinary acute toxicity between groups. In addition, pathologic complete response rates and postoperative morbidity between treatment groups did not differ significantly., CONCLUSIONS: In the management of rectal cancer, IMRT is associated with a clinically significant reduction in lower GI toxicity compared with CRT. Further study is needed to evaluate differences in late toxicity and long-term efficacy. Copyright AÂ© 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
3893,"Is routine postoperative chest radiography needed after open nephrectomy? OBJECTIVES: To assess whether routine postoperative chest radiography (CXR) is required after open nephrectomy for the detection and possible management of a pneumothorax. It has become the standard of care by many urologists to obtain routine postoperative CXRs after open nephrectomy to assess for the presence of a pneumothorax. However, at our institution, very few patients have developed a pneumothorax postoperatively, and, furthermore, the CXR findings almost never affected the clinical management., METHODS: Retrospective data were collected on the last 150 open nephrectomies performed by two urologists at our institution. All laparoscopic nephrectomies and thoracoabdominal nephrectomies were excluded from analysis., RESULTS: A total of 150 patients underwent open nephrectomy between 1998 and 2003. The procedure was performed with an anterior subcostal, 11th rib, 12th rib, midline, and 10th rib incision in 60 (40%), 51 (34%), 18 (12%), 20 (13.3%), and 1 (0.67%) patient, respectively. Of the 150 patients, 92 (61.3%) underwent postoperative CXR and 58 (38.7%) did not. Of the 150 patients, 92 of whom had undergone postoperative CXR, 4 (2.7%) had a postoperative pneumothorax. One of these patients (0.67%) received a chest tube. Of the 4 patients with a pneumothorax, 3 had had a recognized pleural tear that was repaired at nephrectomy and the fourth had had an unrecognized pleural injury., CONCLUSIONS: Routine postoperative CXRs are not needed after open nephrectomy. Obtaining a selective CXR when a recognized intraoperative pleural tear has occurred, a central line is placed, the physical examination reveals an abnormality (ie, decreased breath sounds), or the patient experiences respiratory difficulties in the postoperative period is safe, cost-effective, and decreases the radiation exposure to patients.",Excluded

4214,"[ERCP procedures as a source of radiation risk to a single gastroenterologist] BACKGROUND: One of the numerous sub-areas of interventional radiology is the use of X-rays in gastroenterology. X-ray fluoroscopy is applied in therapeutic procedures, including endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) that is frequently performed. The ERCP procedure is aimed at imaging the pancreatic duct and biliary tracts., MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this paper radiation risk to the gastrenterologist performing ERCP procedures was investigated. The procedures were performed by a single gastroenterologist in the ERCP Laboratory, University Clinical Hospital Military Memorial Medical Academy - Central Veterans' Hospital in Lodz, Poland. The study comprised 2 series of measurements, one taken during the procedures with continuous fluoroscopy mode, the other during procedures with fluoroscopy in pulsed mode at a frequency of 3 pulses/s. Exposure parameters, anatomical data of patient and dose equivalents for the eyes, skin of the hand and the effective dose for whole body of the gastroenterologist were recorded during each procedure., RESULTS: The collected data cover 70 ERCP procedures - 40 procedures were controlled by continuous fluoroscopy and 30 by pulsed fluoroscopy. The results reveal that pulsed fluoroscopy makes it possible to reduce doses received by the gastroeneterologist from 45% to 60% compared to continuous fluoroscopy., CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography procedures can cause radiation risk to the gastroenterologist performing them. The use of continuous fluoroscopy can result in achieving an equivalent dose to eye lens nearly 20 mSv per year, i.e., the decreased annual limit recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP).

Seventy-five patients who underwent standard contrast-enhanced abdominal CT for suspected appendicitis between 2004 and 2009 were retrospectively included. Low-dose CT reconstructions with 75%, 50%, and 25% of the original radiation dose level were generated by applying realistic reduced-dose simulation. Two blinded, independent readers assessed image quality, signal-to-noise ratio, and diagnostic confidence on each dataset. Diagnostic accuracy for detection of appendicitis and complications were calculated for each reader. Paired univariate tests were used to determine intraindividual differences., RESULTS: Among 75 subjects included in the analysis (57% female, mean age: 41 +/- 18 years), the prevalence of histopathologically confirmed appendicitis was 59%. Signal-to-noise ratio and subjective image quality of 50% and 25% reduced-dose CTs were significantly lower than the reference datasets (all P < .005). Appendicitis was correctly identified in all reference and low-dose datasets (sensitivity: 100%, negative predictive value: 100%). Presence of complications was correctly detected in all reference, 75%, and 50% datasets, but was decreased in 25% datasets (sensitivity: 77.8% and negative predictive value: 97.4%). Diagnostic confidence was high for original and 75% datasets, but significantly lower for 50% and 25% datasets (P < .001)., CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that diagnostic accuracy in abdominal CT acquisitions acquired at 75% and 50% of radiation dose is maintained in patients with suspected appendicitis, whereas further reduction of radiation exposition is associated with decreased diagnostic performance.

4821,"Damage of nasal mucociliary movement after intensity-modulated radiation therapy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Radiation usually results in paranasal sinusitis in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), which influences patients' quality of life. This study aimed to determine the relationships between dose distribution in the nasal cavity and nasal mucous injury in patients with NPC treated by intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and to find the tolerable radiation dose for the nasal mucous., METHODS: Sixty-six patients with NPC treated by IMRT between October 2006 and November 2008 were enrolled. The irradiation dose in the nasal cavity was determined by the computer with the IMRT work platform. Mucociliary transport rate (MTR) was detected by modified saccharine test before IMRT, at the end of IMRT, and at 3, 6, and 12 months after IMRT., RESULTS: The data were available for 129 nasal cavities. The cavities receiving a mean dose below or equal to 37 Gy showed substantial preservation of nasal mucous after IMRT. The MRT decreased to (62.82 +/- 38.59)%, (56.78 +/- 37.79)%, (64.05 +/- 39.37)%, and (71.13 +/- 39.55)% of pre-IMRT value at 4 time points after IMRT, with significant differences among the data (P < 0.05). In contrast, when the cavities received a mean dose higher than 37 Gy, no significant differences in MTR among the time points were observed. At 3 months after IMRT, the MTR was the lowest (38.27% of pre-RT value)., CONCLUSIONS: A mean radiation dose of <= 37 Gy for the nasal cavity is an optimal dose to protect the nasal cavity function.",Excluded
4243,"Cosmic rays activity and monthly number of deaths: a correlative study We studied the relation between the intensity of cosmic rays, the level of solar/geomagnetic activity, and the monthly numbers of deaths in a large hospital in Israel and in all Lithuania. The Israeli data include 30526 hospital deaths, two groups of fatal suicides (2359, 2763), and 15435 suicidal attempts for two periods of 108 and 236 consecutive months. The national data for the entire Republic of Lithuania include 424925 deaths for the period of 120 consecutive months. Cosmic rays intensity was measured by an Apatity neutron monitor. We obtained the data on solar, geomagnetic radiovawe propagation, ionosphere ionization hours, proton flux of two energy levels (>90 and 60 MeV) from the National Geophysical Data Center at Goddard Space Flight Center, National Space Environment Center at Boulder, Colorado, USA, and from the Institute of Terrestrial Magnetism, Ionosphere and Radio Wave Propagation (IZMIRAN), Russia. We calculated Pearson coefficients and their probabilities for correlation between monthly space activity level and monthly number of male and female deaths from different causes. Cosmic rays activity revealed significant negative correlation with solar/geomagnetic activity indices and related physical phenomena levels. This activity strongly correlated with flux of protons with the energies >90 MeV proton flux and did not exhibit significant correlation with 60 MeV proton fluxes. Cosmic rays intensity correlation with monthly numbers of deaths was strong for noncardiovascular deaths, suicides, and traffic accidents. The correlation was much weaker for deaths caused by ishemic heart disease and strokes.",Excluded
4671,"A randomized trial comparing levothyroxine with radioactive iodine in the treatment of sporadic nontoxic goiter A randomized clinical trial was performed in consecutive patients with sporadic nontoxic nodular goiter to compare efficacy and side effects of iodine-131 (131I) therapy with suppressive levothyroxine (L-thyroxine) treatment. Sixty-four patients were randomized after stratification for sex and menopausal age to receive 131I (4.44 MBq/g thyroid; group A) or suppressive L-thyroxine treatment aiming at TSH values between 0.01 and 0.1 mU/L (group B). The main outcome measurements after 2 yr were goiter size by ultrasound, serum thyroid function tests, markers of bone turnover, and bone mineral density (BMD). Fifty-seven patients completed the trial. Goiter size was reduced after 2 yr by 44% in group A and by 1% in group B (P < 0.001). Nonresponders (goiter reduction < 13%)were 1 of 29 patients in group A and 16 of 28 patients in group B (P = 0.00001). In responders, goiter reduction in group A (46%) was greater than in group B (22%; P < 0.005). In group A, 45% of patients developed hypothyroidism. In group B, 10 patients experienced thyrotoxic symptoms, requiring discontinuation of treatment in 2 (in 1 because of atrial fibrillation). Markers of bone formation and bone resorption increased significantly in group B, related to a mean decrease of 3.6% of BMD at the lumbar spine after 2 yr (from 1.09 +/- 0.22 to 1.05 +/- 0.23 g/cm2; P < 0.001), both in pre- and postmenopausal women. No changes in BMD were observed in group A. In conclusion, 131I therapy is more effective and better tolerated than L-thyroxine treatment in patients with sporadic nontoxic goiter.

4389,"Key factors affecting the spring emergence of pea moth (Cydia nigricana) The hypothesis that spring emergence of the pea moth Cydia nigricana is regulated by environmental factors, particularly photoperiod and temperature, was examined in this study. A long-term field study was conducted in two distinct pea-growing areas in Hesse and Saxony, Germany. Strong correlations between the flight phenology of pea moth in spring and air temperature, soil temperature, solar radiation and day length were demonstrated for three consecutive years. In laboratory experiments, we elucidated the interaction of different photoperiod-temperature regimes, verifying cumulative day-degree data in relation to pea moth emergence rates in the field. C. nigricana temperature sensitivity is apparently initiated by long day conditions with a critical day length of about 14 h L:D. The overall results contribute to the theory that photoperiod and temperature interact as regulatory cues for spring emergence of C. nigricana. The findings are discussed in terms of the development of predictive models and decision support systems for pea moth control.",Excluded
4257,"Importance of surveillance and success of salvage strategies after definitive chemoradiation in patients with esophageal cancer Purpose: Patients with esophageal carcinoma (EC) who are treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy (bimodality therapy [BMT]) experience frequent relapses. In a large cohort, we assessed the timing, frequency, and types of relapses during an aggressive surveillance program and the value of the salvage strategies. Patients and Methods: Patients with EC (N = 276) who received BMT were analyzed. Patients who had surgery within 6 months of chemoradiotherapy were excluded to reduce bias. We focused on local relapse (LR) and distant metastases (DM) and the salvage treatment of patients with LR only. Standard statistical methods were applied. Result(s): The median follow-up time was 54.3 months (95% CI, 48.4 to 62.4). First relapses included LR only in 23.2% (n = 64), DM with or without LR in 43.5% (n = 120), and no relapses in 33.3% (n = 92) of patients. Final relapses included no relapses in 33.3%, LR only in 14.5%, DM only in 15.9%, and DM plus LR in 36.2% of patients. Ninety-one percent of LRs occurred within 2 years and 98% occurred within 3 years of BMT. Twenty-three (36%) of 64 patients with LR only underwent salvage surgery, and their median overall survival was 58.6 months (95% CI, 28.8 to not reached) compared with those patients with LR only who were unable to undergo surgery (9.5 months; 95% CI, 7.8 to 13.3). Conclusion(s): Unlike in patients undergoing trimodality therapy, for whom surveillance/salvage treatment plays a lesser role,1 in the BMT population, approximately 8% of all patients (or 36% of patients with LR only) with LRs occurring more than 6 months after chemoradiotherapy can undergo salvage treatment, and their survival is excellent. Our data support vigilant surveillance, at least in the first 24 months after chemotherapy, in these patients.Copyright Â© 2014 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

3996,"Diagnostic accuracy of pulmonary CT angiography at low tube voltage: Intraindividual comparison of a normal-dose protocol at 120 kVp and a low-dose protocol at 80 kVp using reduced amount of contrast medium in a simulation study OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to simulate pulmonary emboli (PE) and image quality at low tube energy and reduced contrast material volume in normal-dose pulmonary CT angiography (CTA) images and to analyze the diagnostic accuracy with normal- and lowdose pulmonary CTA. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Normal-dose pulmonary CTA examinations using 120 kVp and 100 mL of contrast material in 10 patients with no PE were retrospectively selected. The image characteristics of an 80-kVp low-dose pulmonary CTA protocol (patient exposure reduction, 57%) with 75 mL of contrast material were simulated. Four different sets of filling defects were computer simulated in identical locations in each normal-dose and corresponding low-dose examination, equaling 783 PE in 40 normal-dose and 40 low-dose datasets. Ten normal- dose and 10 low-dose examinations contained no emboli and were used as controls. The 100 pulmonary CTA studies were randomly assessed by three readers blinded to PE location and image quality. The results were assessed by nonparametric tests and Student t tests. RESULTS. No difference was found between the CT protocols in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative diagnostic likelihood ratios at all ramification levels of the pulmonary arteries (p = 0.343-1). The overall sensitivity and specificity with the normal and simulated low-dose protocols were 79.9% versus 81.3% and 98.0% versus 98.2% (p = 0.444 and 0.702), respectively.

3769,"Risk of covid-19 infection of a bariatric surgery cohort at the beginning of the pandemic Background: Obesity is a known risk factor for COVID-19. The first case in New York was reported in March 1st, 2020 but it is believed that the virus was already spreading during the prior months. In our institution, bariatric surgery was carried out as usual until March 18th, at which time 92 cases of COVID-19 were already admitted. We believe that bariatric patients could have been exposed to COVID-19 during this overlap and sought to evaluate incidence of infection among this high-risk cohort at our institution. We sought to determine the incidence of COVID-19 in patients undergoing bariatric surgery during the preceding months of the pandemic. Method(s): This is a cross-sectional study from a single major bariatric center in the Bronx, New York. Patients who underwent bariatric surgery from January to March 2020 were included. Medical records were assessed looking COVID-19 symptoms and/or diagnosis. Additionally, phone interviews were made looking for COVID-19 symptoms and/or diagnosis outside our institution after the index operation. Result(s): A total of 203 patients were included. Eleven patients (5.4%) had post-op symptoms such as fever, cough and shortness of breath. Of those, 2 tested positive, 1 tested negative, 1 was diagnosed with X-ray findings, 6 were not tested and 1 had an alternate diagnosis. Additionally, 6 patients were tested negative without symptoms for different reasons. None of the patients identified had a severe disease.

4521,"Mayak worker dosimetry study: an overview The Mayak Production Association (MPA) was the first plutonium production plant in the former Soviet Union. Workers at the MPA were exposed to relatively large internal radiation intakes and external radiation exposures, particularly in the early years of plant operations. This paper describes the updated dosimetry database, ""Doses-2005."" Doses-2005 represents a significant improvement in the determination of absorbed organ dose from external radiation and plutonium intake for the original cohort of 18,831 Mayak workers. The methods of dose reconstruction of absorbed organ doses from external radiation uses: 1) archive records of measured dose and worker exposure history, 2) measured energy and directional response characteristics of historical Mayak film dosimeters, and 3) calculated dose conversion factors for Mayak Study-defined exposure scenarios using Monte Carlo techniques. The methods of dose reconstruction for plutonium intake uses two revised models developed from empirical data derived from bioassay and autopsy cases and/or updates from prevailing or emerging International Commission on Radiological Protection models. Other sources of potential significant exposure to workers such as medical diagnostic x-rays, ambient onsite external radiation, neutron radiation, intake of airborne effluent, and intake of nuclides other than plutonium were evaluated to determine their impact on the dose estimates.",Excluded
4298,"Ultraviolet-A1 phototherapy modulates Th1/Th2 and Tc1/Tc2 balance in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus Objective. Ultraviolet-A1 (UVA1) phototherapy is effective for a variety of dermatological diseases. We examined the effectiveness and reliability of low-dose UVA1 phototherapy (60kJ/m2/treatment) in patients suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We studied the changes in immunological parameters. Methods. The patients received a 9-week course of phototherapy according to the following regimen: five times a week during the first 3 weeks, three times a week during the second 3 weeks and twice during the last 3 weeks. Among other things, we analysed the proportions of T helper 1 (Th1), Th2, T cytotoxic (Tc1) and Tc2 cell populations in the peripheral blood of patients by flow cytometric detection of intracytoplasmic interferongamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin 4 (IL-4). Results. Our study showed the improvement of clinical symptoms determined by the subjective clinical disease activity scoring and the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI). By the end of UVA1 phototherapy, the mean value of SLEDAI had decreased from 7.2+/-5.6 to 0.9+/-1.8, which was significant (P = 0.005). Immunological investigations detected a decrease in the frequency of IFN-gamma-producing Th1 and Tc1 cells and a decrease in the Th1/Th2 and Tc1/Tc2 ratios after UVA1 therapy. Conclusion. According to the literature, IFN-gamma has a pathogenic role in the development of SLE. We observed a decreased proportion of IFN-gamma-secreting cells, which we think is presumably one of the beneficial effects of UVA1 therapy. On the basis of our study, UVA1 phototherapy does seem to be an effective adjuvant in the treatment of SLE patients. Â© The Author 2005.

Method(s): A total of 209 patients who underwent CCTA with suspected coronary artery disease scanned with SSCT (n=95) and DSCT (n=114) scanners using prospective ECG-triggered and retrospective ECG-gated protocols were recruited from two institutions. The image was assessed by two experienced observers, while quantitative assessment was performed by measuring the image noise, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). Effective dose was calculated using the latest published conversion coefficient factor. Result(s): A total of 2087 out of 2880 coronary artery segments were assessable, with 98.0% classified as of sufficient and 2.0% as of insufficient image quality for clinical diagnosis. There was no significant difference in overall image quality between prospective ECG-triggered and retrospective gated protocols, whether it was performed with DSCT or SSCT scanners. Prospective ECG-triggered protocol was compared in terms of radiation dose calculation between DSCT (6.5+/-2.9 mSv) and SSCT (6.2+/-1.0 mSv) scanners and no significant difference was noted (p=0.99). However, the effective dose was significantly lower with DSCT (18.2+/-8.3 mSv) than with SSCT (28.3+/-7.0 mSv) in the retrospective gated protocol. Conclusion(s): Prospective ECG-triggered CCTA reduces radiation dose significantly compared to retrospective ECG-gated CCTA, while maintaining good image quality. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This study investigated the dosimetric and set-up accuracy differences between these 2 set-up positions. Twenty NPC patients treated with HT from each set-up position were retrospectively recruited. HT plans were computed using the same target prescription and organs at risks (OARs) constraints for both set-up positions. The doses parameters of the target volumes and OARs were assessed. Daily megavoltage CT images were retrieved to obtain the set-up errors at 4th (C4) and 7th (C7) cervical levels. The mean values of these parameters were compared between the 2 set-up positions. The dose to NP target in FN group was more conformal than EN group, while the conformity of the neck targets in FN group were significantly lower. For the OARs, the temporal lobe, cerebellum, and hippocampus in FN group received significantly lower doses than the EN. However, the optic structures, brain stem, spinal cord, and parotid glands received higher doses in FN group. The systematic errors at C4 and C7 levels in FN group were larger in all translational directions except the ML direction at C7 level. With regard to radiotherapy of NPC patient using helical tomotherapy, FN position reduced doses to intracranial structures but increased doses to optic structures and other structures when compared with the EN position.

The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic capability of hepatic dynamic CT with low-dose contrast material (420 mg I/kg body weight) at 80 kVp with that of the same modality performed with standard-dose contrast material at 120 kVp. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. We randomly assigned 111 patients (50 women, 61 men; mean age, 69.1 years) with known or suspected hepatocellular carcinoma and a body weight of 70 kg or less to one of two protocols. In the 80-kVp protocol, the contrast material (444 mg I/kg body weight) was delivered over 15 seconds at a tube voltage of 80 kVp. In the 120-kVp protocol, a contrast dose of 600 mg I/kg was delivered over 30 seconds at 120 kVp. Of the 111 patients, 38 had hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma. Using the Mann-Whitney U test, we compared the two protocols for the contrast-to-noise ratio of the tumors (difference between tumor attenuation and liver attenuation divided by noise in the liver) and the figure of merit (square of contrast-to-noise ratio divided by effective dose) of the tumors during the arterial phase of imaging. Effective doses also were compared. RESULTS. The contrast-to-noise ratio of the tumors was significantly higher with the 80-kVp than with the 120-kVp protocol (median, 5.3 vs 4.2; p = 0.04). The figure of merit also was significantly higher with the 80-kVp than with the 120-kVp protocol (10.2 vs 5.3, p = 0.02). The effective dose was significantly lower with the 80-kVp than with the 120-kVp protocol (2.97 vs 3.41 mSv, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION.

4439,"Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and its correlation with clinical symptoms and endoscopic findings in patients with chronic radiation proctitis AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as a key proangiogenic factor and determine whether there is any correlation between its expression and clinical symptoms or endoscopic changes in patients with chronic radiation proctitis (ChRP)., METHOD: Fifty patients who had all undergone radiotherapy for prostate, cervical or uterine cancer were included in the study (37 women, 13 men). There was a control group of 20 patients (9 women, 11 men). The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (RTOG/EORTC) scoring system was used for grading the severity of the proctitis. Endoscopic scoring of late rectal mucosal damage was performed using Gilinsky's classification. Serum levels of VEGF were analysed by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method., RESULTS: Most patients presented with Grade 1 symptoms. Endoscopic assessment showed that most patients had Grade 1 late rectal mucosal damage. The predominant endoscopic finding was the presence of telangiectasia. Assessment of VEGF correlation between the control group and the degrees of endoscopic changes showed statistically significant differences for all three degrees (P < 0.0001, P = 0.0251 and P = 0.0005, respectively). Due to the small numbers of patients with Grades 2 and 3 symptoms using the RTOG/EORTC scoring system, they were grouped with Grades 1 and 4 respectively forming two groups for statistical purposes. VEGF expression differed significantly between controls and group I and between controls and group II (P = 0.0001, P = 0.0009, respectively)., CONCLUSION: A significant increase in VEGF expression was found to correlate with clinical symptoms and endoscopic rectal mucosa changes in patients with ChRP, suggesting that it may play an important role in pathological angiogenesis.

4446,"Proton Pump Inhibitor Exposure and Acute Myocardial Infarction Risk: A Nested Cohort Study Background: Association of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) exposure with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) risk in the Caucasian population remains under debate. Here, we clarified whether PPI exposure might be related to an increased new-onset AMI risk in an Asian population. Method(s): Data of 27,624 patients with PPI exposure followed by new-onset AMI development were extracted from Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database and age- and sex-matched with 27,624 controls with PPIs exposure, but without subsequent AMI and ischemic heart disease development. The amount of PPI exposure was calculated based on the cumulative defined daily dose (cDDD) during the follow-up period. Subsequent AMI risk was measured after adjustments of demographic data and indication of PPI use. Result(s): AMI risk increased with an increase in PPI exposure: with cDDD <= 30 as the reference, the odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for cDDDs of > 365 was 1.56 (1.45-1.69). All five PPI categories, including pantoprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, esomeprazole, and rabeprazole, increased AMI risk. Conclusion(s): Our study demonstrated long-term or high-dose PPI exposure associated with increased new-onset AMI risk in patients without a history of any ischemic heart disease. The underlying mechanisms of PPI-related cardiovascular effects deserve more investigation.Copyright Â© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
3931,"The addition of induction chemotherapy with etoposide, ifosfamide, and cisplatin failed to improve therapeutic outcome of concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer - Single institution retrospective analysis Although chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is a standard treatment for unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the optimal sequencing remains to be determined. We retrospectively compared the treatment results of induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent CRT (induction group, 32 patients) with those of concurrent CRT alone (concurrent group, 41 patients) in unresectable stage IIIA/IIIB NSCLC patients. In induction group, 2 cycles of induction chemotherapy (etoposide/ifosfamide/cisplatin: 24 patients, others: 8 patients) were followed by concurrent CRT (60 Gy/30 fractions, 6 mg/m 2 of cisplatin daily), while the same concurrent CRT was administered in concurrent group. Clinicopathologic characteristics including age, weight loss, histologic types, and clinical stage did not show significant differences between two groups except for a higher proportion of patients with ECOG performance status 2 in concurrent group (3% vs. 27%, p=0.015). Overall toxicity was generally acceptable with 1 treatment-related death from tracheoesophageal fistula in induction group. The response rates after concurrent CRT were 41% for induction group and 54% for concurrent group, which showed no significant difference (p=0.560). With median follow-up of 13 (1-92) months, there was a trend toward an advantage for concurrent group in median progression-free survival (6 months vs 8.3 months, p=0.067) and overall survival (12 months vs. 14.5 months, p=0.059). In multivariate analysis, only more than 10% weight loss within 6 months was significantly associated with poor survival (p=0.001). In conclusion, the addition of induction chemotherapy to concurrent CRT did not show any advantage over concurrent CRT alone in locally advanced NSCLC.",Excluded

4909,"Does reducing radiation levels for procedures affect image quality and radiation to proceduralists? A double-blinded randomised study of two protocols AIM: To evaluate the ultra-lose dose imaging protocol (ULDP), compared to the standard low-dose imaging protocol (LDP), which are used for haemodialysis access, in terms of radiation exposure and image quality. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a single-centre, institutional review board-approved, prospective, double-blinded randomised controlled study to compare radiation exposure and image quality of the ULDP and LDP. Ten proceduralists, two radiographers, and 11 nurses were enrolled. Radiation exposure during 80 procedures (40 angioplasties and 40 thrombolysis) was recorded (direct radiation to patients from protocol report and scattered radiation to participants from the RaySafe i2 real-time dosimetry system). Baseline characteristics of procedure were recorded. Image quality was assessed subjectively using questionnaires based on the five-point Likert scale after each procedure. RESULT(S): Compared with LDP, the use of ULDP was associated with a significantly lower rate of radiation exposure to proceduralists, patients, and scrub nurses (0.506+/-0.430 versus 0.847+/-0.965 muSv/s, p=0.044; 0.571+/-1.284 versus 1.284+/-1.007 mGy/s, p<0.001; and 0.052+/-0.071 versus 0.141+/-0.185 muSv/s, p=0.005, respectively). No significant difference in image quality or duration of procedure was observed (all p values >0.05). CONCLUSION(S): Compared with LDP, the use of ULDP was associated with a significantly lower rate of radiation exposure to proceduralists, patients, and scrub nurses without compromising the image quality or duration of procedure.Copyright Â© 2020 The Royal College of Radiologists",Excluded
4154,Postoperative X-ray chest after supracostal puncture: Mandatory after every case of percutaneous nephrolithotomy? Introduction and Objective: It is a routine practice to get postoperative X-ray done after supracostal access in PCNL. Although the incidence of hydro-pneumothorax is very less and routine X-ray chest unnecessarily increase the radiation exposure to patients. The aim of our study was to assess the role of postoperative X-ray chest after supra costal puncture in PCNL for the detection and management of pneumothorax and/or hydrothorax. Material(s) and Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed 347 patients who underwent PCNL at our institute between Jan. 2007 and February 2011. 66.6% were male and 33.4% were female. Out of 347 PCNL supracostal upper calyceal puncture was done in 102 patients: 54 on right side and 48 on left side. In 23 patients three punctures were made and 31 patients required two tracts for complete stone clearance. Result(s): All punctures were done between 11-12th intercostal space and all patients underwent a post operative X-ray chest. In 1 patient hydro pneumothorax was detected which improved after intercostal chest tube drainage. One patient had mild pleural effusion which was managed conservatively. Both these patients had complaint of respiratory difficulty in postoperative period. In rest of the patients chest X-rays were normal and had no respiratory discomfort in post operative period. Conclusion(s): Routine post operative X-ray chest is not mandatory after every PCNL with supracostal access. When intra-operative pneumothorax is suspected or patient complain of respiratory difficulty in postoperative period then X-ray chest should be done.,Excluded

Method(s): Patients with epidermal growth factor receptor-expressing locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck received cetuximab (400 mg/m2 initial dose then 250 mg/m2 weekly) for 7 weeks plus concomitant boost radiotherapy (weeks 2-7: once daily [1.8 Gy] for 3.6 weeks, then twice daily [1.8 Gy morning and 1.5 Gy afternoon] for 2.4 weeks). The primary endpoint was treatment completion rate (the rate of treated patients completing >=70% of the planned cetuximab dose and the full dose of radiotherapy within 2 weeks over the planned schedule). Result(s): Twenty-two patients were evaluable. The treatment completion rate was 100% (95% confidence interval 85-100). The response rate 8 weeks post-radiotherapy was 82% (95% confidence interval 60-95). The most common grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events were mucosal inflammation (73%); dermatitis (27%); and infection, radiation skin injury and stomatitis (23% each). Conclusion(s): Cetuximab plus concomitant boost radiotherapy can be safely administered to Japanese patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

3877,"Developmental switch from LTD to LTP in low frequency-induced plasticity The stimulation of the Schaffer collateral/commissural fibers at low frequency (1 Hz) for 3-5 min can trigger a slow-onset form of low-frequency stimulation (LFS)-long-term potentiation (LTP) (LFS-LTP) in the CA1 area of the adult rat hippocampus. Here we have examined the developmental profile of this plasticity. In 9-15 day-old rats, the application of 1 Hz for 5 min induced long-term depression (LFS-LTD). In 17-21 day-old rats, 1 Hz stimulation had no effect when applied for 5 min but mediated LTD when stimulus duration was increased to 15 min. Over 25 day-old, 1 Hz stimulation mediated LFS-LTP. LFS-LTD was dependent on both N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and mGlu5 receptor activation. Antagonists of mGlu1alpha and cannabinoid type 1 receptor were ineffective to block LTD induction. LFS-LTD was not associated with a change in paired-pulse facilitation ratio, suggesting a postsynaptic locus of expression of this plasticity. Next, we examined whether LFS-LTD was related to 'chemical' LTDs obtained by the direct stimulation of mGlu5 and NMDA receptors. The saturation of LFS-LTD completely occluded NMDA- and (RS)-2-Chloro-5-hydroxyphenylglycine (CHPG)-induced LTD. CHPG-LTD and NMDA-LTD occluded each other. In addition, we observed that NMDA-LTD was dependent on mGlu5 receptor activation in 9-12 day old rats while it was not in animals older than 15 day-old. Therefore we postulate that during LFS application, NMDA and mGlu5 receptor could interact to trigger LTD. Low-frequency-mediated synaptic plasticity is subject to a developmental switch from NMDA- and mGlu5 receptor-dependent LTD to mGlu5 receptor-dependent LTP with a transient period (17-21 day-old) during which LFS is ineffective.",Excluded
4003,"Coronary artery calcium scoring: influence of reconstruction interval and reconstruction increment using 64-MDCT OBJECTIVE: Assessment of coronary artery calcification is increasingly used for cardiovascular risk stratification. However, a scanning protocol for modern MDCT has not been established. In this study, we evaluated the impact of the reconstruction interval within diastole and the reconstruction increment on the coronary calcium score., MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 40 consecutive patients Agatston scores and volumetric scores were assessed using a 64-MDCT scanner. The patients were assigned to two groups at random with 20 patients each: in group A, collimation was 64 x 0.6 mm; in group B, it was 20 x 1.2 mm. All CT examinations were performed with retrospective ECG gating. For each patient, five data sets were created throughout diastole (50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, and 70% of the R-R interval). For each reconstruction, two data sets were calculated with a reconstruction increment of 3.0 and 1.5 mm, respectively. For all reconstructions, the mean Agatston scores and volumetric scores +/- SD and the coefficient of variance were assessed. Furthermore, for each reconstruction, patients were assigned a percentile rank that described the level of cardiovascular risk., RESULTS: Four patients had to be excluded from the study because no coronary calcium was detected on any of the reconstructions. In both groups, the mean Agatston score was not significantly different between reconstruction increment 3.0 mm and reconstruction increment 1.5 mm (group A, 112.1 +/- 92.5 and 114.3 +/- 93.6, p = 0.28; group B, 164.8 +/- 203.0 and 169.4 +/- 207.9, p = 0.29, respectively). However, in two cases, very small calcified lesions in the circumflex coronary artery were only detected using a reconstruction increment of 1.5 mm. In both groups, the mean coefficient of variation was not significantly different at reconstruction increment 1.5 mm (group A, 11.4 +/- 8.2; group B, 12.5 +/- 7.6) and reconstruction increment 3.0 mm (group A, 14.8 +/- 9.3; group B, 14.2 +/- 9.1; group A, p = 0.18; group B, p = 0.48). Based on the reconstruction increment and reconstruction interval, 77% of the patients (n = 14) in group A were assigned to one risk group and 23% (n = 4) to two different risk groups according to percentile strata. In group B, 83% of the patients (n = 15) were assigned to one risk group and 17% (n = 3) to two different risk groups. In contrast to the Agatston score, the volumetric score was significantly higher in both groups at reconstruction increment 1.5 mm (group A, 105.4 +/- 78.5 mm3; group B, 153.8 +/- 182.5 mm3) compared with reconstruction increment 3.0 mm (group A, 90.0 +/- 73.11 mm3; group B, 138.2 +/- 166.8 mm3; p < 0.05)., CONCLUSION: Using a 64-MDCT scanner, the calcium score calculated from different reconstructions within early diastole is variable, but the difference can be minimized using overlapping slice reconstructions. The variation does not lead to a different risk estimation in most patients. In patients with mild coronary calcifications, the use of overlapping slices may help to detect small calcified plaques. Furthermore, we recommend the use of ECG-controlled tube current modulation to reduce the radiation exposure.",Excluded
4851,"Simultaneous integrated boost intensity-modulated radiotherapy in esophageal carcinoma: early results of a phase II study PURPOSE: The safety and efficacy of using simultaneous integrated boost intensity-modulated radiotherapy (SIB-IMRT) for patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma were evaluated in a single-institution phase II setting., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between June 2007 and October 2009, 45 patients underwent concurrent chemoradiotherapy (n = 27) or radiotherapy alone (n = 18). Two planning target volumes (PTV) were defined for the SIB: PTVC and PTVG, with prescribed doses of 50.4 Gy to the PTVC (1.8 Gy/fraction) and 63 Gy to the PTVG (2.25 Gy/fraction), both given in 28 fractions., RESULTS: At a median follow-up interval of 20.3 months, the 3-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 42.2 and 40.7 %, respectively. The median overall survival time was 21 months; locoregional control rates were 83.3 % at 1 year and 67.5 % at 3 years. According to CTCAE (version 3.0) criteria, none of the patients developed grade 4-5 toxicity. The most common grade 2 and 3 radiation-related toxicity was radiation esophagitis, occurring in 64 % of all patients (but only 13 % as grade 3). No patient developed grade > 2 pulmonary complications., CONCLUSION: SIB-IMRT is a feasible therapeutic approach for esophageal carcinoma patients and provides encouraging locoregional control with a low toxicity profile. Further investigations should focus on dose escalation and optimization of the combination with systemic therapies.",Excluded

Those simulation procedures account for more than 80 % of all simulation procedures performed nationwide. Then, total DLP and CTDIvol was calculated and mean, median and 3rd quartile for both units together were presented to determine national DRLs for simulation procedures. The same data was later compared between both units to discover any potential need for optimization., RESULTS: 3rd quartile values of DLP for abdomen, breast, chest, head, head and neck, pelvis and spine were 1116.2, 606.6, 832.4, 1942.4, 969.2, 677.1 and 1042.4 mGy.cm, respectively. 3rd quartile CTDIvol values for the same sequence of procedures were 18.7, 13.3, 19.2, 76.9, 22.6, 17.9 and 22.2mGy, respectively. Among the two units, the mentioned dose values were on average significantly higher on one CT unit than on the other unit., CONCLUSIONS: When comparing collected dose values with other studies, RT CT DRLs showed that radiation doses from our institution were similar or even lower. Some variations were found between both CT units in certain protocols, so exposure parameters should be reviewed and optimized. Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded
4690,"Gamma Knife surgery for parasellar meningiomas: long-term results including complications, predictive factors, and progression-free survival OBJECT: Stereotactic radiosurgery serves as an important primary and adjuvant treatment option for patients with many types of intracranial meningiomas. This is particularly true for patients with parasellar meningiomas. In this study, the authors evaluated the outcomes of Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) used to treat parasellar meningiomas., METHODS: The study is a retrospective review of the outcomes in 138 patients with meningiomas treated at the University of Virginia from 1989 to 2006; all patients had a minimum follow-up of 24 months. There were 31 men and 107 women whose mean age was 54 years (range 19-85 years). Eighty-four patients had previously undergone resection. The mean pre-GKS tumor volume was 7.5 ml (range 0.2-54.8 ml). Clinical and radiographic evaluations were performed, and factors related to favorable outcomes in each case were assessed., RESULTS: The mean follow-up duration was 84 months (median 75.5 months, range 24-216 months). In 118 patients (86%), the tumor volume was unchanged or had decreased at last follow-up. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated radiographic progression-free survival at 5 and 10 years to be 95.4% and 69%, respectively. Fourteen patients (10%) developed new cranial nerve palsies following GKS. Factors associated with tumor control included younger age, a higher isodose, and smaller tumor volume. A longer follow-up duration was associated with either a decrease or increase in tumor volume. Fourteen patients (10%) experienced new or worsening cranial nerve deficits after treatment. Factors associated with this occurrence were larger pretreatment tumor volume, lower peripheral radiation dose, lower maximum dose, tumor progression, and longer follow-up., CONCLUSIONS: Gamma Knife surgery offers an acceptable rate of tumor control for parasellar meningiomas and accomplishes this with a low incidence of neurological deficits. Radiological control after radiosurgery is more likely in those patients with a smaller tumor volume and a higher prescription dose.",Excluded

A hand-held gamma-detecting probe was used during operation to determine whether gross tumor accumulated the radiolabeled analog and occult tumor could be detected. Positive uptake was defined as tumor/background ratios exceeding 2:1., RESULTS: The tumor in all seven patients with gross disease accumulated 125I-TYR(3)-octreotide. Occult tumor beyond that appreciated with preoperative imaging or by routine operative exploration was detected in a patient with carcinoid tumor. In the patient with the occult gastrinoma the probe detected the lesion within the duodenal bulb before duodenotomy and also predicted what proved histologically to be positive peripancreatic adenopathy. There was a single false-positive reading from the stomach in a patient with suspected carcinoid tumor in whom no tumor could be found grossly or histologically. A pancreatic mass that probed negative proved to be an adenocarcinoma of ductal origin., CONCLUSIONS: Tumor-specific peptide-receptor binding can be detected in situ with 125J-TYR(3)-octreotide and a hand-held gamma-detecting probe.

4043,"Radiation Dose-Dependent Hippocampal Atrophy Detected With Longitudinal Volumetric Magnetic Resonance Imaging PURPOSE: After radiation therapy (RT) to the brain, patients often experience memory impairment, which may be partially mediated by damage to the hippocampus. Hippocampal sparing in RT planning is the subject of recent and ongoing clinical trials. Calculating appropriate hippocampal dose constraints would be improved by efficient in vivo measurements of hippocampal damage. In this study we sought to determine whether brain RT was associated with dose-dependent hippocampal atrophy., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Hippocampal volume was measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 52 patients who underwent fractionated, partial brain RT for primary brain tumors. Study patients had high-resolution, 3-dimensional volumetric MRI before and 1 year after RT. Images were processed using software with clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration and Conformite Europeene marking for automated measurement of hippocampal volume. Automated results were inspected visually for accuracy. Tumor and surgical changes were censored. Mean hippocampal dose was tested for correlation with hippocampal atrophy 1 year after RT. Average hippocampal volume change was also calculated for hippocampi receiving high (>40 Gy) or low (<10 Gy) mean RT dose. A multivariate analysis was conducted with linear mixed-effects modeling to evaluate other potential predictors of hippocampal volume change, including patient (random effect), age, hemisphere, sex, seizure history, and baseline volume. Statistical significance was evaluated at alpha = 0.05., RESULTS: Mean hippocampal dose was significantly correlated with hippocampal volume loss (r=-0.24, P=.03). Mean hippocampal volume was significantly reduced 1 year after high-dose RT (mean -6%, P=.009) but not after low-dose RT. In multivariate analysis, both RT dose and patient age were significant predictors of hippocampal atrophy (P<.01)., CONCLUSIONS: The hippocampus demonstrates radiation dose-dependent atrophy after treatment for brain tumors. Quantitative MRI is a noninvasive imaging technique capable of measuring radiation effects on intracranial structures. This technique could be investigated as a potential biomarker for development of reliable dose constraints for improved cognitive outcomes. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

4594,"Functional dosimetric metrics for predicting radiation-induced lung injury in non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with chemoradiotherapy Background: Radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) is an important dose-limiting toxicity during thoracic radiotherapy. The purpose of this study is to investigate single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) perfusion-weighted functional dose-volume histogram (FDVH) for predicting RILI in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy. Method(s): Fifty-seven locally advanced NSCLC patients receiving chemoradiotherapy were enrolled prospectively. Patients had treatment scans and dose calculations to provide a standard dose-volume histogram (DVH). Fusion of SPECT and computed tomography scans provided perfusion-weighted FDVH and associated functional dosimetric parameters (relative volumes of functional lung receiving more than a threshold dose of 5 - 60 Gy at increments of 5 Gy [FV5 - FV60]). The predictive abilities of FDVH and DVH were calculated and compared based on the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Result(s): The accumulative incidence of >= 2 grade RILI was 19.3% with a median follow-up of 12 months. Univariate analysis showed that the functional (FV5 - FV60) and standard (V5 - V40) parameters were associated with RILI (all value of p < 0.05). Close correlations between a variety of functional and standard parameters were found. By ROC curve analysis, functional metrics (AUCs were 0.784 - 0.869) provided similarly (p value 0.233 - 1.000) predictive outcome to standard metrics (AUCs were 0.695 - 0.902) in lower - median dose level parameters (FV5 - FV40). However, FDVH seemed to add some predictive value in higher dose level, the best statistical significance for comparing FV60 with V60 was 0.693 vs. 0.511 (p = 0.055). Conclusion(s): Functional metrics are identified as reliable predictors for RILI, however, this observation still needs to be further verified using a larger sample size.

Patients were divided into two groups: early and late phase hepatic injuries. Each group was investigated 3 to 9 weeks and 4 to 65 months after the start of irradiation, respectively. T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and T2*-weighted images were obtained before and after SPIO administration. In all postcontrast sequences in the early phase, irradiated livers demonstrated relatively higher intensity than nonirradiated livers and the radiation-to-liver contrast-to-noise ratio (C/N) was improved. Postcontrast T2*-weighted images showed the highest C/N. In the late phase, the irradiated areas showed high intensity on T2-weighted images and low intensity on T1-weighted images without SPIO, while high intensity on T1-weighted images with SPIO. The C/N increased with SPIO in all sequences and postcontrast T2-weighted images showed the highest C/N in the late phase.

4474,"Radiation protection by the Ocimum flavonoids orientin and vicenin: Mechanisms of action In previous studies, flavonoids, orientin and vicenin, that were isolated from the leaf extract of Ocimum sanctum, were found to protect mice against radiation injury. Several flavonoids are known to be good antioxidants. Therefore, the effect of orientin and vicenin on radiation-induced lipid peroxidation in vivo and their antioxidant activity in vitro were studied. Adult mice were injected intraperitoneally with 50 mug/kg of orientin or vicenin and exposed whole-body to 3 Gy of gamma radiation. Lipid peroxidation was measured in the liver 15 min to 8 h postirradiation. The antioxidant activity of orientin/vicenin (10-500 muM) was studied by measuring inhibition of hydroxyl radicals generated by the Fenton reaction (Fe3+-EDTA-ascorbic acid-H2O2) in vitro. The compounds were also tested for possible pro-oxidant and iron chelation activities at the above concentrations in the in vitro system. Orientin and vicenin provided almost equal protection against radiation-induced lipid peroxidation in mouse liver. Both compounds showed a significantly greater free radical-inhibiting activity in vitro than DMSO. Neither orientin nor vicenin showed any pro-oxidant activity at the concentrations tested. Both compounds inhibited free radical formation in the absence of EDTA. Free radical scavenging appears to be a likely mechanism of radiation protection by these flavonoids.

4636,"A combination therapy of ethanol injection and radiofrequency ablation under general anesthesia for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma Aim: To summarize the effects of laparoscopic ethanol injection and radiofrequency ablation (L-EI-RFA), thoracoscopic (T-EI-RFA) and open-surgery assisted EI-RFA (O-EI-RFA) under general anesthesia for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Method(s): Time-lag performance of RFA after ethanol injection (Time-lag PEI-RFA) was performed in all cases. The volume of coagulated necrosis and the applied energy for total and per unit volume coagulated necrosis were examined in the groups treated under general (group G) or local anesthesia (group L). Result(s): The results showed that the total applied energy and the applied energy per unit volume of whole and marginal, coagulated necrosis were significantly larger in group G than those in the group L, resulting in a larger volume of coagulated necrosis in the group G. The rate of local tumor recurrence within one year was extremely low in group G. Conclusion(s): These results suggest that EI-RFA, under general anesthesia, may be effective for the treatment of HCC because a larger quantity of ethanol and energy could be applied during treatment under pain-free condition for the patients.

Median age at RT was 76 years (range 30-92), including 27 patients (41%) aged >= 80 years. Median RT dose was 58.05 Gy (range 37.5-67.5), all delivered in 15 daily fractions. Thirty-two patients received proton RT and 34 patients received photon RT., RESULTS: Median follow-up times from diagnosis and RT start were 21 months and 14 months, respectively. In total, five patients (7.6%) developed local failure. The 2-year outcomes were 84% local control (LC) and 58% OS. Among the 51 patients treated with definitive intent, the 2-year LC rate was 93% and the OS rate was 62%. On multivariate analysis for LC, older age was associated with a lower risk of local failure [hazard ratio (HR) 0.91; p = 0.02], while prior surgery (HR 16.5; p = 0.04) and macrovascular invasion (HR 123.93; p = 0.02) were independently associated with an increased risk of local failure. On multivariate analysis for OS, female sex (HR 0.33; p = 0.001) and prior chemotherapy (HR 0.38; p = 0.003) remained significantly associated with OS. On multivariate analysis for OS, compared with photon RT, there was a trend towards improved survival with proton RT (HR 0.50; p = 0.05). The rate of overall grade 3 + toxicity was 11%.

All the patients were treated with local electronic beam irradiation with a total median dosage of 48.55+/-9.51 (40-74) Gy in an average of 24.55+/-5.57 (20-40) fractions, 5 fractions per week. Results The median follow-up time was 55.27+/-29.3 (13-103) months. No severe acute or chronic side effects of irradiation were observed. Complete clinical response (CR) rate of the radiated sites was 54.5% (6/11), partial response (PR) rate was 36.4% (4/11), and the overall response rate (CR+PR) was 90.9%. One patient showed no response. Conclusion Local radiotherapy with psolaren plus ultraviolet A and/or interferon maintaining treatment is an effective palliative therapy in the treatment of tumor-stage MF patients.

4226,"Anthropometric factors and cutaneous melanoma: Prospective data from the population-based Janus Cohort The aim of the present study was to prospectively examine risk of cutaneous melanoma (CM) according to measured anthropometric factors, adjusted for exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR), in a large population-based cohort in Norway. The Janus Cohort, including 292,851 Norwegians recruited 1972-2003, was linked to the Cancer Registry of Norway and followed for CM through 2014. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of CM with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Restricted cubic splines were incorporated into the Cox models to assess possible non-linear relationships. All analyses were adjusted for attained age, indicators of UVR exposure, education, and smoking status. During a mean follow-up of 27 years, 3,000 incident CM cases were identified. In men, CM risk was positively associated with body mass index, body surface area (BSA), height and weight (all ptrends < 0.001), and the exposure-response curves indicated an exponential increase in risk for all anthropometric factors. Weight loss of more than 2 kg in men was associated with a 53% lower risk (HR 0.47, 95% CI: 0.39, 0.57). In women, CM risk increased with increasing BSA (ptrend = 0.002) and height (ptrend < 0.001). The shape of the height-CM risk curve indicated an exponential increase. Our study suggests that large body size, in general, is a CM risk factor in men, and is the first to report that weight loss may reduce the risk of CM among men.Copyright Â© 2017 UICC",Excluded
4918,"Cutaneous viral infections associated with ultraviolet radiation exposure The complex interplay between ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and cutaneous viral infections in the context of cancer etiology is challenging to unravel, given the limited information on the independent association between UVR and cutaneous viral infections. Using multiple biomarkers of infection with 24 types of cutaneous human papillomavirus (HPV) and 4 types of polyomaviruses (HPyV), we investigated cross-sectional associations with recent UVR exposure, using skin pigmentation measured by spectrophotometer. Age- and sex-adjusted associations between UVR and viral seropositivity, viral DNA present in eyebrow hairs (EBH) and skin swabs (SSW) were estimated using logistic regression. Beta-HPV seropositivity was associated with viral DNA positivity in EBH (OR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.05-1.88) and SSW (OR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.25-2.74). Similar associations were observed for Merkel cell polyomavirus. Participants in the highest tertile of UVR exposure were more likely to be seropositive for beta-HPV (OR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.16-2.38), and have beta-HPV DNA in EBH (OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.06-2.33) and SSW (OR = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.25-3.96), compared to participants with the lowest tertile of UVR exposure. UVR exposure was positively associated with three different markers of beta-HPV infection. Therefore, future studies of HPV associated KC development should address more directly the role of HPV and UVR exposure as potential co-carcinogens.Copyright Â© 2020 The Authors.

4699,"Radiation Exposure to solar and ionizing radiation increases the risk for cancer in humans. Some 5% of solar radiation is within the ultraviolet spectrum and may cause both malignant melanoma and non-melanocytic skin cancer; the latter is regarded as a benign disease and is accordingly not included in our estimation of avoidable cancers. Under the assumption that the rate of occurrence of malignant melanoma of the buttocks of both men and women and of the scalp of women would apply to all parts of the body in people completely unexposed to solar radiation, it was estimated that approximately 95% of all malignant melanomas arising in the Nordic populations around the year 2000 will be due to exposure to natural ultraviolet radiation, equivalent to an annual number of about 4700 cases, with 2100 in men and 2600 in women, or some 4% of all cancers notified. Exposure to ionizing radiation in the Nordic countries occurs at an average effective dose per capita per year of about 3 mSv (Iceland, 1.1 mSv) from natural sources, and about 1 mSv from man-made sources. While the natural sources are primarily radon in indoor air, natural radionuclides in food, cosmic radiation and gamma radiation from soil and building materials, the man-made sources are dominated by the diagnostic and therapeutic use of ionizing radiation. On the basis of measured levels of radon in Nordic dwellings and associated risk estimates for lung cancer derived from well-conducted epidemiological studies, we estimated that about 180 cases of lung cancer (1% of all lung cancer cases) per year could be avoided in the Nordic countries around the year 2000 if indoor exposure to radon were eliminated, and that an additional 720 cases (6%) could be avoided annually if either radon or tobacco smoking were eliminated. Similarly, it was estimated that the exposure of the Nordic populations to natural sources of ionizing radiation other than radon and to medical sources will each give rise to an annual total of 2120 cancers at various sites. For all types of ionizing radiation, the annual total will be 4420 cancer cases, or 3.9% of all cancers arising in the Nordic populations, with 3.4% in men and 4.4% in women.",Excluded
4519,"Early clinical outcomes for 3 radiation techniques for brain metastases: Focal versus whole-brain Purpose: To present our novel technique for brain metastases (low-dose whole brain radiation therapy [WBRT] with simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) and focal, frameless stereotactic intensity modulated radiotherapy [IMRT]) in the context of patterns of failure, dosimetry, acute toxicity, and overall survival for 3 different radiation techniques. Methods and Materials: We retrospectively reviewed 92 patients undergoing radiation for brain metastases via the following: (1) ""prophylactic"" WBRT to a low dose (median 30 Gy) with an SIB to the gross tumor volume plus 2-3 mm margin (median dose 45 Gy) in 10-15 fractions; (2) focal, frameless image-guided stereotactic IMRT (S-IMRT) in 5 fractions to tumor only (median 30 Gy); or (3) conventional (c)WBRT using 2 lateral opposed beams in 10-15 fractions (30-37.5 Gy). The primary endpoints were local (LBC), distant (DBC), and total brain control (TBC) for each of the 3 types of brain radiation. Survival, toxicity, and dosimetry were reported as secondary endpoints. Result(s): LBC was achieved in 72%, 78%, and 56% for SIB, S-IMRT, and cWBRT, respectively. DBC (ie, no new brain metastases) was observed in 92%, 67%, and 81% for SIB, S-IMRT, and cWBRT, respectively. TBC (LBC + DBC) was 72%, 67%, and 56% for SIB, S-IMRT, and cWBRT, respectively. No statistical difference in overall survival was observed (P = .067), and only 1 patient experienced biopsy proven radionecrosis. Conclusion(s): TBC after low-dose WBRT with SIB was acceptable and at least comparable to S-IMRT and cWBRT. SIB seems to be a safe and effective treatment strategy for patients with brain metastases and may efficiently combine the benefits of cWBRT and stereotactic radiosurgery.

4687,"Individually adapted examination protocols for reduction of radiation exposure in chest CT RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To develop a simple directive for the reduction of radiation exposure without loss of diagnostic information in routine chest CT examinations., METHODS: Two hundred fifty adult patients (164 male, 86 female) were entered into a prospective trial. All examinations were performed with a multislice CT technique (Somatom Volume Zoom, Siemens). Four groups of 50 patients each were scanned with patient-related specific parameters: individual mA-s values were derived from the estimated body weight: kilograms + 10, +/- 0, - 10, and - 20 mAs. The results were compared with those of 50 patients who were examined by a standard chest protocol by using the parameters 120 mAs and 140 kV. All other parameters including the tube voltage were kept constant. Subjective image quality was rated on a three-point scale: 1 = excellent, 2 = fair, 3 = nondiagnostic. In addition, objective criteria based on signal-to-noise measurements were assessed by using a region-of-interest methodology., RESULTS: Image quality was sufficient in all cases. Mean subjective gradings of image quality, based on soft-tissue window settings, were 1.1 for the 120-mAs protocol, 1.1 for the (body weight [kg] + 10) mAs protocol, 1.1 for the (body weight [kg] +/- 0) mAs protocol, 1.3 for the (body weight [kg] - 10) mAs protocol, and 1.2 for the (body weight [kg] - 20) mAs protocol. Objective criteria based on noise measurements showed mean +/- standard deviation values of 5.7 +/- 0.8 Hounsfield units (HU) for the 120-mAs protocol. For the reduced-dose protocols, values were calculated as 7.6 +/- 1.2 HU (group + 10), 7.9 +/- 1.3 HU (group +/- 0), 8.7 +/- 1.2 HU (group - 10), and finally 9.1 +/- 1.3 HU (group - 20). The best correlation for an entire subgroup was achieved with the - 10 protocol (body weight [kg] - 10) mAs, with nearly constant noise related to body weight in all patients., CONCLUSIONS: By deriving mAs values from body weight estimation, an individually adapted protocol for chest CT can be recommended and easily employed in a clinical setting. With an adaptation of the tube current-time product based on the estimated body weight of the patient - 10 (body weight [kg] - 10 mAs), a well-balanced examination without significant loss of information, even in soft-tissue window settings, can be performed with this particular scanner. For this adapted mAs protocol, a mean reduction of radiation exposure of 45% was achievable, compared with the standard protocol. A maximum decrease per case down to 31 mAs was obtained, without relevant loss of image quality. Therefore, for other types of CT scanners, analogous protocols may be adapted.",Excluded
4740,"DART-bid for loco-regionally advanced NSCLC : Summary of acute and late toxicity with long-term follow-up; experiences with pulmonary dose constraints BACKGROUND: To report acute and late toxicity with long-term follow-up, and to describe our experiences with pulmonary dose constraints., METHODS: Between 2002 and 2009, 150 patients with 155 histologically/cytologically proven non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; tumor stages II, IIIA, IIIB in 6, 55 and 39%, respectively) received the following median doses: primary tumors 79.2 Gy (range 72.0-90.0 Gy), lymph node metastases 59.4 Gy (54.0-73.8 Gy), nodes electively 45 Gy; with fractional doses of 1.8 Gy twice daily (bid). In all, 86% of patients received 2 cycles of chemotherapy previously., RESULTS: Five treatment-related deaths occurred: pneumonitis, n = 1; progressive pulmonary fibrosis in patients with pre-existing pulmonary fibrosis, n = 2; haemorrhage, n = 2. In all, 8% of patients experienced grade 3 and 1.3% grade 4 pneumonitis; 11% showed late fibrotic alterations grade 2 in lung parenchyma. Clinically relevant acute esophagitis (grade 2 and 3) was seen in 33.3% of patients, 2 patients developed late esophageal stenosis (G3). Patients with upper lobe, middle lobe and central lower lobe tumours (n = 130) were treated with V20 (total lung) up to 50% and patients with peripheral lower lobe tumours (n = 14, basal lateral tumours excluded) up to 42%, without observing acute or late pulmonary toxicity >grade 3. Only patients with basal lateral lower lobe tumours (n = 5) experienced grade 4/5 pulmonary toxicity; V20 for this latter group ranged between 30 and 53%. The mean lung dose was below the QUANTEC recommendation of 20-23 Gy in all patients. The median follow-up time of all patients is 26.3 months (range 2.9-149.4) and of patients alive 80.2 months (range 63.9-149.4.). The median overall survival time of all patients is 26.3 months; the 2-, 5- and 8-year survival rates of 54, 21 and 15%, respectively. The local tumour control rate at 2 and 5 years is 70 and 64%, the regional control rate 90 and 88%, respectively., DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Grade 4 or 5 toxicity occurred in 7/150 patients (4.7%), which can be partially avoided in the future (e.g. by excluding patients with pre-existing pulmonary fibrosis). Tolerance and oncologic outcome compare favourably to concomitant chemoradiation also in long-term follow-up.",Excluded
4164,"Knowledge and risk perception among nuclear power plant employees This is a study of knowledge, risk perception, and attitudes among nuclear power plant employees. A total of 236 persons participated, belonging to 10 different professional groups and working at two Swedish power plants. Job-related radiation risks were judged about average as compared to a number of other risks. On the whole, the participants in the study were satisfied with the measures of safety at work, but there were some exceptions to this rule, especially among those hired for temporary jobs through external contractors. The experience of job-related radiation risks was related to the level of knowledge about radiation and its risks: those who knew less experienced larger risks. General level of anxiety did not correlate with risk perception. The latter was accounted for mainly by perceived radiation risks. Job satisfaction was more strongly related to perceived conventional job risks than to nuclear risks. Risk ratings were related to how subjects defined the concept of risk. Those who stressed consequences as part of their risk definition gave higher risk ratings.",Excluded
4424,"Extreme solar event of AD775: Potential radiation exposure to crews in deep space The existence of a historically large cosmic event in AD774 or 775, of probable solar origin, has recently been confirmed from records of 14C levels in tree rings located at widely separated locations on Earth, 10Be records in polar ice cores, and historical records of aurora sightings. Usoskin et al (Astronomy & Astrophysics, 2013) suggest that such an event, of solar origin, would have a proton fluence of 4.5 1010 cm-2 at energies above 30 MeV, with a hard energy spectrum comparable to the event of 23 February 1956. In this work we investigate the possible radiation exposures to crews of missions on the surface of Mars, from such an event. In this work we use the HZETRN radiation transport code, originally developed at NASA Langley Research Center, and the Computerized Anatomical Male and Female human geometry models to estimate exposures for a variety of aluminum shield areal densities similar to those provided by a spacesuit, surface lander, and permanent habitat on the Martian surface. Comparisons of the predicted organ exposures with recently-recommended radiation exposure limits are made. Potential health effects on crews, of such an event, are also discussed.",Excluded
