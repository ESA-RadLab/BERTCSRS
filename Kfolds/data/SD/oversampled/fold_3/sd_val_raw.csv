3753,"Reirradiation for locoregionally recurrent lung cancer: Outcomes in small cell and non-small cell lung carcinoma Objectives: To our knowledge this is the largest report analyzing outcomes for reirradiation (reRT) for locoregionally recurrent lung cancer, and the first to assess thoracic reRT outcomes in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Method(s): Forty-eight patients (11 SCLC, 37 non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC]) receiving reRT to the thorax were identified; 44 (92%) received reRT by intensity-modulated radiotherapy. Palliative responses, survival outcomes, and prognostic factors were analyzed. Result(s): NSCLC patients received a median of 30 Gy in a median of 10 fractions, whereas SCLC patients received a median of 37.5 Gy in a median of 15 fractions. Median survival for the entire cohort from reRT was 4.2 months. Median survival for NSCLC patients was 5.1 months, versus 3.1 months for the SCLC patients (P=0.15). In NSCLC patients, multivariate analysis demonstrated that Karnofsky performance status>=80 and higher radiation dose were associated with improved survival following reRT, and 75% of patients with symptoms experienced palliative benefit. In SCLC, 4 patients treated with the intent of life prolongation for radiographic recurrence had a median survival of 11.7 months. However, acute toxicities and new disease symptoms limited the duration of palliative benefit in the 7 symptomatic SCLC patients to 0.5 months. Conclusion(s): ReRT to the thorax for locoregionally recurrent NSCLC can provide palliative benefit, and a small subset of patients may experience long-term survival. Select SCLC patients may experience meaningful survival prolongation after reRT, but reRT for patients with symptomatic recurrence and/or extrathoracic disease did not offer meaningful survival or durable symptom benefit.

4875,"Multi-detector CT of the chest: influence of dose onto quantitative evaluation of severe emphysema: a simulation study PURPOSE: Quantitative evaluation of the lung parenchyma might be impaired or unreliable by use of reduced-dose CT protocols. Aim of the study was to define the threshold where reduced dose has significant impact on quantitative emphysema parameters., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients with severe centrilobular emphysema underwent multidetector computed tomography (120 kV, 150 mAs). Original CT raw data were simulated using 10 mAs settings (10-100 SIMmAs). Quantitative analysis provided lung volume, emphysema volume, emphysema index, mean lung density, and 4 emphysema volume classes. Simulated low-dose results were compared with original acquisition., RESULTS: Emphysema index showed no clinical relevant variation down to 30 SIMmAs. The large emphysema volume class was significantly different below 50 SIMmAs. The intermediate and small classes showed an overproportional variation below 50 SIMmAs., CONCLUSIONS: Dose reduction down to 30 SIMmAs is possible for clinical routine. Settings below 50 SIMmAs significantly alter the in-detailed 3-dimensional emphysema quantification.",Excluded
4612,"Misdiagnosed male breast cancer with an unknown primary tumor: A case report Compared with female breast cancer, male breast cancer (MBC) has an extremely low morbidity, later staging and fewer breast tissues. The lumps are easier to invade in the center and the majority of the cases are positive for metastatic lymph node, with the typical clinical manifestation as a painless mass in partial breast. MBC with an unknown primary tumor is rare and is often prone to misdiagnosis, resulting in a delay in correct treatment. Such a case is extremely significant for clinical reference. The current study presents a 58-year-old male who developed a painless mass in the left armpit and received armpit mass biopsy and pathological examination which showed glandular cancer, with a high possibility of mammary primary tumor. The patient was administered four cycles of paclitaxel plus oxaliplatin chemotherapy. However, three months later, the patient identified novel disseminated lymph nodes in the left armpit. The initial pathological section and paraffin blocks were re-examined and the patient was finally diagnosed with breast invasive ductal carcinoma based on the metastases pathology and immunohistochemical examination. No breast mass was found on physical examination of the patient and the tumor markers, including cancer antigen 125 and carcinoembryonic antigen, were normal. No primary tumors were observed in the mammography and PET-CT and the primary tumor was not found following the left breast modified radical mastectomy.",Excluded

3800,"Comparison of magnetic wire navigation with the conventional wire technique for percutaneous coronary intervention of chronic total occlusions: a randomised, controlled study Wire crossing of a chronic total coronary occlusion (CTO) is time consuming and limited by the amount of contrast agent and time of radiation exposure. Magnetic wire navigation (MWN) might accelerate wire crossing by maintaining a coaxial vessel orientation. This study compares MWN with the conventional approach for recanalization of CTOs. Forty symptomatic patients with CTO were randomised to MWN (n = 20) or conventional approach (n = 20) for antegrade crossing of the occlusion. In the intention-to-treat analysis, MWN showed a shorter crossing time (412 versus 1131 s; p = 0.001), and, consequently, lower usage of contrast agent (primary endpoint 42 versus 116 ml; p = 0.01), and lower radiation exposure (dose-area product: 29 versus 80 Gy*cm(2); p = 0.002) during wire crossing compared to the conventional approach. Accordingly, in the per-protocol analysis, the wire-crossing rate was, in trend, higher using the conventional approach (17 of 31) compared to MWN (9 of 28; p = 0.08). The use of MWN for revascularisation of CTOs is feasible and reduces crossing time, use of contrast agent, and radiation exposure. However, due to a broader selection of wires, the conventional approach enables wire crossing in cases failed by MWN and seems to be the more successful choice.",Excluded
4662,"Corazonin- and PDF-immunoreactivities in the cephalic ganglia of termites Antisera against the pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) and corazonin (Crz) reacted with distinct sets of neurons in the cephalic ganglia of termites. The locations of immunoreactive cells were similar but their numbers differed among the eight species examined: PDF-ir occurred in 0-6 cells in each optic lobe and 1-2 pairs of cells in the subosophageal ganglion (SOG), and Crz-ir in 0-2 pairs of cells in the pars intecerebralis, 3-14 cells in each lateral protocerebrum, and 0-6 pairs of cells in the SOG. Staining patterns were identical in the pseudergates, soldiers, and substitutive reproductives of Prorhinotermes simplex. Workers and soldiers were compared in the remaining 7 species. The only caste divergence was detected in Coptotermes formosanus, in which the soldiers differed from the workers by lack of 4 Crz-ir perikarya in the pars intercerebralis and occasionally also by the absence of 2 Crz-ir perikarya in the SOG. Diurnal changes in PDF-ir and Crz-ir were examined in P. simplex kept under long day (18:6 h light:darkness) or short day (10:14 h) photoperiods. No circadian fluctuations in the distribution or the intensity of immunostaining were found in the pseudergates and soldiers that were sacrificed in 4 h intervals or in the male and female substitutive reproductives examined in 6 h intervals. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

4712,"Radiation dose considerations in the palliative treatment of locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas Treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer with high-dose radiotherapy has not been curative, and can be difficult to tolerate. We decided to compare retrospectively the outcomes of patients treated concurrently with 5-fluorouracil and either 30 Gy or more than 30 Gy of radiation. From December 1993 through May 2001, 107 patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas had been treated with palliative chemoradiation. Eighty-six patients had received a prescribed dose of 30 Gy and 50.4 Gy had been prescribed in 18 patients. Two of these patients were unable to complete the full dose of radiotherapy due to toxicity, and 3 received intraoperative radiotherapy boost (20 Gy). Three additional patients received a prescribed dose of 33 Gy, 36 Gy, and 52.2 Gy, respectively. These patients were grouped together (n = 21, median 50.4 Gy). All patients had received concurrent protracted venous infusions of 5-fluorouracil (300 mg/m Monday through Friday). The median survival time was not affected significantly by a higher radiotherapy dose (8 months for the 30 Gy group versus 9 months for the group receiving higher doses; P = 0.64). The 6-month actuarial progression rates were 45% versus 50% (P = 0.90) for local disease progression, and 54% versus 50% (P = 0.94) for distant metastasis for the 30 Gy and the higher dose groups, respectively. Ten of the 86 patients (12%) who had received 30 Gy were hospitalized for treatment-related gastrointestinal toxicity (grade 3) versus 6 of the 21 (29%) patients given higher doses (P = 0.05). Compared with higher doses given over 5 to 6 weeks, chemoradiation (30 Gy in 10 fractions in 2 weeks with concurrent infusional 5-FU) results in a similar median survival, and local disease progression rates in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer apparently do not substantially improve local disease control or median survival time. Because higher doses of radiotherapy can lead to increased acute treatment-related morbidity, we recommend using 30 Gy in 10 fractions unless the patient is part of a prospective study evaluating novel biologic or cytotoxic radiosensitizers.",Excluded

3852,"Limitations of body surface area-based activity calculation for radioembolization of hepatic metastases in colorectal cancer PURPOSE: To calculate absorbed radiation doses in patients treated with resin microspheres prescribed by the body surface area (BSA) method and to analyze dose-response and toxicity relationships., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of 45 patients with colorectal carcinoma metastases who received single-session whole-liver resin microsphere radioembolization. Prescribed treatment activity was calculated using the BSA method. Liver volumes and whole-liver absorbed doses (D(WL)) were calculated. D(WL) was correlated with toxicity and radiographic and biochemical response., RESULTS: The standard BSA-based administered activity (range, 0.85-2.58 GBq) did not correlate with D(WL) (mean, 50.4 Gy; range, 29.8-74.7 Gy; r = -0.037; P = .809) because liver weight was highly variable (mean, 1.89 kg; range, 0.94-3.42 kg) and strongly correlated with D(WL) (r = -0.724; P < .001) but was not accounted for in the BSA method. Patients with larger livers were relatively underdosed, and patients with smaller livers were relatively overdosed. Patients who received D(WL) > 50 Gy experienced more toxicity and adverse events (> grade 2 liver toxicity, 46% vs 17%; P < .05) but also responded better to the treatment than patients who received D(WL)< 50 Gy (disease control, 88% vs 24%; P < .01)., CONCLUSIONS: Using the standard BSA formula, the administered activity did not correlate with D(WL). Based on this short-term follow-up after salvage therapy in patients with late stage metastatic colorectal carcinoma, dose-response and dose-toxicity relationships support using a protocol based on liver volume rather than BSA to prescribe the administered activity.

4048,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma gene polymorphism in psoriasis and its relation to obesity, metabolic syndrome, and narrowband ultraviolet B response: A case-control study in Egyptian patients Background: Psoriasis is a common dermatologic disease with multifactorial etiology in which genetic factors play a major role. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma is expressed in keratinocytes and is known to affect cell maturation and differentiation in addition to its role in inflammation. Aim(s): To study the association between PPAR-gamma gene polymorphism and psoriasis vulgaris in Egyptian patients to explore if this polymorphism influenced disease risk or clinical presentation. Method(s): Forty-five patients with psoriasis vulgaris and 45 age, sex and body mass index matched healthy volunteers who have no present, past or family history of psoriasis as a control group were enrolled. Selected cases included obese and nonobese participants. Detection of PPAR-gamma gene polymorphism was done with restriction fragment length polymorphism polymerase chain reaction. Narrow-band ultraviolet B (NBUVB) was given for every case three times/week for 12 weeks. Result(s): Homopolymorphism, heteropolymorphism, and Ala allele were significantly associated with cases (P = 0.01, P = 0.01, and P = 0.004, respectively) and increased risk of occurrence of psoriasis by 5.25, 3.65, and 3.37 folds, respectively. Heteropolymorphism was significantly associated with nonobese cases compared to obese ones (P = 0.01). Ala allele was significantly associated with obese cases (P = 0.001) and increased risk of occurrence of psoriasis in obese participants by 1.14 folds. Homopolymorphism, heteropolymorphism, and Ala allele were more prevalent among obese cases without metabolic syndrome (MS) than obese cases with MS but without statistical significance. Percentage of decrease of mean Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score before and after 3 months of treatment with NBUVB was higher in cases with heteropolymorphism with no significant difference between homo- and heteropolymorphism. Conclusion(s): PPAR-gamma gene polymorphism is associated with and increased the risk of psoriasis and its associated obesity in Egyptian patients. It has no role in NBUVB response in those patients. Future large-scale studies on different populations are recommended.Copyright © 2019 Indian Journal of Dermatology Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",Excluded
3786,"Multilocus inheritance determines predisposition to alpha-radiation induced bone tumourigenesis in mice In a recent study, we presented evidence for genetic predisposition governing radiation osteosarcomagenesis in mice. Following the incorporation of the bone-seeking alpha emitter 227Th, approximately 25% of the variance in osteosarcoma incidence was determined by inherited genetic factors. We have now mapped 5 susceptibility loci in crosses between the more susceptible BALB/c and the more resistant CBA/Ca strains. The major QTL on chromosome 14 overlaps with a locus that was already found in our previous study, using different strains of mice. Here, we investigate the effect by which the major susceptibility locus and 4 minor modifier loci interact to influence osteosarcoma predisposition. Following incorporation of the bone-seeking isotope, 100% of mice that harbour high-risk genotypes at all 5 susceptibility loci develop osteosarcoma with an average of 472 days latency times. In 10 mice inheriting exclusively low-risk genotypes only 1 osteosarcoma was found, arising after 733 days latency time. Inheritance of distinct combinations of BALB/c and CBA/Ca alleles at the susceptibility loci confer more extreme phenotypes in terms of susceptibility or resistance than observed in either of the two parental inbred strains. From the present study, we demonstrate that additive effects of multiple alleles, each making only a minor phenotypic contribution, can combine and significantly alter tumour risk. This mechanism can be of particular importance in genetically heterogeneous populations such as man. Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Included
3937,"Clinical outcomes of chemoradiotherapy for locally recurrent rectal cancer BACKGROUND: To assess the clinical outcome of chemoradiotherapy with or without surgery for locally recurrent rectal cancer (LRRC) and to find useful and significant prognostic factors for a clinical situation., METHODS: Between January 2001 and February 2009, 67 LRRC patients, who entered into concurrent chemoradiotherapy with or without surgery, were reviewed retrospectively. Of the 67 patients, 45 were treated with chemoradiotherapy plus surgery, and the remaining 22 were treated with chemoradiotherapy alone. The mean radiation doses (biologically equivalent dose in 2-Gy fractions) were 54.6 Gy and 66.5 Gy for the chemoradiotherapy with and without surgery groups, respectively., RESULTS: The median survival duration of all patients was 59 months. Five-year overall (OS), relapse-free (RFS), locoregional relapse-free (LRFS), and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) were 48.9%, 31.6%, 66.4%, and 40.6%, respectively. A multivariate analysis demonstrated that the presence of symptoms was an independent prognostic factor influencing OS, RFS, LRFS, and DMFS. No statistically significant difference was found in OS (p = 0.181), RFS (p = 0.113), LRFS (p = 0.379), or DMFS (p = 0.335) when comparing clinical outcomes between the chemoradiotherapy with and without surgery groups., CONCLUSIONS: Chemoradiotherapy with or without surgery could be a potential option for an LRRC cure, and the symptoms related to LRRC were a significant prognostic factor predicting poor clinical outcome. The chemoradiotherapy scheme for LRRC patients should be adjusted to the possibility of resectability and risk of local failure to focus on local control.",Excluded
4653,"Long-term cost of combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy Complications after treatment of Hodgkin's disease are a good model to evaluate the long-term cost of combined chemo- and radiotherapy. Secondary malignancies and mainly acute myelocytic leukemias are the main complications. The 35 of 1,889 cases reported represent increased risk by factor 129. Often preceded by a leukemic phase, they are of poor prognosis. Solid tumors are increased by factor 2.8. They may occur in patients treated by prolonged chemotherapy with alkylating agent without radiotherapy. In seven of 31 patients, solid tumors appeared in the irradiated area. Sterility in young males was present during the first year, though some recuperation was observed thereafter. Better adjustment of treatment to individual risk, to drug sensitivity, and active combinations devoid of alkylating agents are required to reduce the rate of these complications.",Excluded
4607,"Tissue flap transferring for wound repair of the clavicle OBJECTIVE: To investigate the result of tissue flap transferring for wound repair of the clavicle. METHOD(S): From 1994 to 2000, 3 patients (1 with clavicle osteosynthesis, 1 with chronic clavicle osteomyelitis, and 1 with radioactive ulcer in clavicular region accompanied by chronic osteomyelitis of clavicle) were reconstructed with turnover adipofascial flap, myocutaneous flap of pectoris, and myocutaneous flap of latissimus dorsal respectively. The outcome was observed. The operation principles of tissue flaps transferring for wound repair of the clavicle were summarized. RESULT(S): Follow-ups were done for 2 months to 7 years. All tissue flaps survived well and the wounds in clavicular region were healed well. There was no recurrence of chronic clavicle osteomyelitis. CONCLUSION(S): Turnover adipofascial flap, myocutaneous flap of pectoris and latissimus dorsal are often used for wound repair of the clavicle. Most of the wounds of the clavicle can be repaired by turnover adipofascial flap. Myocutaneous flap of pectoris and latissimus dorsal are more suitable for wound repair with chronic clavicle osteomyelitis. In the case of radioactive ulcer of the clavicular region, myocutaneous flap of latissimus dorsal transposition is a better alternative for wound repair.",Excluded

4046,"Preparation and evaluation of the rhenium-188-labelled anti-NCA antigen monoclonal antibody BW 250/183 for radioimmunotherapy of leukaemia Anti-NCA antigen antibody BW 250/183 (Anti-Granulocyte) localizes more than 50% of injected antibody dose to the bone marrow. Therefore, this antibody is promising for adjuvant conditioning radioimmunotherapy of bone marrow before bone marrow transplantation. To examine its potential use for radioimmunotherapy, we developed an efficient and reproducible technical protocol for labelling anti-NCA antigen antibody BW 250/183 with generator-produced rhenium-188, aiming at both high radiochemical yield and high specific activity. 188Re-labelled BW 250/183 antibody was used in 12 patients with advanced leukaemia. Labelling of BW 250/183 with 188Re was accomplished by the direct radiolabelling method using tris-(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) as the reducing agent. Twelve patients with recurrent acute or chronic leukaemia were treated with activities of 6.5-12.4 GBq of 188Re-labelled BW 250/183. Standard gamma camera scintigraphy was used to evaluate the biodistribution, and a region of interest analysis together with the MIRDOSE 3.1 software was applied to determine the radiation doses to relevant tissues. The 188Re-BW 250/183 antibody was labelled in high radiochemical yield, with high radiochemical purity (94% +/- 3%) and specific activity (5.55-7.4 GBq/mg) within 1 h. The preliminary biodistribution studies showed persistent uptake of 188Re-BW 250/183 in bone marrow. The radiation absorbed doses (mGy/MBq) delivered to the total body, red marrow, liver, spleen and kidneys were 0.13 +/- 0.02, 1.45 +/- 0.71, 0.43 +/- 0.21, 1.32 +/- 0.99 and 0.71 +/- 0.17, respectively. TCEP reduction enabled the direct, fast and effective labelling of the monoclonal antibody BW 250/183 with 188Re.

4814,"Improved discrimination between benign and malignant LDCT screening-detected lung nodules with dynamic over static 18F-FDG PET as a function of injected dose Lung cancer mortality rate can be significantly reduced by up to 20% through routine low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening, which, however, has high sensitivity but low specificity, resulting in a high rate of false-positive nodules. Combining PET with CT may provide more accurate diagnosis for indeterminate screening-detected nodules. In this work, we investigated low-dose dynamic 18F-FDG PET in discrimination between benign and malignant nodules using a virtual clinical trial based on patient study with ground truth. Six patients with initial LDCT screening-detected lung nodules received 90min single-bed PET scans following a 10 mCi FDG injection. Low-dose static and dynamic images were generated from under-sampled list-mode data at various count levels (100%, 50%, 10%, 5%, and 1%). A virtual clinical trial was performed by adding nodule population variability, measurement noise, and static PET acquisition start time variability to the time activity curves (TACs) of the patient data. We used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to estimate the classification capability of standardized uptake value (SUV) and net uptake constant K i from their simulated benign and malignant distributions. Various scan durations and start times (t *) were investigated in dynamic Patlak analysis to optimize simplified acquisition protocols with a population-based input function (PBIF). The area under curve (AUC) of ROC analysis was higher with increased scan duration and earlier t *. Highly similar results were obtained using PBIF to those using image-derived input function (IDIF). The AUC value for K i using optimized t * and scan duration with 10% dose was higher than that for SUV with 100% dose. Our results suggest that dynamic PET with as little as 1 mCi FDG could provide discrimination between benign and malignant lung nodules with higher than 90% sensitivity and specificity for patients similar to the pilot and simulated population in this study, with LDCT screening-detected indeterminate lung nodules.",Excluded
4116,"Seroprevalence and its impact on radiographic damage in korean rheumatoid arthritis patients starting biologics Background/Purpose: High titers of rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (ACCP) are poor prognostic factors for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Only few studies have investigated the detailed clinical subtypes or radiographic changes based on serologic status; double (RF/ACCP) positive (+ve), RF or ACCP +ve, double negative (-ve) (seronegative, SN). We aimed to analyze the clinical and radiographic features of RA patients with robust disease activity, based on their serologic status. Method(s): RA patients registered in the Korean College of Rheumatology Biologics Registry (KOBIO), a nationwide inception cohort, were analyzed. Data regarding patient demographics, comorbidity, disease activity, medication, imaging and laboratory exams were utilized. After adjusting for gender, age, disease duration, and smoking history, we analyzed the association of seropositivity and bony erosion (hands and feet X-ray), and the association of the ACCP titer and joint damage, both at baseline (initiation of biologics) presented as odd ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval [95% CI]. Result(s): Data of 1198 RA patients were investigated. Mean age was 57.2 years, and disease duration was 8.3 +/- 7.6 years. Mean DAS28-ESR was 5.71, and erosion were found in 40.1% of patients. Being ACCP+ve was significantly associated with bony erosions (OR 1.69 [95% CI 1.13-2.52], p= 0.0096), compared with RF+ve (OR 1.03 p= 0.83), or RF+ve/ACCP+ve (OR 2.19 [95% CI 1.19-4.01], p= 0.012). Of note, being ACCP+ve/RF-ve was strongly associated with radiographic damage (OR 4.93 [95% CI 2.29-10.61], p< 0.0001) in our analysis (figure). In contrast, a multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that baseline ACCP titers were not positively associated with joint damage; a multivariate linear regression model revealed disease duration (estimate -3.95, p< 0.0001) and RF titer (estimate +0.0665, p= 0.0157) were associated with ACCP titers. Conclusion(s): Our data demonstrate the significance of ACCP in predicting radiographic damage in established Korean RA patients with persistently high disease activity. Longitudinal studies would be needed to clarify the impact of ACCP titers on radiographic progression. (Figure Presented).",Excluded
3875,"Local control in sinonasal malignant melanoma: Comparing conventional to hypofractionated radiotherapy BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect of fractionation schedule on local control in postoperative radiotherapy (RT) for sinonasal malignant melanoma., METHODS: Sixty-three patients who were treated with surgery and postoperative RT in 4 accredited head and neck cancer centers in the Netherlands between 1998 and 2013 were retrospectively studied. Outcomes with conventional fractionation (2-2.4 Gy per fraction; n = 27) were compared to hypofractionation (4-6 Gy per fraction; n = 36). The primary endpoint was local control and the secondary endpoint was toxicity., RESULTS: Comparable local control rates were found after 2 and 5 years (63% vs 64% and 47% vs 53%; P = .73 for, respectively, conventional fractionation vs hypofractionation). Local recurrences were predominantly present ipsilateral (92%) and within the irradiated volume (88%). Late toxicity grade >= 3 was observed in 2 of 63 patients, 1 patient in both groups., CONCLUSION: Radiotherapy fractionation schedule did not influence the local control rate or the incidence of late toxicity in patients treated with surgery and RT for sinonasal malignant melanoma in this retrospective analysis. Due to this retrospective nature and the limited number of patients, strong recommendations cannot be made. Expected toxicity, patient convenience, and workload may be taken into account for the choice of fractionation schedule until conclusive evidence becomes available.

4906,"Reducing contrast medium dose with low photon energy images in renal dual-energy spectral CT angiography and adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the value of using low energy (keV) images in renal dual-energy spectral CT angiography (CTA) and adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) to reduce contrast medium dose. METHOD(S): 40 patients with renal CTA on a Discovery CT750HD were randomly divided into two groups: 20 cases (Group A) with 600mgI kg-1 and 20 cases (Group B) with 300mgI kg-1. The scan protocol for both groups was: dual-energy mode with mA selection for noise index of 10 HU, pitch 1.375:1, rotating speed 0.6s/r. Images were reconstructed at 0.625mm thickness with 40%ASIR, Group A used the conventional 70keV monochromatic images, and Group B used monochromatic images from 40 to 70 keV at 5 keV interval for analysis. The CT values and standard deviation (SD) values of the renal artery and erector spine in the plain and arterial phases were measured with the erector spine SD value representing image noise. The enhancement degree of the renal artery (DELTACT = CT(arterial) -CT(plain)), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR=CTrenal-artery/SDrenal-artery) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR=(CTrenal-artery-CTerector spine)/SDerector-spine) were calculated. The single factor analysis of variance was used to analyze the difference of DELTACT, SNR and CNR among image groups with p < 0.05 being statistically significant. The subjective image scores of the groups were assessed blindly by two experienced physicians using a 5-point system and the score consistency was compared by the kappa test. RESULT(S): Contrast medium dose in the 300mgI kg-1 group was reduced by 50% compared with the 600mgI kg-1 group, while radiation dose was similar between the two groups. The subjective scores were 4.00 +/- 0.65, 4.50 +/- 0.60and 3.70 +/- 0.80 for images at 70 keV (600mgI kg-1 group), 40 keV (300mgI kg-1 group) and 45 keV (300mgI kg-1 group), respectively with good consistency between the two reviewers (p > 0.05). The 40 keV images in the 300mgI kg-1 group had similar DELTACT (469.77 +/- 86.95HU vs 398.54 +/- 73.68HU) and CNR (15.52 +/- 3.32 vs 18.78 +/- 6.71) values as the 70 keV images in the 600mgI kg-1) group but higher SNR values (30.19 +/- 4.41 vs 16.91 +/- 11.12, p < 0,05). CONCLUSION(S): Contrast dose may be reduced by 50% while maintaining image quality by using lower energy images combined with ASIR in renal dual-energy CTA. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Combined with ASIR and energy spectrum, can reduce the amount of contrast dose in renal CTA.",Excluded

The sterile insect technique (SIT) is a potential alternative tool for the management of this pest, however, only conflicting data is found regarding the optimal dose to achieve sterility. Thus, this study evaluated the effect of gamma radiation doses (0, 40, 50, 60 and 70 Gy) on male and female reproductive sterility, gonads morphometry, emergence, flight ability, and longevity under nutritional stress of A. fraterculus. Full female sterility was achieved at 50 Gy, while full male sterility was achieved at 70 Gy. Both ovarian and testicular sizes were affected by irradiation, while no influence was observed on the quality parameters evaluated. Our results suggest that 70 Gy applied 48 h before adult emergence can be used to sterilize A. fraterculus in a SIT programme.",Excluded

Dose and fractionation scheme of the Cyberknife SRT boost was individualized, and prescribed dose ranged from 9 Gy to 16 Gy in 3 to 4 fractions. Among four patients for whom dose to the optic pathway was concerned, the maximum dose was only about 3 Gy for three patients whereas 9.6 Gy in the remaining one patient. The maximum dose for the mandible in one of three patients with oropharyngeal cancer was 19.7 Gy, whereas majority of the bone can be spared by using non-isocentric conformal beams. For a patient with nasopharyngeal cancer, the highest dose in the brain stem was 15 Gy. However, majority of the brain stem received less than 40% of the maximum dose. Although a small volume high dose area within the normal structure could be observed in several patients, results of the present study showed potential benefits of the CyberKnife SRT boost.",Excluded
4510,"18 Years' experience with high dose rate strontium-90 brachytherapy of small to medium sized posterior uveal melanoma Aim: To analyse local tumour control, radiation related complications, visual acuity, enucleation rate, and survival after brachytherapy of small to medium sized choroidal melanoma (CM) with a high dose rate (HDR) strontium-90 (Sr-90) applicator. Method(s): From 1983 until 2000, 98 eyes with CM were treated with Sr-90 brachytherapy. The main outcome measures were actuarial rates of the patients' survival, ocular conservation rate, tumour regression, complication rates, and preservation of visual acuity. End point rates were estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Result(s): The median follow up time was 6.7 years (0.5-18.8 years). Actuarial melanoma free patient survival rate was 85% (SE 4.8%) after 18 years. Actuarial rate of ocular conservation and complete tumour regression was 90% (SE 3.8%) after 15 years. In 93% local tumour control was achieved, 88% showed a stable scar. Recurrence of the tumour on the border caused enucleation of six eyes (7%). In three cases (4%) retinal detachment was the end point. No cases of optic atrophy or of sight impairing retinopathy outside the treated area were found. Actuarial rate of preservation of visual acuity of 1/10 was 65% at 5 years and 45% at 15 years of follow up (SE 5.9% and 8.8%). Conclusion(s): Sr-90 brachytherapy is as effective as iodine or ruthenium brachytherapy for small to medium sized CM but causes fewer complications. The preservation of vision is better than with all other described radioisotopes. HDR Sr-90 brachytherapy can therefore safely be recommended for small to medium sized CM.",Excluded
4593,"Postcontrast T1 Mapping for Differential Diagnosis of Recurrence and Radionecrosis after Gamma Knife Radiosurgery for Brain Metastasis BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The differential diagnosis of radionecrosis and tumor recurrence in brain metastases is challenging. We investigated the diagnostic efficiency of postcontrast T1 mapping in solving this problem., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 2016 and June 2017, fifty-six patients with brain metastases who underwent contrast-enhanced cerebral T1 mapping were recruited for this prospective study. The findings revealed new enhancement after gamma knife radiosurgery. The subjects were assigned to radionecrosis and recurrence groups based on follow-up (median, 11.5 months) and histopathologic results. T1 values of lesions 5 (T15min) and 60 (T160min) minutes after administration of contrast agent and their difference (T1differ) were compared between the 2 groups with the 2-tailed Mann-Whitney U test. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to determine the optimum cutoff values for differential diagnosis., RESULTS: There were significant differences between the 2 groups in T15min, T160min, and T1differ values (P = .012, P = .004, and P < .001, respectively). Relative to T15min and T160min, T1differ exhibited greater sensitivity and specificity (P < .001, respectively) in identifying radionecrosis. The optimum T1differ value for differential diagnosis was 71.1 ms (area under the curve = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.93-1.00), with sensitivity and specificity of 81.5% and 96.5%, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Postcontrast T1 mapping is optimal for the differential diagnosis of radionecrosis and tumor recurrence. Among T1 parameters, T1differ is the most powerful parameter for differential diagnosis. Advantages in terms of quantitative analysis and high resolution portend the wide use of postcontrast T1 mapping in the future. Copyright © 2018 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.",Excluded
4902,"Efficacy and safety of intensity-modulated radiotherapy following transarterial chemoembolization in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy in combination with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has been beneficial in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). There have been few clinical reports on the use of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in combination with TACE for these patients. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy and toxicity of IMRT following TACE in unresectable HCC. The medical records of consecutive patients with unresectable HCC, who underwent IMRT following TACE from January 2009 to June 2014, were retrospectively reviewed in order to assess the overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), tumor response, and treatment-associated toxicity. A total of 64 lesions in 54 patients were included in the analysis. IMRT was delivered at a median dose of 50 Gy (range 44-70 Gy) at 1.8 to 2.0 Gy per fraction. The overall response rate was achieved in 64.8% of patients with complete response in 20.4% of patients at 3 months after completion of IMRT. The median OS was 20.2 months (95% CI=8.6-31.9), and the actuarial 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS rates were 84.6%, 49.7%, and 36.7%, respectively. The median PFS was 10.5 months (95% CI=7.3-13.7) and the 1-, 2-, and 3-year PFS rates were 44.2%, 23.4%, and 14.6%, respectively. The responders had a significantly higher OS rate than the nonresponders (3-year OS 48.0% vs 14.4%, P=0.001). During and the first month following IMRT, 10 (18.5%) patients developed grade 3 hematological toxicity, and 3 (5.6%) developed grade 3 hepatic toxicity. No patient experienced grade 4 or 5 toxicity. Radiation-induced liver disease was not observed. Our findings suggest that IMRT following TACE could be a favorable treatment option for both its safety profile and clinical benefit in patients with unresectable HCC.Copyright © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",Excluded
3899,"Intravenous contrast agent influence on thoracic computed tomography simulation investigated through a heterogeneous dose calculation method using 5-Bulk densities Objective: Using 5-bulk-density heterogeneous dose calculation, we investigated whether contrast-enhanced (CE+) computed tomography (CT) will affect dose-calculation accuracy in the thoracic area. Method(s): We analyzed 17 radiation-oncology patients who underwent thoracic CE+ CTs. Full-resolution CT and 5-bulk-density plans were generated using an adaptive convolution algorithm. Bulk densities for air, lung, fat, soft tissue, and bone were applied to regions identified by an isodensity segmentation tool. The population-averaged physical density of each region was calculated and compared with the reference value calculated from 66 noncontrast-enhanced (CE-) thoracic CT images. Using the 5-bulk densities, we created a new plan in which the physical densities of each area were forced to be the same as the CE- reference value, and we compared the dose-volume histograms (DVH). Result(s): Average physical density for the segmented air, lung, fat, soft tissue, and bone for CE+ were 0.14, 0.29, 0.90, 1.03, and 1.13 g/cm3, and the reference values for CE- were 0.14, 0.26, 0.89, 1.02, and 1.12 g/cm3, respectively. In all the cases, the normal-tissue DVH agreed to better than 1%. In 15 cases, DVH of the planning target volume (PTV) agreed to better than 3%. In 2 patients, >3% difference in the PTV dose was observed. Conclusion(s): Only 2 patients with a strong injection artifact in the PTV or beam showed >3% discrepancy in the target dose. When using CE+ CT for treatment planning, strong injection artifacts must be excluded. Copyright © 2011 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Excluded

Although 45 years have elapsed since A-bomb exposure, there are still some questions about the development of thyroid cancer: 1) Is the incidence now decreasing? 2) What factors, other than radiation exposure, are involved? 3) What is the incidence of multiple cancer, including thyroid cancer?

3908,"Cyberknife radiotherapy for vestibular schwannoma Stereotactic radiosurgery is a well-established treatment modality for vestibular schwannoma. Initial reports using single-stage radiosurgery have demonstrated excellent tumor control rates. Many patients now elect to undergo radiosurgery given the potential for tumor control while avoiding the morbidity associated with microsurgical resection. In attempt to improve hearing preservation rates of single-state radiosurgery, staged frame-based radiotherapy using a 12-hour interfraction interval was used at the authors' institution and has shown a hearing preservation rate of 77% at 2 years of follow-up. With the arrival of the Cyberknife, a frameless, image-guided radiotherapy system, staged stereotactic radiotherapy for vestibular schwannoma became more practical. This article outlines the rationale and treatment protocols developed at Stanford University (California) and reports the authors' initial experience using the Cyberknife to treat vestibular schwannoma.",Excluded
3935,"Osteosarcoma of the flat bone Objective: We aimed to understand the biology of osteosarcoma of the flat bone, which is a rare tumor entity. Method(s): Cases with osteosarcoma of the flat bone were compared with those of the extremity in order to evaluate their clinicopathologic characteristics. And the influences of heterogeneous treatment modalities on outcome were analyzed. Result(s): Tumors of the flat bone comprised 91 (11.3%) of 806 osteosarcoma cases. Eight cases were secondary osteosarcoma associated with previous radiotherapy. Patients with a flat bone tumor were significantly older and more likely to present with metastases at diagnosis than extremity tumor. The proportions of female sex and chondroblastic subtype were higher among flat bone tumors than among extremity tumors. The 5-year overall survival and event-free survival rates were 35.2 +/- 5.4% and 24.7 +/- 5.5%, respectively. Although age and histologic response to pre-operative chemotherapy were not related to outcome of flat bone tumors, treatment modality influenced the survival. Patients treated surgically had better outcomes than those treated by another means. Radiation therapy did not appear to be an effective local control measure as surgery. Conclusion(s): Treatment outcome of the tumor of the flat bone was worse than extremity tumors. Further studies are needed to identify effective local control measures that can substitute for surgery and to determine the biologic characteristics of osteosarcoma of the flat bone. © The Author (2009).

4884,"Proton pencil beam scanning for mediastinal lymphoma: treatment planning and robustness assessment BACKGROUND: Modern radiotherapy (RT) for lymphoma is highly personalized. While advanced imaging is largely employed to define limited treatment volumes, the use of proton pencil beam scanning (PBS) for highly conformal lymphoma RT is still in its infancy. Here, we assess the dosimetric benefits and feasibility of PBS for mediastinal lymphoma (ML)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten patients were planned using PBS for involved-site RT. The initial plans were calculated on the average four-dimensional computed tomography (4D-CT). PBS plans were compared with 3D conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT), intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), and proton double scattering (DS). In order to evaluate the feasibility of PBS and the plan robustness against inter- and intra-fractional uncertainties, the 4D dose was calculated on initial and verification CTs. The deviation of planned dose from delivered dose was measured. The same proton beamline was used for all patients, while another beamline with larger spots was employed for patients with large motion perpendicular to the beam., RESULTS: PBS provided the lowest mean lung dose (MLD) and mean heart dose (MHD) for all patients in comparison with 3D-CRT, IMRT, and DS. For eight patients, internal target volume (ITV) D98% was degraded by <3%; and the MLD and MHD deviated by <10% of prescription over the course of treatment when the PBS field was painted twice in each session. For one patient with target motion perpendicular to the beam (>5 mm), the degradation of ITV D98% was 9%, which was effectively mitigated by employing large spots. One patient exhibited large dose degradation due to pericardial effusion, which required replanning across all modalities., CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that PBS plans significantly reduce MLD and MHD relative to 3D-CRT, IMRT, and DS and identifies requirements for robust free-breathing ML PBS treatments, showing that PBS plan robustness can be maintained with repainting and/or large spots.",Excluded
3763,"Ultra-high resolution whole body prototype CT scanner: Influence of image matrix and slice thickness on image quality in the lung Purpose: To evaluate the effect of 0.25mm slice thickness and 1k image matrix on image quality in HR-CT of the lung. Material(s) and Method(s): 59 subsequent patients underwent a CT of the chest on a clinical prototype scanner (TSX-304R, Toshiba) with the following scanning parameters: 0.25mm slice thickness (128 rows), 0.5 seconds rotation time, target SD at 25HU (AEC), 120 kV, AIDR-3D with FC81. Six series of images were reconstructed as follows (slice thickness in mm/image matrix): 0.25/1k, 0.25/512, 0.5/1k, 0.5/512, 2/1k, and 2/512. By using forced ranking, 2 readers (21, 4 y on staff) blinded to the reconstruction method evaluated the series (6 on 1, random order, 4K monitor) in the categories: (1) definition of bronchioli, (2) conspicuity of vasculature, (3) visibility of fissures/septa, (4) blurriness, (5) noise texture, (6) artifacts, and (7) overall preference. The readers also graded their preference on a free scale from 1=excellent quality to 10=low quality. Image noise (SD in ROI) was measured on all reconstructions within the aorta and in air, radiation dose was recorded. All values were statistically analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA for main and interaction effects, and Kendall's W coefficient of concordance for inter-observer agreement on rankings. Result(s): The image matrix size and slice thickness main effects and their interaction were statistically significant at P<0.05 in all cases, with matrix size generally having a stronger effect than slice thickness. In the categories 1-3, the 1k matrix ranked preferably over 512, and 0.25mm was preferred over 0.5 and 2mm for both readers (forced ranking method). 2mm slices at 1k were preferred for noise texture and artifacts, 0.25mm at 512 ranked the lowest in both categories. On free scale ranking in category 7, both readers preferred 0.5mm at 1k (n.s.) and ranked the 2mm 512 matrix the lowest (P<0.001). The inter-observer agreement (Kendall's W) ranged from 0.89 to 0.93 for categories 1-3, and 0.66 to 0.83 for categories 4-7. The mean DLP was 377.9. SD of image noise varied from 58.1HU (0.25/1k) to 25.8HU (2/512) in air. Conclusion(s): For high-resolution CT of the lung, 1k image matrix provides superior image quality compared with 512 matrix, and 0.25mm slices thickness is mostly preferred over 0.5 and 2 mm.",Excluded
3863,"The impact of tumor volume and radiotherapy dose on outcome in previously irradiated recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy Purpose: To assess the effect of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) dose and tumor volume on outcomes in patients with recurrent, previously irradiated squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 96 patients with recurrent, previously irradiated squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were treated with SBRT using Cyberknife and Trilogy-intensity- modulated radiosurgery. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used to estimate locoregional control (LRC) and overall survival rates. Response was evaluated using positron emission tomography/computed tomography or computed tomography and detailed physical examination. Result(s): The median follow-up for all patients was 14 months (2-39 months). The median dose of prior radiation was 68.4 Gy (32-170 Gy). Patients were divided into 4 SBRT dose groups: I (15-28 Gy/n = 29), II (30-36 Gy/n = 22), III (40 Gy/n = 18), and IV (44-50 Gy/n = 27). The median gross tumor volume (GTV) was 24.3 cm3 (2.5-162 cm). For GTV <=25 cm3 (n = 50), complete response rates were 27.8%/30%/45.5%/45.5%, and for GTV >25 cm3 (n = 46), complete response rates were 20%/25%/42.8%/50% for SBRT groups I-IV, respectively. The 1-/2-/3-year LRC rates for doses 40 to 50 Gy were 69.4%/57.8%/41.1%, respectively, whereas for 15 to 36 Gy, they were 51.9%/31.7%/15.9%, respectively (P = 0.02). The overall 1- and 2-year overall survival rates were 58.9% and 28.4%, respectively. Treatment was well tolerated with no grade 4/5 toxicities. Conclusion(s): Dose escalation up to 50 Gy in 5 fractions is feasible with SBRT for recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Higher SBRT doses were associated with significantly higher LRC rates. Large tumor volume required higher SBRT doses to achieve optimal response rates compared with smaller tumor volume.

4778,"Three-stage Gamma Knife treatment for metastatic brain tumors larger than 10 cm3: A 2-institute study including re-analyses of earlier results using competing risk analysis OBJECTIVE The results of 3-stage Gamma Knife treatment (3-st-GK-Tx) for relatively large brain metastases have previously been reported for a series of patients in Chiba, Japan (referred to in this study as the C-series). In the current study, the authors reappraised, using a competing risk analysis, the efficacy and safety of 3-st-GK-Tx by comparing their experience with that of the C-series. METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study. Among 1767 patients undergoing GK radiosurgery for brain metastases at Mito Gamma House during the 2005-2015 period, 78 (34 female, 44 male; mean age 65 years, range 35-86 years) whose largest tumor was > 10 cm3, treated with 3-st-GK-Tx, were studied (referred to in this study as the M-series). The target volumes were covered with a 50% isodose gradient and irradiated with a peripheral dose of 10 Gy at each procedure. The interval between procedures was 2 weeks. Because competing risk analysis had not been employed in the published C-series, the authors reanalyzed the previously published data using this method. RESULTS The overall median survival time after 3-st-GK-Tx was 8.3 months (95% CI 5.6-12.0 months) in the M-series and 8.6 months (95% CI 5.5-10.6 months) in the C-series (p = 0.41). Actuarial survival rates at the 6th and 12th post-3-st-GK-Tx months were, respectively, 55.1% and 35.2% in the M-series and 62.5% and 26.4% in the C-series (HR 1.175, 95% CI 0.790-1.728, p = 0.42). Cumulative incidences at the 12th post-3-st-GK-Tx, determined by competing risk analyses, of neurological deterioration (14.2% in C-series vs 12.8% in M-series), neurological death (7.2% vs 7.7%), local recurrence (4.8% vs 6.2%), repeat SRS (25.9% vs 18.0%), and SRS-related complications (2.3% vs 5.1%) did not differ significantly between the 2 series. CONCLUSIONS There were no significant differences in post-3-st-GK-Tx results between the 2 series in terms of overall survival times, neurological death, maintained neurological status, local control, repeat SRS, and SRS-related complications. The previously published results (C-series) are considered to be validated by the M-series results.Copyright ©AANS 2018.",Excluded
4594,"Functional dosimetric metrics for predicting radiation-induced lung injury in non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with chemoradiotherapy Background: Radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) is an important dose-limiting toxicity during thoracic radiotherapy. The purpose of this study is to investigate single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) perfusion-weighted functional dose-volume histogram (FDVH) for predicting RILI in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy. Method(s): Fifty-seven locally advanced NSCLC patients receiving chemoradiotherapy were enrolled prospectively. Patients had treatment scans and dose calculations to provide a standard dose-volume histogram (DVH). Fusion of SPECT and computed tomography scans provided perfusion-weighted FDVH and associated functional dosimetric parameters (relative volumes of functional lung receiving more than a threshold dose of 5 - 60 Gy at increments of 5 Gy [FV5 - FV60]). The predictive abilities of FDVH and DVH were calculated and compared based on the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Result(s): The accumulative incidence of >= 2 grade RILI was 19.3% with a median follow-up of 12 months. Univariate analysis showed that the functional (FV5 - FV60) and standard (V5 - V40) parameters were associated with RILI (all value of p < 0.05). Close correlations between a variety of functional and standard parameters were found. By ROC curve analysis, functional metrics (AUCs were 0.784 - 0.869) provided similarly (p value 0.233 - 1.000) predictive outcome to standard metrics (AUCs were 0.695 - 0.902) in lower - median dose level parameters (FV5 - FV40). However, FDVH seemed to add some predictive value in higher dose level, the best statistical significance for comparing FV60 with V60 was 0.693 vs. 0.511 (p = 0.055). Conclusion(s): Functional metrics are identified as reliable predictors for RILI, however, this observation still needs to be further verified using a larger sample size. © 2012 Wang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded

This report provides 1- and 2-year updates to the initial publication. METHOD(S):: Patients were of age 50 years or more with invasive carcinoma or ductal carcinoma in situ, tumor size <=3 cm, and negative surgical margins. After lumpectomy, patients received EBT in 10 fractions over 5 days (34 Gy total). RESULT(S):: Of the 69 patients enrolled, 62 were evaluated at 1 year and 20 patients at 2 years after treatment. At 1 year, 28 (45.2%) patients reported adverse events that were possibly, probably, or definitely related to treatment. Most (90%) were grade 1: manageable and typical of radiation therapy. Four events were grade 2: induration/firmness (2), field contracture (1), and seroma (1). One event was grade 3: a draining fistula at the lumpectomy site due to residual effects of a breast infection at 1 month. No recurrences have been reported. Cosmetic ratings were excellent or good in 93.4% of patients at 1 year. Most patients (69%) were energetic most or all of the time. Most patients (69% to 98%) were not affected by individual symptoms of breast disease at 1 year. Generally patients who had an adverse event did not report the corresponding symptom on the quality-of-life questionnaire.

4100,"Microvascular decompression after gamma knife surgery for trigeminal neuralgia: intraoperative findings and treatment outcomes OBJECT: The authors sought to determine whether the results of trigeminal microvascular decompression (MVD) are influenced by prior gamma knife surgery (GKS). METHOD(S): Gamma knife surgery is an established procedure for treating medically intractable trigeminal neuralgia but failures do occur. The authors assessed six patients (two men and four women; mean age 52 years) who experienced pain recurrence after GKS and elected to undergo trigeminal MVD via retrosigmoid craniotomy. Three patients underwent a single GKS to a maximal dose of 80 Gy, whereas three others underwent a second GKS to total of 120 to 135 Gy. At surgery, none of the six patients demonstrated excess arachnoid thickening, grossly apparent changes in the nerve itself, or any other tissue alterations that made successful mobilization of a blood vessel from the trigeminal root entry zone technically more difficult. A single individual had a small atherosclerotic plaque in the superior cerebellar artery near its contact point with the trigeminal nerve. Follow up at a mean of 25.4 months (range 7.5-42 months) indicated that five patients were pain free. One patient had improved but still relied on medications for pain control. CONCLUSION(S): In the authors' experience, trigeminal MVD can be performed without added difficulty in patients who have previously undergone GKS. The success rates seem similar to those normally associated with MVD. Patients who elect the less invasive option of GKS can be assured that trigeminal MVD remains a viable alternative at a later date if further surgery is required.",Excluded
3913,"Impacts of antibiotics on in vitro UVA-susceptibility of human skin fibroblasts Many studies of UVA-induced cell damage use skin cells obtained during plastic surgery. As the skin is contaminated by micro-organisms, antibiotics need to be added to primary skin cell culture media. This study analysed the impact of the most widely used agents, penicillin, streptomycin, and amphotericin B deoxycholate (amB), on UVA-irradiated human skin fibroblasts. The results show that the presence of amB in cell culture media increases the susceptibility of fibroblasts to UVA and the intracellular level of reactive oxygen species, even when cells are irradiated in amB-free saline. This photosensitising effect of amB can be prevented if the antifungal agent is removed from the culture medium at least 24 hours before irradiation. Moreover, the use of streptomycin during cell culture partly protects cells against the UVA-induced mortality linked to amB. Acellular tests on lipid micelles suggest that this protective effect could result from an inhibition of lipid peroxidation by the antibacterial agent. In conclusion, antibiotics should be used with care in cell culture media if the cells are to be used in physiological studies of fine mechanisms in UVA-susceptibility of skin cells. In other cases, cells should be maintained in antibiotic-free media for 24 hours before irradiation.",Excluded
4001,"Fat depot specific differences in mRNA expression of novel loci associated with waist-hip ratio Background and aims: Body fat distribution is one of the main predictors of obesity-associated complications. It might be hypothesised that changes in the gene expression or in gene function caused by genetic variants may result in metabolic alterations related to obesity. We therefore investigated the adipose tissue expression profiles of 6 loci (TBX15, WARS, PIGC, STAB1, GRB14, ZNRF3), identified in a recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) for WHR, as their exact role in fat distribution remains largely unknown. Effects of genetic variants within these loci (rs984222 TBX15/WARS; rs6784615 STAB1; rs1011731 PIGC; rs4823006 ZNFR3; rs10195252 GRB14) on gene expression, WHR, and obesity related traits were examined. Material(s) and Method(s): Paired samples of visceral (vis) and subcutaneous (sc) adipose tissue were obtained from 297 Caucasian men and women who underwent open abdominal surgery. Abdominal vis and sc fat area was calculated using CT scans and percentage body fat was measured by dualenergy X-ray absorptiometry. Gene expression was measured by quantitative real-time PCR by using TaqMan methodology. SNP genotyping was done using the TaqMan SNP Genotyping assay. Differences in mRNA expression between vis and sc adipose tissue were assessed using the paired t-test. Correlation analyses were carried out and multivariate linear relationships were assessed by generalized linear regression models. Two-sided P-values <0.05 were considered to provide nominal evidence for association (adj. age, gender). Result(s): Differential expression between vis and sc adipose tissue could be observed for all tested genes. Except for STAB1 with higher mRNA expression in sc adipose tissue of males vs. females, there were no gender differences in gene expression in either tissue. Surprisingly, no correlation between WHR and fat mRNA expression of any of the genes was observed except for WARS whose expression in vis fat correlated positively with WHR in men. However, mRNA expression of several genes (e.g. WARS, PIGC, STAB1) correlated with BMI. Further, STAB1 expression in sc adipose tissue correlated with fat mass, and ZNRF3 expression in sc tissue correlated negatively with vis fat area. In addition, vis as well as sc expression of WARS and PIGC correlated negatively with both vis and sc fat area. Nominal associations were detected for rs984222 and TBX15 mRNA expression, rs4823006 and ZNFR3 mRNA expression, and rs10195252 and GRB14 mRNA expression, whereat rs984222 was also associated with BMI, sc and vis fat area as well as the GRB14 SNP with waist and waist-hip ratio in men (adj. age, BMI). Conclusion(s): Besides rather moderate correlations of the expression levels with BMI or WHR, the most striking feature of expression of the 6 examined genes is the inter-depot variability as well as correlations with the vis and sc fat area. Our data further support the role of genes from recent GWAS in the regulation of fat distribution.",Excluded

We sought to examine the pattern of failure with the goal of designing optimal re-RT fields for these patients. Method(s): From July 1996 to April 2011, 47 HNC patients treated with fractionated re-RT developed locoregional failure. Recurrence sites were oropharynx (n = 12), neck (n = 11), oral cavity (n = 9), larynx (n = 5), paranasal sinuses (n = 5), parotid (n = 4), and hypopharynx (n = 1). Median initial radiation therapy (RT) dose was 65 Gy and median time between radiations was 32.2 months. Salvage surgery was performed in 21 patients (45 %), and 37 patients (79 %) received concurrent chemotherapy. Median re-RT dose was 60 Gy, and all patients received intensity-modulated RT. Patterns of failure were assessed by reviewing target volume delineation and compared slice-by-slice visually alongside axial imaging documenting locoregional recurrence. There was no intention to encompass prophylactic subclinical regions at risk. Coding of failures was either in-field (InF) or out-of-field (OutF). All others were marginal failures (margF). Result(s): With a median follow-up of 24.5 months, the median time to locoregional progression-free survival (LRPFS) was 5.3 months and median overall survival (OS) was 12.5 months. Failures were documented as InF in 42 patients (89 %), OutF in three patients (6 %), and margF in two patients (4 %). Five patients died while undergoing re-RT. Patients who developed OutF occurred at sites beyond 2 cm from the tumor volume. Conclusion(s): In our series of recurrent HNC patients who underwent salvage re-RT, the vast majority of locoregional failures were InF. We feel that confining re-RT targets to the gross tumor volume or postoperative clinical target volume without treating the subclinical regions at risk for failure is sufficient. With current image guidance capabilities, reducing the planning target volume margin may further minimize toxicities. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded

4039,"Experience with higher doses of radiotherapy in the postoperative treatment of glioblastoma multiforme: A single institutional report Background: Glioblastoma multiforme is a highly aggressive tumour with median survival of approximately 14 months. Management consists of maximal surgical resection followed by postoperative chemoradiation with concurrent then adjuvant temozolamide. The standard radiotherapy dose is 60 Gy in 2-Gy fractions. Most tumour recurrences occur within the previous irradiation field. Regimens designed to deliver higher radiation dose to improve local control and enhance survival warrant investigation. Method(s): We report a single institutional experience of treatment of consecutive patients with glioblastoma multiforme, treated with resection, postoperative radiotherapy followed by concurrent and/or adjuvant chemotherapy. Finding(s): Of the 80 patients who entered the study, 68 completed the treatment course; there were 45 (66.2 %) male and 23 (33.8%) female patients with a mean age at diagnosis of 48.97 +/- 12.85 (21-75) years. At a median follow up of 19 months, 39 (57.3%) patients had evidence of tumour progression and 36 (52.9%) patients had died. Median overall survival for all patients was 16 months and progression-free survival for all patients was 6.02 months. All potential prognostic factors were analysed to evaluate their effects on overall survival. age of 50 years or younger, concurrent and adjuvant chemotherapy, and extent of surgery were significant. We noted a lower progression rate among patients who received higher doses of radiotherapy (>60 Gy; p = 0.03). Overall survival was also increased, but this was not significant. Interpretation(s): This study suggests that higher radiation doses (>60 Gy) can improve local control and potentially survival; prospective multicentric studies should be done to evaluate the effect of higher doses of conformal radiation on the outcomes of patients with glioblastoma multiforme.",Excluded
3861,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for recurrent surgically treated acromegaly: comparison with fractionated radiotherapy OBJECT: The authors tested the assumption that gamma knife radiosurgery is more effective than fractionated radiotherapy for the treatment of patients with acromegaly who have undergone unsuccessful resective surgery. Untreated and uncured acromegaly causes illness and death. Acromegalic patients in whom growth hormone and, particularly, insulin-like growth factor I are not normalized must undergo further treatment., METHODS: After unsuccessful operations, 16 patients suffering from recurrent and uncured acromegaly underwent stereotactic radiosurgery (25 Gy to the tumor margin, 50 Gy maximum), the outcome of which was compared with the result obtained in 50 patients who received fractionated radiotherapy (40 Gy). The cumulative distribution functions of the two groups (Kaplan-Meier estimate) differed significantly (p < 0.0001 in the log-rank test of Mantel). The mean time to simultaneous normalization of both parameters was 1.4 years in the group treated with the gamma knife and 7.1 years in the group treated with fractionated radiotherapy., CONCLUSIONS: The authors suggest the use of stereotactic radiosurgery as the preferred treatment for recurrent acromegaly resulting from unsuccessfully resected tumors.",Excluded
4403,"Different outdoor professions have different risks - a cross-sectional study comparing non-melanoma skin cancer risk among farmers, gardeners and mountain guides Background: One of the main risk factors for non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), the most common cancer worldwide, is solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR). This has led to the recognition of NMSC as occupational disease for outdoor workers in several countries. However, outdoor professions are a very heterogeneous group with diverse daily activities and associated UVR exposure. Objective(s): To compare the prevalence of NMSC and associated risk behaviour in different outdoor professions. Method(s): Cross-sectional study among outdoor workers (farmers, gardeners, mountain guides) and indoor workers (office employees) as control group using a paper-based questionnaire on UVR exposure and protective behaviour followed by a skin examination by a dermatologist. Result(s): A total of 563 participants (46.9% women, 46.9 +/- 13.8 years) consisting of 348 outdoor workers (38.8% farmer, 35.3% gardener, 25.9% mountain guides) and 215 indoor workers were included in the study between March and September 2017. NMSC incl. actinic keratosis was diagnosed in 33.3% of mountain guides, 27.4% of farmers, 19.5% of gardeners and in 5.6% of indoor workers. Significant differences were seen between the outdoor professions with mountain guides at highest risk compared to farmers (OR = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.2-5.7). Substantial differences between the professions were also seen in skin cancer screening attendance rates (indoor worker 61.4%, mountain guides 57.8%, farmers 31.9%, gardeners 27.6%), daily UVR exposure during work and protective behaviour such as sunscreen use during work. Conclusion(s): Different outdoor professions have significant different risks for NMSC and show different risk behaviour. Tailoring prevention efforts to different professions based on their individual needs could be the key to lower the global burden of (occupational) NMSC.Copyright © 2018 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology",Excluded
4924,"A useful intraoperative technique for transiliac-transsacral screws: a point-to-point coaxial guide apparatus BACKGROUND: The transiliac-transsacral screw placement is a clinical challenge for surgeons. This study explored a point-to-point coaxial guide apparatus assisting the transiliac-transsacral screw insertion and aimed to investigate the feasibility and accuracy of the guide apparatus in the treatment of posterior ring unstable pelvic fracture compared with a free-hand technique. METHOD(S): A retrospective study was performed to evaluate patients treated with transiliac-transsacral screws assisted by the point-to-point coaxial guide apparatus or free-hand technique. The intraoperative data of operative time and radiation exposure times were recorded. Postoperative radiographs and CT scans were performed to scrutinize the accuracy of screws position. The quality of the postoperative fracture reduction was assessed according to Matta radiology criteria. The pelvic function was assessed according to the Majeed scoring criteria at 6 months postoperatively. RESULT(S): From July 2017 to December 2019, a total of 38 patients were included in this study, 20 from the point-to-point guide apparatus group and 18 from the free-hand group. There were no significant differences between the two groups in gender, age, injury causes, pelvic fracture type, screws level, and follow-up time (P > 0.05). The average operative time of the guide apparatus group for each screw was significantly less than that in the free-hand group (25.8 +/- 4.7 min vs 40.5 +/- 5.1, P < 0.001). The radiation exposure times were significantly lower in the guide apparatus group than that in the free-hand group (24.4 +/- 6.0 vs 51.6 +/- 8.4, P < 0.001). The intraosseous and juxtacortical rate of screw placement (100%) higher than in the free-hand group (94.4%). CONCLUSION(S): The point-to-point coaxial guide apparatus is feasible for assisting the transiliac-transsacral screw in the treatment of posterior unstable pelvic fractures. It has the advantages of simple operation, reasonable design and no need for expensive equipment, and provides an additional surgical strategy for the insertion of the transiliac-transsacral screw.",Excluded
4268,"Higher levels of metastasis-inducing S100A4 protein levels are associated with less favourable treatment response to disease modifying antirheumatic drugs in female patients with recent-onset rheumatoid arthritis Background Metastasis-inducing S100A4 protein was identified as a pro-inflammatory and pro-destructive factor in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Our research group has previously demonstrated that S100A4 is significantly elevated in peripheral blood, synovial fluid and synovial tissue of RA patients and that the levels of S100A4 correlate with disease activity. Objectives To evaluate the levels of S100A4 in serum of patients with recent-onset RA and to characterize the association of S100A4 with disease activity and response to treatment. Methods Serum levels of S100A4 protein were measured by ELISA in 59 patients with recent-onset RA (symptom duration <6 months) before and 3 months after initiation of treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, and cross-sectionally in 42 healthy controls. IgM rheumatoid factor (IgM-RF), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were analysed at baseline. Clinical disease activity (DAS28) was assessed at baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months after initiation of treatment. The degree of radiographic joint damage was calculated from x-rays using the Sharp-van der Heijde Score (SHS) at baseline and at month 12. Results Mean DAS28 (SD) significantly decreased from 5.36 (1.42) at baseline to 3.09 (1.52) at month 3 (n=59) and to 2.69 (1.19) at month 12 (n=40), respectively (p<0.0001). Of the 40 patients with available radiographs, 9 (23%) showed an increase in SHS (SHS >0) after 12 months. The levels of serum S100A4 protein were significantly higher in patients with recent-onset RA compared to healthy controls (646.60+/-602.60 vs. 46.97+/-30.12 ng/ml; p<0.001) and significantly decreased after 3 months of treatment (to 388.10+/-521.00; p<0.001). There was positive correlation of baseline levels of S100A4 with IgM-RF (r=0.611; p<0.0001) and ACPA levels (r=0.471; p<0.001). After adjustment for IgM-RF, the levels of S100A4 at baseline (r=0.403; p<0.05) as well as at month 3 (r=0.548; p<0.01) were positively correlated with DAS28 after 12 months of treatment in female patients (n=28). There was no correlation in male patients. The levels of S100A4 did not correlate with disease activity at baseline or with the change of disease activity over time. Furthermore, there was no association between baseline levels or changes of SA100A4 and achievement of DAS28 remission or radiographic progression. Conclusions Our results indicate that circulating S100A4 levels are significantly higher in patients with recent-onset RA compared to healthy individuals and that higher S100A4 levels at baseline or at month 3 might have predictive potential for worse treatment response at month 12, at least in female patients with recent-onset RA.",Excluded
3760,"Survival curves after X-ray and heat treatments for melanoma cells derived directly from surgical specimens of tumours in man X-ray and heat survival curves were established for melanoma cells derived directly from surgical specimens of tumours in man by using the Courtenay soft agar colony assay. The plating efficiency for 11 of the 14 melanomas studied was sufficiently high (PE = 0.3-58%) to measure cell survival over at least two decades. Experiments repeated with cells stored in liquid nitrogen showed that the survival assay gave highly reproducible results. The melanomas exhibited individual and characteristic survival curves whether exposed to radiation or heat (43.5 degrees C). The Do-values were in the ranges 0.63-1.66 Gy (X-rays) and 33-58 min (heat). The survival curves were similar to those reported previously for human melanoma xenografts. The radiation sensitivity of the cells was not correlated to the heat sensitivity. Since the melanomas appeared to be very heterogeneous in radiation response in vitro as melanomas are known to be clinically, it is suggested that melanomas may be suitable for prospective studies aimed at establishing whether clinical radioresponsiveness somehow is related to in vitro survival curve parameters.",Excluded
3814,"Outcomes and toxicity following Yttrium-90 radioembolization for hepatic metastases from neuroendocrine tumors-a single-institution experience Background: The prognosis of patients with hepatic metastases from neuroendocrine tumors (NET) is generally good, and radioembolization with Yttrium-90 microspheres is a locoregional therapy that is used in efforts to improve hepatic disease control and survival. This study aims to describe the survival outcomes and toxicities associated with radioembolization for hepatic-predominant metastatic NET in a large single-institution cohort. Method(s): A total of 59 patients underwent radioembolization for metastatic NET with hepatic predominant disease at a single academic center. Patient outcomes were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and toxicities were detailed and described. Ten patients within the cohort underwent post-treatment dosimetric analysis using PET-MRI and normal liver dosimetry was correlated with hepatic fibrosis and toxicity. Result(s): Median overall survival from time of radioembolization in the patient cohort was 31 months, and the 1- and 2-year overall survival was 80.4% and 65.6% respectively. Median hepatic progression-free survival and overall progression-free survival were 18 and 13 months, respectively. Three patients died of hepatic failure that was possibly therapy-related. Ten patients underwent evaluation of post-treatment dosimetry following radioembolization. In patients who did not develop hepatotoxicity or hepatic fibrosis, mean dose to normal liver was 25.4 Gy, while the mean liver dose in patients who experienced toxicity (hepatic fibrosis in n=2 and death from hepatic failure in n=1) was 59.1 Gy. Conclusion(s): Overall survival following radioembolization for hepatic metastases from NET is excellent; however, deaths that are potentially treatment-related have been observed. Preliminary data regarding dose to normal liver is suggestive of a relation between dosimetry and toxicity, however further work is required to further elucidate the mechanism, correlation with dosimetry, as well as additional patient and tumor factors that may predispose these patients to toxicity.Copyright © Journal of Gastrointestinal Oncology.

3842,"A Serum Small Molecule Biosignature of Radiation Exposure from Total Body Irradiated Patients The potential for radiological accidents and nuclear terrorism has increased the need for the development of new rapid biodosimetry methods. In addition, in a clinical setting the issue of an individual's radiosensitivity should be taken into consideration during radiotherapy. We utilized metabolomics and lipidomics to investigate changes of metabolites in serum samples following exposure to total body ionizing radiation in humans. Serum was collected prior to irradiation, at 3-8 h after a single dose of 1.25-2 Gy, and at 24 h with a total delivered dose of 2-3.75 Gy. Metabolomics revealed perturbations in glycerophosphocholine, phenylalanine, ubiquinone Q2, and oxalic acid. Alterations were observed in circulating levels of lipids from monoacylglycerol, triacylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylglycerol lipid classes. Polyunsaturated fatty acids were some of the most dysregulated lipids, with increased levels linked to proinflammatory processes. A targeted metabolomics approach for eicosanoids was also employed. The results showed a rapid response for proinflammatory eicosanoids, with a dampening of the signal at the later time point. Sex differences were observed in the markers from the untargeted approach but not the targeted method. The ability to identify and quantify small molecules in blood can therefore be utilized to monitor radiation exposure in human populations.",Included

Comparison was made with rats irradiated with a 1.35 mm wide single beam of similar X-rays. Rats were killed when paresis developed, or up to 383 days post irradiation (dpi)., RESULTS: Microbeam peak/valley doses of =357/12.7 Gy to 715/25.4 Gy to an 11 mm long segment of the spinal cord, or single beam doses of =146-454 Gy to a 1.35 mm long segment caused foreleg paresis and histopathologically verified spinal cord damage; rats exposed to peak/valley doses up to 253/9 Gy were paresis-free at 383 dpi., CONCLUSIONS: Whereas microbeam radiation therapy [MRT] for malignant gliomas implanted in rat brains can be safe, palliative or curative, the high tolerance of normal rat spinal cords to similar microbeam exposures justifies testing MRT for autochthonous malignancies in the central nervous system of larger animals with a view to subsequent clinical applications.

To gain further perspective, we evaluated the toxicity rates of sequential lobar versus whole liver 90Y-radioembolization. Method(s): Thirty-four patients with liver malignancy in noncirrhotic livers were included; 90Y-radioembolization was performed as either whole liver or sequential lobar treatment in 17 patients each. Standard clinical and liver specific laboratory parameters as well as MR imaging before treatment and at follow-up (6 and 12 weeks) after radioembolization were evaluated for toxicity using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). Volumetry of the liver, tumor, and spleen and measurement of portal vein diameter also were performed. Result(s): Three months after whole liver RE, 14 liver-related grade 3/4 events were recorded versus 2 events after sequential lobar treatment (P < 0.05). Three patients treated with whole liver RE suffered from radioembolization-induced liver disease (REILD). Pathological increases in bilirubin at 3 months were observed for the whole liver group only (52.3 vs. 18.7 mumol/l, P = 0.012). Total liver volume did not change significantly in either group, but shrinkage of the initially treated hepatic lobe with compensatory hypertrophy of the subsequently treated lobe was observed in the sequential lobar group (P < 0.05). Portal vein diameter increased significantly in whole liver-treated patients only (+17% vs. +6.6%, P = 0.043). Conclusion(s): Noncirrhotic patients undergoing sequential lobar radioembolization had less hepatic toxicity compared to whole liver embolization.

3752,"Estimation of background radiation doses for the Peninsular Malaysia's population by ESR dosimetry of tooth enamel Background radiation dose is used in dosimetry for estimating occupational doses of radiation workers or determining radiation dose of an individual following accidental exposure. In the present study, the absorbed dose and the background radiation level are determined using the electron spin resonance (ESR) method on tooth samples. The effect of using different tooth surfaces and teeth exposed with single medical X-rays on the absorbed dose are also evaluated. A total of 48 molars of position 6-8 were collected from 13 district hospitals in Peninsular Malaysia. Thirty-six teeth had not been exposed to any excessive radiation, and 12 teeth had been directly exposed to a single X-ray dose during medical treatment prior to extraction. There was no significant effect of tooth surfaces and exposure with single X-rays on the measured absorbed dose of an individual. The mean measured absorbed dose of the population is 34 +/- 6.2 mGy, with an average tooth enamel age of 39 years. From the slope of a regression line, the estimated annual background dose for Peninsular Malaysia is 0.6 +/- 0.3 mGy y(-1). This value is slightly lower than the yearly background dose for Malaysia, and the radiation background dose is established by ESR tooth measurements on samples from India and Russia.",Excluded

To provide insight into both the dynamics of the pump and the effects of MDR, we radiolabeled paclitaxel, a substrate for the Pgp pump, with (18)F to study MDR in vivo with PET. We obtained biodistribution and radiation dose estimates for (18)F-paclitaxel (FPAC) in monkeys and studied the effects of a Pgp blocker (XR9576, tariquidar) on FPAC kinetics., METHODS: Paired baseline and Pgp modulation (2 mg/kg XR9576) 4-h whole-body dynamic PET scans were obtained in 3 rhesus monkeys after injection of FPAC. Measured residence times were extrapolated to humans and radiation dose estimates were obtained using MIRDOSE3.1. The postmodulator area under the time-activity curves (AUCs) and Logan plot slopes, a measure of tracer distribution volume (equilibrium tissue-to-plasma ratio) that is inversely proportional to tracer efflux, were compared with baseline values to determine changes in FPAC distribution., RESULTS: Cumulative activities of the organs sampled accounted for 80% of the injected dose. The critical organ is gallbladder wall (0.19 mGy/MBq [0.69 rad/mCi]), followed by liver (0.14 mGy/MBq [0.52 rad/mCi]); the effective dose is 0.022 mSv/MBq (0.083 rem/mCi). XR9576 preinfusion changed the Logan plot slope for liver by +104% (P = 0.02), lung by +87% (P = 0.11), and kidney by -14% (P = 0.08). Changes in the mean AUC (normalized to the plasma AUC) were +54% (P = 0.08), +97% (P = 0.04), and -12% (P = 0.02), respectively, for liver, lung, and kidney. No significant difference was found in the metabolite-corrected plasma AUC (normalized to the injected dose) between the baseline and XR9576 modulator studies (P = 0.69)., CONCLUSION: Under Radioactive Drug Research Committee guidelines, 266 MBq (7.2 mCi) FPAC can be administered to humans up to 3 times a year. The increase in FPAC accumulation in liver and lung after XR9576 is consistent with Pgp inhibition and demonstrates the potential of FPAC to evaluate MDR.",Excluded

Patients and Methods Twenty-four consecutive octogenarians with stage I NSCLC were treated with SBRT between 2007 and 2011 at a single center. Median prescription dose was 48 Gy (range, 48-56). Follow-up clinical examination and computed tomography (CT) were performed every 2 to 3 months. Results Median age was 85 years (range, 80-89). Twenty-three (96%) patients had peripheral tumors, and median tumor size was 22 mm (range, 11-49). Tissue diagnosis was obtained in 16 (67%) patients. Median follow-up for all patients was 27.6 months (range, 4.3-61.2). The 24-month disease-free survival was 77% (95% confidence interval [CI], 61%-97%). The 24-month overall survival (OS) was 74% (95% CI, 57%-94%). No local failure (LF) was observed during the period of observation.

3730,"Reliability and validity of a telephone questionnaire for estimating lifetime personal sun exposure in epidemiologic studies Our Australia-wide case-control study of ocular melanoma diagnosed in 1996 to 1997 needed a short telephone interview on sun exposure. We constructed one by examining data from 700 controls ages 40 to 64 years in the Geraldton Skin Cancer Survey in 1988; they had answered a ""whole-of-life"" questionnaire in a face-to-face interview. Sun exposure in their first 4 decade years of age best predicted their lifetime annual average sun exposure, so the shortened questionnaire asked about sun exposure in these 4 decade years only. Retesting 60 participants 1 year later with the whole-of-life questionnaire gave an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.65 (95% confidence interval, 0.48-0.78) for ranked total sun exposure between the two interviews; the intraclass correlation coefficient was higher in men (0.73) than in women (0.54). Correlations were also high between parallel measurements of sun exposure on working days in the decade years and in outdoor occupations throughout life in the telephone interview of the ocular melanoma study (Spearman's R = 0.75) and in another study of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (R = 0.71). Agreement between simultaneous parallel measures of total exposure (nonworking + working day and recreational + occupational exposure) was slightly weaker and of nonworking day and recreational exposure much weaker. Occupational exposure in women was much less strongly correlated with total exposure than it was in men possibly because of their frequently combined work and family roles, which the questionnaires did not try to separate. Research is needed into how this might be done to improve sun exposure measurement in women.",Excluded
4676,"Volumetric bone mineral density estimation using a 3d reconstruction method from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry Volumetric BMD (vBMD) has been shown to be strongly related to bone strength and osteoporotic hip fracture. This can estimated for the femoral neck from Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) by using the projected area as: vBMD=BMC/A2 where BMC is the bone mineral content and A the projected area on the DXA image. However, such approximation cannot be used for other critical locations, such as the trochanteric and adjacent shaft region. An accurate quantification of the vBMD can be obtain from Quantitative Computed Tomoghaphy (QCT), however, this modality subjects the patient to a high radiation dose and is not as widely available as DXA central devices. In this work an estimation of the vBMD from a DXA image is presented by using a 3D reconstruction method. The reconstruction method uses a 3D statistical model, constructed from a dataset of QCT scans which describes the statistical variations in shape and BMD distribution. The 3D statistical model is registered onto the 2D DXA image of the patient so that the projection of the model matches the DXA image. The result of this reconstruction process is a patient specific volumetric reconstruction of the BMD distribution onto which the vBMD can then be extracted for specific regions. Reconstructions were subsequently obtained from the DXA images of 30 patients (15 male and 15 females with an average age of 50+/-13 years). The vBMD of the femoral neck and the trochanteric region was extracted from the reconstructions and the vBMD in the corresponding regions of the QCT scans of the same subjects were considered the ground truth. The linear correlation with the ground truth vBMD then indicates the vBMD estimation accuracy. For the trochanteric and shaft region, our method achieved a strong correlation with a correlation coefficient of 0.94 and 0.93 and a Mean Average Error (MAE) of 15.3 and 21.8mg/cm3 respectively. In addition, the proposed method resulted in a MAE of 17.2mg/cm3 and a correlation coefficient of 0.92 for the femoral neck region whereas the vBMD, estimated using the projected area, resulted in a correlation coefficient of 0.91. These results indicates that our proposed method accurately estimates the vBMD of the trochanteric, shaft and femoral neck region from DXA. This potentially allows for an improved fracture risk estimation while maintaining DXA as the current standard modality.",Excluded
4829,"Expression of activated checkpoint kinase 2 and histone 2AX in exfoliative oral cells after exposure to ionizing radiation Gamma-H2AX (activated histone 2AX) and pChk2 (activated checkpoint kinase 2), which are DNA damage response molecules, are produced in irradiated cells and may be signature molecules of radiation exposure. We investigated their use as potential biomarkers to identify individuals exposed to ionizing radiation. We collected exfoliated oral epithelial cell samples from 100 healthy individuals undergoing routine dental radiographic examination (2.34 cGy) both before and after the radiograph using a non-invasive technique. The expression levels of pChk2 and gamma-H2AX in oral cells were assessed by immunohistochemical assay. Both biomarkers showed statistically significant increases in levels of expression after the radiation exposure (P < 0.001). This suggests that pChk2 and gamma-H2AX may serve as sensitive indicators of low-dose radiation exposure.",Included
3827,"Minimally invasive radioguided parathyroidectomy We reported here the data on minimally invasive radioguided parathyroidectomy (MIRP) in a large group of 253 patients enrolled from the whole series of 355 consecutive patients affected by primary hyperparathyroidism (P-HPT) referred to our center. On the basis of preoperative imaging including Sestamibi scintigraphy and neck ultrasound (US), 263 patients (74% of the whole series) with evidence of a solitary parathyroid adenoma (PA) and a normal thyroid gland were addressed to MIRP and in 253 (96%) of them this minimally invasive neck exploration was successfully performed. The MIRP protocol developed in our center consisted of a very low 1 mCi Sestamibi injection in the operating room a few minutes before the start of intervention, thus minimizing the radiation exposure dose to the patient and personnel. No major intraoperative complication was recorded in patients treated by MIRP and only a transient hypocalcemia in 8.5% of cases. The mean duration time for MIRP was 35 min and the mean hospital stay 1.2 days. Local anesthesia was also performed in 62 patients, 54 of whom were elderly patients with concomitant invalidating diseases contraindicating general anesthesia. No HPT relapse was observed during subsequent follow-up. The gamma probe was used also during bilateral neck exploration in the group of 92 patients excluded from MIRP. The most frequent cause of exclusion from MIRP in our series was the presence of concomitant Sestamibi avid thyroid nodules (68.5% of cases) that can give false positive results at radioguided surgery. In conclusion, MIRP is an effective treatment in patients with a high likelihood of a solitary PA and a normal thyroid gland at scintigraphy and US so that an accurate preoperative localizing imaging is required for MIRP. A low 1 mCi Sestamibi dose appears sufficient to perform MIRP. Patients with concomitant Sestamibi avid thyroid nodules should be excluded from MIRP. © 2006 Elsevier SAS.

The aim of this study is to compare CEACT to POCUS for the diagnosis and staging of suspected acute diverticulitis. METHOD(S): This is a prospective study conducted on 55 patients admitted to the Emergency Department of two Italian Hospitals with a clinical suspicion of acute diverticulitis between January 2014 and December 2017. All the patients included underwent POCUS first and CEACT immediately afterwards, with the diagnosis and the staging reported according to the Hinchey (H) classification modified by Wasvary et al. Three surgeons performed all the POCUS and the same two radiologists retrospectively analyzed all the CEACT images. The radiologists were informed of the clinical suspicion but unaware of the POCUS findings. The CEACT was used as the gold standard for the comparison. RESULT(S): The final cohort included 30 (55%) females and 25 (45%) males. The median age was 62 (24-88) and the median body mass index was 26 (19-42).Forty-six out of 55 patients had a confirmed diagnosis of acute diverticulitis on both POCUS and CEACT, whereas in seven patients the diagnosis was not confirmed by both methods. POCUS sensitivity and specificity were 98% and 88% respectively. POCUS positive and negative predictive values were 98% and 88% respectively. POCUS accuracy was 96%.POCUS classified 33 H1a, 11 H1b, 1 H2 and 1 H3 acute diverticulitis. This staging was confirmed in all patients but three (93%) by CEACT. CONCLUSION(S): Point-of-care ultrasound appeared a reliable technique for the diagnosis and the staging of clinically suspected H1 and H2 acute diverticulitis. It could contribute in saving time and resources and in avoiding unnecessary radiation exposure to most patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.

4504,"Relation between quantitative coronary CTA and myocardial ischemia by adenosine stress myocardial CT perfusion Background: Coronary-computed tomography angiography (CTA) has limited accuracy to predict myocardial ischemia. Besides luminal area stenosis, other coronary plaque morphology and composition parameters may help to assess ischemia. With the integration of coronary CTA and adenosine stress CT myocardial perfusion (CTP), reliable information regarding coronary anatomy and function can be derived in one procedure. This analysis aimed to investigate the association between coronary stenosis severity, plaque composition and morphology and the presence of ischemia measured with adenosine stress myocardial CTP. Methods and Results: 84 patients (age, 62 +/- 10 years; 48% men) who underwent sequential coronary CTA and adenosine stress myocardial CT perfusion were analyzed. Automated quantification was performed in all coronary lesions (quantitative CTA). Downstream myocardial ischemia was assessed by visual analysis of the rest and stress CTP images and defined as a summed difference score of >=1. One or more coronary plaques were present in 146 coronary arteries of which 31 (21%) were ischemia-related. Of the lesions with a stenosis percentage <50%, 50%-70%, and >70%, respectively, 9% (6/67), 18% (9/51), and 57% (16/28) demonstrated downstream ischemia. Furthermore, mean plaque burden, plaque volume, lesion length, maximal plaque thickness, and dense calcium volume were significantly higher in ischemia-related lesions, but only stenosis severity (%) (OR 1.06; 95% CI 1.02-1.10; P = .006) and lesion length (mm) (OR 1.26; 95% CI 1.02-1.55; P = .029) were independent correlates. Conclusion(s): Increasing stenosis percentage by quantitative CTA is positively correlated to myocardial ischemia measured with adenosine stress myocardial CTP. However, stenosis percentage remains a moderate determinant. Lumen area stenosis and lesion length were independently associated with ischemia, adjusted for coronary plaque volume, mean plaque burden, maximal lesion thickness, and dense calcium volume.Copyright © 2016, The Author(s).",Excluded
3823,"Ewing's sarcoma and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor cells produce large quantities of bioactive tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) after radiation exposure PURPOSE: In the present study, we examined human Ewing's sarcoma (ES) and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (pPNET) cell lines that are able to produce TNF-alpha as part of the response to irradiation. Radiation-induced tumor cell production of TNF-alpha may enhance irradiation efficacy and improve the effect of local tumor irradiation. On the other hand, radiation-induced tumor cell production of TNF-alpha may adversely affect the normal tissue., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twelve different ES/pPNET cell lines were investigated in vitro and (after establishment as tumor xenografts in athymic nude mice) in vivo for their TNF-alpha mRNA expression (real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) and TNF-alpha protein production (in vitro: enhanced amplified sensitivity immunoassay; in vivo: immunohistochemistry) after exposure to different irradiation doses (2, 5, 10, 20, 30, or 40 Gy) and after different time intervals (1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, or 72 h after irradiation). The bioactivity of the TNF-alpha protein was evaluated in chromogenic cytotoxicity and neutralization assays., RESULTS: Nine out of 12 ES/pPNET cell lines express constitutively significant quantities of bioactive TNF-alpha in vitro. ES/pPNET cells originating from primary tumors secreted higher TNF-alpha levels than cells derived from metastatic lesions. In 5 of the 9 TNF-alpha-producing cell lines, TNF-alpha mRNA and protein levels were upregulated after irradiation exposure in a time- and dose-dependent manner. After establishment of the ES/pPNET cell lines in athymic nude mice, the radiation-induced TNF-alpha release could be demonstrated also in the xenograft tumors in vivo (analogous to the in vitro experiments). Using the same methods for quantitative analysis, it was determined that the TNF-alpha expression of the radiation-responsive tumor cells was up to 2000-fold higher compared to the maximal radiation-induced TNF-alpha release in normal lung tissue measured during the pneumonic phase., CONCLUSION: Certain ES/pPNET cell lines produce extremely large quantities of bioactive TNF-alpha after radiation exposure in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Radiation-induced TNF-alpha production of tumor cells may be of paramount importance in respect to not only tumor behavior, but also to potential damage to normal tissue and the clinical status of the host.",Included
4918,"Cutaneous viral infections associated with ultraviolet radiation exposure The complex interplay between ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and cutaneous viral infections in the context of cancer etiology is challenging to unravel, given the limited information on the independent association between UVR and cutaneous viral infections. Using multiple biomarkers of infection with 24 types of cutaneous human papillomavirus (HPV) and 4 types of polyomaviruses (HPyV), we investigated cross-sectional associations with recent UVR exposure, using skin pigmentation measured by spectrophotometer. Age- and sex-adjusted associations between UVR and viral seropositivity, viral DNA present in eyebrow hairs (EBH) and skin swabs (SSW) were estimated using logistic regression. Beta-HPV seropositivity was associated with viral DNA positivity in EBH (OR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.05-1.88) and SSW (OR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.25-2.74). Similar associations were observed for Merkel cell polyomavirus. Participants in the highest tertile of UVR exposure were more likely to be seropositive for beta-HPV (OR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.16-2.38), and have beta-HPV DNA in EBH (OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.06-2.33) and SSW (OR = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.25-3.96), compared to participants with the lowest tertile of UVR exposure. UVR exposure was positively associated with three different markers of beta-HPV infection. Therefore, future studies of HPV associated KC development should address more directly the role of HPV and UVR exposure as potential co-carcinogens.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

4302,"Melanocortin 1 Receptor-Targeted alpha-Particle Therapy for Metastatic Uveal Melanoma New effective therapies are greatly needed for metastatic uveal melanoma, which has a very poor prognosis with a median survival of less than 1 y. The melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) is expressed in 94% of uveal melanoma metastases, and a MC1R-specific ligand (MC1RL) with high affinity and selectivity for MC1R was previously developed. Methods: The 225Ac-DOTA-MC1RL conjugate was synthesized in high radiochemical yield and purity and was tested in vitro for biostability and for MC1R-specific cytotoxicity in uveal melanoma cells, and the lanthanum-DOTA-MC1RL analog was tested for binding affinity. Non-tumor-bearing BALB/c mice were tested for maximum tolerated dose and biodistribution. Severe combined immunodeficient mice bearing uveal melanoma tumors or engineered MC1R-positive and -negative tumors were studied for biodistribution and efficacy. Radiation dosimetry was calculated using mouse biodistribution data and blood clearance kinetics from Sprague-Dawley rat data. Results: High biostability, MC1R-specific cytotoxicity, and high binding affinity were observed. Limiting toxicities were not observed at even the highest administered activities. Pharmacokinetics and biodistribution studies revealed rapid blood clearance (<15 min), renal and hepatobillary excretion, MC1R-specific tumor uptake, and minimal retention in other normal tissues. Radiation dosimetry calculations determined pharmacokinetics parameters and absorbed alpha-emission dosages from 225Ac and its daughters. Efficacy studies demonstrated significantly prolonged survival and decreased metastasis burden after a single administration of 225Ac-DOTA-MC1RL in treated mice relative to controls. Conclusion: These results suggest significant potential for the clinical translation of 225Ac-DOTA-MC1RL as a novel therapy for metastatic uveal melanoma.

4912,"Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for tumor staging and definition of tumor volumes on radiation treatment planning in nonsmall cell lung cancer A prospective radiographic cohort study of single center clinical outcome We investigate the impact of magnetic resonance (MR) on the staging and radiotherapy planning for patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A total of 24 patients with NSCLC underwent MRI, which was fused with radiotherapy planning CT using rigid registration. Gross tumor volume (GTV) was delineated not only according to CT image alone (GTVCT), but also based on both CT and MR image (GTVCT/MR). For each patient, 2 conformal treatment plans were made according to GTVCT and GTVCT/MR, respectively. Dose-volume histograms (DVH) for lesion and normal organs were generated using both GTVCT and GTVCT/MR treatment plans. All patients were irradiated according to GTVCT/MR plan. Median volume of the GTVCT/MR and GTVCT were 105.42cm3 and 124.45cm3, respectively, and the mean value of GTVCT/MR was significantly smaller than that of GTVCT (145.71+/-145.04 vs 174.30+/-150.34, P<0.01). Clinical stage was modified in 9 patients (37.5%). The objective response rate (ORR) was 83.3% and the l-year overall survival (OS) was 87.5%. MR is a useful tool in radiotherapy treatment planning for NSCLC, which improves the definition of tumor volume, reduces organs at risk dose and does not increase the local recurrence rate.Copyright © 2017 the Author(s).

4709,"Radioiodine therapy induces dose-dependent in vivo oxidation injury: evidence by increased isoprostane 8-epi-PGF(2 alpha) UNLABELLED: 131I is the treatment of choice for differentiated thyroid cancer and hyperthyroidism. A relationship between low-density lipoprotein oxidation and radioiodine therapy-related side effects, consequently inducing increased formation of 8-epi-prostaglandin F(2 alpha) (PGF(2 alpha)) in situ, has recently been reported by several investigators. Isoprostanes, among them 8-epi-PGF(2 alpha), have been associated with increased oxidation injury due to various pathologic conditions in vivo. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible induction of oxidative stress as a consequence of (131)I therapy., METHODS: 8-epi-PGF(2 alpha) was examined in plasma, serum, and urine in 42 patients undergoing radioiodine treatment of hyperthyroidism or thyroid cancer. The 8-epi-PGF(2 alpha) levels were analyzed daily for 1 wk and thereafter at different points up to 12 wk after treatment., RESULTS: The isoprostane levels showed an increase after application of radioiodine in all investigated compartments. The effect was significantly higher and longer lasting after higher-activity therapy (2,960 or 7,400 MBq) than after lower-activity therapy (185 or 740 MBq)., CONCLUSION: These findings document a significant, dose-dependent in vivo oxidation injury as a consequence of therapeutic radioiodine application to the salivary gland.",Excluded

4397,"UVB induces epidermal 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 activity in vivo Detrimental consequences of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) in skin include photoageing, immunosuppression and photocarcinogenesis, processes also significantly regulated by local glucocorticoid (GC) availability. In man, the enzyme 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta-HSD1) generates the active GC cortisol from cortisone (or corticosterone from 11-dehydrocorticosterone in rodents). 11beta-HSD1 oxo-reductase activity requires the cofactor NADPH, generated by hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. We previously demonstrated increased 11beta-HSD1 levels in skin obtained from photoexposed versus photoprotected anatomical regions. However, the direct effect of UVR on 11beta-HSD1 expression remains to be elucidated. To investigate the cutaneous regulation of 11beta-HSD1 following UVR in vivo, the dorsal skin of female SKH1 mice was irradiated with 50, 100, 200 and 400 mJ/cm2 UVB. Measurement of transepidermal water loss, 11beta-HSD1 activity, mRNA/protein expression and histological studies was taken at 1, 3 and 7 days postexposure. 11beta-HSD1 and hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA expression peaked 1 day postexposure to 400 mJ/cm2 UVB before subsequently declining (days 3 and 7). Corresponding increases in 11beta-HSD1 protein and enzyme activity were observed 3 days postexposure coinciding with reduced GC receptor mRNA expression. Immunofluorescence studies revealed 11beta-HSD1 localization to hyperproliferative epidermal keratinocytes in UVB-exposed skin. 11beta-HSD1 expression and activity were also induced by 200 and 100 (but not 50) mJ/cm2 UVB and correlated with increased transepidermal water loss (indicative of barrier disruption). UVB-induced 11beta-HSD1 activation represents a novel mechanism that may contribute to the regulation of cutaneous responses to UVR exposure.Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

3964,"Occupational ionising radiation and risk of basal cell carcinoma in US radiologic technologists (1983-2005) OBJECTIVE: To determine risk for incident basal cell carcinoma from cumulative low-dose ionising radiation in the US radiologic technologist cohort., METHODS: We analysed 65,719 Caucasian technologists who were cancer-free at baseline (1983-1989 or 1994-1998) and answered a follow-up questionnaire (2003-2005). Absorbed radiation dose to the skin in mGy for estimated cumulative occupational radiation exposure was reconstructed for each technologist based on badge dose measurements, questionnaire-derived work history and protection practices, and literature information. Radiation-associated risk was assessed using Poisson regression and included adjustment for several demographic, lifestyle, host and sun exposure factors., RESULTS: Cumulative mean absorbed skin dose (to head/neck/arms) was 55.8 mGy (range 0-1735 mGy). For lifetime cumulative dose, we did not observe an excess radiation-related risk (excess relative risk/Gy=-0.01 (95% CI -0.43 to 0.52). However, we observed that basal cell carcinoma risk was increased for radiation dose received before age 30 (excess relative risk/Gy=0.59, 95% CI -0.11 to 1.42) and before 1960 (excess relative risk/Gy=2.92, 95% CI 1.39 to 4.45)., CONCLUSIONS: Basal cell carcinoma risk was unrelated to low-dose radiation exposure among radiologic technologists. Because of uncertainties in dosimetry and sensitivity to model specifications, both our null results and our findings of excess risk for dose received before age 30 and exposure before 1960 should be interpreted with caution.

4350,"Effects of proton pump inhibitor use on the esophageal microbial community Background: Changes in the esophageal microbiome correlate with esophageal disease, but the effects of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drugs are incompletely characterized. Our objective was to identify the effects of PPI use on the microbial community of the esophagus. Method(s): Mucosal biopsies of the distal esophagus were analyzed using a customized esophageal microbiome qPCR panel array (EMB). Patient demographics, use of PPIs, duration of use and dose were recorded. Result(s): Fifty-eight patients were included. Mean age was 60.5 years. Ninety percent (52/58) of patients were on PPIs. Mean dose was 42.7 mg. Mean duration of use was 2.5 years. The use of PPIs led to a significant difference in absolute levels of only one organism, Actinomyces, in the entire array (p < 0.01). Among patients who used proton pump inhibitors, there was no significant association between dose and absolute levels of any organism. Similarly, there was no association between duration of use and absolute levels of any organism. Conclusion(s): PPI use does not seem to cause significant changes in the distal esophageal microbial community. Future studies with larger sample sizes and esophageal pH testing should be performed to determine the level of acidity and its relationship to the microbial community.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).",Excluded
4689,"Stability and survival of bone-anchored hearing aid implant systems in post-irradiated patients Bone-anchored hearing aids (BAHAs) are based on the principle of osseointegration, which is fundamental to implant stability and survival. Previous exposure to ionising radiation may compromise this, as evidenced in relation to dental and craniofacial implants. There is a dearth of data, however, regarding BAHA implant systems in patients with previously irradiated implant sites. We sought, therefore, to investigate implant stability and survival in such patients. Patients were identified retrospectively from our electronic BAHA database. Hospital records were reviewed for demographics; operative technique; complications; and details regarding previous irradiation. Implant stability was assessed by resonance frequency analysis (RFA), generating a numerical value-implant stability quotient (ISQ). Extrapolating from dental studies, successfully loaded implants typically have ISQs of >=60. Readings were, therefore, interpreted with respect to this. Seven patients were identified for inclusion. Mean time between irradiation and implant insertion was 33 months (range 16-72 months), and mean time from implant insertion to RFA measurement was 41 months (range 3-96 months). Operatively, all patients underwent single-stage procedures under local anaesthesia. One patient suffered a Holger's grade 2 skin reaction, while two suffered significant skin flap failure, requiring revision procedures. The implant survival rate was 100 %. All ISQ values were >60, with a mean of 66.9 (95 % confidence interval 63.1-70.6). Our data support sufficient osseointegration of BAHA implant systems in post-irradiated patients, but highlight issues with wound healing. Contemporary soft tissue preservation operative techniques will likely overcome this, facilitating safe and efficacious BAHA insertion in this ever-increasing group of patients.Copyright © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
4858,"DNA double strand breaks but not interstrand crosslinks prevent progress through meiosis in fully grown mouse oocytes There is some interest in how mammalian oocytes respond to different types of DNA damage because of the increasing expectation of fertility preservation in women undergoing chemotherapy. Double strand breaks (DSBs) induced by ionizing radiation and agents such as neocarzinostatin (NCS), and interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) induced by alkylating agents such as mitomycin C (MMC), are toxic DNA lesions that need to be repaired for cell survival. Here we examined the effects of NCS and MMC treatment on oocytes collected from antral follicles in mice, because potentially such oocytes are readily collected from ovaries and do not need to be in vitro grown to achieve meiotic competency. We found that oocytes were sensitive to NCS, such that this ionizing radiation mimetic blocked meiosis I and caused fragmented DNA. In contrast, MMC had no impact on the completion of either meiosis I or II, even at extremely high doses. However, oocytes treated with MMC did show gamma-H2AX foci and following their in vitro maturation and parthenogenetic activation the development of the subsequent embryos was severely compromised. Addition of MMC to 1-cell embryos caused a similarly poor level of development, demonstrating oocytes have eventual sensitivity to this ICL-inducing agent but this does not occur during their meiotic division. In oocytes, the association of Fanconi Anemia protein, FANCD2, with sites of ICL lesions was not apparent until entry into the embryonic cell cycle. In conclusion, meiotic maturation of oocytes is sensitive to DSBs but not ICLs. The ability of oocytes to tolerate severe ICL damage and yet complete meiosis, means that this type of DNA lesion goes unrepaired in oocytes but impacts on subsequent embryo quality.",Excluded
4817,"Pre-operative botulinum toxin injection for movement disorder-induced cervical spondylosis Movement disorder is characterized by unique, unusual movements that are repetitive, and involuntary cervical motion has been well established to cause cervical spondylosis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the management of neurological and orthopedic complications in patients with movement disorder induced cervical spondylosis by botulinum toxin injection to provide immobilization of neck. In this retrospective study, 6 patients during the period from 2003 to 2010 who were diagnosed with movement disorder-induced cervical spondylosis by neurologists. Each patient received botulinum toxin injection with a total dosage of 500-600U in the sternocleidomastoid, trapezius, splenius capitis, levator scapulae one week prior to surgery. Patients' demographics, diagnoses, injected dosage of botulinum toxin, and operative methods are retrospectively collected. All patients had a repeat cervical spine X-ray to assess the fusion and integrity of the construct. The clinical outcomes were assessed by using modified Rankin scale (mRS). The duration of follow-up was measured from the date of operation to the date of the last clinic visit. The mean age of our patients was 47.2 years ranging from 31 to 64 years. There was a male gender predilection with a male/female ratio of 4:2. The causing diseases prior to cervical spondylosis in our six patients were as follows: cerebral palsy in 3 patients, spasmodic torticollis in 2, and tardive dyskinesia in 1. At the mean follow-up of 56.5 months, all patients had improvement in their daily activities, and the average ratio of improvement in mRS was 41%. Cervical spine X-ray series showed no evidence of implant failure in any of the patients. Intramuscular injection of botulinum toxin provided post-operative immobilization of the neck for treatment of movement disorder-induced cervical spondylosis. These patients need long-term follow up for monitoring of adjacent segmental degeneration. © 2011 JMS.",Excluded
4683,"Multi-phase rotational angiography of the left ventricle to assist ablations: feasibility and accuracy of novel imaging AIMS: Interventional left ventricular (LV) procedures integrating static 3D anatomy visualization are subject to mismatch with dynamic catheter movements due to prominent LV motion. We aimed to evaluate the accuracy of a recently developed acquisition and post-processing protocol for low radiation dose LV multi-phase rotational angiography (4DRA) in patients., METHODS AND RESULTS: 4DRA image acquisition of the LV was performed as investigational acquisition in patients undergoing left-sided ablation (11 men; BMI = 24.7 +/- 2.5 kg/m2). Iodine contrast was injected in the LA, while pacing from the RA at a cycle length of 700 ms. 4DRA acquisition and reconstruction were possible in all 11 studies. Reconstructed images were post-processed using streak artefact reduction algorithms and an interphase registration-based filtering method, increasing contrast-to-noise ratio by a factor 8.2 +/- 2.1. This enabled semi-automatic segmentation, yielding LV models of five equidistant phases per cardiac cycle. For evaluation, off-line 4DRA fluoroscopy registration was performed, and the 4DRA LV contours of the different phases were compared with the contours of five corresponding phases of biplane LV angiography, acquired in identical circumstances. Of the distances between these contours, 95% were <4 mm in both incidences. Effective radiation dose for 4DRA, calculated by patient-specific Monte-Carlo simulation, was 5.1 +/- 1.1 mSv., CONCLUSION: Creation of 4DRA LV models in man is feasible at near-physiological heart rate and with clinically acceptable radiation dose. They showed high accuracy with respect to LV angiography in RAO and LAO. The presented technology not only opens perspectives for full cardiac cycle dynamic anatomical guidance during interventional procedures, but also for 3DRA without need for very rapid pacing.

Patient demographics, radiographic accuracy, and perioperative outcomes were recorded and compared. The accuracy of pedicle screw placement was according to the Gertzbein and Robbins scale and facet joint violation. Perioperative outcomes mainly included operative time, radiation exposure, and revisions., RESULTS: Of the 176 screws in the RA group, 164 screws were grade A, and 9, 2, and 1 screws were grades B, C, and D, respectively. Of the 204 screws in the FG group, 175 screws were grade A, with 16 screws scored as grade B, 8 screws scored as grade C, 3 screws scored as grade D, and 2 screws scored as grade E. The rate of perfect screw position (grade A) was higher in the RA group than in the FG group (93.2% vs. 85.8%, respectively; P = 0.020). In the FG group, 191 screws (93.6%) were clinically acceptable (groups A and B), whereas more acceptable screw positions were achieved in the RA group (98.3%; P = 0.024). Fewer screws in the RA group violated the proximal facet joint (5 vs. 24 screws, respectively; P = 0.001). The radiation dose was lower in the RA group (25.9 +/- 14.2 vs. 70.5 +/- 27.3 muSv, respectively; P < 0.001). Two screws in the FG group required a revision, but no revision was required in the RA group., CONCLUSIONS: RA pedicle screw placement is an accurate and safe procedure in TLIF for lumbar degenerative disease.

We developed and field tested a brief, video-based patient decision aid about lung cancer screening., METHODS: Smokers in a cancer center tobacco treatment program aged 45 to 75 years viewed the video online between November 2011 and September 2012. Acceptability, knowledge, and clarity of values related to the decision were assessed., RESULTS: Fifty-two patients completed the study (mean age=58.5 years; mean duration smoking=34.8 years). Acceptability of the aid was high. Most patients (78.8%) indicated greater interest in screening after viewing the aid. Knowledge about lung cancer screening increased significantly as a result of viewing the aid (25.5% of questions answered correctly before the aid, and 74.8% after; P<.01) although understanding of screening eligibility remained poor. Patients reported being clear about which benefits and harms of screening mattered most to them (94.1% and 86.5%, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: Patients have high information needs related to lung cancer screening.

4331,"Critical analysis of lumbar interspinous devices failures: A retrospective study Interspinous devices (IDs) were introduced in the 90s. Since then, they have rapidly become very popular for the minimally invasive treatment of lumbar pain disorders. They feature different shapes and biomechanical characteristics, and are used in the spine degenerative pathologies or as motion segment stabilizers (dynamic stabilization) or to obtain the decompression of neurological structures. The indications seem to be rather narrow and still to be verified in terms of their clinical efficacy. However, IDs are being extensively utilized beyond their classical indications with the inevitable risk of a clinical failure. The aim of the present work was to carry out a critical analysis of the causes of failure in a series of 19 patients. From January 2007 to March 2009, 19 patients with residual painful syndrome after the implantation of IDs were observed. The series includes 11 males and 8 females with a mean age of 53.6 years (range 38-84 years) who were operated on elsewhere and who underwent revision surgery at our hospital. The inclusion criteria were low back pain and/or radiculopathy after the device implantation without improvement of the painful symptomatology, radiculopathy with signs of sensory and motor deficit, intermittent neurogenic claudication, and infection. All patients were thoroughly re-assessed with new standard imaging examinations such as MRI and CT scans, considering the following image features: the position of the device with respect to the spinous processes (X-ray), the intervertebral disc disease of the level operated upon or of the adjacent levels (MRI), the segmental instability (dynamic X-rays), the severity of the canal stenosis (CT). The accurate evaluation of the clinical and imaging parameters revealed three main causes of failure: errors of indication, technical errors and the structural failure of the ID. The most frequent cause of failure was a wrong indication. The results of the study are presented and the causes of failure are discussed in detail. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Excluded

Heliotherapy (HT) may heal atopic dermatitis (AD) but its effect on vitamin D balance has not been examined., OBJECTIVES: To study the effect of HT on serum calcidiol (25-hydroxyvitamin D) concentration and on healing of AD., METHODS: Twenty-three adult patients with AD received a 2-week course of HT in the Canary Islands in either January or March 2005. Daily solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation was measured and personal UV exposure calculated as standard erythema doses (SED). Blood samples were taken during HT and during a 1-2 month follow-up. Serum calcidiol concentration was measured by radioimmunoassay. Healing of AD was examined by SCORAD index., RESULTS: Before HT 17 (74%) AD patients had vitamin D insufficiency (calcidiol < 50 nmol L(-1)) and four patients high (> 80 nmol L(-1)) serum calcidiol values. The median personal UV dose during the 2-week HT course was 60 SED in the January group and 109 SED in the March group. Serum calcidiol concentration increased significantly in both groups, by 13.4 and 24.0 nmol/L(-1), respectively, and after HT only four (17%) patients had vitamin D insufficiency. SCORAD improved from 34 to 9 in the January HT group and from 30 to 9 in the March group., CONCLUSIONS: A 2-week course of HT significantly improved vitamin D balance by increasing serum calcidiol concentration, and caused a marked healing of AD. These parallel positive responses should be taken into account when the benefits of HT are considered.",Excluded
4282,"Effect of fluoroscopic X-rays combined with iodinated radiographic contrast media on human hematological parameters Introduction: Fluoroscopic X-rays are widely used for examinations around the world. Technicians often use an iodinated radiographic contrast media during fluoroscopic X-ray examinations. Objective(s): This study examined the impact on hematological parameters for human blood and morphology of red blood cells that were exposed to fluoroscopic X-ray combined with iodinated radiographic contrast media, i.e., iopromid, iohexol, and iodixanol. Method(s): Blood samples from male and female subjects were incubated with 5 mgI/mL of iodinated radiographic contrast media for 5 min, then were irradiated using fluoroscopic X-rays (70 kV, 0.8 mA) for 10, 30, and 60 min. Hematological parameters of the blood samples were determined by a clinical service center, and morphology of red blood cells was examined by light microscope. Comparison of mean values of hematological parameters based on the student's t-tests between irradiated blood alone, iodinated radiographic contrast media-incubated blood alone, and combination-exposed blood to each corresponding control blood was performed. Result(s): These data showed no change in the hematological parameters and morphology of red blood cells in irradiated blood alone, iodinated radiographic contrast media-incubated blood alone, and combination-exposed blood in both male and female subjects when compared to control blood at all fluoroscopic X-ray times. Conclusion(s): These finding suggested that there were no harmful effects following fluoroscopic X-rays combined with iodinated radiographic contrast media when human blood was irradiated in an in vitro condition.Copyright © 2021, Korean Society of Environmental Risk Assessment and Health Science.",Included
4270,"Salivary gland cancer in the United States The risk of salivary gland cancer (SGC) is increased in atomic bomb survivors and after radiotherapy, but other risk factors are not well established. Some studies have suggested an association of SGC with breast cancer and with exposure to various viruses or UVB radiation. Corroborating evidence of these associations was sought by using population-based registries to examine the demographic distribution of SGC, patterns of secondary primary cancers after SGC, and risk of SGC with AIDS. SGC incidence per 100,000 persons did not change between 1973 and 1992, averaging 1.2 in males and 0.8 in females, with a steep age gradient. To examine the relationship between UVB exposure and SGC, population-based, age-adjusted incidence rates of SGC were plotted against the UVB insolation of each registry site. Regression analysis suggested no correlation between SGC incidence and increasing UVB insolation (beta = 0.10, R2 = 0.08). SGC also did not appear to be associated with second cancers that have been linked to herpes or papilloma viruses or with AIDS [observed/expected (O/E) ratio, <2.8], but all of these conditions are so uncommon that only very large relative risks would have been statistically significant. Women with SGC before age 35 had a statistically nonsignificant elevation in breast cancer risk [O/E, 3.30; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.66-9.65], and older women had no increased risk of breast cancer. SGC patients were at increased risk for nonsalivary, second-primary oropharyngeal cancers (O/E, 3.27; 95% CI, 2.00-5.05), thyroid cancer (O/E, 3.31; 95% CI, 1,07-7.73), and lung cancer (O/E, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.45-2.35), particularly in patients whose SGC was treated with radiotherapy (O/E, 2.83; 95% CI, 2.06-3.80). In summary, SGC remains rare and does not appear to be associated with AIDS, virally related malignancies, or UVB. Patients who have had SGC, however, should be monitored for subsequent oropharyngeal, thyroid, and lung cancers.",Excluded
3988,"Tumor accumulation of NIR fluorescent PEG-PLA nanoparticles: impact of particle size and human xenograft tumor model Cancer therapies are often terminated due to serious side effects of the drugs. The cause is the nonspecific distribution of chemotherapeutic agents to both cancerous and normal cells. Therefore, drug carriers which deliver their toxic cargo specific to cancer cells are needed. Size is one key parameter for the nanoparticle accumulation in tumor tissues. In the present study the influence of the size of biodegradable nanoparticles was investigated in detail, combining in vivo and ex vivo analysis with comprehensive particle size characterizations. Polyethylene glycol-polyesters poly(lactide) block polymers were synthesized and used for the production of three defined, stable, and nontoxic near-infrared (NIR) dye-loaded nanoparticle batches. Size analysis based on asymmetrical field flow field fractionation coupled with multiangle laser light scattering and photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) revealed narrow size distribution and permitted accurate size evaluations. Furthermore, this study demonstrates the constraints of particle size data only obtained by PCS. By the multispectral analysis of the Maestro in vivo imaging system the in vivo fate of the nanoparticles next to their accumulation in special red fluorescent DsRed2 expressing HT29 xenografts could be followed. This simultaneous imaging in addition to confocal microscopy studies revealed information about the accumulation characteristics of nanoparticles inside the tumor tissues. This knowledge was further combined with extended size-dependent fluorescence imaging studies at two different xenograft tumor types, the HT29 (colorectal carcinoma) and the A2780 (ovarian carcinoma) cell lines. The combination of two different size measurement methods allowed the characterization of the dependence of nanoparticle accumulation in the tumor on even rather small differences in the nanoparticle size. While two nanoparticle batches (111 and 141 nm in diameter) accumulated efficiently in the human xenograft tumor tissue, the slightly bigger nanoparticles (diameter 166 nm) were rapidly eliminated by the liver.

4747,"A novel aldehyde dehydrogenase-3 activator (Alda-89) protects submandibular gland function from irradiation without accelerating tumor growth Purpose: To determine the effect of Alda-89 (an ALDH3 activitor) on (i) the function of irradiated (radiotherapy) submandibular gland (SMG) in mice, (ii) its toxicity profile, and (iii) its effect on the growth of head and neck cancer (HNC) in vitro and in vivo. Experimental Design: Adult mice were infused with Alda-89 or vehicle before, during, and after radiotherapy. Saliva secretion was monitored weekly. Hematology, metabolic profile, and postmortem evaluation for toxicity were examined at the time of sacrifice. Alda-89 or vehicle was applied toHNCcell lines in vitro, and severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice transplanted with HNC in vivo with or without radiation; HNC growth was monitored. The ALDH3A1 and ALDH3A2 protein expression was evaluated in 89 patients with HNC and correlated to freedom from relapse (FFR) and overall survival (OS). Result(s): Alda-89 infusion significantly resulted in more whole saliva production and a higher percentage of preserved acini after radiotherapy compared with vehicle control. There was no difference in the complete blood count, metabolic profile, and major organ morphology between the Alda-89 and vehicle groups. Compared with vehicle control, Alda-89 treatment neither accelerated HNC cell proliferation in vitro, nor did it affect tumor growth in vivo with or without radiotherapy. Higher expression of ALDH3A1 orALDH3A2 was not significantly associated with worse FFR or OS in either human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive or HPV-negative group. Conclusion(s): Alda-89 preserves salivary function after radiotherapy without affecting HNC growth or causing measurable toxicity in mice. It is a promising candidate to mitigate radiotherapy-related xerostomia. © 2013 American Association for Cancer Research.",Excluded
4500,"Posterior capsule opacification severity, assessed with straylight measurement, as main indicator of early visual function deterioration PURPOSE: To study the effect of posterior capsule opacification (PCO) morphology and severity on different aspects of visual function (VF): the small-angle domain (visual acuity [VA], contrast sensitivity [CS]) and large-angle domain (straylight; logarithm of the straylight parameter s [log{s}]). To evaluate whether straylight is a valuable additional indicator for appropriate posterior capsulotomy referral., DESIGN: Prospective, comparative study., PARTICIPANTS AND CONTROLS: For the study population, 240 pseudophakic eyes with PCO and a capsulotomy indication were selected. For the reference population, 99 pseudophakic eyes without PCO were selected., METHODS: The relation between PCO morphology and PCO severity and the precapsulotomy and postcapsulotomy logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR), logarithm of CS (log[CS]), and log(s) values were determined. The PCO severity was assessed with retroillumination using evaluation of posterior capsule opacification (EPCO) software. Precapsulotomy logMAR and log(s) values were used to predict functionally significant logMAR and log(s) improvement after capsulotomy., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The logMAR, log(CS), and log(s) improvements of >=0.20 log units were considered functionally significant (i.e., treatment effect). Precapsulotomy logMAR and log(s) values, above which a treatment effect (improvement>=0.20 log units) can be expected with >=50% probability, were determined and called cutoff values., RESULTS: Postcapsulotomy VF improvement was related to precapsulotomy VF values: Postcapsulotomy improvement was largest in cases with substantially impaired precapsulotomy VF parameters. Visual function deterioration was related to PCO severity rather than PCO morphology. The PCO severity (EPCO score) assessed with retroillumination has a progressive, linear relation with log(s) and a curvilinear relation with logMAR. Reflected light examination is expected to overestimate functional PCO severity. The precapsulotomy cutoff value was >=1.44 for log(s) and >=0.21 for logMAR., CONCLUSIONS: The linear relation between retroillumination PCO severity and log(s) indicates that log(s) is sensitive to low PCO severity, whereas the curvilinear relation between PCO severity and logMAR indicates that logMAR is unaffected by low PCO severity. Straylight is a sensitive, additional indicator for capsulotomy referral, especially in less severe cases of PCO. In ophthalmic practice, the precapsulotomy log(s) cutoff value of 1.44 can be used as an indicator for beneficial capsulotomy referral., FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE(S): The author(s) have no proprietary or commercial interest in any materials discussed in this article.

4482,"Treatment of postherpetic trigeminal neuralgia with the gamma knife Object. Postherpetic neuralgia is a syndrome characterized by intractable pain. Treatment of this pain has not yet been successful. Patients with postherpetic neuralgia will therefore benefit from any progress in the treatment strategy. The authors performed gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS) as a noninvasive treatment for postherpetic trigeminal neuralgia (TN) and evaluated the success rate for pain relief. Methods. Between 1995 and February 1999, six men and 10 women were treated for postherpetic TN; conservative treatment failed in all of them. The median follow up was 33 months (range 8-34 months). The radiation was focused on the root of the trigeminal nerve in the vicinity of the brainstem (maximal dose 70-80 Gy in one fraction, 4-mm collimator). The patients were divided into five groups according to degree of pain relief after treatment. A successful result (excellent, very good, and good) was reached in seven (44%) patients and radiosurgery failed in nine (56%). Pain relief occurred after a median interval of 1 month (range 10 days-6 months). No radiation-related side effects have been observed in these patients. Conclusions. These results suggest that GKS for postherpetic TN is a relatively successful and safe method that can be used in patients even if they are in poor condition. In case this method fails, other treatment options including other neurosurgical procedures are not excluded.",Excluded
4218,"The use of a comprehensive tumour xenograft dataset to validate gene signatures relevant for radiation response PURPOSE: To investigate the use of xenograft models in a novel gene signature validation method using gene expression microarrays., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gene expression profiles of ten human Head and Neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) were obtained. Several published prognostic gene expression signatures were evaluated within this set. These consisted of different radiotherapy relevant signatures (i.e. for hypoxia, proliferation and 'stemness'). Signatures were correlated with various endpoints that have been determined in the ten different xenograft models. These include immunohistochemical measures for hypoxia and proliferation, volume doubling time (VDT) and local tumour control after fractionated irradiation or after single dose irradiation under clamp hypoxia., RESULTS: We found several significant correlations between the published gene expression signatures and tumour parameters. Several signatures, like the proliferation and wound signature correlated with BrdU labelling index. Further a 'stemness'-related gene signature showed a strong negative correlation with hypoxic fraction., CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous assessment of immunohistochemistry, in vivo tumour properties and gene expression profiling in a comprehensive set of xenograft models can be used to validate and potentially infer biological information about prognostic gene signatures.",Excluded
4498,"Multifraction radiotherapy for palliation of painful bone metastases: 20 Gy versus 30 Gy Aims and Background: To compare 2 multifraction radiotherapy schedules in the palliation of painful bone metastases. Methods and Study design: We retrospectively analyzed clinical data of 105 patients with a total of 140 painful bone metastases who were treated with 20 Gy in 5 fractions or 30 Gy in 10 fractions. The primary tumors were breast (30%), lung (28%), and prostate (14%). The main sites of irradiation were spine (n = 79) and sacrum or pelvis (n = 39). Pain was graded by patients according to the pain numeric rating scale just before and 1 month after radiotherapy. Pain progression was defined as an increase .2 on pain scale after an initial response. Result(s): The overall response rate at 1 month was 88.6%. Overall response rate was 89.6% in the 20-Gy arm and 87.3% in the 30-Gy arm (p = 0.669). The rate of complete response was statistically better in patients treated with 30 Gy (p = 0.019). The mean reduction in pain was 3.2 in the 20-Gy group and 3.6 in the 30-Gy group. Pain progression was 6.5% and 1.6%, respectively. The incidence of acute toxicity was statistically significantly higher in the 30-Gy arm (23.8%) than in the 20-Gy arm (2.6%) (p = 0.001). One pathologic fracture of the irradiated bone was observed in the 30-Gy arm. Two lesions, one in each group, were re-irradiated for pain recurrence. Pain progression was found in 6.5% of the irradiated lesions in the 20-Gy arm and in 1.6% in the 30-Gy arm. Conclusion(s): In our series, both regimens achieved high rate of pain relief, although the group treated with higher total dose reported better complete response rate. The 30-Gy arm had a significantly higher rate of acute toxicity.Copyright © 2015 INTM, Italy. Published by Wichtig Publishing.",Excluded
4390,"Stereotactic radiosurgery of small intracranial tumors: neuropathological correlation in three patients The mechanism by which radiosurgery can stop the growth of some tumors is poorly understood, in part because postmortem neuropathological findings in patients have been reported only rarely. To define further the effects of radiosurgery, we present the correlation among clinical, neuroimaging, and neuropathological data in three patients with different intracranial tumors who died between 2 and 39 weeks after radiosurgery. The target volumes in two patients with malignant tumors showed sharply demarcated coagulative necrosis. In the third patient, who had a benign acoustic nerve tumor, neuropathological examination found intratumoral hemorrhage and cyst formation, but no necrosis. Radiosurgery appears to cause acute necrosis of malignant cells, although its effectiveness may be limited by the infiltrative nature of some tumors. In benign tumors, necrosis following radiosurgery is relatively delayed, and may not be required for growth arrest.",Excluded

Method(s): We determined the genotype and allele distributions of rs1800469 (C-509T), rs1800470 (C869T), rs189037 (A-111G), and rs373759 (126713 G>A) in 141 Han Chinese patients who underwent definitive thoracic radiotherapy (50 to 77 Gy, 5 days/wk) for lung cancer (small cell or non-small cell tumors, n = 97), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC, n = 27), or mediastinal cancer (n = 17). Clinical variables were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression models to calculate the relative risk of RP associated with the clinical variables, and a Pearson correlation analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between the SNP genotypes and alleles and the incidence of RP for the various risk factors. Result(s): The T alleles of rs1800470 (CT/TT) and rs1800469 (CT/TT) and the G allele of rs189037 (GA/GG) were associated with the risk of >= grade-2 RP in the ESCC patients (P = 0.0006, P = 0.0127, and P = 0.0412, respectively), and that the A alleles of rs189037 (AG/AA) and rs373759 (AG/AA) were associated with the risk of >= grade-2 RP in the patients with mediastinal cancer (P = 0.0063 and P = 0.0003, respectively). None of the SNP genotypes were associated with the risk of RP in lung cancer patients. Conclusion(s): The T alleles of the rs1800470 (CT/TT) and rs1800469 (CT/TT) SNPs of TGFbeta1 and the G allele of the rs189037 (GA/GG) SNP of ATM are independent risk factors for RP in Chinese ESCC patients, and the A alleles of the rs189037 (AG/AA) and rs373759 (AG/AA) SNPs of ATM are independent risk factors for RP in Chinese patients with mediastinal cancer. These SNPs might represent useful biomarkers for personalizing radiotherapy regimens for Chinese patients with ESCC or mediastinal cancer to reduce the incidence of RP.

4893,"Computed tomography-guided interstitial 125iodine seed brachytherapy as a salvage therapy for recurrent spinal bone metastases after radiotherapy Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of permanent 125I seed interstitial brachytherapy in patients with recurrent spinal bone metastases under CT guidance. Material(s) and Method(s): From November 2010 to November 2015, 17 patients who met the inclusion criteria were retrospectively reviewed. There were 12 men and 5 women with a median age of 56 years (range 24-83 years). There were 10 lung carcinomas, 4 esophagus carcinomas , 1 liver cancer, 1 breast cancer, and 1 kidney carcinoma . 6 had squamous cell carcinoma, 8 were adenocarcinoma, 3 others respectively. All patients suffered varying degrees of pain before seed implantation, ranging from 1 to 9 on the NRS. Mean NRS scores before implantation was 6.88 +/- 2.25 respectively. Regarding neurologic function, 2 grade Bs, 2 grade Cs, 3 grade Ds and 10 grade Es. All patients with recurrent spinal bone metastases had received conventional EBRT. During the procedure, patients remained in a prone position to facilitate CT guidance. We measured the pedicle angle and the distance of the puncture point. The depth of the puncture point to the pedicle was also borne in mind. Needles were inserted through the anterior portion of the lateral images, in the interval between the pedicle and the vertebral body, or with a pedicle or paraspinal approach, respectively. Seeds were implanted 1.0 cm from the spinal cord, to minimize radiation damage. Immediately after the procedure, a CT scan was obtained to confirm the location of the seeds in case of any need for supplementary implantation. The number of 125I seeds implanted ranged from 18 to 62 (median 30) with specific activity of 0.5-0.8 mCi (median 0.75 mCi). The post-plan showed that the actuarial D90 of 125I seeds were 60.5-154 Gy(median 106 Gy). The follow-up period ranged from 1 to 59 months (median 7 months). The local control rate was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): For all patients, the 1-,2-year overall survival rates were 74.8%, 49.8%, respectively, with a median of 15 months (range, 1-59 months), the 1-, 2-year local control rates were 54.1%, 36.1%, respectively, with a median of 14 months (range, 1-59 months).

We investigated structural brain changes following long-term head-down tilt bed rest as a spaceflight analog., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Volumetric analysis was performed on structural pre- and post-bed rest brain MR images., RESULTS: Comparing post-bed rest to pre-bed rest images, we found the following: 1) no significant group differences in GM, WM, CSF, or ventricular volumes; 2) shift of the center of mass of the brain upward and posterior rotation of the brain relative to the skull; 3) a significant correlation between posterior brain rotation and changes in ventricular volume; and 4) significant increases in brain tissue density in regions at the vertex, including the frontoparietal lobes, with contraction of adjacent extra-axial CSF spaces, and significant decreases in tissue density in areas along the base of the brain, including the orbitofrontal cortex., CONCLUSIONS: We observed widespread morphologic changes with brain tissue redistribution in response to gravity changes; possible associated functional changes are unknown. The observation that ventricular change is correlated to posterior brain rotation suggests an alteration in CSF homeostasis. Ultimately, to elucidate any structural changes that may play a role in visual impairment and intracranial pressure syndrome, volumetric analysis of pre- and postflight structural scans of astronauts is needed.

4743,"'Glowing in the dark': A study of radiation received by desmoid patients undergoing multiple CT scans Aim: Patients with FAP related intra-abdominal desmoid disease undergo multiple CT scans of abdomen, pelvis, and sometimes chest to monitor the response to treatment and assess the possibility of recurrent or new tumors. CT is generally preferred to MRI because of the better quality and more easily interpretable images. However there is concern about the cumulative dose of radiation associated with multiple CT scans. This retrospective study, was performed to assess the radiation exposure of FAP desmoid patients related to CT scans Method: Patients with intra-abdominal desmoid disease related to FAP managed in our department were accessed. The number of abdominal/ pelvic and chest CTs from the time of desmoid diagnosis to the last imaging follow-up was totaled. When available, the radiation dose was obtained, when not, an average dose was applied. Patient demographics and the worst stage of the desmoid disease were noted. In this study we report only the 22 patients with more than 13 CT scans over the time of follow-up Results: There were 22 patients 7 men and 15 women, with a mean age at desmoids diagnosis of 28.4 +/- 1.0 years. Three desmoids were Stage II, 7 were stage III and 12 were stage IV. Mean follow-up was 111 months (median 107, range 34-215). The mean total number of abdominal/pelvic CT scans was 28 (median 31, range 14-42) and chest CT scans was 4.8 (median 3.5, range 0-18). The mean frequency of scans was every 4.5 months (median 3.9, range every 1 month to every 12 months). The mean cumulative dose of radiation associated with abdominal/pelvic CTs was 491 mGy*cm, equivalent to 491 mSv (0.491Sv). The highest dose in a patient with a stage IV desmoid receiving 42 CT scans over 10.5 years was 574 mSv (0.57Sv). 1 Sv is associated with a 0.055% chance of cancer. The additional dose associated with Chest CT was a mean of 265 mSv (0.26 Sv) Conclusion(s): In patients with advanced abdominal desmoid disease, the total dose of radiation accumulated over a mean of 9 years follow up is significant in terms of predisposing to cancer. This should encourage the use of alternative forms of imaging such as MRI or at least a less frequent use of CT scans.",Excluded
4562,"A single-institution phase I feasibility study of dose-escalated IMRT for non-operative locally advanced esophageal carcinoma Background and purpose: Radiation dose escalation to improve poor outcomes with chemoradiation in locally advanced esophageal carcinoma is limited in part by increased toxicity. This Phase I study investigates the use of IMRT to improve tolerability of dose escalation. Material(s) and Method(s): A single-institution, prospective study was conducted between 2007 and 2013 for individuals with inoperable esophageal carcinoma. Gross disease received 60 Gy in 30 fractions and at-risk sites received 54 Gy with simultaneous integrated boost. Concurrent chemotherapy primarily consisted of cisplatin/5-FU. The primary objective was to assess feasibility (<15% rate of grade 4-5 toxicity). Secondary objectives included assessment of overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), and locoregional (LRR) and distant recurrence. Result(s): Twenty-six patients were enrolled with median follow up of 17.6 months (range 0.1 to 152.0). The majority were AJCC 7th edition Stage III (54%), distal esophagus primary (81%), and adenocarcinoma histology (85%). Twenty-one patients (81%) completed their course of radiation therapy, while only 55% received 2 cycles of concurrent cisplatin/5-FU. One grade 5 and one grade 4 cardiac event occurred, both during chemoradiation and before receiving 50 Gy. The 3-year OS was 48.6% (95% CI: 32.5 to 72.2%) and PFS was 28.5% (95% CI: 14.6 to 55.5%).

4326,"Interaural intensity difference and ear advantage in listening to dichotic consonant-vowel syllable pairs The right-ear advantage (REA) is typically observed in verbal dichotic listening, indicating a left hemisphere superiority for speech processing. The REA could be thought of as a bottom-up, stimulus-driven laterality effect, caused by the preponderance of the contralateral neural fibers from the right ear to the auditory/speech processing areas in the left temporal lobe. The REA can, however, be modified by explicitly requiring the listeners to focus their attention alternatively on the left or right-ear stimuli, thus either countering or enhancing the bottom-up processes through top-down attentional control. In the present study, we manipulated the strength of the bottom-up REA by inducing an intensity difference between the right-ear and left-ear speech inputs in order to make the REA either weaker (left-ear input>right-ear input) or stronger (left-ear input<right-ear input) and also examined how this manipulation affected the top-down attention modulation effects. Twenty healthy participants listened to dichotic presentations of consonant-vowel syllable pairs with different attention instructions. The results showed that the interaural intensity difference significantly affected the ear advantage in the predicted way. It also interacted with the top-down control effects, attentional control having a stronger effect when attending to the ear that had a weaker sound intensity, as compared to when the intensities were equal.",Excluded

Method(s): A total of 480 patients undergoing single-level PELD performed by eight junior trainees were included. The trainees were divided into two groups based on whether they had previous SNRB experience (group A, yes; group B, no). Surgical proficiency was defined as total operation time less than 65 minutes and cumulative radiation exposure time no more than 40 seconds. The learning curve was analyzed by cumulative summation (CUSUM) test. Clinical evaluations included Macnab classification, visual analog scale (VAS)-low back score, VAS-leg score, and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Follow-up information at 12 months was also obtained. Result(s): Integral number of cases before achieving an acceptable surgical level in group A (47.75 +/- 2.50 cases) was significantly smaller than that in group B (56.50 +/- 1.29 cases, p < 0.05), along with less accumulated failure (18.75 +/- 0.96 cases vs. 25.50 +/- 1.75 cases, p < 0.05). The two groups were comparable in clinical outcomes. Forty-seven cases of complications were observed, with 17 in group A and 30 in group B (p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Previous experience of SNRB improved the performance of PELD with shorter operation time and less radiation exposure. SNRB practice may reduce the complication rate without a significant effect on the recurrence of symptoms and reoperation.Copyright © 2020, SICOT aisbl.",Excluded

We hypothesized that anal cancer treatment would result in detrimental effects on SF, QOL, and mood., MATERIALS/METHODS: We prospectively surveyed patients with anal cancer treated with definitive CRT. We assessed SF for women with the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and for men with the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). For all patients, we assessed QOL using EORTC QLQ-C30 and CR29 and mood using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). We reported descriptive statistics for SF, QOL, and mood and used univariate analysis to evaluate predictors of SF for women., RESULTS: Of 50 eligible patients, 84% completed the surveys. Median time from RT until survey was 36 months (1-97 months). Women (n = 34) reported poor SF overall (mean FSFI score = 15, scale 2-36, standard deviation (SD) 10.4). Most women reported poor SF related to satisfaction, desire, orgasm, arousal, pain, and lubrication. Men (n = 8) also had poor overall satisfaction (mean IIEF score = 6.1, scale 2-10, SD 3.6). Men reported poor erectile function and lower satisfaction with intercourse. Mean QLQ-C30 QOL score was 86.5 (SD 16.3). Results from EORTC QLQ-CR-20 demonstrated patients experienced poor sexual interest. Per HADS, 2.5% reported depression and 18% anxiety., CONCLUSION: Patients with anal cancer experience sexual dysfunction after RT, with QOL and mood symptoms similar to patients with other cancers. Our data support the need for ongoing efforts to understand and address issues with SF, QOL, and mood following RT for these patients.",Excluded
4376,"Evaluation of S100B in the diagnosis of suspected intracranial hemorrhage after minor head injury in patients who are receiving platelet aggregation inhibitors and in patients 65 years of age and older OBJECT: Cranial CT (CCT) scans and hospital admission are increasingly performed to rule out intracranial hemorrhage in patients after minor head injury (MHI), particularly in older patients and in those receiving antiplatelet therapy. This leads to high radiation exposure and a growing financial burden. The aim of this study was to determine whether the astroglial-derived protein S100B that is released into blood can be used as a reliable negative predictive tool for intracranial bleeding in patients after MHI, when they are older than 65 years or being treated with antiplatelet drugs (low-dose aspirin, clopidogrel)., METHODS: The authors conducted a prospective observational study in 2 trauma hospitals. A total of 782 patients with MHI (Glasgow Coma Scale Score 13-15) who were on medication with platelet aggregation inhibitors (PAIs) or were age 65 years and older, independent of antiplatelet therapy, were included. Clinical examination, bloodwork, observation, and CCT were performed in the traumatology emergency departments. When necessary, patients were admitted and observation took place on the ward; in these patients, CCT was performed during their hospital stay. Patients with severe trauma, focal neurological deficits, posttraumatic seizures, anticoagulant therapy, alcohol intoxication, coagulation disorder, blood sampling more than 3 hours after trauma, and unknown time of the trauma were excluded from the study. The median age of the patients was 83 years, and 69% were female. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of S100B with reference to CCT findings were calculated. The cutoff of S100B was set at 0.105 mug/L., RESULTS: Of the 782 patients, 50 (6.4%) had intracranial bleeding. One patient with positive results on CCT scan showed an S100B level below 0.105 mug/L. Of all patients, 33.1% were below the cutoff. S100B showed a sensitivity of 98.0% (CI 89.5%-99.7%), a negative predictive value of 99.6% (CI 97.9%-99.9%), a specificity of 35.3% (CI 31.9%- 38.8%), and a positive predictive value of 9.4% (CI 7.2%-12.2%)., CONCLUSIONS: Levels of S100B below 0.105 mug/L can accurately predict normal CCT findings after MHI in older patients and in those treated with PAIs. Combining conventional decision criteria with measurement of S100B can reduce the CCT scan and hospital admission rates by approximately 30%.",Excluded
4850,"Prevalence of anxiety in patients awaiting diagnostic procedures in an oncology center in Brazil Objective: Anxiety disorders have been shown to undermine the quality of life of cancer patients. Unfortunately, medical professionals often neglect to screen for anxiety in their patients. The aim of the present study was to describe the prevalence of anxiety in patients awaiting diagnostic procedures in an oncology center waiting room, and to investigate possible relationships between anxiety and demographic and clinical variables. Method(s): A cross-sectional study was performed with 398 patients who completed a self-administered questionnaire containing the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Result(s): Results of the HADS indicated that 38% of participants had anxiety, while data from the STAI showed that 46% had either high state or trait anxiety. The most frequently cited source of anxiety was concern over test results. Age, gender, employment status, and education level were correlated with anxiety. Conclusion(s): The prevalence of anxiety is high among patients awaiting diagnostic procedures. Patients in the waiting room should be routinely screened for anxiety. Careful assessment and treatment of anxiety are important components in the care of patients with cancer. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Excluded

4291,"Twice-daily Thoracic Radiotherapy for Limited-stage Small-cell Lung Cancer Does Not Increase the Incidence of Acute Severe Esophagitis PURPOSE: Acute esophagitis is common after thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) given with chemotherapy for limited-stage small-cell lung cancer (LS SCLC). Although twice-daily TRT to 45 Gy in 30 fractions is considered standard, some clinicians are reluctant to use this schedule because of its perceived impracticality and risk of severe esophagitis. We reviewed a single-institution experience with severe (grade >= 3) esophagitis after TRT with chemotherapy for LS SCLC., PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 504 patients were identified as having received TRT (>=45 Gy) with platinum-containing chemotherapy for LS SCLC at MD Anderson Cancer Center in 1987 through 2012. Patients with complete or good partial response were offered prophylactic cranial irradiation. Esophagitis was scored retrospectively with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, V3.0. Clinical variables were analyzed for possible association with acute grade >= 3 esophagitis., RESULTS: At a median follow-up time of 23.9 months (range, 1.2-240.8 months), 103 (20%) patients had experienced grade >= 3 esophagitis. In univariate analysis, TRT dose >= 60 Gy was the only factor associated with severe esophagitis (odds ratio [OR], 1.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-3.30; P = .043); use of twice-daily TRT was not (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.61-1.52; P = .867). The significance of TRT to >= 60 Gy was maintained in multivariate Cox regression analysis adjusted for tumor size (OR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.05-3.46; P = .034)., CONCLUSIONS: TRT to >= 60 Gy predicted acute severe esophagitis, but twice-daily fractionation did not. Standard-dose 45-Gy twice-daily TRT should not be avoided for fear of severe esophagitis. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
4710,"Solar urticaria Introduction. Solar urticaria (SU) is a rare photodermatosis induced by a broad spectrum of electromagnetic radiation. Theoretically it should not present a diagnostic problem, but in everyday practice it is quite frequently misdiagnosed. Objective. To characterize SU cases diagnosed in the photobiology unit of the Dermatological Department of WUM, with particular analysis of conformity of initial diagnosis with that established in the photobiology unit. Material and methods. Investigation was performed in 87 patients directed to the photobiology unit with diagnosis of solar urticaria (out of 12 041 patients with different forms of light hypersensitivity tested). In all patients in order to determine sensitivity to UVB and UVA phototests were performed. They included evaluation of minimal urticarial dose. As the light source fluorescent bulbs emitting a continuous spectrum of UVB or UVA were used. In 5 patients to evaluate sensitivity to visible light a slide projector was used. In 30 patients additionally photopatch tests were done. Results. Our results confirmed rare occurrence of solar urticaria. Diagnosis of US was confirmed only in 15 out of 87 patients with such initial diagnosis (17.2%); they represented 0.12% of all patients with photodermatoses tested. In this group there were 8 women and 7 men of mean age 26.2 years (M), 25.7 years (W). In the majority (9) of cases the disease lasted one year before testing. The US action spectrum in our patients was UVA + UVB in 9 cases, mainly UVA in 2, mainly UVB in 2, and in two patients urticarial wheals were provoked by UVA, UVB and visible light. We did not notice either delayed onset or prolonged duration of urticaria. Photopatch testing and longer (up to 2 weeks after UV exposure) observation of irradiated sites enabled us to make a proper diagnosis in further 52 patients. In 35 we disclosed polymorphic light eruptions, in 12 contact dermatitis to chromium, in 2 photocontact dermatitis to chlorpromazine and fragrance substances. In 3 patients we diagnosed chronic actinic dermatitis. In 20 cases it was not possible to establish a definite diagnosis. Wrong initial diagnosis was observed mainly in patients hypersensitive to UVA. Conclusions. In patients with oedemato-erythematous lesions after sun exposure lasting longer than 24 h, particularly in the elderly, diagnostic procedures should include additionally to phototesting patch and photopatch tests.",Excluded

4259,"Low Intensity laser therapy in patients with burning mouth syndrome: a randomized, placebo-controlled study The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of low intensity laser therapy in patients with Burning Mouth Syndrome (BMS). Thirty BMS subjects were randomized into two groups - Laser (LG) and Placebo (CG). Seven patients dropped out, leaving 13 patients in LG and 10 patients in CG. Each patient received 4 irradiations (laser or placebo) twice a week, for two consecutive weeks (blinded to the type of irradiation received). Infrared laser (AsGaAI) irradiations were applied to the affected mucosa in scanning mode, wavelength of 790 nm, output power of 20 mW and fluence of 6 J/cm2. A visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to assess the therapeutic effect before and after each irradiation, and at all the control time periods: 7, 14, 30, 60 and 90 days after the last irradiation. One researcher delivered irradiation and another recorded the results. Both researchers were blinded, the first to the results, and the second to the type of radiation applied. The results were categorized according to the percentage of symptom level variation, and showed a statistically better response in LG in only two categories of the control checkpoints (p=0.02; Fisher's Exact Test). According to the protocol used in this study, low intensity laser therapy is as beneficial to patients with BMS as placebo treatment, indicating a great emotional component of involvement in BMS symptomatology. Nevertheless, there were positive results in some statistical analyses, thus encouraging further research in BMS laser therapy with other irradiation parameters.",Excluded

It is known that ionizing radiation may have damaging effects on chromosomes. In the present study, we investigated the genotoxic effects of ionizing radiation on nuclear medicine workers. We used two different indicators of genotoxicity methods: sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and micronucleus (MN)., METHODS: The present research was carried out using 21 nuclear medicine workers (11 females and 10 males) during two periods: during normal working conditions and after a 1-month vacation. The radiation dose varied from 1.20 to 48.56 mSv, which accumulated during the occupational exposure time between two vacations. Peripheral blood samples were taken from each subject for two distinct lymphocyte cultures (SCE and MN) in each period., RESULTS: In nearly all subjects, SCE values increased significantly during radiation exposure compared to the postvacation period (P<.05). Similarly, MN frequencies in most of the subjects increased significantly during radiation exposure compared to the postvacation period (P<.05)., CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that both SCE and MN frequencies in most of the subjects were significantly higher during exposure to ionizing radiation than after a 1-month vacation period. However, this genotoxic effect was reversible in most of the subjects.",Excluded
4026,"Hedgehog pathway inhibitor in combination with radiation therapy for basal cell carcinomas of the head and neck: First clinical experience with vismodegib for locally advanced disease Background: Definitive radiotherapy and vismodegib, an oral inhibitor of the hedgehog pathway, are both established treatment options for locally advanced basal cell carcinomas (BCC). Both have shown good results in local tumor control; however, the effects concerning advanced tumors are often not of a lasting nature and to date no systematic data about the combination of the two modalities are available. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed four patients who received vismodegib and radiotherapy in combination. Radiation doses varied between 50.4 Gy and 66.0 Gy. Three patients had recurrent BCC. One patient had locoregional lymph node involvement. Vismodegib was taken once a day (150 mg) during the entire time of irradiation and beyond upon instructions of the attending dermatologist. Result(s): In three cases a persistent complete response was observed, in one case the tumor remained stable for approximately 6 months until further tumor progression was documented. The combined therapy was well tolerated in all cases. No exceptional side effects pointing at a drug-radiation interaction were observed. Conclusion(s): The combination of vismodegib and radiation seems feasible and the initial results are promising. In our cohort, there was no increase in unexpected side effects. Further research is needed to evaluate the significance of this combined therapy.Copyright © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
4890,"DNA damage-induced PARP1 activation confers cardiomyocyte dysfunction through NAD+ depletion in experimental atrial fibrillation Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common clinical tachyarrhythmia with a strong tendency to progress in time. AF progression is driven by derailment of protein homeostasis, which ultimately causes contractile dysfunction of the atria. Here we report that tachypacing-induced functional loss of atrial cardiomyocytes is precipitated by excessive poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) activation in response to oxidative DNA damage. PARP1-mediated synthesis of ADP-ribose chains in turn depletes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), induces further DNA damage and contractile dysfunction. Accordingly, NAD+ replenishment or PARP1 depletion precludes functional loss. Moreover, inhibition of PARP1 protects against tachypacing-induced NAD+ depletion, oxidative stress, DNA damage and contractile dysfunction in atrial cardiomyocytes and Drosophila. Consistently, cardiomyocytes of persistent AF patients show significant DNA damage, which correlates with PARP1 activity. The findings uncover a mechanism by which tachypacing impairs cardiomyocyte function and implicates PARP1 as a possible therapeutic target that may preserve cardiomyocyte function in clinical AF.Copyright © 2019, The Author(s).",Excluded

In a disaster setting, misusage of contemporary media sources available today can lead to disseminated incorrect information and panic. The study aims to build a scale which examines associations between media and individual anxieties, and to propose effective media usages for future disaster management. Method(s):The University of Tokyo collaborated with the Fukushima local government to conduct a radiation-health-seminar for a total of 1560 residents, at 12 different locations in Fukushima. A 13 item questionnaire collected once before and after a radiation-seminar was used on factor analysis to develop sub-scales for multiple regression models, to determine relationships between the sub-scales and media type consumed. A paired t-test was used to examine any changes in sub-scale of pre- and post-seminar scores. Result(s):Three sub-scales were revealed and were associated with different media types: was with rumors, while concern for the future was positively associated with regional-newspapers and negatively with national-newspapers. Anxiety about social-disruption was associated with radio. The seminar had a significant effect on anxiety reduction for all the three sub-scales. Conclusion(s):Different media types were associated with various heightened concerns, and that a radiation seminar was helpful to reduce anxieties in the post-disaster setting. By tailoring post-disaster messages via specific media types, i.e., radio, it may be possible to effectively convey important information, as well as to calm fears about particular elements of post-disaster recovery and to combat rumors. © 2013 Sugimoto et al.",Excluded

3982,"Dual-layer spectral computed tomography: Virtual non-contrast in comparison to true non-contrast images Purpose: To evaluate virtual-non-contrast (VNC) images obtained from clinical triphasic scans with a dual-layer spectral computed tomography system regarding accuracy of iodine subtraction. Material(s) and Method(s): From September to December 2016, 62 consecutive patients who underwent a clinical routine triphasic CT examination were included into this retrospective study. VNC images based on the arterial and portal venous phase were generated. For every patient and every contrast phase, a region-of-interest (ROI) was defined in aorta, liver, renal cortex, spongious bone, fat, muscle and fluid (i.e. gallbladder, urinary bladder), resulting in 2170 ROIs. VNC images were compared to true-non-contrast (TNC) images regarding difference in attenuation. Consistency between VNC images obtained from the arterial and portal venous phase as well as the influence of the initial attenuation on respective VNC images were evaluated. Result(s): Comparison of HU in VNC and TNC images showed a high accuracy of iodine elimination. Mean difference between TNC and VNC images was only 0.5 +/- 8.5 HU and >90% of all comparisons showed a difference of less than 15 HU. For all tissues but spongious bone, mean absolute difference between TNC and VNC images was below 10 HU. VNC images derived from the arterial and the portal venous phase showed excellent correlation. The quality of iodine removal in VNC images was not influenced by the original contrast enhancement. However, VNC images cannot be used for evaluation of iodine removal in bone as bone and iodine can hardly be differentiated via spectral CT. Conclusion(s): VNC imaging in DL-CT is a promising tool for daily clinical routine. As non-enhanced CT images are essential in multiple clinical situations, the permanent availability of VNC images with dual-layer spectral CT will result in a substantial reduction of radiation exposure and an increased diagnostic value of monophasic contrast-enhanced CT scans.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
3953,"Dosimetric effect of different isocenter for nasopharyngeal carcinoma with volumetric modulated arc therapy Objective: The purpose of this study was to analyze the dosimetric effect of different isocenters with volumetric modulated arc therapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Method(s): A total of 20 NPC patients who had received radiotherapy were re-planned by the volumetric modulated arc therapy plan. Three volumetric modulated arc therapy plans with different isocenters were generated for each patient: the first plan using the center of PGTVnx as the isocenter (AP-V), the second plan using the center of PGTVnd as the isocenter (BP-V), and the third plan using the center of PTV2 as the isocenter (CP-V). The conformity and homogeneity indexes of the target, dose-volume histogram of organs at risk, normal tissue, volume of dose, and monitor units were compared for the three plans. Result(s): AP-V provided a significantly lower maximum dose for the optic nerves and optic chiasm; lower mean dose for the eyeballs; lower absolute volume >10 Gy, absolute volume >20 Gy, and absolute volume >30 Gy; and fewer monitor units than BP-V and CP-V. BP-V and CP-V provided a significantly lower absolute volume >50 Gy than AP-V. In the conformity indexes of PGTVnd and PTV2, BP-V and CP-V were significantly better than in AP-V. In the homogeneity index of PTV2, BP-V and CP-V were significantly better than in AP-V. In general, there is no significant difference between BP-V and CP-V. Conclusion(s): All three plans achieved the clinical demands. AP-V decreased the volumes of absolute volume >10 Gy, absolute volume >20 Gy, and absolute volume >30 Gy, whereas BP-V and CP-V decreased the volume of absolute volume >50 Gy. In terms of organs at risk, AP-V offered better protection of the optic nerves, optic chiasm, and eyeballs for NPC than BP-V and CP-V. Most importantly, AP-V enhanced the utilization of the monitor units. For this reason, we propose that the radiotherapy technician put the location position in the PGTVnx center during simulation of the NPC patients. We further propose that the isocenter be moved to the geometric center of PGTVnx if the NPC patient plan has higher dosimeter requirements for the optic nerves, optic chiasm, or eyeballs.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

4694,"Management of oropharyngeal cancer: a cross-sectional review of institutional practice at a large Canadian referral centre BACKGROUND: Over the years, the treatment of oropharyngeal cancer has changed; in the past, first-line treatment consisted of surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy, today however, primary treatment typically involves concomitant chemoradiation, and reserves surgery for salvage. While chemoradiation is the modality of choice for primary management of oropharyngeal cancer, disease characteristics, institutional bias, and patient preferences influence treatment choice. This has lead to variation in the treatment of OPC, and has generated some uncertainly regarding the ideal therapeutic approach. The objective of this study was to describe the treatment of OPC a large Canadian referral center, highlighting trends in treatment choice and outcome., METHODS: This is a cross-sectional retrospective review of clinical practice at Sunnybrook Health Science Centre (Toronto, ON). This investigation documents type of first-line treatment, rates of treatment failure, rates of surgical salvage, and 5-year disease-free survival. This study also asses the therapeutic impact of free-flap reconstruction on the use of a postoperative tracheostomy and/or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube., RESULTS: The majority of oropharyngeal cancer patients presented with regionally metastatic disease (stage III-IV) and underwent concomitant chemoradiation as first-line treatment. Just over half of patients who failed chemoradiation were eligible for salvage surgery. Forty-six percent of salvage patients recurred at approximately 6 months, and died approximately 12 months following the first sign of disease recurrence. Five-year survival for salvage patients stage II, III, IVA, and IVB was 100%, 54.5%, 53.8%, and 50%, respectively. The incidence of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tubes and tracheostomies was comparable between patients who underwent free-flap reconstruction and patients who did not., CONCLUSION: The modality of choice for first-line treatment of oropharyngeal cancer is concomitant chemoradiation. The moderate failure rate following chemoradiation and the modest survival rate following salvage surgery could indicate that selected patients may benefit from undergoing surgery as first-line treatment. While this study did not show that functional outcomes were better for free-flap patients, it is highly likely that those who received a free-flap did better then they would have had they not undergone reconstructive surgery. More research regarding the therapeutic effects of free-flaps in OPC survivors is needed.",Excluded

The aim of the study was to analyze the potential of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) for the diagnosis of sialolithiasis and to compare the results with those of sonography and sialendoscopy., STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis., METHODS: The data of 43 patients with suspected sialolithiasis were evaluated retrospectively. All patients had CBCT and sonographic imaging and received sialendoscopy to confirm and possibly treat sialolithiasis., RESULTS: Sonography, CBCT, and sialendoscopy together indicated sialolithiasis in 33 patients. The mean maximum diameter of the extracted sialoliths did not significantly differ between the three diagnostics. Each diagnostic tool showed an excellent specificity and positive predictive value. Sensitivity and negative predictive value were best in sialendoscopy (94% resp. 83%), followed by CBCT (79% resp. 56%) and then sonography (70% resp. 47%)., CONCLUSION: The results revealed that CBCT is capable of diagnosing sialoliths in general and tended to be more sensitive than sonography.

Materials/Methods: Patients who were pathologically diagnosed as Stage IE/IIE ocular adnexal MALT lymphoma and underwent radiation therapy were retrospectively analyzed. Since 2006, 55 patients received radiation therapy and were followed up for more than 6 months at our institution. At initial presentation, 53 patients had Stage IE disease and two had Stage IIE disease. There were 28 men and 27 women. The median age was 66 years (range, 39-90 years). Local control (LC), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): The median follow-up period was 47 months (range, 6-90 months). The median radiation dose was 30 Gy (range, 30-30.6 Gy in 15- 17 fractions). All patients were treated by radiation alone, but oral steroid was used for four patients who had double vision at the beginning of treatment. Thirty-four patients were treated with 6 MV photon beams with a wedged pair of fields. Nineteen patients with a lesion confined to the conjunctive or eyelid were treated with 9 MeV electron beams with a single anterior field. In the remaining two patients, combination of the two beams was used. A lead lens block was used in 16 patients. Six patients had bilateral lesions and were treated simultaneously. The 5-year LC rate was 100%. In two patients, local recurrence was suspected at 44 and 46 months, respectively, after radiation therapy, but both of them were diagnosed to have IgG4-related inflammation by biopsy, with no evidence of malignancy upon histological and immunohistochemical examinations. The 5-year PFS and OS rates were 89% and 100%, respectively. Four patients had recurrence at a distant site. The median time to recurrence was 24 months. Three of the four patients received systemic chemotherapy with R-CHOP and another patient is being followed up without second line treatment. One patient developed retinal detachment incidentally during radiation therapy and underwent surgery thereafter. There was no other Grade 3 or higher acute morbidity. Eleven patients had Grade 2 late morbidity (dry eye, 2; cataract, 9). Sixteen patients had Grade 3 cataract. No patients had severe late adverse events other than cataract. Conclusion(s): Patients with localized ocular adnexal MALT lymphoma achieved excellent local control after 30 Gy of radiation therapy alone. Local regrowth of the mass was observed in two patients, but both were diagnosed as IgG4-related disease.

4626,"Gut microbial dysbiosis is associated with development and progression of radiation enteritis during pelvic radiotherapy Radiation enteritis (RE) is the most common complication of radiotherapy for pelvic irradiation receivers. Herein we investigated the alterations in gut microbial profiles and their association with enteritis in patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy. Faecal samples were collected from 18 cervical cancer patients during radiotherapy. Microbiota profiles were characterized based on 16S rRNA sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq platform. Epithelial inflammatory response was evaluated using bacterial-epithelial co-cultures. Dysbiosis was observed among patients with RE, which was characterized by significantly reduced alpha-diversity but increased beta-diversity, relative higher abundance of Proteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria and lower abundance of Bacteroides. Coprococcus was clearly enriched prior to radiotherapy in patients who later developed RE. Metastat analysis further revealed unique grade-related microbial features, such as more abundant Virgibacillus and Alcanivorax in patients with mild enteritis. Additionally, using bacterial-epithelial co-cultures, RE patient-derived microbiota induced epithelial inflammation and barrier dysfunction, enhanced TNF-alpha and IL-1beta expression compared with control microbiota. Taken together, we define the overall picture of gut microbiota in patients with RE. Our results suggest that dysbiosis of gut microbiota may contribute to development and progression of RE. Gut microbiota can offer a set of biomarkers for prediction, disease activity evaluation and treatment selection in RE. Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Cardioxane in doses 20 mg/kg was applied ip 1 h before and 20 h after farmorubicin treatment or 30 min before and 20 h after irradiation. The early markers of peroxidative damage were thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBA-RS) in serum and heart homogenate, and the cytoplasmic enzyme creatine kinase CK (CPK) activity in serum. Results indicate that Cardioxane in clinically relevant doses did not exert a protective effect against oxidative reactions and did not significantly influence the changes of serum enzyme level observed after both cardiotoxic agents. Furthermore, Cardioxane alone induced a small but significant increase of TBA-RS in serum and heart tissue, providing additional toxicity.",Excluded
3748,"Small Cell Lung Cancer. Methodology and Preliminary Results of the SMALL CELL Study INTRODUCTION: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most aggressive histologic type of lung cancer, and accounts for approximately 10%-15% of all cases. Few studies have analyzed the effect of residential radon. Our aim is to determine the risk factors of SCLC., METHODS: We designed a multicenter, hospital-based case-control study with the participation of 11 hospitals in 4 autonomous communities., RESULTS: Results of the first 113 cases have been analyzed, 63 of which included residential radon measurements. Median age at diagnosis was 63 years; 11% of cases were younger than 50 years of age; 22% were women; 57% had extended disease; and 95% were smokers or former smokers. Median residential radon concentration was 128Bq/m3. Concentrations higher than 400Bq/m3 were found in 8% of cases. The only remarkable difference by gender was the percentage of never smokers, which was higher in women compared to men (P<.001). Radon concentration was higher in patients with stageIV disease (non-significant difference) and in individuals diagnosed at 63 years of age or older (P=.032)., CONCLUSIONS: A high percentage of SCLC cases are diagnosed early and there is a predominance of disseminated disease at diagnosis. Residential radon seems to play an important role on the onset of this disease, with some cases having very high indoor radon concentrations. Copyright © 2017 SEPAR.

4273,"Phase III trial of concurrent thoracic radiotherapy with either first- or third-cycle chemotherapy for limited-disease small-cell lung cancer Background: We compared late thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) with early TRT in the treatment of limited-disease small-cell lung cancer (LD-SCLC). Patients and Methods: Patients with LD-SCLC received four cycles of etoposide plus cisplatin every 21 days. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either TRT administered concurrently with the first cycle (early TRT) or the third cycle (late TRT) of chemotherapy. The primary end point was complete response rate. Result(s): Two hundred twenty-two patients were randomly assigned. Late TRT was not inferior to early TRT in terms of the complete response rate (early versus late; 36.0% versus 38.0%). Other efficacy measures including overall survival [median, 24.1 versus 26.8 months; hazard ratio (HR) 0.90; 95% CI 0.18-1.62] and progression-free survival (median, 12.4 versus 11.2 months; HR 1.10; 95% CI 0.37-1.84) were not different between two arms. No statistical difference was noted in the pattern of treatment failures. However, neutropenic fever occurred more commonly in the early TRT arm than the late TRT arm (21.6% versus 10.2%; P = 0.02). Conclusion(s): In LD-SCLC treatment, TRT starting in the third cycle of chemotherapy seemed to be noninferior to early TRT, and had a more favorable profile with regard to neutropenic fever. © The Author 2013.

4337,"Acute phase response before treatment predicts radiation esophagitis in non-small cell lung cancer BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Radiation esophagitis (RE) represents an inflammatory reaction to radiation therapy (RT). We hypothesized that aspects of the physiologic acute phase response (APR) predicts RE., MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 285 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with definitive radiation. The primary analysis was the association of pretreatment lab values reflective of the APR with symptomatic (grade 2) RE. Univariate and multivariate odds ratios (ORs) were calculated to test associations of clinical and pretreatment lab values with RE. Optimal cutpoints and multivariable risk stratification groupings were determined via recursive partitioning analysis., RESULTS: Pretreatment platelet counts were higher and hemoglobin levels lower in patients who developed RE (P<0.05). Based on these two pre-treatment risk factors, an APR score was defined as 0 (no risk factors), 1 (either risk factor), or 2 (both risk factors). APR score was significantly associated with RE in both univariate (OR = 2.3 for each point, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5-3.4, P = 0.001) and multivariate (OR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.3-3.4, P = 0.002) analyses., CONCLUSIONS: The APR score may represent a novel metric to predict RE. However, pending validation in an independent dataset, caution is advised when interpreting these results given their retrospective and thus exploratory nature. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

3940,"Reduced acute bowel toxicity in patients treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy for rectal cancer PURPOSE: We have previously shown that intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) can reduce dose to small bowel, bladder, and bone marrow compared with three-field conventional radiotherapy (CRT) technique in the treatment of rectal cancer. The purpose of this study was to review our experience using IMRT to treat rectal cancer and report patient clinical outcomes., METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective review was conducted of patients with rectal cancer who were treated at Mayo Clinic Arizona with pelvic radiotherapy (RT). Data regarding patient and tumor characteristics, treatment, acute toxicity according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v 3.0, tumor response, and perioperative morbidity were collected., RESULTS: From 2004 to August 2009, 92 consecutive patients were treated. Sixty-one (66%) patients were treated with CRT, and 31 (34%) patients were treated with IMRT. All but 2 patients received concurrent chemotherapy. There was no significant difference in median dose (50.4 Gy, CRT; 50 Gy, IMRT), preoperative vs. postoperative treatment, type of concurrent chemotherapy, or history of previous pelvic RT between the CRT and IMRT patient groups. Patients who received IMRT had significantly less gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. Sixty-two percent of patients undergoing CRT experienced >=Grade 2 acute GI side effects, compared with 32% among IMRT patients (p = 0.006). The reduction in overall GI toxicity was attributable to fewer symptoms from the lower GI tract. Among CRT patients, >=Grade 2 diarrhea and enteritis was experienced among 48% and 30% of patients, respectively, compared with 23% (p = 0.02) and 10% (p = 0.015) among IMRT patients. There was no significant difference in hematologic or genitourinary acute toxicity between groups. In addition, pathologic complete response rates and postoperative morbidity between treatment groups did not differ significantly., CONCLUSIONS: In the management of rectal cancer, IMRT is associated with a clinically significant reduction in lower GI toxicity compared with CRT. Further study is needed to evaluate differences in late toxicity and long-term efficacy. Copyright A© 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
4757,"Associations of LIG4 and HSPB1 genetic polymorphisms with risk of radiation-induced lung injury in lung cancer patients treated with radiotherapy OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the correlations of genetic polymorphisms in LIG4 and HSPB1 genes with the radiation-induced lung injury (RILI), especially radiation pneumonitis (RP), in lung cancer patients., METHODS: A total of 160 lung cancer patients, who were diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer and received radiotherapy, were included in the present study from September 2009 to December 2011. TaqMan Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR) was used to verify the SNPs of LIG4 and HSPB1 genes. Chi-square criterion was used to compare the differences in demographic characteristics, exposure to risk factors, and SNPs genotypes. Crude odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated by logistic regression analysis. All statistical analyses were conducted in SPSS 18.0., RESULTS: A total of 32 (20.0%) lung cancer patients had RP after receiving radiotherapy. Of the 32 cases, 4 cases were of grade 2, 24 cases were of grade 3, and 4 cases were of grade 4. However, our results indicated that the general condition and treatment of all patients had no significant difference with RP risk (P > 0.05). Meanwhile, our results revealed that there was no significant association between the frequencies of LIG4 rs1805388 and HSPB1 rs2868371 genotype distribution and the risk of RP (P > 0.05)., CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we demonstrated that the genetic polymorphisms in LIG4 rs1805388 and HSPB1 rs2868371 were not obviously correlated with the risk of RP and RILI of lung cancer.",Excluded
4296,"Intraoperative electron radiation therapy as an important treatment modality in retroperitoneal sarcoma Background: Local recurrence (LR) rates in patients with retroperitoneal sarcoma (RPS) are high, ranging from 40% to 80%, with no definitive studies describing the best way to administer radiation. Intraoperative electron beam radiation therapy (IOERT) provides a theoretical advantage for access to the tumor bed with reduced toxicity to surrounding structures. The goal of this study was to evaluate the role of IOERT in high-risk patients. Method(s): An institutional review board approved, single institution sarcoma database was queried to identify patients who received IOERT for treatment of RPS from 2/2001 to 1/2009. Data were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, Cox regression, and Fisher Exact tests. Result(s): Eighteen patients (median age 51 y, 25-76 y) underwent tumor resection with IOERT (median dose 1250 cGy) for primary (n = 13) and recurrent (n = 5) RPS. Seventeen patients received neoadjuvant radiotherapy. Eight high-grade and 10 low-grade tumors were identified. Median tumor size was 15 cm. Four patients died and two in the perioperative period. Median follow-up of survivors was 3.6 y. Five patients (31%) developed an LR in the irradiated field. Three patients with primary disease (25%) and two (50%) with recurrent disease developed an LR (P = 0.5). Four patients with high-grade tumors (57%) and one with a low-grade tumor (11%) developed an LR (P = 0.1). The 2- and 5-y OS rates were 100% and 72%. Two- and 5-y LR rates were 13% and 36%. Conclusion(s): Using a multidisciplinary approach, we have achieved low LR rates in our high-risk patient population indicating that IOERT may play an important role in managing these patients. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Objectives In this study we examined the prevalence of low bone mineral density (BMD) and VF in patients with AS (modified New York criteria), and investigated the associations between BMD or VF and demographic, body composition or disease-related parameters. Methods Skeletal and body composition assessment included dual X-ray Absortiometry (DXA) at the lumbar spine, hip and total body and radiographs of the spine. The presence of VF was established by the Genant's semi-quantitative method. Results A total of 79 AS patients, 65 males and 14 females with mean age of 43 and 49 years, respectively and with a mean disease duration of 10 years were included. Mean Z score BMD (SD below the age- and gender-matched mean reference value) were slightly decreased only in male patients, both at lumbar spine and total hip (-0,4 p=0,05; -0,3 p<0,01), while mean total body Z score BMD were positive in both genders (female +1,2 p<0,05; male +0,7 p<0,001), independent of the presence of syndesmophytes. Z score BMD values at both total hip and lumbar spine were directly and significantly (p<0.01) associated with body mass index (BMI, Kg/m2); Z score BMD were significantly correlated with both fat and lean mass (kg), measured by DXA, only at hip sites. Z score BMD were significantly lower in the 36 patients with syndesmophytes and in those (19%) with peripheral joints involvement. Despite reasonably preserved BMD values at least one VF was identified in 31% of males and 14% of females; most VF were located at thoracic-lumbar transition and were mild wedge fractures. The presence of VF was not associated with BMD values (ANOVA) but rather with peripheral joints involvement (chi-square test, p<0.01), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index (logistic regression, p<0,01), and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (p<0,01). Conclusions In this study we found that BMD is relatively well preserved in AS patients. The total body BMD values above the normal range suggest that the overall bone formation might be somewhat increased despite the propensity to decreased mobility. VF are very common particularly in male AS patients: its occurrence is unrelated with BMD values while it is significantly correlated with clinical parameters of disease activity and functional impairment.",Excluded
4429,"Exercise in space: human skeletal muscle after 6 months aboard the International Space Station The aim of this investigation was to document the exercise program used by crewmembers (n = 9; 45 +/- 2 yr) while aboard the International Space Station (ISS) for 6 mo and examine its effectiveness for preserving calf muscle characteristics. Before and after spaceflight, we assessed calf muscle volume (MRI), static and dynamic calf muscle performance, and muscle fiber types (gastrocnemius and soleus). While on the ISS, crewmembers had access to a running treadmill, cycle ergometer, and resistance exercise device. The exercise regimen varied among the crewmembers with aerobic exercise performed approximately 5 h/wk at a moderate intensity and resistance exercise performed 3-6 days/wk incorporating multiple lower leg exercises. Calf muscle volume decreased (P < 0.05) 13 +/- 2% with greater (P < 0.05) atrophy of the soleus (-15 +/- 2%) compared with the gastrocnemius (-10 +/- 2%). Peak power was 32% lower (P < 0.05) after spaceflight. Force-velocity characteristics were reduced (P < 0.05) -20 to -29% across the velocity spectrum. There was a 12-17% shift in myosin heavy chain (MHC) phenotype of the gastrocnemius and soleus with a decrease (P < 0.05) in MHC I fibers and a redistribution among the faster phenotypes. These data show a reduction in calf muscle mass and performance along with a slow-to-fast fiber type transition in the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles, which are all qualities associated with unloading in humans. Future long-duration space missions should modify the current ISS exercise prescription and/or hardware to better preserve human skeletal muscle mass and function, thereby reducing the risk imposed to crewmembers.",Excluded
4419,"In vivo dosimetry during DSA of the carotid and renal arteries. Deriviation of local DRLs The Euratom directive 97/43 recommends the use of patient dose surveys in diagnostic radiology and the establishment of diagnostic reference dose levels (DRLs). The aims of this study are to perform measurements of the entrance surface dose (ESD) during diagnostic digital subtraction angiography (DSA) of the renal and carotid arteries using thermoluminescence dosemeters (TLDs), extraction of local DRLs, and calculation of the effective dose. Dose measurement for the staff was also performed. Dose measurements were performed on 48 participating patients. The mean effective dose was calculated to be 15.9 mSv and 8.9 mSv, for the renal and carotid DSA, respectively. The effective dose of the radiologist was calculated to be 0.022 mSv and 0.023 mSv per procedure for renal and carotid DSA respectively, when wearing a protective apron and using a movable ceiling mounted shield. Radiation dose variation depends on the physical characteristics of the patient, on the procedure preferences by radiologists and on the difficulties in conducting the procedures. The lack of DRLs for the specific examinations lead the research team to choose the DRL for DSA of the renal arteries to be 169 mGy for ESD at the pelvic region and for DSA of the carotid arteries to be 313 mGy for ESD at the region of the aortic arc.",Excluded

4705,"New type of hip arthroplasty failure related to modular femoral components: Breakage at the neck-stem junction Total hip replacements (THR) with modular femoral components (stem-neck interface) make it possible to adapt to extramedullary femoral parameters (anteversion, offset, and length) theoretically improving muscle function and stability. Nevertheless, adding a new interface has its disadvantages: reduced mechanical resistance, fretting corrosion and material fatigue fracture. We report the case of a femoral stem fracture of the female part of the component where the modular morse taper of the neck is inserted. An extended trochanteric osteotomy was necessary during revision surgery because the femoral stump could not be grasped for extraction, so that a long stem had to be used. In this case, the patient had the usual risk factors for modular neck failure: he was an active overweight male patient with a long varus neck. This report shows that the female part of the stem of a small femoral component may also be at increased failure risk and should be added to the list of risk factors. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of this type of failure. © 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of bone cement distribution, cement leakage, and clinical outcomes with side-opening cannula for bone cement injection in percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) in treatment of Kummell disease., METHODS: A prospective study of patients with Kummell disease undergoing PVP was conducted from April 2012 to September 2017. In total, 43 patients (11 males, 32 females) with Kummell disease who received bilateral PVP were included in the study. The patients were divided into front-opening cannulas (FOC) group with front-opening cannulas and side-opening cannulas (SOC) group with side-opening cannulas. All patients were followed up for 6 months. The patient general information such as gender, age, bone density, compression ratio, operative time, and location of fracture vertebrae were recorded. Visual analogue scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), bone cement distribution, radiation exposure time, bone cement leakage rate and vertebral height, and kyphosis angle were measured and compared for two groups before surgery, 1 day and 6 months after surgery., RESULTS: A total of 43 patients were enrolled, including 11 males and 32 females, aged 61-84 years. The bone density (T value) was 2.5 +/- 0.6 in FOC group and 2.4 +/- 0.6 in SOC group (P > 0.05). The compression ratio and operative time were 36.1% +/- 13.0%, 39.3 +/- 7.9 min in FOC group and 35.2% +/- 13.7%, 40.0 +/- 10.7 min in SOC group (P > 0.05). There was no significance between FOC and SOC groups in the location of fracture vertebrae. All patients underwent at least 6 months of follow-up. At 6 months postoperatively, the VAS and ODI were significantly higher in the FOC group (3.0 +/- 0.8, 35.7% +/- 2.1%) than in the SOC group (1.3 +/- 0.4, 18.6% +/- 2.4%) (P < 0.05). The cement leakage rate of the SOC group was 4.8%, which was lower than that of the FOC group (31.8%, P < 0.05), and the bone cement distribution ratio was higher than that of the FOC group (63.1% +/- 7.9% vs 40.5% +/- 8.6%, P < 0.05). At 6 months after operation, the height of the anterior and posterior vertebral bodies of the patients in the SOC group restored better than the FOC group (anterior SOC: FOC 5.1 +/- 0.5 mm vs 4.5 +/- 0.5 mm; posterior SOC: FOC 0.6 +/- 0.1 mm vs 0.3 +/- 0.1 mm, P < 0.05), and the kyphosis correction was more obvious than patients in FOC group (SOC: FOC 8.5degree +/- 1.4degree vs 4.6degree +/- 0.8degree, P < 0.05)., CONCLUSION: Percutaneous vertebroplasty with side-opening cannula is safe and effective in avoiding bone cement leakage, improving bone cement distribution, and restoring vertebral height.

Totally, 120 patients with locally advanced lung cancer in radiotherapy were randomized into treatment and control groups. Patients in the treatment group took ambroxol orally at a dosage of 90 mg, three times per day for 3 months from the beginning of radiotherapy. The expression of TGF-beta1 and TNF-alpha in plasma was analyzed. The clinical symptoms and lung diffusing capacity were monitored using high resolving power computed tomography. The level of TGF-beta1 in the control group was increased (11.8 +/- 5.5 ng/ml), whereas in ambroxol-treated patients, the increase was not significant (5.6 +/- 2.6 ng/ml, P < 0.001). Radiotherapy-induced elevation of TNF-alpha levels, seen in control patients, was also abolished after treatment with ambroxol (5.1 +/- 1.0 vs. 2.4 +/- 0.8 ng/ml, P < 0.001). In the treatment group, carbon monoxide diffusion capacity was not significantly decreased at 6, 12, and 18 months post-radiotherapy, compared with the control group (P < 0.05).

4923,"Less efficient g2-m checkpoint is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer in African Americans Cell cycle checkpoints play critical roles in the maintenance of genomic integrity. The inactivation of checkpoint genes by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms is frequent in all cancer types, as a less-efficient cell cycle control can lead to genetic instability and tumorigenesis. In an on-going case-control study consisting of 216 patients with non-small cell lung cancer, 226 population-based controls, and 114 hospital-based controls, we investigated the relationship of gamma-radiation-induced G2-M arrest and lung cancer risk. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were cultured for 90 hours, exposed to 1.0 Gy gamma-radiation, and harvested at 3 hours after gamma-radiation treatment. gamma-Radiation-induced G2-M arrest was measured as the percentage of mitotic cells in untreated cultures minus the percentage of mitotic cells in gamma-radiation-treated cultures from the same subject. The mean percentage of gamma-radiation-induced G2-M arrest was significantly lower in cases than in population controls (1.18 versus 1.44, P < 0.01) and hospital controls (1.18 versus 1.40, P = 0.01). When dichotomized at the 50th percentile value in combined controls (population and hospital controls), a lower level of gamma-radiation-induced G2-M arrest was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer among African Americans after adjusting for baseline mitotic index, age, gender, and pack-years of smoking [adjusted odd ratio (OR), 2.25; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.97-5.20]. A significant trend of an increased risk of lung cancer with a decreased level of G2-M arrest was observed (P(trend) = 0.02) among African Americans, with a lowest-versus-highest quartile adjusted OR of 3.74 (95% CI, 0.98-14.3). This trend was most apparent among African American females (P(trend) < 0.01), with a lowest-versus-highest quartile adjusted OR of 11.75 (95% CI, 1.47-94.04). The results suggest that a less-efficient DNA damage-induced G2-M checkpoint is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer among African Americans. Interestingly, we observed a stronger association of DNA damage-induced G2-M arrest and lung cancer among African Americans when compared with Caucasians. If replicated, these results may provide clues to the exceedingly high lung cancer incidence experienced by African Americans.",Included
4421,"Chromosomal principle of radiation-induced F1 sterility in Ephestia kuehniella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) A dose-response analysis of chromosomal aberrations was performed in male progeny of gamma-irradiated males in the flour moth, Ephestia kuehniella. For comparison, several female progeny from each dose level were examined. Aberrations were detected on microspread preparations of pachytene nuclei in the electron microscope and classified according to pairing configurations of synaptonemal complexes (SCs). Fragmentation and various translocations were the most numerous aberrations, whereas interstitial deletion and inversion were rare. At 100 Gy, relatively simple multiple translocations were found. Multiple translocations showing complicated configurations occurred at 150 and 200 Gy, and their number increased with the dose. In males, the mean number of chromosomal breaks resulting in aberrations linearly increased with the dose from 8.4 to 16.2 per nucleus. In females, this value achieved a maximum of 11.2 breaks/nucleus at 200 Gy. Three factors were suggested to contribute to the reported higher level of F1 sterility in males than females: (i) survival of males with high numbers of breaks, (ii) crossing-over in spermatogenesis but not in the achiasmatic oogenesis, and (iii) a higher impact of induced changes on the fertility of males than females. It was concluded that translocations are most responsible for the production of unbalanced gametes resulting in sterility of F1 moths. However, F1 sterility predicted according to the observed frequency of aberrations was much higher than the actual sterility reported earlier. This suggests a regulation factor which corrects the predicted unbalanced state towards balanced segregation of translocated chromosomes.",Excluded

3957,"Ionizing radiation and genetic risks. VI. Chronic multifactorial diseases: a review of epidemiological and genetical aspects of coronary heart disease, essential hypertension and diabetes mellitus This paper provides a broad overview of the epidemiological and genetical aspects of common multifactorial diseases in man with focus on three well-studied ones, namely, coronary heart disease (CHD), essential hypertension (EHYT) and diabetes mellitus (DM). In contrast to mendelian diseases, for which a mutant gene either in the heterozygous or homozygous condition is generally sufficient to cause disease, for most multifactorial diseases, the concepts of genetic susceptibility' and risk factors' are more appropriate. For these diseases, genetic susceptibility is heterogeneous. The well-studied diseases such as CHD permit one to conceptualize the complex relationships between genotype and phenotype for chronic multifactorial diseases in general, namely that allelic variations in genes, through their products interacting with environmental factors, contribute to the quantitative variability of biological risk factor traits and thus ultimately to disease outcome. Two types of such allelic variations can be distinguished, namely those in genes whose mutant alleles have (i) small to moderate effects on the risk factor trait, are common in the population (polymorphic alleles) and therefore contribute substantially to the variability of biological risk factor traits and (ii) profound effects, are rare in the population and therefore contribute far less to the variability of biological risk factor traits. For all the three diseases considered in this review, a positive family history is a strong risk factor. CHD is one of the major contributors to mortality in most industrialized countries. Evidence from epidemiological studies, clinical correlations, genetic hyperlipidaemias etc., indicate that lipids play a key role in the pathogenesis of CHD. The known lipid-related risk factors include: high levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol, low levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol, high apoB levels (the major protein fraction of the low density lipoprotein particles) and elevated levels of Lp(a) lipoprotein. Among the risk factors which are not related to lipids are: high levels of homocysteine, low activity of paraoxonase and possibly also elevated plasma fibrinogen levels. In addition to the above, hypertension, diabetes and obesity (which themselves have genetic determinants) are important risk factors for CHD. Among the environmental risk factors are: high dietary fat intake, smoking, stress, lack of exercise etc. About 60% of the variability of the plasma cholesterol is genetic in origin. While a few genes have been identified whose mutant alleles have large effects on this trait (e.g., LDLR, familial defective apoB-100), variability in cholesterol levels among individuals in most families is influenced by allelic variation in many genes (polymorphisms) as well as environmental exposures. A proportion of this variation can be accounted for by two alleles of the apoE locus that increase (&epsi;4) and decrease (&epsi;2) cholesterol levels, respectively. A polymorphism at the apoB gene (XbaI) also has similar effects, but is probably not mediated through lipids. High density lipoprotein cholesterol levels are genetically influenced and are related to apoA1 and hepatic lipase (LIPC) gene functions. Mutations in the apoA1 gene are rare and there are data which suggest a role of allelic variation at or linked LIPC gene in high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Polymorphism at the apoA1--C3 loci is often associated with hypertriglyceridemia. The apo(a) gene which codes for Lp(a) is highly polymorphic, each allele determining a specific number of multiple tandem repeats of a unique coding sequence known as Kringle 4. The size of the gene correlates with the size of the Lp(a) protein. The smaller the size of the Lp(a) protein, the higher are the Lp(a) levels. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)",Excluded
4845,"Tactile influences on astronaut visual spatial orientation: human neurovestibular studies on SLS-2 Human spatial orientation in spaceflight is initially disturbed by the absence of usable graviceptor information from the otolithic organs. Experiments measuring astronaut visually induced motion (vection) strength on various flight days during the first 10 days of the Spacelab Life Sciences-2 mission demonstrated two new phenomena in addition to confirming the initial increased weighting of visual and localized tactile cues. The reliance on tactile and visual noninertial cues apparently declined after a week in space, as the crew became able to utilize their internal reference frame. Subjects also showed that even nondirectional tactile cues served as a direction anchor and inhibited visually induced roll sensation relative to a new loosely tethered test condition. Individual perceptual styles were again revealed among the four astronauts tested. The readaptation to 1 G similarly shows a period of reinterpretation of inertial and visual cues to spatial orientation. The results are discussed in terms of an internal-model representation of body orientation, with time-varying weights applied to extrinsic and intrinsic signals.",Excluded
4451,"Heavy ion radiotherapy in lung cancer (Introduction) In radiotherapy of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), carbon ion beams offer improved dose distributions as compared to photon beams and thus enable dose escalation within a target while sparing the surrounding normal tissues. Furthermore, carbon ions being heavier than protons provide a higher biological effectiveness, which increases with depth, reaching the maximum at the end of the range. At the National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS), clinical research on carbon ion radiotherapy (C-ion RT) was started in 1994 using carbon-ions generated by Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC). So far, almost 6,000 patients have been treated, where the benefit of C-ion RT over other modalities has been demonstrated in terms of high local control rates and a significant reduction in overall treatment time with acceptable toxicities in most cases. In this paper, the results of treatment for Stage I NSCLC using 9 and 4 fractions are reviewed, as well as preliminary results of single fraction treatment is described. Also, results of other RT reported in the literatures are compared. (Methods and materials) Stage I lung cancer is divided into two types depending on tumor location: peripheral-type and central-type. This classification is made on the assumption that the two types may tolerate radiation differently. Therefore, different fractionation regimens were investigated for each type. The patients eligible for either treatment are those for whom surgery was not indicated due to medical reasons or refusal. From 1999 to 2003, a total of 131 tumors in129 patients received C-ion RT with 9 fractions and 4 fractions, including 94 males and 37 females with an average age of 74.5 years. Out of the 131 foci, there were 72 T1 tumors and 59 T2 tumors. There were 85 adenocarcinomas, 43 epidermoid cancers and 3 other types. Regarding dose fractionations, 51 cases were treated with 72.0GyE/9 fractions, and 80 cases were treated with 52.8GyE/4fr for stage IA and 60.0GyE/4fr for stage IB. Since 2003, a doseescalation study using single fraction treatment has been conducted for peripheral-type NSCLC. The initial dose was 28.0 GyE, which was then escalated at increments of 5%. At each dose level, about 10 to 30 patients were registered for evaluation of toxicity and local control with carbon ions. C-ion RT has also been applied to locally advanced lung cancers and hilar-type cancers, and case studies are being accumulated. The locally advanced lung cancers included Pancoast tumors and mediastinal-type tumors in stages II-IIIA. (Results) All of the patients treated with 9 fractions/3 weeks (50 patients) and 4 fractions/1 week (79 patients) developed no evidence of severe toxicities. The 5-year local control rates were 98.6% for stage-IA cases and 89.7% for stage- IB cases, and the 5-year survival rates were 63.1% for stage-IA cases and 50.0% for stage-IB cases. In single fraction treatment, a total of 218 patients have been registered, in which the total dose has been escalated from 28.0 to 48.0 GyE. So far, no serious adverse events have been observed, and local control appears to be improving with increasing total dose. For skin reactions, six grade 2 toxicity (3.3%) but no grade 3 or higher was observed. For radiation pneumonitis, only one grade 1 was reported, and no toxicities greater than grade 2 occurred. The overall local control rate was 91.8%, and the causespeci fic survival rate at 5-years was 71.8%. The superficial lesions arising at the hilar region have been successfully treated with acceptable toxicities. Similarly, in the preoperative radiotherapy for patients with chest wall invasion, high anti-tumor effect was confirmed in the pathological findings after the lung was surgically removed. (Discussion) Only at NIRS, Japan, NSCLC has been treated with carbon ions. For peripheral tumor, we have been conducting clinical studies to establish a short-course, hypo-fractionated radiotherapy. We first performed a dose-escalation study using 18 fractions/6 weeks. The number of fractions and treatment times were subsequently reduced to 9 fractions over 3 weeks, 4 fractions over one week, and eventually to a single fraction treatment. The preliminary data suggested favorable local control and very few toxic reactions with a median follow up time of about 16 months. Compared with pulmonary damage reported for stereotactic radiotherapy in stage I lung cancer, the incidence and severity in our patients seemed to be remarkably low. The decreased adverse effects on the lung are likely achieved due to the small volume irradiated. When comparing proton vs C-ion RT, local control results are comparable for T1 tumors, but for T2 tumors 2-5 year local control rates are higher in C-ion RT. It is of note that in most reported data for proton therapy, follow-up periods are short relative to the time required for full evaluation of TCP, late NTCP and survival. Considering that the average age of the patients receiving C-ion RT was about 75 years, about 10 years older than that of 65 years in the operated patients, the results of C-ion RT for stage-I lung cancer may be comparable to surgical results. Thus, the single-fraction irradiation method may be described as the ultimate type of treatment using carbon ion, and would be a valid alternative to surgery, especially for elderly and inoperable patients.",Excluded
3718,"A prospective study of 18FDG-PET with CT coregistration for radiation treatment planning of lymphomas and other hematologic malignancies Purpose This prospective single-institution study examined the impact of positron emission tomography (PET) with the use of 2-[18F] fluoro-2-deoxyglucose and computed tomography (CT) scan radiation treatment planning (TP) on target volume definition in lymphoma. Methods and Materials 118 patients underwent PET/CT TP during June 2007 to May 2009. Gross tumor volume (GTV) was contoured on CT-only and PET/CT studies by radiation oncologists (ROs) and nuclear medicine physicians (NMPs) for 95 patients with positive PET scans. Treatment plans and dose-volume histograms were generated for CT-only and PET/CT for 95 evaluable sites. Paired t test statistics and Pearson correlation coefficients were used for analysis. Results 70 (74%) patients had non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 10 (11%) had Hodgkin lymphoma, 12 (10%) had plasma-cell neoplasm, and 3 (3%) had other hematologic malignancies. Forty-three (45%) presented with relapsed/refractory disease. Forty-five (47%) received no prior chemotherapy. The addition of PET increased GTV as defined by ROs in 38 patients (median, 27%; range, 5%-70%) and decreased GTV in 41 (median, 39.5%; range, 5%-80%). The addition of PET increased GTV as defined by NMPs in 27 patients (median, 26.5%; range, 5%-95%) and decreased GTV in 52 (median, 70%; range, 5%-99%). The intraobserver correlation between CT-GTV and PET-GTV was higher for ROs than for NMPs (0.94, P<.01 vs 0.89, P<.01). On the basis of Bland-Altman plots, the PET-GTVs defined by ROs were larger than those defined by NMPs. On evaluation of clinical TPs, only 4 (4%) patients had inadequate target coverage (D95 <95%) of the PET-GTV defined by NMPs. Conclusions Significant differences between the RO and NMP volumes were identified when PET was coregistered to CT for radiation planning. Despite this, the PET-GTV defined by ROs and NMPs received acceptable prescription dose in nearly all patients. However, given the potential for a marginal miss, consultation with an experienced PET reader is highly encouraged when PET/CT volumes are delineated, particularly for questionable lesions and to assure complete and accurate target volume coverage. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

4736,"Transoral endoscopic laser microsurgery or concurrent chemoradiation therapy for T2N0 larynx cancer Purpose/Objective(s): To compare the effectiveness of transoral endoscopic laser microsurgery (TLM) and concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) in the management of T2N0 laryngeal cancer. Materials/Methods: This retrospective review enrolled 43 consecutive patients with T2N0 larynx cancer treated with definitive TLM (n = 25) or CCRT (n = 18) between 2005 and 2012. The tumor was located in the supraglottis in 9 patients, glottis in 31 patients, and subglottis in 3 patients. The mean cumulative radiation doses were 70 Gy for CCRT group and Cisplatin-based concurrent chemotherapies were the most commonly used regimens. Oncological outcomes were evaluated using local control (LC), regional control (RC), larynx preservation survival (LPS), disease free survival (DFS), cancer specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS). Result(s): The median follow-up time was 3.93 years for the survivors. Patients' characteristics between two groups had no statistically significant difference. The 5-year LRC rate for CCRT group was 94.4% significantly higher than the 64.1% for TLM group (p = 0.030). The 5-year DFS rate for CCRT group was significantly improved (78.5% vs 56.5%, p=0.040). There was no significant difference in LPS, CSS, and OS. The most significant risk factor for tumor recurrence was subglottic invasion with significantly poor 5-year LRC rate (50.9% vs 92.7%, p = 0.003). On multivariate analysis, subglottic invasion was the only significant factor predicting recurrence after definitive treatment. Conclusion(s): TLM and CCRT are both effective in terms of larynx preservation survival rate for T2N0 larynx cancer. However, CCRT may improve the local regional control and disease free survival rate. Tumor with subglottic invasion carries poor prognostic value for tumor control, further adjuvant therapy may be considered.",Excluded
4541,"Benefits of an intraoral stent in decreasing the irradiation dose to oral healthy tissue: dosimetric and clinical features OBJECTIVE: To determine whether an intraoral stent may decrease radiation dose to health tissues during intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and to evaluate the effect on mucositis., STUDY DESIGN: A total of 33 patients with tongue or floor of the mouth cancer were retrospectively evaluated and divided into 2 groups: group 1 (with stent, n = 19) and group 2 (without stent, n = 14). Data were collected on dosimetric and mucositis outcomes., RESULTS: The mean dose to the maxilla was significantly lower in group 1 (20.9 Gy) than in group 2 (35.8 Gy) (P = .05). The mean dose to the ipsilateral parotid was 35.0 Gy in group 1 vs 41.8 Gy in group 2 (P = .05). No difference was seen in the severity of mucositis between groups (P = .82). However, grade III mucositis was present in group 1 at 4 weeks after IMRT, 1 week after its occurrence in group 2., CONCLUSIONS: A stent was effective in decreasing doses to healthy structures and delaying the emergence of mucositis.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

4635,"X-ray enhancement of splenic rosette-forming cells in nonimmune mice The formation of rosettes between spleen cells from nonimmune mice and sheep red blood cells (SRBC) has been investigated. The number of splenic rosette-forming cells (RFC) in the intact spleen was very low but greatly increased after sublethal whole body x-irradiation. These cells were inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with AKR anti-C3H- antigen antiserum, in the presence of fresh guinea pig serum, but not with rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin antiserum. The splenic RFC also increased after cortisone acetate administration into mice. These results suggest that the RFC are a T cell sub-population having x-ray resistant and cortisone-insensitive characteristics. The x-irradiation of mice in vivo selectively increased the number of splenic RFC in consequence of reduction in the number of cells having non-T cell characteristics. These RFC are presumably antigen-specific sheep red blood cell rosettes, a quite different situation as in the case of human T lymphocyte rosette formation.",Included
3925,"The single institutional outcome of postoperative radiotherapy and concurrent chemoradiotherapy in resected non-small cell lung cancer Purpose: This study was conducted to observe the outcomes of postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) with or without concurrent chemotherapy in resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in single institution. Material(s) and Method(s): From 2002 to 2013, 78 patients diagnosed with NSCLC after curative resection were treated with radiotherapy alone (RT, n = 48) or concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT, n = 30). The indications of adjuvant radiation therapy were N2 node positive (n = 31), close or involved resection margin (n = 28), or gross residual disease due to incomplete resection (n = 19). The median radiation dose was 57.6 Gy (range, 29.9 to 66 Gy). Result(s): Median survival time was 33.7 months (range, 4.4 to 140.3 months). The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 49.5% (RT 46% vs. CCRT 55.2%; p = 0.731). The 3-year disease-free survival rate was 45.5% (RT 39.4% vs. CCRT 55.3%; p = 0.130). The 3-year local control rate was 68.1% (RT 64.4% vs. CCRT 77.7%; p = 0.165). The 3-year DMFS rate was 56.1% (RT 52.6% vs. CCRT 61.7%; p = 0.314). In multivariate analysis, age >=66 years and pathologic stage III were significant poor prognostic factors for OS. Treatment failure occurred in 40 patients. Four patients had radiologically confirmed grade 3 radiation pneumonitis. Conclusion(s): In NSCLC, adjuvant RT or CCRT after curative surgery is a safe and feasible modality of treatment. OS gain was seen in patients less than 66 years. Postoperative CCRT showed a propensity of achieving better local control and improved disease-free survival compared to RT alone according to our data.Copyright © 2014 The Korean Society for Radiation Oncology.",Excluded

Formulas containing hydroquinone 4% are effective in these conditions. Since exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) can worsen disease and complicate treatment, the incorporation of sunscreens can avert this problem., METHODS: We tested the sun protection factor of a hydroquinone formulation (Lustra-Ultra, TaroPharma, Hawthorne, NY) containing avobenzone 3%, and octinoxate 7.5% according to the FDA Sunscreen Monograph on 20 volunteer subjects. We also determined the UVR absorbance spectrum of the preparation., RESULTS: The mean sun protection factor (SPF) of 21.7 satisfied labeling requirements for SPF 20. The formulation exhibited strongest photoprotection near the wavelengths of peak sun burning effectiveness in the UVB region and maintains significant UVR absorbance through the entire UVA region., CONCLUSIONS: Avobenzone 3% and octinoxate 7.5% provide broad spectrum UV protection.

Method(s): To examine the time course of PpIX production, 10% ALA was applied to inflammatory papules for 1 to 5 hours and followed by in situ fluorescence examination. To determine the effects of ALA dose and lesion type, 3, 5, and 10% ALA was applied to acne lesions in split-face fashion for 3 hours followed by whole-face light irradiation at 633 nm and 30 to 70 J/cm2. Treatment was repeated twice at 2-week intervals. Result(s): PpIX reached a stable level after 3 hours of incubation. Similar PpIX levels were seen in areas receiving 3, 5, and 10% ALA. Poisson regression analyses indicated that lesion counts decreased by 0.791 times for a one-unit increase in treatment times (95% CI 0.782-0.799, p < .0001) but only by 0.999 times for a one-unit increase in ALA dose (95% CI 0.998-1.000, p = .22).

Another 60 patients considered as the control group underwent only an MRI preoperatively and a pathological examination postoperatively. For the patients in the study group, meningiomas were removed by a hand-held gamma-probe 4-12 h after SRS; these patients were followed up by MRI examination each year for 5 years to monitor the recurrence rate of the meningiomas. For the control group, routine operations without radio guidance were performed and followed up with MRI examination simultaneously., RESULTS: All patients in the study group, comprising 20 with grade I and 10 with grade II meningiomas, showed high Tc-HYNIC-octreotide accumulation with a sensitivity of 100% for SRS; four patients (13.3%) relapsed after a 5-year follow-up, including one (5%) patient with a grade I and three (30%) patients with a grade II meningioma. However, among the 60 control patients, 30 were of grade I and 30 were of grade II; 18 patients (30%) experienced recurrence, including five (16.7%) grade I patients and 13 (43.3%) grade II patients. There were significant differences in recurrence between the study group and the control group when considering all the patients and those in grade I and grade II (all P values were below 0.001)., CONCLUSION: Tc-HYNIC-octreotide SPECT/CT SRS is a sensitive technique for detecting meningiomas, and radio guidance using a hand-held gamma-probe with Tc-HYNIC-octreotide during surgery can significantly reduce the recurrence of meningiomas.",Excluded
4699,"Radiation Exposure to solar and ionizing radiation increases the risk for cancer in humans. Some 5% of solar radiation is within the ultraviolet spectrum and may cause both malignant melanoma and non-melanocytic skin cancer; the latter is regarded as a benign disease and is accordingly not included in our estimation of avoidable cancers. Under the assumption that the rate of occurrence of malignant melanoma of the buttocks of both men and women and of the scalp of women would apply to all parts of the body in people completely unexposed to solar radiation, it was estimated that approximately 95% of all malignant melanomas arising in the Nordic populations around the year 2000 will be due to exposure to natural ultraviolet radiation, equivalent to an annual number of about 4700 cases, with 2100 in men and 2600 in women, or some 4% of all cancers notified. Exposure to ionizing radiation in the Nordic countries occurs at an average effective dose per capita per year of about 3 mSv (Iceland, 1.1 mSv) from natural sources, and about 1 mSv from man-made sources. While the natural sources are primarily radon in indoor air, natural radionuclides in food, cosmic radiation and gamma radiation from soil and building materials, the man-made sources are dominated by the diagnostic and therapeutic use of ionizing radiation. On the basis of measured levels of radon in Nordic dwellings and associated risk estimates for lung cancer derived from well-conducted epidemiological studies, we estimated that about 180 cases of lung cancer (1% of all lung cancer cases) per year could be avoided in the Nordic countries around the year 2000 if indoor exposure to radon were eliminated, and that an additional 720 cases (6%) could be avoided annually if either radon or tobacco smoking were eliminated. Similarly, it was estimated that the exposure of the Nordic populations to natural sources of ionizing radiation other than radon and to medical sources will each give rise to an annual total of 2120 cancers at various sites. For all types of ionizing radiation, the annual total will be 4420 cancer cases, or 3.9% of all cancers arising in the Nordic populations, with 3.4% in men and 4.4% in women.",Excluded
3791,"Examination of the optimal temporal resolution required for computed tomography coronary angiography Sub-second multidetector-row computed tomography systems provide great potential for the further improvement of CT coronary angiography (CTCA). However, because the temporal resolution (TR) of such CT systems is insufficient, blurring and artifacts produced by fast cardiac motion remain as unresolved issues. Previous TR investigations of CTCA were based on the retrospective electrocardiogram-gated multisegment reconstruction technique. However, the results obtained may not necessarily be correct because the TR of multisegment reconstruction may not be substantial due to the insufficient periodicity of cardiac motion. The optimal TR required for better CTCA images was evaluated with use of a dual-source CT system, which has various substantial TR modes (83, 125, and 165 ms). CTCA images of 147 patients with heart rates (HRs) ranging from 36 to 117 beats/minute (bpm) were evaluated visually on a 4-point scale. Our results revealed not only that the 165-ms TR is sufficient for low HRs (<=60 bpm), but also that the 83- and 125-ms TRs are unnecessary for such HRs. The image quality with the 125-ms TR mode was acceptable for the left anterior descending artery, left circumflex artery, and right coronary artery at low to intermediate HRs (<=70 bpm). At high HRs (>70 bpm), the 83-ms TR mode resulted in an excellent image quality for all cases except those with very rapid RCA motion. Adequate TRs for a wide range of heart rates (52-106 bpm) are thus clarified. © 2013 Japanese Society of Radiological Technology and Japan Society of Medical Physics.",Excluded
3872,"MR-Angiography in assessing the anatomy of the renal arteries before renal sympathetic denervation The paper presents comparative analysis of preoperation MR-angiography and X-ray angiography carried out before renal denervation of sympathetic plexus of renal arteries in patients with resistant arterial hypertension. Purpose. To compare the data of MRA and diagnostic X-ray angiography of the renal arteries to determine a method that allows you to plan in detail the renal denervation procedure. Materials and methods. 44 patients (16 men, 28 women; average age was 59.18 years) with a verified diagnosis: resistant hypertension, admitted to treatment (renal denervation). All patients underwent standard preoperative laboratory and instrumental diagnostics. Survey aortography with selective renal angiography and MR angiography were performed in all 44 (100%) patients. Results and conclusion. It has been shown that both methods are comparable in the detection of renal arteries stenosis, as well as in visualization of the main renal artery and of segment branches of arteries, and in measurement of their diameters. In most cases MR-angiography a little bit exaggerates the diameter of the artery for as low as 0.6-0.8 mm. Also MR-angiography do not deliver radiation exposure to a patient. Moreover, MRA provides the opportunity of sequential thin-slice imaging, and may separate branches of the renal arteries up to segment branches of 3-4 classes with high accuracy. In total, the MRA predicts the anatomic imaging with invasive catheter X-ray angiography and allows to plan it in details before renal sympathetic denervation.Copyright © 2019 Russian Electronic Journal of Radiology.

Methods Post-processing software was used to simulate C-arm angulations in two dimensions (oblique, cranial/caudal) for appropriate visualisation of distal landing zones at the iliac bifurcation during EVAR. Retrospectively, 27 consecutive EVAR patients (25 men, mean +/- SD age 73 +/- 7 years) were identified; one group of patients (NEW; n = 12 [23 iliac bifurcations]) was compared after implementation of the new method with a group of patients who received a historic method (OLD; n = 15 [23 iliac bifurcations]), treated with EVAR before the method was applied. Results In the OLD group, a median of 2.0 (interquartile range [IQR] 1-3) digital subtraction angiography runs were needed per iliac bifurcation versus 1.0 (IQR 1-1) runs in the NEW group (p = .007). The median dose area products per iliac bifurcation were 11951 mGy*cm2 (IQR 7308-16663 mGy*cm2) for the NEW, and 39394 mGy*cm2 (IQR 19066-53702 mGy*cm2) for the OLD group, respectively (p = .001). The median volume of contrast per iliac bifurcation was 13.0 mL (IQR: 13-13 mL) in the NEW and 26 mL (IQR 13-39 mL) in the OLD group (p = .007).

This recommendation is largely based on the findings of the National Lung Screening Trial. Both policy-level and clinical decision-making about LDCT screening must consider the potential benefits of screening (reduced mortality from lung cancer) and possible harms. Effective screening requires an appreciation that screening should be limited to individuals at high risk of death from lung cancer, and that the risk of harm related to false positive findings, overdiagnosis, and unnecessary invasive testing is real.

4164,"Knowledge and risk perception among nuclear power plant employees This is a study of knowledge, risk perception, and attitudes among nuclear power plant employees. A total of 236 persons participated, belonging to 10 different professional groups and working at two Swedish power plants. Job-related radiation risks were judged about average as compared to a number of other risks. On the whole, the participants in the study were satisfied with the measures of safety at work, but there were some exceptions to this rule, especially among those hired for temporary jobs through external contractors. The experience of job-related radiation risks was related to the level of knowledge about radiation and its risks: those who knew less experienced larger risks. General level of anxiety did not correlate with risk perception. The latter was accounted for mainly by perceived radiation risks. Job satisfaction was more strongly related to perceived conventional job risks than to nuclear risks. Risk ratings were related to how subjects defined the concept of risk. Those who stressed consequences as part of their risk definition gave higher risk ratings.",Excluded
4756,"Palliative local radiotherapy in the treatment of tumor-stage Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma/mycosis fungoides Objective To determine the efficacy of palliative radiotherapy in treating tumor-stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma/mycosis fungoides (MF). Methods From January 2008 to January 2013, a total of 11 patients with tumor-stage MF were treated with local radiation therapy in Peking Union Medical College Hospital. The median age of these patients was 53.36+/-14.45 years. Female-male ratio was 1:1.2. The average course of disease was 10.82+/-3.37 years. All the patients were treated with local electronic beam irradiation with a total median dosage of 48.55+/-9.51 (40-74) Gy in an average of 24.55+/-5.57 (20-40) fractions, 5 fractions per week. Results The median follow-up time was 55.27+/-29.3 (13-103) months. No severe acute or chronic side effects of irradiation were observed. Complete clinical response (CR) rate of the radiated sites was 54.5% (6/11), partial response (PR) rate was 36.4% (4/11), and the overall response rate (CR+PR) was 90.9%. One patient showed no response.

4143,"[Safety and feasibility of intracoronary brachytherapy with the Novoste system within the scope of international multicenter studies] UNLABELLED: Clinical trials are increasingly investigating the effects of intracoronary radiation for the treatment of de-novo lesions, restenosis (without stents), and in-stent restenosis. As the first group in Germany, we had the opportunity to use the Novoste system within the international multicenter studies BETA-CATH, START and BRIE and report our preliminary experience regarding safety and feasibility of intracoronary brachytherapy with this afterloader. A total of 95 patients were enrolled. The Novoste system was used in 92 patients (104 lesions). Ischemic complications were not observed; therefore, radiation was performed as planned. The mean applied dose was 16 +/- 2 Gy (14-20 Gy, at 2 mm distance) and mean exposure time was 202 +/- 27 s (165-261 s). The addition of brachytherapy increased the total duration of the intervention for 17 +/- 8 min. At the body surface of the patients, the following dose rates were measured: left chest wall: 99 +/- 52 microSv/h; groin 3 +/- 3 microSv/h. All patients received ASS 300 mg/d o.d. Patients with stent implantation in the same session received 250 mg b.i.d. Ticlopidin or 75 mg Clopidogrel o.d. for at least three months. Total mortality and infarct rate was 0. There was no acute, subacute or late stent thrombosis., CONCLUSION: Our first experience with the Novoste Beta-Cath system showed that intracoronary brachytherapy can be safely and simply performed in the cath lab. There were no acute complications. To avoid the possible risk of late stent thrombosis, Ticlopidin or Clopidogrel must be administered for at least three months.",Excluded
4232,"Cumulative radiation dose from medical imaging procedures in patients undergoing resection for lung cancer Background: Radiation dose from diagnostic imaging procedures is not monitored in patients undergoing surgery for lung cancer. Evidence suggests an increased lifetime risk of malignancy of 1.0% per 100 millisieverts (mSv). As such, recommendations are to restrict healthcare and radiation workers to a maximum dose of 50 mSv per year or to 100 mSv over a three-year period. The purpose of this study was to estimate cumulative effective doses of radiation in patients undergoing lung cancer resection and to determine predictors of increased exposure. Method(s): We identified 94 consecutive patients undergoing resection for non-small cell lung cancer. Radiologic procedures performed from one year prior to resection until two years postresection were recorded. Estimates of effective doses (mSv) were obtained from published literature and institutional records. Predictors of dose greater than 50 mSv per year and greater than 100 mSv per three years were examined statistically. Result(s): The majority of patients (median age = 67 years) had stage IA cancer (52%). In the three-year period, patients had 1,958 radiologic studies (20.8/patient) including 398 computed tomographic (CT) scans (4.23/patient) and 211 positron emission tomography (PET) scans (2.24 per patient). The three-year median estimated radiation dose was 84.0 mSv (interquartile range, 44.1 to 123.2 mSv). The highest dose was in the preoperative year. In any one year, 66% of patients received more than 50 mSv, while 19% received over 100 mSv. Over the three-year period, 43.6% of patients exceeded 100 mSv. The majority of the radiation (89.8%) was from CT or PET scans. On multivariate analysis, a history of previous malignancy (odds ratio [OR] 3.8; confidence interval [CI] 1.14 to 12.7), postoperative complications (OR 6.16; CI 1.42 to 26.6), and postoperative surveillance with PET-CT (OR 13.2; CI 4.34 to 40.3) predicted exposure greater than 100 mSv over the three-year period. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates that lung cancer patients often receive a higher dose of radiation than that considered safe for healthcare and radiation workers. The median cumulative dose reported in this study could potentially increase the individual estimated lifetime cancer risk by as much as 0.8%. Although risk-benefit considerations are clearly different between these groups, strategies should be in place to decrease radiation doses during the preoperative workup and postoperative period. © 2011 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.",Excluded

The Timika X-ray score has been proposed as a tool for measuring disease severity and predicting treatment outcome., OBJECTIVE: To evaluate inter- and intra-reader agreement of Timika scores and assess the ability of the score to predict microbiologic outcome at 2 months., DESIGN: Analytical validation study. Disease severity was measured by two readers using pretreatment radiographs and follow-up films taken at 2, 6 and 12 months after the start of treatment among 110 human immunodeficiency virus negative adults with pulmonary TB. One fourth of the films were reread to assess intra-reader agreement., RESULTS: The two-component Timika score had high inter- and intra-reader agreement (intraclass correlation (ICC)inter = 75%, ICCintra > 0.81). Baseline Timika score was associated with positive month 2 smear (P = 0.0004) and culture status (P = 0.03). The average Timika score declined significantly over the course of successful treatment., CONCLUSION: The Timika score showed good inter- and intra-reader agreement and a significant association with microbiological outcomes after 2 months of treatment.

Study Design: A case-control study. Place and Duration of Study: Orthopedics and Traumatology Department, Bozok University Medical Faculty, Yozgat, Turkey, from 2012 to 2014. Methodology: Patients diagnosed with OA (n=94) and patients who did not have joint complaints (n=279) were enrolled in this study. Patients diagnosed with osteoarthritis according to the 1986 American College of Rheumatology osteoarthritis criteria and Kellgren and Lawrence scores were investigated, based on age, gender, and X-ray findings. Blood samples were taken for the identification of GDF5 (rs143383) SNPs by PCR/RFLP, according to a standard protocol. Result(s): This study included 373 patients. The OA group (25.2%; n=94) was characterized by specific genotypes: TT (39.4%; n=37); heterozygotes (TC; 45.7%; n=43); and homozygotes (CC; 14.9%; n=14). The control group (74.8%; n=279) was comprised of TT (26.5%; n=74), TC (54.8%; n=153), and CC (18.6%; n=52) genotypes. An analysis of rs143383 SNP of the GDF5 gene polymorphism revealed that the rs143383 TT genotype had a higher risk for OA (crude OR=1.798, 95% CI=1.010-2.941, p=0.021).

Exposure was measured using a personal exposure meter EME SPY 140. Mean values of exposure levels from different radiofrequency sources were calculated using both naive and robust regression on order statistics approaches. The total daily exposure from all radiofrequency electromagnetic field sources varied widely among participants depending on their location, the mobile network they use, their activities, and their mode of transportation, ranging from about 0.2 V m to 0.9 V m. The average total daily exposure of all participants was about 0.48 V m. The main contribution to the mean exposure was from WiFi 2G (45%), GSM900 uplink (19%), GSM900 downlink, and FM radiobroadcasting (each by 11%). Other sources including GSM1800, UMTS2100, WiFi 5G, DECT, TETRA, WiMAX, and TV bands all together contributed 14%. During different activities, participants were exposed to the highest exposure level while traveling and to the lowest exposure while they were sleeping.

This study aims to analyze the long-term oncologic and functional outcomes of a large cohort of patients and to determine prognostic factors. Study Design: Retrospective cohort study. Method(s): The records of all patients diagnosed with hypopharyngeal SCC and treated with curative intent at our tertiary referral center were reviewed. Patient and initial disease characteristics, features, and complications of primary treatment, recurrence patterns, and corresponding treatments and the oncologic and functional long-term outcome were determined. Result(s): For a total of 179 patients, primary radiotherapy (RT) was the predominant treatment modality (78%), whereas 22% underwent primary surgery. The median, 2-year, and 5-year overall survival (OS) for the study cohort were 47 months, 64% and 43%. The median survival after first and second relapse was 7 and 6 months, respectively. The 2 and 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) was 52% and 36%. The median RFS after first relapse and salvage treatment was 9 months.

A hand-held gamma-detecting probe was used during operation to determine whether gross tumor accumulated the radiolabeled analog and occult tumor could be detected. Positive uptake was defined as tumor/background ratios exceeding 2:1., RESULTS: The tumor in all seven patients with gross disease accumulated 125I-TYR(3)-octreotide. Occult tumor beyond that appreciated with preoperative imaging or by routine operative exploration was detected in a patient with carcinoid tumor. In the patient with the occult gastrinoma the probe detected the lesion within the duodenal bulb before duodenotomy and also predicted what proved histologically to be positive peripancreatic adenopathy. There was a single false-positive reading from the stomach in a patient with suspected carcinoid tumor in whom no tumor could be found grossly or histologically. A pancreatic mass that probed negative proved to be an adenocarcinoma of ductal origin., CONCLUSIONS: Tumor-specific peptide-receptor binding can be detected in situ with 125J-TYR(3)-octreotide and a hand-held gamma-detecting probe. This technique may facilitate neuroendocrine tumor localization and operative cytoreduction.",Excluded
4897,"Comparison of nodal irradiation dose using radiotherapy for patients with thoracic esophageal cancer The present study aimed to compare incidental nodal irradiation (INI) doses using volume-modulated arc therapy (VMAT), 5-field intensity-modulated radiotherapy (5F-IMRT) and 3D-conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) treatment plans for patients with thoracic esophageal cancer (EC). A total of 15 patients with thoracic EC were selected for participation between October 2016 and July 2017 at the Hangzhou Cancer Hospital. Regional lymph nodal stations were contoured according to 3D CT-based images of the Japan Esophageal Society Guidelines. All patients were treated with 60 Gy using VMAT, 5F-IMRT and 3D-CRT plans. Dose-volume histograms of planning target volume (PTV), lung, heart, spinal cord and incidental nodal irradiation were compared between the three plans. 5F-IMRT was superior in PTV_V95% (the volume of the PTV receiving 95% of the prescription dose, P=0.003) and the VMAT plan was best in terms of conformal index (P=0.005). V20 and V30were reduced by 10.7-22.6% (P=0.002) and 12.8-21% (P=0.026), respectively, in normal lung tissue using the VMAT plan. 5F-IMRT demonstrated the lowest maximum dose (Dmax) for the spinal cord (P=0.037). For the INI, 3D-CRT exhibited the highest equivalent uniform dose (EUD) values for 106pre (P=0.014) and 106tb-L (P=0.03) in upper-thoracic EC. The mean EUD of all lymph nodal regions in middle-thoracic EC were >40 Gy in VMAT and 5F-IMRT plans; the VMAT plan had higher EUD values in lower-thoracic EC compared with 5F-IMRT, 3D-CRT plans for INI. VMAT were comparable to the 5F-IMRT plan with respect to dosimetric characteristics for planning and INI doses to thoracic nodal levels NO 105-112 are considerable for thoracic EC.Copyright © 2020 Spandidos Publications.

4034,"Influence of previous radiation exposure on pathologic features and clinical outcome in patients with thyroid cancer Objective: To determine whether previous radiation exposure to the head and neck is related to less favorable pathologic and clinical outcome in patients after surgical management of thyroid cancer. Design(s): Retrospective chart review. Setting(s): Academic teaching hospital (referral center). Patient(s): All patients with diagnosed thyroid cancer who had been exposed to radiation before surgical treatment were retrospectively identified from the thyroid cancer database at our institution (1963-2007). One hundred twenty-five patients (95 women and 30 men) were included. Inclusion criteria included surgical treatment for thyroid cancer and a history of exposure to radiation at least 3 years before diagnosis of the disease. Main Outcome Measure(s): Pathologic features and data related to disease recurrence, distant metastasis, and survival. Result(s): Mean (range) age at first exposure to radiation was 19.4 (1-65) years, and mean lag time to diagnosis of disease was 28.7 (3-60) years. Patients were treated surgically with either total or near-total thyroidectomy (83%) or partial or subtotal thyroidectomy (17%). Pathologic diagnoses included 111 papillary carcinomas (89%). Sixty- three percent of patients had multifocal disease, 12% had lymphovascular tumor invasion, and 26% had direct ex- trathyroid extension of disease. Twenty-five percent of patients had metastases to cervical lymph nodes, and 9% had distant metastases. Sixteen percent of patients experienced local recurrence of disease. At last follow-up, 86% of patients were alive and free of disease, 8% were alive with disease, 4% had died of thyroid cancer, and 2% had died of an unrelated cause. Compared with other patients with thyroid cancer, this radiation-exposed cohort was more likely to undergo total thyroidectomy, multiple operative procedures, and external radiotherapy. A higher percentage had multifocal disease, extrathyroid extension, stage IV disease, and distant metastases. At follow-up, fewer patients were free of disease, and more patients had died of thyroid disease. Conclusion(s): Patients who have been exposed to radiation have more aggressive disease and worse clinical outcome than other patients with thyroid cancer. © 2009 American Medical Association.

4832,"Radiation-dose response of glycophorin A somatic mutation in erythrocytes associated with gene polymorphisms of p53 binding protein 1 Information on individual variations in response to ionizing radiation is still quite limited. Previous studies of atomic-bomb survivors revealed that somatic mutations at the glycophorin A (GPA) gene locus in erythrocytes were significantly elevated with radiation exposure dose, and that the dose response was significantly higher in survivors with subsequent cancer development compared to those without cancer development. Noteworthy in these studies were great inter-individual differences in GPA mutant fraction even in persons with similar radiation doses. It is hypothesized that persistent GPA mutations in erythrocytes of atomic-bomb survivors are derived from those in long-lived hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) populations, and that individual genetic backgrounds, specifically related to DNA double-strand break repair, contribute to individual differences in HSC mutability following radiation exposure. Thus, we examined the relationship between radiation exposure, GPA mutant fraction in erythrocytes, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the key gene involved in DNA double-strand break repair, p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1). 53BP1 SNPs and inferred haplotypes demonstrated a significant interaction with radiation dose, suggesting that radiation-dose response of GPA somatic mutation is partly dependent on 53BP1 genotype. It is also possible that 53BP1 plays a significant role in DNA double-strand break repair in HSCs following radiation exposure. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded
4127,"Radiation and host factors in human thyroid tumors following thymus irradiation In this paper thyroid tumor data from the 1971 survey of the Rochester, New York thymus irradiated population are further analyzed to study radiobiological and host factors. The analyses were based on the approximately 2650 irradiated subjects and 4800 sibling controls who had 5 or more years of follow-up. Twenty-four thyroid cancers and 52 thyroid adenomas were found in the irradiated group, and 0 thyroid cancers and 6 adenomas among the controls. The overall risk estimates were 3.8 thyroid cancers/106 PY-rad and 4.5 thyroid adenomas/106 PY-rad. The dose-response data (thyroid dose range of 5 to > 1000 rad) for thyroid cancer indicate both a linear and a dose-squared component, but no dose-squared component is evident for thyroid adenomas. At lower total doses (< 400 rad) there was a suggestion that dose fractionation diminished the thyroid cancer response, but a similar fractionation effect was not found for thyroid adenomas. The temporal pattern of tumors suggested an extended plateau of excess tumor production, rather than a 'wavelike' temporal pattern. There was no evidence for an inverse relationship between thyroid radiation dose and thyroid cancer latency. Female and Jewish subjects had a higher risk of radiation-induced thyroid cancer than did their respective counterparts. The additive and multiplicative models of radiation effects were compared with respect to sex differences; neither model provided a superior fit to the data. The tentative nature of the conclusion is stressed because of the relatively small number of thyroid cancers.",Included
4687,"Individually adapted examination protocols for reduction of radiation exposure in chest CT RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To develop a simple directive for the reduction of radiation exposure without loss of diagnostic information in routine chest CT examinations., METHODS: Two hundred fifty adult patients (164 male, 86 female) were entered into a prospective trial. All examinations were performed with a multislice CT technique (Somatom Volume Zoom, Siemens). Four groups of 50 patients each were scanned with patient-related specific parameters: individual mA-s values were derived from the estimated body weight: kilograms + 10, +/- 0, - 10, and - 20 mAs. The results were compared with those of 50 patients who were examined by a standard chest protocol by using the parameters 120 mAs and 140 kV. All other parameters including the tube voltage were kept constant. Subjective image quality was rated on a three-point scale: 1 = excellent, 2 = fair, 3 = nondiagnostic. In addition, objective criteria based on signal-to-noise measurements were assessed by using a region-of-interest methodology., RESULTS: Image quality was sufficient in all cases. Mean subjective gradings of image quality, based on soft-tissue window settings, were 1.1 for the 120-mAs protocol, 1.1 for the (body weight [kg] + 10) mAs protocol, 1.1 for the (body weight [kg] +/- 0) mAs protocol, 1.3 for the (body weight [kg] - 10) mAs protocol, and 1.2 for the (body weight [kg] - 20) mAs protocol. Objective criteria based on noise measurements showed mean +/- standard deviation values of 5.7 +/- 0.8 Hounsfield units (HU) for the 120-mAs protocol. For the reduced-dose protocols, values were calculated as 7.6 +/- 1.2 HU (group + 10), 7.9 +/- 1.3 HU (group +/- 0), 8.7 +/- 1.2 HU (group - 10), and finally 9.1 +/- 1.3 HU (group - 20). The best correlation for an entire subgroup was achieved with the - 10 protocol (body weight [kg] - 10) mAs, with nearly constant noise related to body weight in all patients., CONCLUSIONS: By deriving mAs values from body weight estimation, an individually adapted protocol for chest CT can be recommended and easily employed in a clinical setting. With an adaptation of the tube current-time product based on the estimated body weight of the patient - 10 (body weight [kg] - 10 mAs), a well-balanced examination without significant loss of information, even in soft-tissue window settings, can be performed with this particular scanner. For this adapted mAs protocol, a mean reduction of radiation exposure of 45% was achievable, compared with the standard protocol. A maximum decrease per case down to 31 mAs was obtained, without relevant loss of image quality. Therefore, for other types of CT scanners, analogous protocols may be adapted.",Excluded

We compared the survival outcomes of these patients to those of patients with LD (n = 29) or other ED (n = 38) during the same period. Three patients had progression of BM at completion of chemotherapy. Ten patients received whole-brain radiotherapy (4 prophylactic, 6 therapeutic), and remaining one elderly patient underwent stereotactic radiosurgery. Finally, 8 and 3 patients achieved a CR or PR of BM, respectively. Five remained free of progression for 21.1-73.2 months. The progression-free and overall survival outcomes of ED-SCLC with brain only metastases were comparable to those of LD and superior to those of other ED.

Method(s): Seventy-eight lesions of brain metastases in 49 lung cancer patients treated by stereotactic radiotherapy between September 2003 and December 2006 were analyzed. In the treatment planning, the planning target volume (PTV) was defined as an enhanced lesion plus 3 mm margin. A total dose of 39-42 Gy in three fractions was delivered to the isocenters of the PTV. Result(s): The median survival time after stereotactic radiotherapy was 17.4 months. The 1- and 2-year survival rates were 61% and 32%, respectively. The presence of extracranial tumors, the pre-treatment performance status, and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group recursive partitioning analysis class were significant prognostic factors. The 1-and 2-year local recurrence rates were 14% and 17%, respectively, with no serious acute toxic effect. Injuries involving brain necrosis were observed in six patients. New brain metastases or meningeal carcinomatosis was seen in more than half of the patients following treatment with stereotactic radiotherapy.

4463,"Persistence of chromatid aberrations in the cells of solid mouse tissues exposed to 137Cs gamma radiation Primary mouse ear and kidney cultures were established for determination of cytogenetic aberrations at short (3 days to 1 month) and long (12-23 months) times after exposure of their right sides to 7.5 Gy of (137)Cs gamma radiation. In every case, higher levels of aberrations were observed in primary cultures established from the irradiated tissues than in those established from the contralateral tissues. The most common aberrations in the contralateral tissues and those from nonirradiated mice were chromatid and isochromatid breaks and small chromatid fragments. Primary cells from irradiated tissues removed from animals within a month of exposure displayed a variety of unstable chromosome-type aberrations characteristic of recent exposure to ionizing radiation including rings, dicentrics, double minutes, and large acentric fragments. The percentages of cells exhibiting chromatid breaks and small chromatid fragments were also markedly elevated. Although the levels of chromosome-type aberrations found in primary cells from irradiated tissues dropped to near background levels a year or more after exposure, chromatid-type aberrations remained elevated. These results are consistent with long-term persistence of damage in the genomes of ionizing radiation-exposed cells in solid tissues and the induction of genomic instability in vivo.",Included
4221,"Butterfly wing colours: scale beads make white pierid wings brighter The wing-scale morphologies of the pierid butterflies Pieris rapae (small white) and Delias nigrina (common jezabel), and the heliconine Heliconius melpomene are compared and related to the wing-reflectance spectra. Light scattering at the wing scales determines the wing reflectance, but when the scales contain an absorbing pigment, reflectance is suppressed in the absorption wavelength range of the pigment. The reflectance of the white wing areas of P. rapae, where the scales are studded with beads, is considerably higher than that of the white wing areas of H. melpomene, which has scales lacking beads. The beads presumably cause the distinct matt-white colour of the wings of pierids and function to increase the reflectance amplitude. This will improve the visual discrimination between conspecific males and females. Copyright 2004 The Royal Society",Excluded

Method(s): Medical records (clinical characteristics and management) and imaging data (X-ray findings, CT findings, and fluoroscopic findings) of 12 patients with CPCE after PVP between October 2015 and July 2018 at our hospital were collected and examined retrospectively. Their health conditions were also evaluated through a telephone follow-up survey. Result(s): Twelve patients with an average age of 76.8+/-8.5 years were included in our study. One patient who had a cardiac cement embolus and one patient who suffered from an inferior vena cava (IVC) cement embolus were successfully treated via percutaneous retrieval. Ten asymptomatic patients with pulmonary cement embolus (PCE) were managed with conservative observation. All of the patients were alive and remained asymptomatic during the follow-up period (median time, 6.5 months; range, 1-50 months). Conclusion(s): More attention should be paid to the possibility of development of CPCE. For patients with cardiac cement embolus, open heart surgery should be considered as a preferred treatment, and percutaneous procedure could be used as an alternative treatment for patients with surgical contraindication or other surgical high-risk factors. For patients with an IVC cement spike, percutaneous retrieval could be recommended. Careful observation and clinical follow-up could be recommended for patients with asymptomatic peripheral or central PCEs.Copyright © 2019 AME Publishing Company. All rights reserved.",Excluded
4584,"Scintigraphic studies of rectal emptying in patients with constipation and defecatory difficulty We prospectively evaluated 38 adult patients with chronic constipation with and without defecatory difficulties using a newly described scintigraphic test to measure rectal emptying and compared them to 20 healthy controls. All patients underwent anorectal manometry, and 30 who complained of infrequent defecation underwent a colonic transit study using radiopaque markers. Control subjects promptly evacuated both 100 ml and 200 ml artificial stool in a characteristic fashion, but three evacuated none of the 100-ml volume and two had no evacuation of the 200-ml stool (inhibited controls). Constipated patients exhibited three patterns of emptying: (1) normal emptying of both volumes (47%); (2) poor emptying of both volumes or inhibited defecation (29%); and (3) normal emptying of the 200-ml but abnormal evacuation of the 100-ml volume (24%). An abnormal expulsion pattern during manometry occurred in 21% of patients and was strongly associated with the inhibited defecation pattern. However, defecation patterns could not be predicted on the basis of age, gender, symptoms, duration of complaints, colonic transit, or other rectal manometric parameters. Although rectal scintigraphy has potential advantages as a diagnostic test in terms of quantitation and decreased radiation exposure, the inability of the test to distinguish patients with slow transit constipation and defecatory complaints makes the potential utility of this test of uncertain value in clinical and investigative settings.",Excluded
4871,"Lung cancer and cigarette smoking in Europe: An update of risk estimates and an assessment of inter-country heterogeneity Ten case-control studies have been carried out in 6 European countries to investigate the major risk factors for lung cancer. Carcinogenic effect from cigarette smoke was the most relevant interest in our study, which has included 7,609 cases of lung cancer and 10,431 controls, mainly population based. The results indicate elevated odds ratios (ORs; 23.9 among men and 8.7 among women) with attributable risks exceeding 90% for men and close to 60% for women. A large, and statistically significant, variability of the results across countries was detected after adjusting for the most common confounding variables, and after controlling, at least in part, for the instability of the ORs due to the small number of non-smokers in some of the study subsets. This pattern of lung cancer risk associated with cigarettes smoke, across different European regions, reflects inherent characteristics of the studies as well as differences in smoking habits, particularly calender periods of starting, and it is likely to have been influenced by effect modifiers like indoor radon exposure, occupation, air pollution and dietary habits. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Excluded
3756,"Radiation sensitivity in vitro of primary tumors and metastatic lesions of malignant melanoma The radiation sensitivity of cells isolated directly from surgical specimens of the primary tumor and one to three distant metastases in ten different melanoma patients was measured in vitro using the Courtenay soft agar colony assay. Dose-response curves were fitted to the cell survival data by the method of least squares using the multitarget-single hit and the linear-quadratic models. The ten patients could be divided into three distinct groups. Group I consisted of four patients with radioresistant primary tumors (D0s from 1.38 +/- 0.06 Gy to 1.69 +/- 0.08 Gy). The radiation sensitivity of the metastases (D0s from 1.33 +/- 0.10 Gy to 1.73 +/- 0.06 Gy) was not significantly different from that of the primary tumor in this group; i.e., no heterogeneity was observed. Group II consisted of three patients with radiosensitive primary tumors (D0s from 0.84 +/- 0.06 Gy to 0.91 +/- 0.05 Gy). Heterogeneity was not observed in this group either; i.e., all metastases were radiosensitive (D0s from 0.85 +/- 0.05 Gy to 1.00 +/- 0.06 Gy). Group III consisted of three patients with a heterogeneous disease. The primary tumor of all patients in this group was radiosensitive (D0s from 0.85 +/- 0.05 Gy to 1.03 +/- 0.05 Gy). The most radioresistant metastasis in each patient was significantly (P much less than 0.05) more resistant (D0s from 1.46 +/- 0.06 Gy to 1.56 +/- 0.07 Gy) than the primary tumor. None of the metastases were significantly more radiosensitive than the primary tumor in any patient. These observations suggest that the progression of tumors to increased levels of malignancy includes the increased ability to become radioresistant, and it may be speculated that similar genomic alterations are responsible for the development of the metastatic and the radioresistant tumor cell phenotype. If so, this may have severe implications for the treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma with low linear energy transfer ionizing radiation as well as for the development of predictive assays for tumor treatment sensitivity.",Excluded
3973,"The radiologic technologists' health study in South Korea: study design and baseline results PURPOSE: To describe the study design, methods, and baseline results of a prospective cohort of radiologic technologists which we have initiated in South Korea., METHODS: The cohort participants were enrolled through a self-administered questionnaire survey administered from April 2012 to May 2013. Survey data were linked with radiation dosimetry, a cancer registry, and health insurance data by personal identification numbers. A nationwide representative survey was also conducted using a stratified random sampling design with face-to-face interviews., RESULTS: A total of 12,387 radiologic technologists were enrolled, which accounted for approximately 63% of all diagnostic radiologic technologists working in South Korea. For nationwide survey, 585 workers were interviewed using the detailed questionnaire, and buccal cells were also collected by scraping the inside of the cheek. The majority of study subjects were under 50-year-old and male workers. The average annual effective dose of radiation declined both men (from 2.75 to 1.43 mSv) and women (from 1.34 to 0.95 mSv) over the period of 1996-2011. A total of 99 cancers (66 cancers in men and 33 in women) were reported from 1992 to 2010. The standardized incidence ratio of all cancer combined was significantly lower in men (SIR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.58-0.96) than general population, but the ratios for thyroid cancer were significantly higher than expected among both men and women., CONCLUSIONS: This cohort provides comprehensive information on work activities and health status of diagnostic radiologic technologists. In addition, the nationwide representative sample provides unique opportunities compared with previous radiologic technologist studies.",Excluded
4820,"Optic radiation tractography and visual field deficits in laser interstitial thermal therapy for amygdalohippocampectomy in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy Background/Aims: Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) has become an alternative to open-resective surgery for refractory mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). Occurrence of visual field defects (VFDs) following open surgery for MTLE is reported at 52-100%. We examined the rate of VFDs following LITT for amygdalohippocampectomy (AHE) and correlated the occurrence of VFDs with damage to the optic radiations, assessed by diffusion tensor tractography (DTI). Method(s): We performed a retrospective analysis of 5 patients who underwent LITT-AHE for medically refractory MTLE. We examined the association between VFDs and optic radiation damage by correlating postprocedural visual field testing with qualitative assessment of optic radiation fiber tracts. Result(s): Postoperative assessments showed that 4 patients had normal visual field testing, and 1 had a right superior quadrantanopsia (20%). We performed 3-dimensional reconstruction of the optic radiation, laser probe trajectory, and ablation volume. Damage to Meyer's loop was determined consistent with the VFD. Conclusion(s): Short-term follow-up in our series suggests that laser ablation AHE may be associated with a lower rate of VFD than has been reported for open AHE. Our results suggest that incorporating optic radiation mapping through DTI may preoperatively help to minimize the risk of VFD following laser ablation AHE.Copyright © 2017 S.

4494,"Relative Safety of External Beam Radiation Therapy in Lung Transplant Recipients Who Develop Thoracic Malignancies We report outcomes for three patients who previously received lung transplants, subsequently developed malignancies, and were given radiation therapy to the chest for treatment of their cancers despite lack of scientific data on radiation tolerance of transplanted lung. None of three patients exhibited early or delayed adverse reactions to radiotherapy. For these three cases, the mean dose to the ipsilateral transplanted lung was 10 Gy, and ipsilateral lung relative volume of lung receiving 20 Gy or more was, on average, 22%. These doses are relatively low and would have been considered safe for patients with native lungs. In our opinion, tolerance of transplanted lung to therapeutic radiotherapy clearly requires additional research. While those data are pending, radiation therapy to the thorax should not be ruled out on the basis of having a lung transplant alone, provided lung dose can be maintained as low as possible using meticulous treatment planning.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

3769,"Risk of covid-19 infection of a bariatric surgery cohort at the beginning of the pandemic Background: Obesity is a known risk factor for COVID-19. The first case in New York was reported in March 1st, 2020 but it is believed that the virus was already spreading during the prior months. In our institution, bariatric surgery was carried out as usual until March 18th, at which time 92 cases of COVID-19 were already admitted. We believe that bariatric patients could have been exposed to COVID-19 during this overlap and sought to evaluate incidence of infection among this high-risk cohort at our institution. We sought to determine the incidence of COVID-19 in patients undergoing bariatric surgery during the preceding months of the pandemic. Method(s): This is a cross-sectional study from a single major bariatric center in the Bronx, New York. Patients who underwent bariatric surgery from January to March 2020 were included. Medical records were assessed looking COVID-19 symptoms and/or diagnosis. Additionally, phone interviews were made looking for COVID-19 symptoms and/or diagnosis outside our institution after the index operation. Result(s): A total of 203 patients were included. Eleven patients (5.4%) had post-op symptoms such as fever, cough and shortness of breath. Of those, 2 tested positive, 1 tested negative, 1 was diagnosed with X-ray findings, 6 were not tested and 1 had an alternate diagnosis. Additionally, 6 patients were tested negative without symptoms for different reasons. None of the patients identified had a severe disease.

Five percent of the patients who underwentbariatric surgery developed postoperative symptoms and 1.5% was actually diagnosed with the disease.",Excluded
4358,"Tube placement using 'IRIS': A pilot assessment of its utility and safety INTRODUCTION: Most critically ill patients have a feeding tube placed blindly, but 0.5% result in a major lung complication because misplacement is only detected at the end of procedure. Real-time guided tube placement may pre-empt such complications. This clinical effectiveness study examined the ability to visualise anatomy using KangarooTM feeding tubes with IRIS technology ('IRIS' tube). METHOD(S): In a single centre, gastric or intestinal integrated real-time imaging system (IRIS) tubes were prospectively placed in critically ill patients noting the anatomical visualisation. RESULT(S): Of 15 placements, 13 were successful gastric placements and used for feeding but one gastric and one intestinal placement failed because of signal loss and inability to find the pylorus, respectively; both tubes were removed. Air insufflation and fluid aspiration were possible with all tubes. Respiratory misplacement was clearly differentiated, prior to reaching the main carina, from gastrointestinal (GI) anatomical markers, permitting removal before causing trauma. Furthermore, non-traumatic placement was visualised in high-risk cases including during advancement through a nostril with a base of skull fracture and into a stomach with a recently haemorrhaging gastric polyp. Individually assessed, direct vision may offer greater safety. X-ray or pH of aspirated fluid confirmed the position of GI tube placements. One adverse event occurred during placement, reversible bradycardia, in a patient previously having bradycardia. Vision was intermittently obscured by bile, mucus or impaction with mucosa. CONCLUSION(S): 'IRIS' tubes offer real-time guidance regarding anatomical position. Larger studies are needed to establish the best techniques of deploying this equipment and over-coming the difficulties observed.Crown Copyright © 2021. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

4938,"Radioiodine therapy in Graves' disease patients with large diffuse goiters treated with or without carbimazole at the time of radioiodine therapy We S ought to ascertain how high the success rates of radioiodine therapy are for Graves' disease patients with large diffuse goiters when aiming for a constant absorbed dose of 250 Gy. Thirty-six patients with a thyroid volume of 50-110 mL were evaluated for changes in thyroid function and appearance 3, 6, and 12 months after radioiodine therapy. Success was defined as definitive elimination of hyperthyroidism following therapy (hypothyroidism corrected with thyroxine on diagnosis); failure as persistent/recurrent hyperthyroidism after 12 months. Overall success rate was 50%. However, a subgroup of 20 patients without simultaneous carbimazole (carbimazole-off) showed a highly significantly larger success rate (85%) than the 16 patients with simultaneous carbimazole (carbimazole-on) at the time of radioiodine therapy (6.3%, p< 0.000005). Successful cases showed a significantly higher volume reduction after radioiodine than failures (75.5% vs. 35.4%, p < 0.00005). Stepwise logistic regression showed that therapy failure was related to administration of carbimazole during radioiodine therapy (p < 0.0250 and absorbed dose (p < 0.05), but not thyroid function (free triiodothyronine [FT3] and free thyroxine [FT4]), initial thyroid volume or thyrotropin-receptor antibody (TRAb) value. However, a significant correlation of therapy success to absorbed dose (r = 0.69, p < 0.005) could be shown only for carbimazole-off patients, but not for the others. Finally, multivariate favor analysis consistently showed that therapy success was correlated only to absorbed dose and antithyroid drugs, not to initial thyroid volume, TRAb value, or thyroid function. Thyroid volume per se is not responsible for the lower success rate in Graves' disease patients with large goiters because even a comparable group of 32 Graves' disease patients with small thyroid glands (<=20 mL) and without simultaneous carbimazole showed a success rate of 87.5%. The high failure rate in the carbimazole-on patients (absorbed dose comparable to carbimazole-off) is due to the simultaneous administration of carbimazole. Therefore, if clinically feasible, we recommend discontinuing carbimazole at least one day before beginning radioiodine therapy.",Excluded

The maximum eye lens dose of 1492 mGy was measured at LOC region for an AVM case, followed by 907 mGy for an aneurysm case and 665 mGy for a diagnostic angiography procedure. Strong correlations (shown as R(2)) were observed between kerma-area-product and measured eye doses (LOC: 0.78, LE: 0.68). Lateral and frontal air-kerma showed strong correlations with measured dose at LOC (AKL: 0.93, AKF: 0.78) and a weak correlation with measured dose at LE. A moderate correlation was observed between fluoroscopic time and dose measured at LE and LOC regions., CONCLUSIONS: The MOSkin dose-monitoring system represents a new tool enabling real-time monitoring of eye lens dose during neuro-interventional procedures. This system can provide interventionalists with information needed to adjust the clinical procedure to control the patient's dose., KEY POINTS: Real-time patient dose monitoring helps interventionalists to monitor doses.

4103,"Subsequent cooling-circulation after radiofrequency and microwave ablation avoids secondary indirect damage induced by residual thermal energy PURPOSE We aimed to investigate the exact role of residual thermal energy following microwave ablation (MWA) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) at the final ablation and transition zones and determine whether residual thermal energy could be dissipated by subsequent cooling-circulation. METHODS In an ex vivo study, MWA and RFA were performed on fresh porcine liver, and central and border temperatures were compared. In an in vivo study, MWA and RFA were performed to the livers of New Zealand white rabbits. Tissue samples were stained with alpha-NADH-diaphorase. The coagulation zones (NADH-negative) and transition zones (lightly NADH-stained) of different groups were compared at different time points. RESULTS In the ex vivo model, the residual thermal energy after MWA and RFA could be dispersed by subsequent cooling-circulation due to the temperature decreasing rapidly. In the in vivo study, the coagulation volume in the ablation group was larger than that in the cooling-circulation group (P < 0.05) 2 days after ablation. In the ablation group, the damaged zone (the transition zone plus the coagulation zone) on alpha-NADH-diaphorase-stained images increased rapidly within 2 hours after ablation and slowly reached the maximum on day 2. However, the damaged zones did not change significantly at the three time points observed in the cooling-circulation group. CONCLUSION The residual thermal energy in MWA and RFA induced secondary damage beyond the direct coagulation zone, and it could be dissipated by subsequent cooling-circulation, contributing to smaller ablation and transition zones.Copyright © Turkish Society of Radiology 2019.",Excluded

4713,"Noncancer disease incidence in the atomic bomb survivors: 1958-1986 Using the longitudinal data of the Adult Health Study (AHS) cohort collected during 1958-1986, we examined for the first time the relationship between exposure to ionizing radiation and the incidence of 19 nonmalignant disorders in the A-bomb survivors. Affected individuals were ascertained through the three-digit codes of the International Classification of Diseases which are encoded in the AHS database subsequent to diagnoses made on the basis of general laboratory tests, physical examinations, and history-taking conducted during biennial AHS examinations. The disease onset time was estimated using the mid-point between the AHS examination data when the disease was initially reported and the previously attended disease-free examination date. Dosimetry System 86 organ doses judged to be most appropriate were used. Tests of dose effects were performed assuming a linear relative risk model with stratified background incidence. For the entire study period, significant excess risk was detected for uterine myoma (P < 0.001), chronic liver disease and cirrhosis (P = 0.006), and thyroid disease (P < 0.0001), defined broadly as the presence of one or more of certain noncancerous thyroid conditions. The incidence of myocardial infarction was shown to be increased (P = 0.03) in later years (1968-1986) among the younger heavily exposed AHS subjects, confirming the results of the recent Life Span Study (LSS) noncancer mortality report on coronary heart disease. The findings for uterine myoma may serve as additional evidence indicating benign tumor growth as a possible consequence of radiation exposure. Our results indicating the involvement of radiation in the development of liver diseases are consistent with the report of increased mortality from liver cirrhosis with radiation dose in the LSS cohort. An effect of age at exposure was detected for nonmalignant thyroid disease (P = 0.02), with an increased risk for those exposed who were under 20 years of age, but not for older survivors. Thus the AHS data suggest that thyroid glands in the young are more radiosensitive not only to the development of malignancies, but also to the development of nonmalignant disorders as well. The findings hold independently of the dose effects observed for thyroid cancer. This study also shows that for the period 1958-1986 new occurrences of lens opacity are not increased with radiation dose (P = 0.39) in the AHS subjects.",Included
4614,"Safety and effectiveness of de-escalated radiation dose in T1-3 nasopharyngeal carcinoma: A propensity matched analysis Backgrounds: With the excellent local control in T1 to T3 nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treated with intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), the importance of toxicities is increasingly being recognised. This retrospective propensity score analysis sought to assess whether moderate dose reduction compromised long-term outcome compared with standard dose in T1-3 NPCs. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 266 patients (67 female, 199 male) with a median age of 50 years between June 2011 and June 2015 were analysed. All were treated with IMRT, with or without systemic chemotherapy. The prescription radiation dose to gross tumor is 70Gy/2.12Gy/33F in our institution. Result(s): With a median follow-up time of 50 months, the 5-year loco-regional failure-free survival (LRFS) and overall survival (OS) were 93.5% and 81.8%, respectively. 32 patients received radiation dose less than prescription dose, with a median dose of 63.6Gy (53-67Gy). Another 234 patients received exactly the prescription dose of 70Gy. Propensity scores were computed (32 patients treated with de-escalated dose and 64 patients with standard dose), there was no significant difference in 5-year LRFS and 5-year OS between the two groups (92.5% and 91.7% with standard dose; 82.1% and 85.7% with de-escalation dose; p=0.863 for LRFS and 0.869 for OS). No independent prognostic factor was associated with loco-regional failure in univariate analysis. Conclusion(s): T1-3 nasopharyngeal carcinoma presenting with superior locoregional control, a moderately reduced dose (about 10%) delivered with IMRT resulted in comparable prognosis to those with prescription dose of 70Gy.Copyright © The author(s).",Excluded
4080,"Optimization of CT protocols for thyroid and parathyroid SPECT/CT imaging The first national survey of patient exposures from hybrid imaging in Nuclear Medicine, performed in Bulgaria in 2014, revealed that SPECT/CT imaging of either thyroid or parathyroid glands was performed by applying a CT scan of the whole anatomical region, neck and chest, subject to SPECT. In most cases it was not necessary to perform a CT scan matching the whole SPECT region. The aim of this study is to propose an optimized CT protocol by reducing the CT scan length. The standard CT protocols for both types of examinations included neck and chest scan with the same exposure data. After the optimization the CT scan was restricted to the region of radiopharmaceutical uptake. Comparison of scan length, dose-length product (DLP) and effective dose from the old and the new protocols was performed. Software was used to estimate effective dose from the CT scan separately for males and females. A total of 17 patients undergoing either thyroid or parathyroid examination received CT of the neck and chest before the optimization. After the introduction of the optimized protocol, data were collected for a total of 70 patients. The mean scan length for males was reduced from 39 to 22 cm (42% reduction) and for females the reduction was from 44 to 22 cm (50%). The mean DLP was decreased by about 34% (from 138 to 91 mGy.cm) for * males and 48% (from 147 to 77 mGy.cm) for females respectively.

4887,"Radiation exposure of computed tomography imaging for the assessment of acute stroke Purpose: To assess suspected acute stroke, the computed tomography (CT) protocol contains a non-contrast CT (NCCT), a CT angiography (CTA), and a CT perfusion (CTP). Due to assumably high radiation doses of the complete protocol, the aim of this study is to examine radiation exposure and to establish diagnostic reference levels (DRLs). Method(s): In this retrospective study, dose data of 921 patients with initial CT imaging for suspected acute stroke and dose monitoring with a DICOM header-based tracking and monitoring software were analyzed. Between June 2017 and January 2020, 1655 CT scans were included, which were performed on three different modern multi-slice CT scanners, including 921 NCCT, 465 CTA, and 269 CTP scans. Radiation exposure was reported for CT dose index (CTDIvol) and dose-length product (DLP). DRLs were set at the 75th percentile of dose distribution. Result(s): DRLs were assessed for each step (CTDIvol/DLP): NCCT 33.9 mGy/527.8 mGy cm and CTA 13.7 mGy/478.3 mGy cm. Radiation exposure of CTP was invariable and depended on CT device and its protocol settings with CTDIvol 124.9-258.2 mGy and DLP 1852.6-3044.3 mGy cm. Conclusion(s): Performing complementary CT techniques such as CTA and CTP for the assessment of acute stroke increases total radiation exposure.

The sample analyzed at present represents approximately 30% of the intended future trial size., METHODS: The patients were randomly assigned to receive 63 Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions 7 days a week (n = 44) or 63 Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions 5 days a week with concurrent cisplatin 80-100 mg per square metre of body surface area on Days 1, 22 and 43 of the course of radiotherapy (n = 40). Acute mucosal reactions were scored using the modified Dische system., RESULTS: 15 (17.9%) patients, including 5 patients in p-CAIR and 10 patients in p-RTCT, did not comply with the assigned radiation treatment, mostly because of rapid tumour progression or deteriorating general performance. In p-RTCT, 22 (55%) patients received less than the intended three courses of chemotherapy mostly owing to haematological toxicity. The average maximum mucosal severity score was 14.2 in p-CAIR compared with 13.4 in p-RTCT; the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.31)., CONCLUSION: The schedules compared (p-CAIR and p-RTCT) did not differ considerably with respect to acute mucosal reactions. Haematological toxicity in p-RTCT was elevated compared with p-CAIR. Both schedules were considered tolerable with respect to acute toxicity, which justifies further recruitment to the trial., ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: The results show that early mucosal reactions are comparable in both trial arms but haematological toxicity is more pronounced during radiochemotherapy.",Excluded

The post-treatment urodynamic findings were compared with the pretreatment ones (n = 7), and a comparison was made between the serial urodynamic findings after the treatment in another seven patients who were able to undergo the pretreatment urodynamic study (UDS). RESULT(S): The median follow-up period up to the latest UDS was 34 months. Of the 14 patients, the latest UDS revealed some storage dysfunctions in 11 (79%) and some emptying dysfunctions in three (23%). Uninhibited detrusor contraction and decreased bladder compliance were recorded in 29 and 43% at the pretreatment UDS and approximately 50-60 and 20-60% in the serial follow-up studies, respectively (n = 7). Impaired detrusor contractility lasted in one patient. In the seven patients without the pretreatment UDS, decreased maximum cystometric capacity and decreased compliance were recorded in approximately 50-60 and 20-60% at the serial UDS, respectively. Detrusor contractility was aggravated in one patient and completely lost in one with time. CONCLUSION(S): The urodynamic findings indicate that the bladder-sparing regimen might result in perpetuating the lower urinary tract dysfunctions due to invasive bladder cancer itself and/or transurethral surgery and might injure the infrasacral autonomic nerves and the bladder itself.",Excluded
4110,"The origin of Europeans is not rooted in the Middle East but in Southern East Asia The study of tooth crown variables has proven useful in the assessment of human origin and dispersal. I show that multivariate analysis of quantified total tooth structure from dental X-rays is a powerful phylogenetic methodology. From an analysis of the complex global dental phenotype ('GDP,' composed of ~ 30 root, pulp, crown, and enamel variables per tooth), a representative Western European population was found to associate with Southeast Asians, while Mongolians formed a tight cluster with all Native Americans. The results suggest that either an emigrant wave, or waves, of modern humans emerged from Africa and with time segregated into at least three groups: Australian aborigines, Europeans, and Southeast Asians, or less likely due to genetic and archaeologic observations, a southern Asia origin of all modem humans from an emigrant African hominid. Both hypotheses portend an early evolution of the European genotype and support the argument that Europeans are principally derived from Upper Paleolithic hunter-gatherers, and thus Middle East Neolithic people did not have a major genetic impact on Europeans.",Excluded
4531,"Long term radiological features of radiation-induced lung damage PURPOSE: To describe the radiological findings of radiation-induced lung damage (RILD) present on CT imaging of lung cancer patients 12months after radical chemoradiation., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Baseline and 12-month CT scans of 33 patients were reviewed from a phase I/II clinical trial of isotoxic chemoradiation (IDEAL CRT). CT findings were scored in three categories derived from eleven sub-categories: (1) parenchymal change, defined as the presence of consolidation, ground-glass opacities (GGOs), traction bronchiectasis and/or reticulation; (2) lung volume reduction, identified through reduction in lung height and/or distortions in fissures, diaphragm, anterior junction line and major airways anatomy, and (3) pleural changes, either thickening and/or effusion., RESULTS: Six patients were excluded from the analysis due to anatomical changes caused by partial lung collapse and abscess. All remaining 27 patients had radiological evidence of lung damage. The three categories, parenchymal change, shrinkage and pleural change were present in 100%, 96% and 82% respectively. All patients had at least two categories of change present and 72% all three. GGOs, reticulation and traction bronchiectasis were present in 44%, 52% and 37% of patients., CONCLUSIONS: Parenchymal change, lung shrinkage and pleural change are present in a high proportion of patients and are frequently identified in RILD. GGOs, reticulation and traction bronchiectasis are common at 12months but not diagnostic. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded

4842,"Low-dose computed tomography with adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction and low tube voltage in craniocervical computed tomographic angiography: Impact of body mass index Objectives: To assess radiation dose and image quality using Adaptive Statistical Iterative Reconstruction (ASIR) in craniocervical computed tomographic angiography and to further evaluate the impact of body mass index (BMI) on image quality. Method(s): A total of 178 consecutive patients (112 men, 66 women; age range, 25-79 years) were enrolled in this prospective study and randomly divided into 2 groups: group A (conventional group): 120 kV, filtered back-projection reconstruction, and group B (low-dose group): 100 kV, 40% ASIR reconstruction. Radiation dose and image quality between groups A and B were compared. Correlation coefficients were calculated between quantitative image quality measurement and BMI, and between radiation dose and BMI using Pearson correlation. Two experienced radiologists independently evaluated the image quality with 4-point scores, and interrater reliability was calculated using kappa analysis. Result(s): The volume CT dose index, dose-length product, and effective dose of group B were lower than those of group A (each P < 0.01), with decreases of 23.99%, 25.15% and 25.47% respectively. Positive correlations existed between radiation dose and BMI for both groups A and B (each P < 0.01). GroupB had lower image noise, higher attenuation, higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and higher subjective score than did group A (each P < 0.01). Computed tomographic values had negative correlations with BMI for the head, neck, and shoulders in both groups A and B (each P < 0.01). Image noise, SNR, and CNR had no correlations with BMI for the head and neck in both groups (each P > 0.01). On the contrary, image noise had a positive correlation, and SNR and CNR had a negative correlations with BMI for the shoulders in group A (each P < 0.01), but in contrast, no such correlations were found in group B (each P > 0.01). Conclusion(s): In craniocervical CTA, ASIR can improve the image quality and reduce radiation dose in patients. Furthermore, ASIR reduced the variances of image quality of different body sizes in the shoulders.Copyright © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
4340,"Evaluation of gait speed after applying kinesio tape on quadriceps femoris muscle in patients with knee osteoarthritis BACKGROUND: Knee osteoarthritis is a chronic degenerative disease, known as the most common cause of difficulty walking in older adults and subsequently is associated with slow walking. Functional decline, increased risk of falls and the presence of pain are, in many studies, related to the muscle weakness caused by osteoarthritis especially weakness of the quadriceps muscles. Many studies have shown that the strength of the quadriceps femoris muscle can affect gait, by improving or weakening it. Kinesio Tape is a physiotherapeutic technique, which reduces pain and increases muscular strength by irritating the skin receptors. AIM: This study aimed to verify if the application of Kinesio Tape on quadriceps femoris muscle increases gait speed while decreasing the time needed to accomplish the 10-meter walk test in patients with knee osteoarthritis and also in subjects without knee osteoarthritis. METHOD(S): In this study, we observed the change of gait speed with the help of the 10-meter walk test before, one day and three days after the application of Kinesio Tape in quadriceps femoris muscle. We compared the results of the time needed to perform the 10-meter walk in two groups. In the first group, the Patients group, participated 102 out-patients with a clinical diagnosis of primary knee osteoarthritis, while in the second group, the Control group, participated 73 subjects with a main excluding criterion a clinical diagnosis of primary knee osteoarthritis. RESULT(S): Our results indicated that there was a significant decrease of time needed to perform the 10-meter walk test in both groups three days after application of Kinesio Tape on quadriceps femoris muscle. However, there was not a significant change one day after the application of Kinesio Tape compared before its application in both groups. CONCLUSION(S): Our results indicated that there was a significant decrease in time needed to accomplish the 10-meter walk test. Kinesio Tape is a technique that can be used especially when changing walking stereotypes is a long-term goal of the treatment.Copyright © 2018 Klejda Tani, Irena Kola, Vjollca Shpata, Fregen Dhamaj.

4089,"Clinical research: remote magnetic navigation vs. manually controlled catheter ablation of right ventricular outflow tract arrhythmias: a retrospective study Aims: Remote magnetic navigation (RMN) is an alternative to manual catheter control (MCC) radiofrequency ablation of right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) arrhythmias. The data to support RMN approach is limited. We aimed to investigate the clinical and procedural outcomes in a cohort of patients undergoing RVOT premature ventricular complex/ventricular tachycardia (PVCs/VT) ablation procedures using RMN vs. MCC., Methods and results: Data was collected from two centres. Eighty-nine consecutive RVOT PVCs/VT ablation procedures were performed in 75 patients; RMN: 42 procedures and MCC: 47 procedures. CARTOXPTM or CARTO3 (Biosense Webster) was used for endocardial mapping in 19/42 (45%) in RMN group and 28/47 (60%) in MCC group; EnSiteTM NavXTM (St. Jude Medical) was used in the rest of the cohort. Stereotaxis platform (Stereotaxis Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA) was used for RMN approach. Procedural time was 113 +/- 53 min in the RMN group and 115 +/- 69 min in MCC (P = 0.90). Total fluoroscopic time was 10.9 +/- 5.8 vs. 20.5 +/- 13.8 (P < 0.05) and total ablation energy application time 7.0 +/- 4.7 vs 11.9 +/- 16 (P = 0.67) accordingly.

3809,"Which patients are prone to undergo disproportionate recurrent CT imaging and should we worry? Purpose: To identify the spectrum of patients who undergo disproportionate recurrent computed tomography (CT) imaging, and to explore the cumulative effects of radiation exposure and intravenously injected contrast agents in these patients. Method(s): This retrospective study investigated all patients who had undergone 40 or more CT scans at a tertiary care center between 2007-2017. Result(s): Fifty-six patients who had undergone a median of 47 (range: 40-92) CT scans were included. The main reason for CT scanning in all patients was oncological, and 55 patients (98.2 %) had metastatic disease. Twenty-six patients (45.6) had received chemotherapy, 35 (62.5 %) radiation therapy, 38 (67.9 %) targeted therapy, 12 (21.4 %) liver tumor microwave ablation, 44 (78.6 %) major surgery, and 34 (60.7 %) had participated in a therapeutic trial. Mean cumulative effective dose was 187.4 mSv (range: 120.7-278.4 mSv). Median estimated radiation-induced lifetime attributable risk (LAR) of cancer incidence was 1.0 % (range: 0.20-2.36 %). Mean estimated radiation-induced LAR of cancer mortality was 0.68 % (range: 0.18-1.37 %). Mean cumulative volume of intravenously injected iomeprol was 2339 mL (range: 540-3605 mL). Three patients (5.4 %) had developed severely decreased kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate between 15 and 29 mL/min per 1.73 m2 for at least 3 months). Conclusion(s): Patients with metastatic disease who experience a relatively long survival may be prone to undergo disproportionate recurrent CT imaging. The non-negligible CT radiation-induced cancer risk and mortality should be taken into account in these patients, while the effect of cumulatively administered CT contrast agents on kidney function requires further investigation.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)",Excluded
4476,"Balloon kyphoplasty under three-dimensional radiography guidance Percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty (PBKP) is generally performed under two-dimensional (2D) radiography guidance (lateral- and anteroposterior (A-P) views) using C-arm fluoroscopy. However, 2D images taken by single-plane or bi-plane fluoroscopy cannot provide information regarding axial views, particularly the Z axis. Lack of information regarding the Z axis prevents the creation of three-dimensional (3D) images. Currently, there has been a progress in interventional X-ray systems, and they are capable of providing 3D radiographic images using a rotational angiography mode which is used to create 3D angiographies. In this report, we described the usefulness of 3D radiography guidance. Patients treated by PBKP was designed to evaluate the efficacy of 3D radiography guidance. These patients experienced osteoporotic vertebral fractures with severe pain. We retrospectively analyzed patients who underwent PBKP from February to December 2016. All patients had a single-level vertebral fracture and underwent surgery by 2D or 3D radiography guidance. We performed 16 patients in 3D radiography guidance, and 10 patients in traditional 2D radiography guidance. This 3D radiography guided PBKP increase the amount of the polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) injection compared with ordinary 2D method. As a result, postoperative vertebral height and alignment were significantly improved. Both groups have no complication. To confirm the final results and make PBKP more effective, 3D radiography guidance is feasible and safe for balloon kyphoplasty.Copyright © 2017 by The Japan Neurosurgical Society.",Excluded
4386,"Long-term outcome of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in patients with acoustic neuromas Purpose: To evaluate the effectiveness and long-term outcome of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for acoustic neuromas (AN). Patients and Methods: Between 1990 and 2001, we treated 26 patients with 27 AN with SRS. Two patients suffered from neurofibromatosis type 2. Before SRS, a subtotal or total resection had been performed in 3 and in 5 patients, respectively. For SRS, a median single dose of 13 Gy/80% isodose was applied. Result(s): The overall actuarial 5-year and 10-year tumor control probability in all patients was 91%. Two patients developed tumor progression after SRS at 36 and 48 months. Nineteen patients (73%) were at risk of treatment-related facial nerve toxicity; of these, 1 patient developed a complete facial nerve palsy after SRS (5%). A total of 93% of the lesions treated were at risk of radiation-induced trigeminal neuralgia. Two patients (8%) developed mild dysesthesia of the trigeminal nerve after SRS. The hearing preservation rate in patients with useful hearing before SRS was 55% at 9 years. Conclusion(s):: Stereotactic radiosurgery results in good local control rates of AN and the risk of cranial nerve toxicities is acceptable. As toxicity is lower with fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy, SRS should be reserved for smaller lesions. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

Method(s): Time-resolved non-contrast-enhanced images of the lungs were acquired prospectively in 15patients using a 2D balanced steady-state free precession (b-SSFP) sequence. After non-rigid registrationof the native image data, perfusion-weighted images were calculated by separating periodic changes oflung proton density at the cardiac frequency using FD. DCE MRI subtraction datasets were acquired asstandard of reference. Both datasets were analyzed visually for perfusion defects. Then segmentationanalyses were performed to describe perfusion of pulmonary lobes semi-quantitatively as percent-ages of total lung perfusion. Overall FD MRI perfusion signal was compared to velocity-encoded flowmeasurements in the pulmonary trunk as an additional fully quantitative reference. Result(s): Image quality ratings of FD MRI were significantly inferior to those of DCE MRI (P < 0.0001).Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of FD MRI for visual detection of perfusion defects were 84%, 92%,and 91%. Semi-quantitative evaluation of lobar perfusion provided high agreement between FD MRI andDCE MRI for both entire lungs and upper lobes, but less agreement in the lower parts of both lungs. FDperfusion signal showed high linear correlation with pulmonary arterial blood flow. Conclusion(s): FD MRI is a promising technique that allows for assessing regional lung perfusion in NSCLCpatients without contrast media or ionizing radiation. However, for being applied in clinical routine,image quality and robustness of the technique need to be further improved. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
4704,"Case report: Asymptomatic ventricular fibrillation and ineffective high energy therapy in a patient with left ventricular non compaction cardiomyopathy and left ventricular assist device BACKGROUND We present a case of asymptomatic ventricular fibrillation and ineffective defibrillation in a patient with left ventricular non compaction cardiomyopathy after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) Heart Mate III. Non compaction cardiomyopathy is a rare, congenital cardiomyopathy resulting from abnormal embryogenesis of myocardium with characteristic multiple trabeculations in ventricular apex. Its lethal character comes from frequent ventricular arrhythmias, often also with atrio ventricular conduction block. The main role of treatment is to improve cardiac efficiency, reduce the risk of arrhythmias, implant of an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator for prevention of sudden cardiac death, ventricular assist device and heart transplant in cases of serious heart failure. CASE REPORT 61 year old patient with severe heart failure (LVEF 16%), diagnosed in 2012. In the course of non compaction cardiomyopathy after cardiac resynchronization therapy with defibrillation function in February 2018 and implantation left ventricular mechanical cardiac assistant LVAD with Heart Mate III system on 27.06.2019. The patient had 5 discharges of the device in a church without loss of consciousness and symptoms of apparent circulatory failure on 27.10.2019. The patient was admitted to the Emergency Department in fair general condition, with basal crepitations over the lungs audible, slight dyspnea at rest, with ongoing Torsade de pointes in electrocardiographic examination, with ventricular rate 300/min, and blood pressure 100/60 Hg mm. Ventricular fibrillation was interrupted by external defibrillator, achieving sinus rhythm return. Basic examination results showed elevated proBNP values (4362 ng/l), features of pulmonary stasis on X ray. CRT D device memory showed 5 unsuccessful discharges of the device, followed by external effective defibrillation after exhausting all available high energy therapies, which restored sinus rhythm and synchronous biventricular stimulation. The patient was discharged home in good condition. CONCLUSIONS Ineffective high energy therapy in many cases ends in death. In this case, despite the abnormal electrical heart rate, LVAD was working correctly and ensured proper cardiovascular function.",Excluded
4194,"Variability in the amount of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose excreted in urine measured from oncology patients during PET/computed tomography imaging The objectives of this work were to estimate the amount of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (F-FDG) excreted (AFE) in the patient urine during the uptake phase as percentage of the injected activity and to examine the effect of blood glucose levels (BGL) on the excreted amount and whether it varies among men and women using statistical analysis methods. Radiation dose rates were measured at 1 m from 50 patients, 24 men and 26 women, before and after the first void using a calibrated ionization chamber. The F-FDG was injected in the patients using a calibrated automatic dose injection system. Statistical analysis using hypothesis testing was carried out. Patients with BGL above 5 mmol/l had a higher AFE of 12.3% in comparison with 8.3% of the patients with BGL below 5 mmol/l. A statistically nonsignificant correlation (r=0.183, P<0.249) between AFE and BGL was found; a nonsignificant difference was found in the AFE measured among the male and female patients. The AFE measured was 12+/-6%, with a range of (2-30%). There was a wide variation in the first void time of 39+/-8 min, with a range of (17-68) min. A simple noninvasive measurement method is presented that enabled the estimation of the amount of F-FDG excreted from the patient during voiding.

The incidence of radiation-induced complications following radiotherapy, especially RION, is correlated with survival time of patients. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), the most common type of cancer in southern China, has been primarily treated with radiotherapy, with associated neural injuries. To our knowledge, there are few reports of RION among patients with NPC who have undergone radiotherapy. To study this further, we reviewed nine patients with NPC and RION after radiotherapy and examined the clinical manifestations of RION, characteristics of the ophthalmologic examination, MRI results and the treatments used. Of the nine patients with RION, the most frequent clinical presentation was a decline of vision with visual field defects in one or both eyes. Ophthalmologic examinations showed flame hemorrhages in the retina, optic nerve atrophy and cotton wool spots. T1-weighted enhanced MRI showed enhancement of the optic nerve and optic chiasm in six patients.

Sensitisation to DNCB occurred in 52% of 37 patients but in 78% of controls. There was depression of lymphocyte transformation by PPD in 19 patients compared with controls (P=0.001), but there was no difference in lymphocyte transformation by PHA or pokeweed mitogen between 34 patients and controls. In a pilot study patients were randomly allocated to autograft (eight) or non-autograft (seven) groups. The autograft group were given an intradermal injection of a suspension of irradiated autologous tumour-cells mixed with intradermal BCG on the day of operation. Tests of cell-mediated immunity were repeated two weeks after operation. Five patients in each group received a course of radiotherapy to the mediastinum three weeks after operation. There was a rise in cutaneous tuberculin reactivity (P=0.08) and total leucocyte count (P=0.09) in the autograft group postoperatively with a fall in total lymphocyte and T lymphocyte counts in the non-autograft group (P less 0.05). These differences, however, were not followed by any difference in the frequency of tumour recurrence or the survival rate two years after operation. The results show that the immunological surveillance mechanism is impaired even in patients with early bronchial carcinoma and that it is possible to overcome postoperative immunological depression with specific immunotherapy combined with BCG. This treatment did not produce any clinical advantage in this small number of patients and the skin lesions caused the patients considerable discomfort.",Excluded

The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of RT and routine endoscopic surveillance, hypothesizing that most patients are curable with RT alone. We queried a single institution database at a tertiary referral cancer center for patients with H pylori-independent GML treated with RT between 1991 and 2017. Response was assessed by follow-up endoscopies (EGDs) starting 10 to 12 weeks post-RT. Computed tomography scans were also part of the follow-up program, and positron emission tomography was added when clinically appropriate. We identified 178 patients (median age, 63 years; range, 25-89 years); 86% had stage I disease, 7% had stage II disease, and 7% had stage IV disease. Median RT dose was 3000 cGy over 20 fractions. Ninety-five percent of patients exhibited complete pathologic response on posttreatment EGD. Two patients experienced grade 3 toxicity, and 2 patients experienced in-field secondary malignancies. Over a median follow-up of 6.2 years, 9.6% experienced local failures, and 11.8% developed distant sites of disease. Five-year and 10-year overall survival were 94% and 79%, respectively, from last date of RT. RT is a highly effective and safe treatment for GML with excellent overall survival and very rare acute or late treatment-related toxicities. Favorable outcomes from this large retrospective sample of patients provide credible and compelling support for RT as standard of care for H pylori-independent GML.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology",Excluded

Forty-one patients received concomitant chemoradiotherapy with vinorelbine/cisplatin (VC), 35 with docetaxel/cisplatin (DC). AE was graded according to criteria of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG). The following clinical and dosimetric parameters were analyzed: gender, age, clinical stage, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), pretreatment weight loss, concomitant chemotherapy agents (CCA) (VC vs. DC), percentage of esophagus volume treated to >= 20 (V20), >= 30 (V30), >= 40 (V40), >= 50 (V50) and >= 60 Gy (V60), and the maximum (Dmax) and mean doses (Dmean) delivered to esophagus. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to test the association between the different factors and AE., RESULTS: Seventy patients developed AE (Grade 1, 19 patients; Grade 2, 36 patients; and Grade 3, 15 patients). By multivariate logistic regression analysis, V40 was the only statistically significant factor associated with Grade >= 2 AE (p<0.001, OR = 1.159). A V40 of <23% had a 33.3% (10/30) risk of Grade >= 2 AE, which increased to 89.1% (41/46) with a V40 of >= 23% (p<0.001). CCA (p =0.01; OR = 9.686) and V50 (p<0.001; OR = 1.122) were most significantly correlated with grade 3 AE. A V50 of <26.5% had a 6.7% (3/45) risk of Grade 3 AE, which increased to 38.7% (12/31) with a V50 of >= 26.5% (p = 0.001). On the linear regression analysis, V50 and CCA were significant independent factors affecting AE duration. Patients who received concomitant chemotherapy with VC had a decreased risk of grade 3 AE and shorter duration compared with DC., CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant chemotherapy agents have potential influence on AE. Concomitant chemotherapy with VC led to lower risk of AE compared with that using DC. V40 and V50 of esophagus can predict grade >= 2 and >= 3 AE, respectively.",Excluded

However, owing to the small sample size of each trial, differences in response rates and outcomes were not statistically significant but remained clinically notable. We therefore did a pooled analysis to infer whether radiotherapy improves responses to immunotherapy in patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer. Method(s): Inclusion criteria for the PEMBRO-RT and MDACC trials were patients (aged >=18 years) with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer and at least one unirradiated lesion to monitor for out-of-field response. In the PEMBRO-RT trial, patients had previously received chemotherapy, whereas in the MDACC trial, patients could be either previously treated or newly diagnosed. Patients in both trials were immunotherapy-naive. In the PEMBRO-RT trial, patients were randomly assigned (1:1) and stratified by smoking status (<10 vs >=10 pack-years). In the MDACC trial, patients were entered into one of two cohorts based on radiotherapy schedule feasibility and randomly assigned (1:1). Because of the nature of the intervention in the combination treatment arm, blinding to radiotherapy was not feasible in either trial. Pembrolizumab was administered intravenously (200 mg every 3 weeks) with or without radiotherapy in both trials. In the PEMBRO-RT trial, the first dose of pembrolizumab was given sequentially less than 1 week after the last dose of radiotherapy (24 Gy in three fractions), whereas in the MDACC trial, pembrolizumab was given concurrently with the first dose of radiotherapy (50 Gy in four fractions or 45 Gy in 15 fractions). Only unirradiated lesions were measured for response. The endpoints for this pooled analysis were best out-of-field (abscopal) response rate (ARR), best abscopal disease control rate (ACR), ARR at 12 weeks, ACR at 12 weeks, progression-free survival, and overall survival. The intention-to-treat populations from both trials were included in analyses. The PEMBRO-RT trial (NCT02492568) and the MDACC trial (NCT02444741) are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov. Finding(s): Overall, 148 patients were included in the pooled analysis, 76 of whom had been assigned pembrolizumab and 72 who had been assigned pembrolizumab plus radiotherapy. Median follow-up for all patients was 33 months (IQR 32.4-33.6). 124 (84%) of 148 patients had non-squamous histological features and 111 (75%) had previously received chemotherapy. Baseline variables did not differ between treatment groups, including PD-L1 status and metastatic disease volume. The most frequently irradiated sites were lung metastases (28 of 72 [39%]), intrathoracic lymph nodes (15 of 72 [21%]), and lung primary disease (12 of 72 [17%]). Best ARR was 19.7% (15 of 76) with pembrolizumab versus 41.7% (30 of 72) with pembrolizumab plus radiotherapy (odds ratio [OR] 2.96, 95% CI 1.42-6.20; p=0.0039), and best ACR was 43.4% (33 of 76) with pembrolizumab versus 65.3% (47 of 72) with pembrolizumab plus radiotherapy (2.51, 1.28-4.91; p=0.0071). Median progression-free survival was 4.4 months (IQR 2.9-5.9) with pembrolizumab alone versus 9.0 months (6.8-11.2) with pembrolizumab plus radiotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.67, 95% CI 0.45-0.99; p=0.045), and median overall survival was 8.7 months (6.4-11.0) with pembrolizumab versus 19.2 months (14.6-23.8) with pembrolizumab plus radiotherapy (0.67, 0.54-0.84; p=0.0004). No new safety concerns were noted in the pooled analysis. Interpretation(s): Adding radiotherapy to pembrolizumab immunotherapy significantly increased responses and outcomes in patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer. These results warrant validation in a randomised phase 3 trial. Funding(s): Merck Sharp & Dohme.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
4640,"A statewide teleradiology system reduces radiation exposure and charges in transferred trauma patients BACKGROUND: Trauma transfer patients routinely undergo repeat imaging because of inefficiencies within the radiology system. In 2009, the virtual private network (VPN) telemedicine system was adopted throughout Oregon allowing virtual image transfer between hospitals. The startup cost was a nominal $3,000 per hospital., METHODS: A retrospective review from 2007 to 2012 included 400 randomly selected adult trauma transfer patients based on a power analysis (200 pre/200 post). The primary outcome evaluated was reduction in repeat computed tomography (CT) scans. Secondary outcomes included cost savings, emergency department (ED) length of stay (LOS), and spared radiation. All data were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U and chi-square tests. P less than .05 indicated significance. Spared radiation was calculated as a weighted average per body region, and savings was calculated using charges obtained from Oregon Health and Science University radiology current procedural terminology codes., RESULTS: Four-hundred patients were included. Injury Severity Score, age, ED and overall LOS, mortality, trauma type, and gender were not statistically different between groups. The percentage of patients with repeat CT scans decreased after VPN implementation: CT abdomen (13.2% vs 2.8%, P < .01) and cervical spine (34.4% vs 18.2%, P < .01). Post-VPN, the total charges saved in 2012 for trauma transfer patients was $333,500, whereas the average radiation dose spared per person was 1.8 mSV. Length of stay in the ED for patients with Injury Severity Score less than 15 transferring to the ICU was decreased (P < .05)., CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a statewide teleradiology network resulted in fewer total repeat CT scans, significant savings, decrease in radiation exposure, and decreased LOS in the ED for patients with less complex injuries. The potential for health care savings by widespread adoption of a VPN is significant. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
3990,"Quantitative Accuracy and Lesion Detectability of Low-Dose 18F-FDG PET for Lung Cancer Screening Lung cancer remains responsible for more deaths worldwide than any other cancer, but recently there has been a significant shift in the clinical paradigm regarding the initial management of subjects at high risk for this disease. Low-dose CT has demonstrated significant improvements over planar x-ray screening for patient prognoses and is now performed in the United States. Specificity of this modality, however, is poor, and the additional information from PET has the potential to improve its accuracy. Routine screening requires consideration of the effective dose delivered to the patient, and this work investigates image quality of PET for low-dose conditions, in the context of lung lesion detectability. Reduced radiotracer doses were simulated by randomly discarding counts from clinical lung cancer scans acquired in list-mode. Bias and reproducibility of lesion activity values were relatively stable even at low total counts of around 5 million trues. Additionally, numeric observer models were developed and trained with the results of 2 physicians and 3 postdoctoral researchers with PET experience in a detection task; detection sensitivity of the observers was well correlated with lesion signal-to-noise ratio. The models were used prospectively to survey detectability of lung cancer lesions, and the findings suggested a lower limit around 10 million true counts for maximizing performance. Under the acquisition parameters used in this study, this translates to an effective patient dose of less than 0.4 mSv, potentially allowing a complete low-dose PET/CT lung screening scan to be obtained under 1 mSv.

OS and time to progression were analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier method., RESULTS: Technical success rate was 100%, average operative time for DynaCT-guided RFA was 45.3 +/- 4.8 min, average radiation dose was 730.5 +/- 78.8 mGy, and no life-threatening complications were observed. At 1-month follow-up enhanced MRI, complete remission was achieved in 82.6% of patients (38/46), and partial remission in 17.4% (8/46). The median follow-up period was 29.5 months (interquartile range 4.0-69.0 months). At 1, 2, and 3 years after surgery, the LTP rates were 4.3, 13.1, and 30.4%, respectively, and the OS rates were 89.1, 71.7, and 56.5%, respectively., CONCLUSION: DynaCT-guided TACE + RFA is safe and feasible for the treatment of solitary large HCCS.

3878,"Mucositis in irradiated cancer patients: effects of an antiseptic mouthrinse OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of an antiseptic, non-alcohol based mouth-rinse containing chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride, in preventing the oral complications associated to radiation therapy in head-and-neck cancer patients., STUDY DESIGN: This was a parallel, double blind, prospective, randomized clinical trial. Cancer patients were randomly assigned to one of the two treatments (test mouth-rinse or a placebo). Three visits were scheduled (baseline, 14 and 28 days). Different outcome variables were evaluated: mucositis, plaque and gingival indices, stimulated saliva and salivary pH., RESULTS: 70 patients were screened and 36 were included. The presence and the degree of mucositis significantly increased in both groups and no significant differences were detected between groups, although the median increase in the placebo group (1.81) at 2 weeks was higher than in the test group (1.20)., CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of the small sample size, this study suggests that the use of the tested mouth-rinse may lead to some improvements in clinical parameters in patients irradiated for head-and-neck cancer.",Excluded
4633,"Lung stereotactic body radiation therapy for elderly patients aged >= 80 years with pathologically proven early-stage non-small cell lung cancer: a retrospective cohort study Background: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is an established therapy for medically inoperable early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Many elderly patients are medically inoperable owing to comorbidities. Therefore, SBRT may be a useful therapy for elderly patients. However, the application of SBRT for patients aged >= 80 years has not been completely elucidated. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the clinical utility of SBRT for elderly patients aged >= 80 years with pathologically proven early-stage NSCLC. Method(s): We retrospectively evaluated the data of patients aged >= 80 years with pathologically proven primary NSCLC who underwent SBRT at our institution between January 2009 and March 2020. Treatment outcomes and toxicities were analyzed. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate survival curves and the log-rank test to compare the survival curves. We performed univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. p-values < 0.05 were regarded significant. Result(s): Sixty-four patients (65 lesions) were included, and the median follow-up period was 38.7 (range 3.5-95.7) months. The median age was 82.9 (range 80.0-94.8) years. Sixteen patients were medically operable, and 48 patients were medically inoperable. The prescribed dose of SBRT was either 48 Gy in four fractions or 60 Gy in 10 fractions. The median survival time was 60.0 months (95% confidence interval, 43.5-71.1). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year local control, cancer-specific survival, progression-free survival, and overall survival rates were 98.4%, 98.4%, 81.0%, and 88.9%; 90.1%, 93.7%, 58.9%, and 68.3%; and 87.4%, 83.5%, 38.2%, and 47.5%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that inoperability and solid nodules were the predictors of poor overall survival after SBRT in elderly patients. Two patients (3.1%) had grade 3 radiation pneumonitis, and one patient (1.6%) had grade 5 radiation pneumonitis. Conclusion(s): SBRT was feasible in patients aged >= 80 years with NSCLC. It achieved good local control with minimal toxicity. SBRT may be beneficial in elderly patients with early-stage NSCLC.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).",Excluded

All the patients examined were maintained within 4 weeks on a diet, radioprotective effect of which was realized due to the elevated content of sulfur containing amino acids, antioxidants and complexes. In the patients who lived in the radionuclide-contaminated areas, a moderate activation of lipid peroxidation was detected simultaneously with marked alterations in the humoral component of the immunity system, which involved a considerable increase in the levels of IgG and complements C3 and C4. A decrease in content of malonic dialdehyde and diene conjugates as well as normalization of IgG and decrease in content of IgA, IgM and C3 were observed in blood plasma of the patients on diet. Supplementation of omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega 3-PUFA), 5 g/day and alpha-tocopherol, 12.5 mg/day, to the diet elevated the serum concentrations of all lg classes, which suggests the presence of an immunomodulating effect of omega 3-PUFA. Moreover, the content of malonic dialdehyde was not increased in blood plasma if 3-PUFA was used. Hence, increased alpha-tocopherol levels should be used in the treatment of these patients with omega 3-PUFA (up to 5-7 mg per g PUFA) in order to stabilize lipid peroxidation.",Excluded
4027,"Low-dose simulation and sparse sampling with statistical iterative reconstruction: Dose reduction in MDCT-based bone mineral density and microstructure assessment Introduction: The clinical use of multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) to assess bone strength and fracture risk in subjects with osteoporosis is limited by the relatively high radiation doses of established protocols. In this study, the effects of simulated dose reduction and sparse sampling combined with statistical iterative reconstruction (SIR) on bone mineral density (BMD) measurements and microstructure analyses of trabecular bone were assessed. We also explored whether analyses based on low-dose protocols were still able to differentiate between subjects with and without vertebral fractures. Material(s) and Method(s): In routine chest and abdominal MDCT scans of 12 subjects with prevalent osteoporotic vertebral fractures and 12 controls, pairwise matched for age and sex, lower radiation doses were simulated by virtual lower tube current (10%, 25%, and 50% of the original current) and sparse sampling (10%, 25%, and 50% of the original raw data). All images were reconstructed with SIR. BMD and trabecular bone microstructure parameters (including bone fraction and trabecular thickness) were extracted from the reconstructed images in T10 to L5. Result(s): Effective dose of the original scan was 10 mSv, and 5, 3, and 1 mSv for the 50%, 25%, and 10% sparse sampled/low-dose simulated data, respectively. All BMD measurements calculated from different virtual lower tube currents and different sparse samplings were significantly lower in subjects with fractures compared with controls (range: 89-110 versus 125-187 mg/mL; p < 0.003 for all). Analogously, bone fraction (0.31-0.47 versus 0.50-0.52; p < 0.004 for all) and trabecular thickness were consistently lower in subjects with fractures (1.1-1.3 versus 1.7-2.4 mm; p < 0.011 for all). Conclusion(s): After simulated dose reduction and sparse sampling, BMD and microstructure parameters obtained from MDCT examinations and processed with statistical iterative reconstruction were still significantly different in subjects with and without vertebral fractures, suggesting an osteoporosis diagnosis to be feasible in low-dose protocols.",Excluded
4398,"[X-ray-induced breaks in the X chromosomes in Drosophila lines of various radiosensitivities] The frequency of X-ray induced X-chromosome breaks has been studied in females of the line rad (2) 201G1 hypersensitive to radiation and in females of the control line selected from the same population. The frequency of X-chromosome breaks was judged based on the frequency of X0 males occurrence. Synergism of the effects of X-rays (at doses 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 kr) and of hyperthermia (+37 degrees C, 5.5 hours) applied after irradiation served as an indirect evidence for the functioning of DNA repair systems. It is demonstrated that radiosensitivity of mature oocytes of the lines compared was equal and that hyperthermia applied after irradiation increased the latter effect in both lines. Young oocytes of the control line were radioresistant, and hyperthermia applied after irradiation enhanced its effect. Opposite to them, young oocytes of the rad line females were radiosensitive. They did not differ from mature oocytes in the frequency of X-chromosome losses. Synergism of the two factors (irradiation and hyperthermia) was not registered in young oocytes. On the basis of the results obtained, it may be concluded that radiosensitivity of young oocytes in the hypersensitive line is conditioned by the failure of DNA repair systems and that the rad (2) 201G1 gene may be considered, in relation to the genes controlling DNA repair, as a suppressor functioning selectively at a certain stage of oogenesis.",Excluded

4336,"Intratreatment Response Assessment With 18F-FDG PET: Correlation of Semiquantitative PET Features With Pathologic Response of Esophageal Cancer to Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy Purpose: This prospective study seeks to extract semiquantitative positron emission tomography (PET) features from 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET scans performed before and during neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for esophageal cancer and to compare their accuracy in predicting histopathologic response. Methods and Materials: From 2012 to 2016, 26 patients with esophageal cancer underwent pretreatment and intratreatment PET scans during chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery. Median patient age was 63 years (interquartile range, 58-68 years); 26 patients had esophageal adenocarcinoma, and 3 had esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The intratreatment PET scan was performed at a median of 32.4 Gy (interquartile range, 30.6-32.4 Gy). PET features of the primary site including maximum standardized uptake value (SUV), SUV mean, metabolic tumor volume, and total lesion glycolysis were extracted from the pretreatment and intratreatment PET scans. Patients were histopathologic responders if there was complete or near-complete tumor response by modified Ryan scheme. Mean values of PET features were compared between histopathologic responders and nonresponders. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to compare the accuracy of PET features in predicting histopathologic response. Result(s): Eleven patients (42%) were histopathologic responders. PET features most discriminatory of histopathologic response on AUC analysis were volumetric PET features from the intratreatment PET including metabolic tumor volume based on manual contour (AUC, 0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.52-0.93) and total lesion glycolysis based on semiautomatic 40% SUV threshold (AUC, 0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.53-0.94).

3855,"Time sequence of cancer occurrence. Implications in low level radiation risk assessment A total of 8 229 C57 Black mice of both sexes were randomly assigned to various groups. In some groups, mice aged 33 +/- 3 days were submitted to either sham, neutron or cobalt external radiation at 32, 45, 63, 88 and 123 mGy or at 18, 25, 36 and 51 cGy dose levels, respectively. In other groups, mice either at birth or weaning, were injected with tritiated thymidine or tritiated water, or were given tritiated water as drinking water for the entire lifespan. The main purpose of the experiment was to investigate the low dose-response relationship of cancer induction, especially leukemogenesis and to evaluate the excess risk, using actuarial age-specific rates. Following neutron or cobalt exposure, the phenotypic occurrence of lymphocytic lymphomas was earlier in appearance and higher in yield during the first decades of lifespan in irradiated groups versus matching controls, whereas such occurrence was markedly lower in yield at a later age. Under parallel experimental conditions, induction of reticulum cell lymphomas, however, was uniformly enhanced throughout the entire lifespan. Induction rates of all tumors (reticular and solid) pooled were significantly increased, and more so following cobalt than neutron irradiation. In mice injected with tritiated thymidine, the overall tumor incidence was increased monotonically throughout the lifespan. In mice exposed to tritiated water, the incidence of lymphocytic lymphomas was markedly increased throughout the lifespan, whereas no such effect was observed for reticulum cell tumors. In the light of tumor data analysis, it appears that selection of a particular type of tumor as a dependent variable for dose-response assessment cannot disregard the primary modulation of the whole tumor spectrum. In C57 Black murine leukemogenesis, the shape and structure of the dose-response regression curve over the entire lifespan does not fit the linear-quadratic model. It is, however, theorized that our data are consistent with the two-mutation clonal expansion model, assuming creation of initiated cells which are added to the pool of spontaneously occurring initiated cells and implying that the excess risk is initially high at early age and then decreases with increasing age following exposure. It is concluded that murine radiocarcinogenesis investigation may contribute to improving the assessment as well as understanding the underlying mechanisms of low level radiation hazards.

3972,"The tolerance of proton radiotherapy - Preliminary results Introduction. Because the specific proton beam dose distribution (i.e. the so-called 'Bragg curve'), proton radiotherapy ensures that the high-dose region is precisely confined to the target volume while minimizing the dose delivered to healthy tissues/critical organs surrounding the tumour or to those lying in the path of the proton beam. This method has been used for patients in Krakow since November 2016. Aim. To report the early tolerance outcomes to proton radiotherapy in patients completing their treatment just before the end of August 2017. Materials and methods. Study subjects were 47 patients who had completed their treatment before the end of August 2017 with a mean age of 41.6 years (range: 16-76, median: 40). The most frequent diagnoses were skull base tumours (22 pts. - 46.8%) and brain G1 or G2 gliomas (17 pts. - 36.2%), whereas the most frequent histological types were chordomas (17 pts. - 36.2%). Proton radiotherapy was administered by pencil beam scanning and consisted of using the intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) technique. The total dose given per cancer type averaged as follows: (i) 70 and 74 Gy(RBE), for respectively chodrosarcomas and chordomas, (ii) 54 Gy(RBE) for brain gliomas and (iii) 70 Gy(RBE) for paranasal sinuses tumours. Early tolerance was prospectively evaluated and measured according to the CTCAE scale, version 4.03. Results. In all, 91 side effects (SE) were recorded in 44 patients. The intensity of SEs were as following: 62 SEs (68.1%) were of grade 1 intensity, 21 SEs (23.1%) were of grade 2 and 8 SEs (8.8%) were of grade 3. The most frequently developed SEs were skin reactions (29 pts. - 61.7%) or oral/pharyngeal mucositis (20 pts. - 42.6%). Because the patient follow-up period was short, presented results only describes the early tolerance to this therapy.

3833,"Oxygen consumption during walking and running under fractional weight bearing conditions INTRODUCTION: Knowledge of changes in oxygen consumption during reduced body weight loading at different speed levels is important, in particular in astronauts who may lose aerobic fitness as well as in clinical patients (e.g., in obese individuals at walking speeds or in injured athletes at running speeds). Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze oxygen consumption during unloaded walking and running., METHODS: Oxygen consumption (Vo2), heart rate (HR), and Borg rating of perceived exertion (Borg RPE) were quantified in 10 healthy young female and male volunteers at 3 body weight (BW) conditions (100%, 66%, and 33% BW) and 4 treadmill speeds (slow walking at 0.4 m x s(-1), comfortable walking at 1.3 m x s(-1), slow running at 2.2 m x s(-1), and moderately fast running at 3.1 m x s(-1)). Unloading was achieved in a waist-high chamber with increased pressure called Lower Body Positive Pressure (LBPP)., RESULTS: All parameters (Vo2, HR, and Borg RPE) decreased during unloaded walking and running. Interestingly, our findings confirm a specific linear relationship between each parameter and treadmill speed for each BW condition with smaller slope angles at higher levels of unloading (e.g., for Vo2, the slope angle decreased from 11.9 at 100% BW to 4.4 at 33% BW)., DISCUSSION: Oxygen consumption, heart rate, and Borg rating of perceived exertion are reduced during unloaded exercise with a relatively greater decline at higher treadmill speeds. That is, the higher the treadmill's speed in unloaded conditions, the relatively ""easier"" it is to exercise.",Excluded
4882,"Prognostic factors in set of limited disease small-cell lung cancer patients treated with chemoradiotherapy Background: Combined chemoradiotherapy is the standard treatment for patients with limited disease small cell lung cancer (LD SCLC). Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is recommended in case of complete remission (CR) since late 90' and for partial remissions last few years. Early concurrent radiation (RT) has been found as slightly beneficial at cost of higher toxicity. Use of granulocyte colonystimulating factor (G-CSF) for prophylaxis of febrile neutropenia is controversial in SCLC. We analyzed patients and treatment related variables for prognostic significance in long term follow-up of regional treatment protocol since 2000 in VFN, University Hospital Prague. Method(s): The planned treatment consisted of 4 to 6 courses of platinum/etoposide chemotherapy (CT) and thoracic irradiation of 45 to 66 grays with one daily fraction. Patients with CR or later with PR were assigned to PCI (30Gy in 15 fractions) at the end of treatment. Sequential strategy was preferred due to age over 70 or worse performance status. In some patients G-CSF prophylaxis was used. Influence of factors as sex, age, timing and dose of RT, dose and regimen of CT, G-CSF delivery, treatment response and PCI yes or not, were tested for survival impact. Result(s): Eighty consecutive patients were treated between Jan-2000 and Sep-2010, 49 men, 31 women, median age 62 years (range 49 - 80). CT in median dose of 5 cycles was predominantly cisplatin based, RT in median dose of 57.6 Gy was given concurrently in 56% and sequentially in 33% of patients. Thoracic RT was omitted in 9 patients, for poor performance status or progressive disease in 6 and due to radical surgery in 3 subjects. Esophagitis grade 3-4 occurred in 42%, significantly more often in concurrent RT (60% vs. 19%, p< 0.01). Response rate (RR) 90% and CR 62% in concurrent group did not differ significantly from sequential one (RR 88%, CR 52%). The median survival was 19.5 months and 3- and 5-year survival was 27% in all the patients. Survival differences in groups according to sex, age, stage, carbo or cisplatin and partial versus complete treatment response did not differ significantly. Significantly longer survival was observed in groups with PCI, with concurrent radiation or in patients treated with G-CSFs. Median time to progression was 14 months for the whole group. Significantly longer time to progression was in CR patients, concurrent RT, PCI patients and G-CSF delivery. Conclusion(s): Concurrent early chemoradiotherapy, PCI delivery and G-CSF treatment have shown significant impact on time to progression and overall survival in our group of LD SCLC patients.",Excluded
4652,"Host and tumor immunity: Local and systemic opportunities to enhance tumor curability by radiotherapy Success of radiation treatment depends on intrinsic properties of tumor cells, involvement of the host immune system and the crosstalk between tumor and host cells in primary and secondary (metastatic) sites. During the last decade our laboratory has investigated the role of these interactions in the ability of radiotherapy to eradicate primary tumors and metastatic disease. In the current presentation we will focus on host factors which interact with ionizing radiation (IR). The results of our studies using genetic models and specific immunological probes have identified CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, professional antigen presenting cells (CD11c+ dendritic cells), local production of TNFalpha by tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and host Type I Interferons (IFNs) as required for successful treatment by radiation 1,2. Transformation of the tumor microenvironment into an ""immunological hub"" to suppress local and distant disease is a tantalizing goal for which radiotherapy might be well suited, especially in combination with immunotherapy. , Our group has recently demonstrated that the combination of radiotherapy and anti-PD-L1 antibodies decrease accumulation and function of myeloid derived suppressor cells(CD11b,Gr1+) through enhanced local production of TNFalpha by tumor infiltrating lymphocytes ( TILs). in experimental systems3,4 The capacity of local radiotherapy to augment the activation TILs and drive cytokine production is, in part, due to the ability to increase tumor antigen cross-presentation by professional antigen presenting cells in the tumor stroma. Our group demonstrated host type I IFNs are essential for enhanced tumor antigen cross-presentation following radiotherapy. The critical role of type I IFNs in the host immune response to radiotherapy positions them as central components in the crosstalk between tumor cells and the host that can exert positive or negative influences depending on the context. In particular, the interaction of tumor cells with the host leads to the selection of clones resistant to the cytotoxic effects of IFNs and radiotherapy. Using transcriptomic approaches we identified a set of Interferon Stimulated Genes (ISGs) associated with tumor radioresistance.5 This gene set was identified in different types of primary tumors (lung, prostate, breast and glioblastoma) and termed the Interferon Related DNA Damage Signature (IRDS). Statistical training of this gene set detected a 7 gene signature which predicted response to adjuvant radio/chemotherapy for some woman with breast cancer 6. The IRDS is prognostic for patients with subsets of glioma and prostate cancer. We propose that these data indicate the presence of pro-survival genes in the IFN/Jak/Stat axis, which has been confirmed recently through a genomics approach The Jak-Stat pathway is currently under investigation as a potential therapeutic target for radio-chemosensitization in different tumor types. Our current approaches are directed towards identification of tumor ISGs with pro-survival/radioprotective functions. These results demonstrate the requirement to investigate both tumor and the host to improve the therapeutic ratio in radiotherapy.",Excluded

The surgery success rate was 96.5%, and no serious complication related to the surgery was reported. Symptoms of venous obstruction improved significantly after surgery. The score of group A decreased from 14.74 +/- 0.562 points before surgery to 2.79 +/- 1.357 points after surgery(P <.001), and the score of group B decreased from 13.79 +/- 1.398 points before surgery to 5.55 +/- 3.674 points after surgery (P <.001). The patency rate of group A was significantly higher than that of group B at 1 to 6 months after surgery (100%, 84.2%, 68.4%, 63.2%, 36.8%, 21.1% vs 68.4%, 23.7%, 18.4%, 7.9%, 5.3%, 2.6%, respectively; P <.05). Before treatment, there was no statistically significant difference in the Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score between the groups (P =.791). After 1 to 6 months of treatment, the KPS score was significantly higher in group A than in group B (P =.013). The median patency duration in groups A and B was 125 days (95% CI: 80.018-169.982) and 35 days (95% CI: 20.501-49.499), respectively (P <.001). The median survival time of group A was 155 days (95% CI: 110.406-199.594), and that of group B was 98 days (95% CI: 55.712-140.288; P =.325). Multivariate analysis showed that the implantation of a stent combined with a linear strand of 125I seeds and the KPS score (>=80 points) were independent factors of long-term patency after stent placement. Conclusion(s): The placement of a stent combined with a linear strand of 125I seeds is a safe and effective treatment for venous obstruction caused by malignant tumors. This treatment provides prolonged patency compared with the placement of bare stent, and while it does not significantly improve the survival time of patients, it can improve their quality of life.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.",Excluded

4769,"Incidence of dementia among atomic-bomb survivors--Radiation Effects Research Foundation Adult Health Study Radiotherapy has been reported to cause neuropsychological dysfunction. Here we examined whether exposure to atomic bomb radiation affected the incidence of dementia among 2286 atomic bomb survivors and controls - all members of the Adult Health Study cohort. Study subjects were non-demented and aged >or=60 years at baseline examination and had been exposed in 1945 at >or=13 years of age to a relatively low dose (<or=4 Gy), compared with total dose from radiotherapy. Dementia diagnoses were made during biennial health examinations with a two-phase procedure. DSM IV criteria were used for diagnosing dementia, NINCDS-ADRDA for Alzheimer disease, and NINDS-AIREN for vascular disease. To estimate the effect of radiation on the dementia incidence rate, we applied Poisson regression analysis. Incidence per 1000 person-years was 16.3 in the <5 mGy group, 17.0 in the 5-499 mGy group, and 15.2 in the >or=500 mGy group. Alzheimer disease was the predominant type of dementia in each dose category. After adjustment for potential risk factors, radiation exposure did not affect the incidence rate of either all dementia or any of its subtypes. No case of dementia had a history of therapeutic cranial irradiation. Although we found no relationship between radiation exposure and the development of dementia among atomic bomb survivors exposed at >or=13 years old in this longitudinal study, effects on increased risk of early death among atomic bomb survivors will be considered.",Included
3999,"Intraosseous contrast administration for emergency computed tomography: A case-control study OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the feasibility of intraosseous (i.o.) contrast media injection (CMI) for emergency computed tomography (CT) of severe trauma and the associated image quality compared to intravenous (i.v.) CMI., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors retrospectively analysed objective (contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR)) and subjective (4-point Likert scale) image quality of CTs after i.o. (n = 4, mean age (y) 57.0+/-11.0) versus i.v. (n = 20, mean age (y) 58.8+/-4.4) CMI. All patients underwent a native head CT scan, a cerebral CT angiography (CTA) and CTA of the supra-aortic vasculature as well as a chest and abdominal CT scan in the venous phase; one patient with an i.o. access additionally received a CTA of the lower limbs. Electronic patient records have been reviewed to determine i.o. access related complications., RESULTS: Both groups were consistent in age, heart rate, scan parameters including the flow rate of the contrast agent, resulting in comparable radiation dose levels. The image noise and CNR had no significant difference between the two groups. Scoring the delineation of the main vessels after i.o. CMI showed no significant difference to the i.v. group. There were no CT or i.o. access related complications observed., CONCLUSION: The i.o. access is a safe and suitable alternative for emergency CMI in CT. Using established protocols good to very good image quality can be achieved, comparable to i.v. CMI. We show for the first time, that i.o. CMI is also feasible for CTA imaging of the head and neck region as well as of pelvic and leg vessels.",Excluded
4422,"Models to study gravitational biology of Mammalian reproduction Mammalian reproduction evolved within Earth's 1-g gravitational field. As we move closer to the reality of space habitation, there is growing scientific interest in how different gravitational states influence reproduction in mammals. Habitation of space and extended spaceflight missions require prolonged exposure to decreased gravity (hypogravity, i.e., weightlessness). Lift-off and re-entry of the spacecraft are associated with exposure to increased gravity (hypergravity). Existing data suggest that spaceflight is associated with a constellation of changes in reproductive physiology and function. However, limited spaceflight opportunities and confounding effects of various nongravitational factors associated with spaceflight (i.e., radiation, stress) have led to the development of ground-based models for studying the effects of altered gravity on biological systems. Human bed rest and rodent hindlimb unloading paradigms are used to study exposure to hypogravity. Centrifugation is used to study hypergravity. Here, we review the results of spaceflight and ground-based models of altered gravity on reproductive physiology. Studies utilizing ground-based models that simulate hyper- and hypogravity have produced reproductive results similar to those obtained from spaceflight and are contributing new information on biological responses across the gravity continuum, thereby confirming the appropriateness of these models for studying reproductive responses to altered gravity and the underlying mechanisms of these responses. Together, these unique tools are yielding new insights into the gravitational biology of reproduction in mammals.",Excluded
4387,"Analysis by alkaline comet assay of cancer patients with severe reactions to radiotherapy: Defective rejoining of radioinduced DNA strand breaks in lymphocytes of breast cancer patients Therapeutic exposure to ionising radiation reveals inter-individual variations in normal tissue responses. To examine whether a defect in DNA repair capacity might be involved in such hypersensitive phenotypes, we analysed, using the alkaline comet assay, the response as a function of time to in vitro irradiation at 5 Gy of lymphocytes from 17 breast cancer and 9 Hodgkin's disease patients who developed severe reactions to radiotherapy in comparison with 22 patients with 'average' reactions and 24 healthy donors. A difference between breast cancer over-reactors and both patients with normal reactions and healthy donors was observed 30 and 60 min after exposure. A subgroup of breast cancer over-reactors (7/17) reproducibly demonstrated increased levels of residual damage. When the kinetic analyses were prolonged to 120 min, results were in favour of delayed kinetics of rejoining in these patients. Among Hodgkin's disease over-reactors, only one patient showed defective repair. Interestingly, all patients with the most severe complications (grade 4 RTOG/EORTC), i.e., 5 breast cancer and 1 Hodgkin's disease, showed impaired rejoining. Our results suggest that impairment in DNA strand break processing may be associated, in specific subgroups of breast cancer patients, with an individual risk of major toxicity of radiation therapy. Thus, the alkaline comet assay appears to be useful for documenting the DNA repair phenotype in cancer patients.",Included
4255,"Adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantation preoperative survey using MDCT, a single medical center experience in Taiwan This study evaluated multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) scans performed on potential living donors for adult-to-adult liver transplantation (LDLT), with the aim of identifying significant findings that could be used to exclude potential transplantation donors. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 151 consecutive potential adult donors for LDLT from May 2007 to January 2015. Liver parenchyma steatosis, focal hepatic mass or intraabdominal malignancy, vascular variations, and donor liver volume were evaluated via MDCT. Grounds for excluding potential donors were also recorded and analyzed. Of the 151 potential donors, nine (6.0%) had moderate to severe fatty liver, 37 (24.5%) had hepatic arterial variants, 22 (14.6%) had significant portal venous variants, and more than half were found to have right accessory inferior hepatic vein. No intraabdominal malignancies were found. Eighty-eight potential donors were rejected, with the most common cause being insufficient recipient volume or remnant donor volume (47.7%), moderate to severe parenchymal steatosis (10.2%), and recipient expiration prior to transplantation (8.0%). An additional 16 potential donors were excluded by the surgical team due to the complexity of their portal venous variations. The rate of exclusion by pre-transplant imaging evaluation with MDCT was 33.8%. MDCT can provide accurate quantification of donor liver volume and steatosis severity along with precise demonstration of vascular variants, which are crucial for the preoperative evaluation of LDLT. However, MDCT may be ineffective for evaluating the biliary system without hepatobiliary-excreted contrast agent and has the disadvantage of ionizing radiation.Copyright © 2017",Excluded
4905,"Seeds screening aqueous synthesis, multiphase interfacial separation and in situ optical characterization of invisible ultrathin silver nanowires We report a multi-step synthetic method to obtain ultrathin silver nanowires (Ag NWs) from an aqueous solution with a ~17 nm diameter average, and where some of them decreased down to 9 nm. Carefully designed seed screening processes including LED irradiation at high temperature for a short time, and then continuous H2O2 etching, and relative growth mechanisms of high-yield five-twinned pentagonal seeds and ultrathin Ag NWs in aqueous environment are detailed. Then, a rapid and simple multiphase interfacial assembly method particularly suitable for the separation of ultrathin Ag NWs from various by-products was demonstrated with a clear mechanism explanation. Next, a unique optical interaction between light and individual AG NWs, as well as feature structures in the AG NWs film, was investigated by a micro-domain optical confocal microscope measurement in situ together with a theoretical explanation using modal transmission theory. That revealed that the haze problem of AG NWs films was not only arising from the interaction between light and individual or crossed Ag NWs but was also greatly dependent on a weak coupling effect of leaky modes supported by adjacent Ag NWs with large distances which had not been considered before. We then provided direct experimental evidence and concluded how to obtain haze-free films with 100% transparency in the whole visible range based on ultrathin Ag NWs. This breakthrough in diameter confinement and purification of Ag NWs is a highly expected step to overcome the well-focused light diffusion and absorption problems of Ag NWs-based devices applied in various fields such as flexible electronics, high-clarity displays, visible transparent heaters, photovoltaics and various optoelectronic technologies.",Excluded

4742,"Outcomes of subintimal plaque modification in chronic total occlusion percutaneous coronary intervention Background: When crossing into the distal true lumen fails during chronic total occlusion (CTO) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), subintimal plaque modification (SPM) is often performed to restore antegrade flow and facilitate subsequent lesion recanalization. Method(s): Between January 2012 and May 4, 2019, 4,659 CTO PCIs were included in the PROGRESS-CTO registry, of which 935 (20%) had a prior unsuccessful attempt. Of those 935 patients, 119 (13%) had prior SPM. We analyzed the outcomes of the 58 SPM procedures for which data were available, as well as the outcomes of the 60 subsequent CTO PCI attempts. Result(s): Mean patient age was 67 +/- 9 years and 86% were men. Patients had high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors such as dyslipidemia (91%), hypertension (93%) diabetes (48%), prior PCI (61%), and prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery (47%). The target CTO lesions often had proximal cap ambiguity (54%), moderate/severe calcification (73%), moderate/severe tortuosity (63%), and high J-CTO score (mean 3.2 +/- 1.1). The technical and procedural success of subsequent CTO PCI were high (83% for both) with an acceptable rate of in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular events (3.3%). Technical and procedural success were higher for repeat attempts that were performed >=60 days after the index CTO PCI (94% vs. 69%, p =.015). Median (interquartile range) subsequent procedure time was 147 (100, 215) min, contrast volume was 185 (150, 260) ml, and air kerma radiation dose was 2.5 (1.4, 4.2) Gray.

4600,"Gamma Knife radiosurgery combined with stereotactic aspiration as an effective treatment method for large cystic brain metastases In the present study, the efficacy and clinical outcomes of stereotactic aspiration combined with the Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) method were evaluated retrospectively for patients with large cystic brain metastases. This combined method aims to decrease the tumor weight (volume) and increase the possible radiation dose. The present study involved 48 patients who were diagnosed with cystic metastatic brain tumors between January 2008 and December 2012 in the Department of Neurosurgery of Nanfang Hospital Southern Medical University (Guangzhou, China). Every patient underwent Leksell stereotactic frame, 1.5T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided stereotactic cyst aspiration and Leksell GKRS. Subsequent to the therapy, MRI was performed every 3 months. The results indicated that 48 cases were followed up for 24-72 months, with a mean follow-up duration of 36.2 months. Following treatment, 44 patients (91.7%) exhibited tumor control and 4 patients (8.3%) experienced progression of the local tumor. During this period, 35 patients (72.9%) succumbed, but only 2 (4.2%) of these succumbed to the brain metastases. The total local control rate was 91.7% and the median overall survival time of all patients was 19.5 months. The 1-year overall survival rate was 70.8% and the 2-year overall survival rate was 26.2%. In conclusion, these results indicated that the method of stereotactic cyst aspiration combined with GKRS was safe and effective for patients with large cystic brain metastases. This method is effective for patients whose condition is too weak for general anesthesia and in whom the tumors are positioned at eloquent areas. This method enables patients to avoid a craniotomy, and provides a good tumor control rate, survival time and quality of life.Copyright © 2016, Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.",Excluded

3828,"Reduction of radiation exposure in cryoballoon ablation procedures: a single-centre study applying intracardiac echocardiography and other radioprotective measures Aims: The population treated with cryoballoon (CB) ablation is relatively young, and radiation protection is of major importance. We aimed to demonstrate that radiation exposure can be markedly reduced by intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) and optimized settings of the X-ray system., Methods and results: We analysed 100 patients undergoing CB pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) for treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. In 50 consecutive patients (25 male, 59 +/- 13 years; Group 1), we used ICE, skipped PV angiography prior to CB inflation, and avoided fluoroscopy whenever possible. Furthermore, we reduced the frame rate, minimized distance between patient and detector, and consequently applied collimation. These patients were compared with 50 similar preceding patients in Group 2 (29 male, 61 +/- 12 years). Total fluoroscopy time was reduced from 18 +/- 6 min in Group 2 to 12 +/- 5 min in Group 1 (P < 0.001). Moreover, the dose area product was significantly lower (1555 +/- 1219 vs. 4935 +/- 2094 cGycm2, P < 0.001), total freezing time was significantly shortened (1855 +/- 399 vs. 2121 +/- 756 s, P = 0.031), and contrast media use was significantly reduced (66 +/- 25 vs. 109 +/- 27 mL, P < 0.001). At the same time, total procedure duration and complication rates did not differ significantly between both groups. After a 12 months follow-up, a similar percentage of patients was free from recurrences (74% in Group 1 vs. 78% in Group 2, P = 0.640)., Conclusion: Radiation exposure in CB PVI can be markedly reduced without prolonging procedure times, affecting the outcome or complication rates. Moreover, ICE seems to shorten total freezing time. Copyright Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology. All rights reserved. © The Author 2016.

All computed tomography (CT) examinations were performed in two groups with the same tube voltage (100 kV), flow rate of contrast medium (5.0 mL/s), and iodine dose (22.8 g). An automatic mAs and low concentration contrast medium (300 mgI/mL) were used in group A, whereas effective mAs was reduced by a factor 0.6 along with HCCM (400 mgI/mL) in group B. Radiation dose was assessed (CT dose index [CTDIvol] and dose length product), and vessel-based objective IQ for various regions of interest (enhancement, noise, signal-to-noise ratio, and contrast-to-noise ratio), subjective IQ, noise, and motion artifacts were analyzed overall and vessel-based with a 5-point Likert scale., RESULTS: The CT attenuation of coronary arteries and image noise in group B were significantly higher than those in group A (ranges: 507.5-548.1 Hounsfield units vs 407.5-444.5 Hounsfield units; and 20.3 +/- 8.6 vs 17.7 +/- 8.0) (P <= 0.0166).

The zinc level is different in patients with thalassemias. This study aimed to determine the zinc status and its relationship with demographic factors and chelation therapy in beta-thalassemia major (beta-TM) patients. This cross-sectional study was conducted on 102 beta-thalassemia (beta-thal), patients. Zinc level was evaluated in subjects using the atomic absorption method. The results were analyzed through descriptive statistics, chi 2 and Mann-Whitney U tests. Of 102 cases, 92 patients were eligible and evaluated. The mean age was 23 (minimum 11, maximum 43) years. Forty-six percent of cases were males and 54.0% were females. Of the 92 patients taking iron chelators, 29.3% used deferoxamine (DFO), 16.3% deferasirox (DFX), 20.6% DFO and deferiprone (DFP), and 33.8% DFO and DFP. All cases had zinc deficiency, 89.1% had zinc levels <40.0 mg/dL, and 10.9% with zinc levels >40.0 mg/dL. There was a significant relationship between gender and group with zinc levels greater than 40.0 mg/dL and those with less than 40.0 mg/dL. Zinc deficiency is highly prevalent among patients with thalassemia in the city of Yasuj, Iran. There was a significant relationship between zinc levels and gender although no significance was observed between zinc level and age, body mass index (BMI), ferritin, and chelation factors; it is recommended that these patients be periodically evaluated for zinc level. In case of a lack of laboratory evaluation, the use of prophylactic zinc supplementation should be considered for these patients.Copyright © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Excluded

3921,"Prospective assessment of gustatory function after radiotherapy for head and neck cancers Background: Taste disorders are major causes of morbidity in patients undergoing head and neck irradiation. We quantitatively assessed the gustatory function of patients with head and neck cancers who underwent radiotherapy using recently developed standardised tools for measuring taste. Method(s): Twenty patients undergoing head and neck irradiation responded to a specific questionnaire and were assessed by olfactory and gustatory function tests. To assess changes over time, testing was performed before, immediately after, and at 2- and 4-week intervals following the start of radiotherapy. Concurrently, patients were evaluated for xerostomia from radiotherapy. Result(s): A decrease in the taste recognition threshold was observed in the second week after the beginning of radiotherapy. The taste detection threshold improved within the 14th-18th week. Most affected patients demonstrated that their gustatory function primarily decreased independent of the olfactory function. Disturbances in taste were exponentially worsened beyond an accumulated dose of 30 Gy and involved all tastants. According to a multivariate analysis, radiation-induced taste impairment was not influenced by the degree of xerostomia. However, there was an association between the dose of irradiation and the severity of taste disturbance. Conclusion(s): In this preliminary study, we found that the taste function was worse 2 weeks after the start of radiotherapy and returned to pretreatment levels within 4.5 months. Taste disturbances were exponentially worse beyond an accumulated dose of 20 Gy. Taste dysfunction after radiotherapy was not influenced by the degree of xerostomia, whereas only the dose of irradiation was associated with the severity of taste dysfunction.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded

3807,"Association of time of occurrence of electrical heart storms with environmental physical activity Aim Many publications in recent decades have reported a temporal link between medical events and environmental physical activity. The aim of this study was to analyze the time of occurrence of electrical heart storms against levels of cosmological parameters. Methods The sample included 82 patients (71 male) with ischemic cardiomyopathy treated with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator at a tertiary medical center in 1999-2012 (5,114 days). The time of occurrence of all electrical heart storms, defined as three or more events of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation daily, was recorded from the defibrillator devices. Findings were analyzed against data on solar, geomagnetic, and cosmic ray (neutron) activity for the same time period obtained from space institutions in the United States and Russia. Results Electrical storms occurred in all months of the year, with a slight decrease in July, August, and September. Most events took place on days with lower-than-average levels of solar and geomagnetic activity and higher-than-average levels of cosmic ray (neutron) activity. There was a significant difference in mean daily cosmic ray activity between the whole observation period and the days of electrical storm activity (P = 0.0001).

MED-UVB, MMD-UVB and MMD-UVA did not depend on skin phototype. Facultative skin whiteness (L*), erythema (E) and melanin content (M) correlated significantly with MED-UVB while constitutive skin colours were significant for L*, yellowness (b*), E and M. Sun exposure did not significantly correlate with MED-UVB and MMDs, however, an inverse relationship with MED-UVB was demonstrated. Conclusion(s): Minimal erythema doses in our cohort were slightly different from other regional countries. Constitutive and facultative skin whiteness, erythema and melanin content correlated with MED. There was no association between skin phototype and sun exposure with MED or MMD.Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Excluded
4751,"CT manifestations and bone marrow pathological features of pulmonary histoplasmosis Objective: To observe the imaging and clinico-pathological manifestations of pulmonary histoplasmosis (HP). Method(s): Data of 14 patients with pathologically diagnosed lung HP and received antifungal therapy were analyzed. All patients underwent transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB), bone marrow biopsy and bone marrow hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, periodic acid Schiff (PAS) staining, gomori methenamine silver (GMS) staining and immunohistochemical test, while 11 patients underwent broncho alveolar lavage (BAL) and broncho alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) bacteria culture. Ultrasonography results of abdominal and superficial lymph nodes were recorded. Result(s): Among 14 patients, 12 had influenza-like symptoms and 2 had no symptom. Chest CT showed that 1 case of nodular type and 13 cases of mixed type, with multiple pulmonary nodules, exudation and consolidation, some nodules with cavities and all nodules slightly enhanced. Enlarged lymph nodes were observed in 3 cases. Bronchial and alveolar inflammation were showed with TBLB examination, but results of BALF bacterial culture were all negative. HE staining of bone marrow showed histiocytic hyperplasia and granuloma formation. PAS staining all showed magenta mycelia and spores. GMS staining all showed dark brown mycelia and spores. Immunohistochemical CD68 expression (+) indicated macrophages swallowed histoplasmas. The effect of antifungal therapy in all patients was obvious, and intrapulmonary lesions were generally absorbed. Conclusion(s): CT manifestations of pulmonary HP had certain characteristics, and combination of clinical and epidemic history was helpful to diagnosis.Copyright © 2021 by the Press of Chinese Journal of Medical Imaging and Technology.",Excluded

4391,"The relationship between cumulative lifetime ultraviolet radiation exposure, bone mineral density, falls risk and fractures in older adults Data linking cumulative lifetime vitamin D status with skeletal outcomes are lacking. We show that increasing cumulative sun exposure was associated with higher bone mineral density in younger males and protective against fractures in females independent of current vitamin D. This supports the concept that cumulative sun exposure is an important contributor to skeletal health., INTRODUCTION: While low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are associated with increased fracture risk, this reflects only recent sun exposure. The Beagley-Gibson (BG) method utilises microtopographical skin changes to quantify cumulative lifetime ultraviolet radiation (sun) exposure. This study aimed to describe the relationship between BG grade, BMD, falls risk and fractures in older adults., METHODS: Eight hundred thirty-five community-dwelling adults aged 53-83 years had silicone casts from the dorsum of both hands graded by the BG method. BMD was measured using DXA and falls risk using the short form of the Physiological Profile Assessment. Vertebral deformities and symptomatic fractures were assessed by DXA and questionnaire, respectively., RESULTS: The relationship between BG grade, spine BMD and vertebral fracture varied depending upon sex. In females, increasing grade was associated with lower vertebral fracture prevalence (OR = 0.44/grade, p = 0.018) and fewer fractures (OR = 0.82/grade, p = 0.021), particularly major fractures (OR = 0.75/grade, p = 0.03). In males, increasing grade was associated with more DXA-detected vertebral deformities (RR = 1.28/grade, p = 0.001), but not symptomatic fractures. These relationships were independent of BMD, falls risk, smoking and current 25-hydroxyvitamin D. BG grade was not associated with falls risk. For BMD, there were interactions between BG grade and both age and sex and a positive trend with hip BMD in younger males., CONCLUSIONS: BG grade demonstrated beneficial associations with fracture outcomes in females and BMD in younger males independent of current 25-hydroxyvitamin D. These data support the concept that cumulative ultraviolet radiation exposure is an important determinant of skeletal health. The association with vertebral deformities in males may reflect outdoor physical trauma in younger life.",Excluded
4104,"Boron neutron capture therapy combined with early successive bevacizumab treatments for recurrent malignant gliomas - A pilot study Recurrent malignant gliomas (RMGs) are difficult to control, and no standard protocol has been established for their treatment. At our institute, we have often treated RMGs by tumor-selective particle radiation called boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). However, despite the cell-selectivity of BNCT, brain radiation necrosis (BRN) may develop and cause severe neurological complications and sometimes death. This is partly due to the full-dose X-ray treatments usually given earlier in the treatment course. To overcome BRN following BNCT, recent studies have used bevacizumab (BV). We herein used extended BV treatment beginning just after BNCT to confer protection against or ameliorate BRN, and evaluated; the feasibility, efficacy, and BRN control of this combination treatment. Seven patients with RMGs (grade 3 and 4 cases) were treated with BNCT between June 2013 and May 2014, followed by successive BV treatments. They were followed-up to December 2017. Median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) after combination treatment were 15.1 and 5.4 months, respectively. In one case, uncontrollable brain edema occurred and ultimately led to death after BV was interrupted due to meningitis. In two other cases, symptomatic aggravation of BRN occurred after interruption of BV treatment. No BRN was observed during the observation period in the other cases. Common terminology criteria for adverse events grade 2 and 3 proteinuria occurred in two cases and necessitated the interruption of BV treatments.

3771,"Prognostic value of myocardium perfusion imaging with a new reconstruction algorithm Background: It has been demonstrated that a new reconstruction algorithm for myocardium perfusion imaging (MPI) allows faster acquisition with similar accuracy. The prognostic value of MPI performed with this software and short acquisition time is unknown. Method(s): To determine the prognostic value we followed 3184 consecutive MPI patients between March 2008 and March 2010. A 2-day protocol with low dose 99mTc-MIBI (10-12 mCi) and a 6-minute acquisition was used. Exercise stress was used in 62.6 % of the studies. Scans were reconstructed using the software ""Evolution for cardiac"". Perfusion defects were quantified by summed stress score (SSS) and categorized in four groups: SSS0 = 0; SSS1 = 1-3; SSS2 = 4-8; and SSS3 >= 9. Patients were phone contacted every 6 months for follow up and hard events were defined as death or myocardial infarction (MI) and total events as hard events plus late revascularization. Result(s): The mean radiation dose was <7 mSv/patient. Mean F/U was 33 +/- 20 months; 140 of the patients were lost to follow up and 86 were censored due early revascularization (<60 days after MPS). There were 140 hard events: 89 deaths and 51 MI. Mean age was 61.5 +/- 12.3 years and 57.7 % were male. Hard event rate was 0.8 %/year in patients with normal MPS and 3.7 %/year in those with abnormal MPS. Patients with larger defects had nine times more hard events than patients with SSS = 0 (14.2 % vs 1.6 %). Revascularization was more frequent in patients with abnormal MPS than normal MPS (21.7 % vs 3.9 %; P < 0.001). Cox proportional hazard analysis showed that SSS was an independent predictor of hard events and revascularization. Conclusion(s): The use of reduced-dose, fast myocardial perfusion SPECT and the new processing algorithm lowers acquisition time and radiation exposure compared to conventional SPECT without compromising the well-established prognostic value of MPI. © 2013 American Society of Nuclear Cardiology.",Excluded
4849,"Schwann cell engraftment into injured peripheral nerve prevents changes in action potential properties Peripheral nerve injury results in changes in action potential waveform, ion channel organization, and firing properties of primary afferent neurons. It has been suggested that these changes are the result of reduction in basal trophic support from skin targets. Subcutaneous injections of Fluro-Gold (FG) in the hind limb of the rat were used to identify cutaneous primary afferent neurons. Five days after FG injection, sciatic nerves were ligated and encapsulated in a silicon tube allowing neuroma formation. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing Schwann cells (SCs) were injected proximal to the cut end of the nerve. Thirteen to 22 days after injury and SC injection, the L4 and L5 dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were prepared for acute culture. Whole cell patch-clamp recordings in current clamp mode were obtained and action potential properties of medium-sized (34-45 microm) FG+ DRG neurons were characterized. In the neuroma group without cell transplantation, action potential duration and spike inflections were reduced as were the amplitude and duration of spike afterhyperpolarizations. These changes were not observed after transection by nerve crush where axons were allowed to regenerate to distal peripheral targets. In the transplantation group, GFP(+)-SCs were extensively distributed throughout the neuroma, and oriented longitudinally along axons proximal to the neuroma. Changes in action potential properties were attenuated in the GFP(+)-SC group. Thus the engrafted SC procedure ameliorated the changes in action potential waveform of cutaneous primary afferents associated with target disconnection and neuroma formation.",Excluded
3892,"What is new in the clinic of emphysematous pyelonephritis? INTRODUCTION & OBJECTIVES: Emphysematous pyelonephritis (EPN) is a severe, fortunately rare, potentially fatal necrotizing pyelonephritis with a variable clinical presentation, ranging from side pain to septic shock. The majority of cases occur in diabetics with poor glycemic control, while a small percentage may be due to urinary tract obstruction. The disease shows a high mortality rate (19-43%). Escherichia coli is the main causative agent (80%). Diagnosis of EPN should be supported by radiologically. In X Ray, psoas muscle shadow is wiped out in the same side and gas bubble can be observed in renal anatomical locations. Ultrasonograpy is inadequate; intravenous pyelography is not preferable due to the need of contrast material. The best imaging technique is computer tomography (CT) to show renal gas forming and associated tissues. The traditional treatment is parenteral antibiotics treatment and surgical treatment. Surgical treatment including percutaneous catheter drainage (PCD) and nephrectomy. In this text, our five patients diagnosed with EPN were evaluated with the reviewing of the present literature. MATERIAL & METHODS: The patients' demographic data, clinical presentation, investigation findings, treatment, and outcome were retrospectively studied. Gas forming was reported in CT for all patients. Urine cultures, white blood cell, sedimentation and C reactive protein levels were collected. We applied a parenteral treatment which consists of ceftriaxone 1 gr 2x1 and metronidazole 500 mg 2x1 for 14 day to all patients. RESULT(S): Our patients consist of three women and two men. The mean age was 62 (range 51-82). Four patients had kidney stone and three of them had second type Diabetes Mellitus as co morbid factors. The most common clinical findings were tachycardia, fever and flank pain. The patients' Urine culture was positive for Escherichia coli with a significant colony count. Radiological examination gave a diagnosis of EPN. While 3 patients were successfully treated by medical therapy alone, 1 had double J stenting according to ureterorenoscopy and 1 had ultrasound-guided PCD. The mean hospitalization period was 16 days (range 14-21). All patients were discharged with recovery. CONCLUSION(S): EPN predominantly affects female diabetics and immunocompromised patients. However, obstruction is another predisposing factor in non diabetic patients. Escherichia coli was found to be the causative organism in all the patients. Treatment comprised of resuscitation, normalization of serum electrolytes and blood sugars, administration of parenteral antibiotics, and relieving ureteric obstruction if present. Only the medical treatment can be a safe strategy in selected cases. Unlike the present literature, we think that EPN is not so mortal disease in today's conditions due to progress in medical care including the early diagnosis and treatment procedures.",Excluded
4590,"Implications for preserving neural stem cells in whole brain radiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation: A review of 2270 metastases in 488 patients This study delineated the incidence of metastatic involvement of neural stem cell (NSC) regions and further aimed to explore the feasibility of selectively sparing the NSC compartments during whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). A total of 2270 intracranial metastases in 488 patients were identified. Lesions were classified according to locations, including lesions in the NSC compartments (subventricular zone, SVZ, or hippocampus) and those in the rest of the brain/brainstem. The incidence of involvement of NSC regions was compared between oligometastatic patients (those with 14 lesions) and non-oligometastatic patients (those with 5 or more lesions) using a chi-square test. The volume of the NSC regions accounted for 2.23% of the whole brain, and the overall rate of metastatic lesions in NSC regions was 1.1% in 2270 metastases (25/2270), and 4.7% in 488 patients (23/488). Of the NSC region metastases, 7 (0.3%) involved the hippocampus and 18 (0.8%) occurred in the SVZ. Among the 7 hippocampal metastases identified in this study, 1/7 (14.3%) were found in oligometastatic patients, while 6/7 (85.7%) metastases were in non-oligometastatic patients. For metastases in the SVZ, all lesions occurred in non-oligometastatic patients with none in oligometastatic patients. Metastatic involvement of the NSC compartments was significantly lower in oligometastatic patients (0.15%, 1/670) than in non-oligometastatic patients (1.5%, 24/1600) (P < 0.001). Our retrospective review of 2270 metastases in 488 patients is that the volume of the compartments of NSC regions was 2.23% relative to the whole brain, but the incidence of involvement of the NSC compartments was 1.1%, and the vast majority of NSC lesions were found in nonoligometastatic patients. We believe our data supports selective reduction of doses for these aforementioned structures, when treating oligometastatic patients with WBRT and locally advanced-stage small-cell lung cancer patients with PCI. © The Author 2012.

4586,"Impact of radiotherapy dose on dentition breakdown in head and neck cancer patients Purpose: To evaluate the severity of post-radiation dental lesions and possible correlation with radiation dose to the teeth in patients treated for head and neck cancers. Methods and Materials: Data from 93 head and neck radiotherapy patients treated between 1997 and 2008 were analyzed retrospectively. The main effect, radiation dose to the individual teeth, was evaluated with covariates of elapsed time after radiation, xerostomia, topical fluoride use, and oral hygiene status included. Patients' radiotherapy plans were used to calculate cumulative exposure for each tooth. Patients' teeth were evaluated using a validated index and then categorized as having none-slight or moderate-severe post-radiation damage. Result(s): Patients (31 females, 62 males) ranged in age from 18-82 years (mean 57). The number of teeth-patient ranged from 3-30 (mean 20) with a total of 1873 teeth evaluated. Overall, 51% of teeth had moderate-severe damage, with the remaining having little or none. Using odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals, the odds for moderate-severe damage were 2-3 times greater for teeth exposed to between 30 and 60 Gy as compared to no radiation. However, for teeth exposed to >= 60 Gy as compared to no radiation the odds of moderate-severe tooth damage was greater by a magnitude of 10 times. Conclusion(s): The results indicate that there is minimal tooth damage below 30 Gy (salivary gland threshold), a greater than 1:1 increased dose-response between 30 and 60 Gy likely related to salivary gland damage, and a critical threshold of >= 60 Gy, which may be linked to direct effects of radiation on tooth structure. These findings suggest that care should be taken during the treatment planning process to limit tooth dose, and when clinically possible to limit tooth dose to less than 60 Gy. © 2011 American Society for Radiation Oncology.",Excluded
4178,"The Artemis Program: An Overview of NASA's Activities to Return Humans to the Moon NASA is developing a two-phased approach to quickly return humans to the Moon and establish a sustainable presence in orbit and on the surface. The two phases run in parallel, and both have already begun, with selection of the first Gateway element, the Power and Propulsion Element, solicitation activities focused on an American-built, industry-provided Human Landing System, and discussions with industry and international partners about potential opportunities for collaboration. Phase 1 is driven exclusively by the administration's priority to land the first woman and the next man on the lunar South Pole by 2024. In this phase, NASA and its partners will develop and deploy two Gateway components: the Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) that will launch in 2022, and the Habitation and Logistics Outpost (HALO), a minimal habitation capability) that will launch in 2023. Both will launch on commercial rockets, as will Gateway logistics deliveries to outfit the ship and provide supplies for surface expeditions. This initial Gateway configuration represents the beginning of its capability buildup, and the primary components required to support the first human expedition to the lunar South Pole. NASA's baseline reference approach for human expeditions on the surface is for Human Landing Systems to aggregate and dock to the Gateway, then deploy to the lunar South Pole with two astronauts aboard. Phase 2 is focused on advancing the technologies that will foster a sustainable presence on and around the Moon - a lasting and productive presence enabled by reusable systems, access for a diverse body of contributing partners, and repeatable trips to multiple destinations across the lunar surface. In this Phase, we will advance sustainable systems to make surface expeditions more repeatable and affordable. While the Gateway is the first of its kind to be funded, the concept has been proposed for decades as a necessary and foundational capability for a sustainable return to the Moon, and a port for vehicles embarking to farther destinations. It supports every tenet of Space Policy Directive-1 and the infrastructure it provides is critical to an accelerated return to the Moon, and access to more parts of the Moon than ever before. The Gateway also provides a unique platform to conduct cross-discipline science. Science instruments, both internal and external to the Gateway, have the potential to reveal new findings in space science, Earth science, and biological research data from deep space. Additionally, the broad science community will be able to utilize the communications and data relay capabilities of the Gateway, beginning with the PPE in Phase 1. This paper will outline the cross-discipline activities NASA is currently conducting, and those the agency anticipates conducting in the future to successfully implement Phases 1 and 2 in the lunar vicinity, all while preparing for humanity's next giant leap: Mars. 2020 IEEE.",Excluded
4425,"Plan quality and delivery time comparisons between volumetric modulated arc therapy and intensity modulated radiation therapy for scalp angiosarcoma: A planning study using X-ray voxel Monte Carlo algorithm Purpose/Objective(s): Radiation therapy (RT) dose calculations for treating scalp angiosarcoma must consider heterogeneous regions with multilayered complex densities of the bolus, scalp, skull, cerebral fluid, and brain. As a model-based algorithm does not accurately consider these various densities, it may not provide a sufficiently precise dose calculation for scalp angiosarcoma, resulting in the need for a more accurate dose calculation algorithm. We evaluated the advantages of volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) over intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in terms of plan quality, delivery time, and monitor unit (MU) using the x-ray Voxel Monte Carlo (XVMC) algorithm. Materials/Methods: Four patients were selected for this planning study. Clinical target volume (CTV) was defined as gross tumor volume (GTV) and the scalp, plus a margin of 30 mm added to the GTV along the scalp surface. Planning target volume (PTV) was determined by adding a 2-mm isotropic margin to the CTV. The median PTV was 465.9 cm3 (range 215.0-932.8 cm3). Three different coplanar treatment plans were created for each case, comprising a 2-arc VMAT plan as well as 5-field and 9-field step and shoot IMRT plans using a photon energy of 6 MV. Dose calculation was performed using the XVMC algorithm. Total RT dose of 60 Gy was prescribed to the PTV in 30 fractions. The homogeneity index (HI) of the PTV, conformity index (CI) of the PTV, organ at risk (OAR) doses, delivery time, and MU were calculated and compared. Result(s): VMAT, 5-field, and 9-field IMRT plans showed the following features, respectively: median values of HI, 0.14, 0.17, and 0.15; CIs100%, 0.64, 0.61, and 0.64; CIs98%, 0.72, 0.67, and 0.72; and CIs95%, 0.75, 0.68, and 0.72. All plans satisfied the dose constraints of OARs, except for the left lens in 2 cases with the 5-field IMRT plan. The median delivery time for VMAT, 5-field, and 9-field IMRT plans were 192, 659, and 885 s, respectively. Delivery time for VMAT was significantly shorter than that for the other 2 plans (P<0.01). The median MUs of the VMAT, 5-field, and 9-field IMRT plans were 1093, 747, and 912, respectively, with no significant differences. Conclusion(s): The VMAT provided plan quality comparable to 9-field IMRT and was superior to 5-field IMRT in terms of doses to both the PTV and OARs. Additionally, VMAT provided a shorter delivery time than IMRT without a significant increase in MU. Therefore, we recommend VMAT as a sophisticated irradiation technique for the treatment of scalp angiosarcoma.",Excluded
3834,"Residential radon and lung cancer in Sweden: risk analysis accounting for random error in the exposure assessment A large epidemiologic study on residential radon exposure and lung cancer has been conducted in Sweden. An attempt is now made to quantify the impact of random error in the exposure assessment on the risk estimate for lung cancer in this study. The study included 1,360 lung cancer cases, diagnosed from 1980 to 1984, and 2,847 population controls. Radon measurements were performed in 8,992 dwellings occupied by the study subjects some time since 1947. Questionnaires provided information on smoking and other risk factors. Imprecision in the retrospective exposure assessment for radon was estimated from a Monte Carlo technique modeling Swedish conditions. Adjusted risk estimates were obtained from regression analyses based on expected values for true time-weighted average residential radon concentration (TWA), conditional on observed TWA. Without adjustment for random error in the TWA estimates, the linear excess relative risk coefficient was 0.10 per 100 Bq m(-3), but an excess relative risk of about 0.15 to 0.20 per 100 Bq m(-3) was suggested following adjustment. The potentially significant consequences of errors in the retrospective radon exposure assessment should be taken into consideration in the risk estimation as well as in comparisons of results of different studies and in future pooled analyses.",Excluded
4707,"Dissecting the hematopoietic microenvironment. V: limitations of repair following damage to the hematopoietic support stroma Damage and repair of the hematopoietic microenvironment of the spleen was studied using X-irradiation, anoxic necrosis induced by splenic ligation, or a combination of the two, as the destructive agents. Spleen colony number, size and type, 59Fe uptake, and microscopic study of splenic structure were used as means of assessment. The most severe or least repaired damage was induced by high dose irradiation (4000 r), by 1000 r followed immediately by splenic ligation, and by two successive splenic ligations separated by a 30 day recovery period. It was seen that reduction of CFUs lodgment, as measured by f factor, played a very major role in the lesser number of spleen colonies formed after either kind of damage. Following the several treatments, the numbers of spleen colonies formed, their size and their typing as erythrocytic or granulocytic varied independently of each other, suggesting that these functions of the microenvironment, and the cell types responsible for them, are independent of each other. The exhaustion of regenerative capacity displayed by repeatedly ligated spleens suggested a maximal limit for stromal cell replications commensurate with Hayflick's hypothesis.",Excluded
4329,"Glutamatergic input is coded by spike frequency at the soma and proximal dendrite of AII amacrine cells in the mouse retina In the mammalian retina, AII amacrine cells play a crucial role in scotopic vision. They transfer rod signals from rod bipolar cells to the cone circuit, and divide these signals into the ON and OFF pathways at the discrete synaptic layers. AII amacrine cells have been reported to generate tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive repetitive spikes of small amplitude. To investigate the properties of the spikes, we performed whole-cell patch-clamping of AII amacrine cells in mouse retinal slices. The spike frequency increased in proportion to the concentration of glutamate puffer-applied to the arboreal dendrite and to the intensity of the depolarizing current injection. The spike activity was suppressed by L-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid, a glutamate analogue that hyperpolarizes rod bipolar cells, puffer-applied to the outer plexiform layer. Therefore, it is most likely that the spike frequency generated by AII amacrine cells is dependent on the excitatory glutamatergic input from rod bipolar cells. Gap junction blockers reduced the range of intensity of input with which spike frequency varies. Application of TTX to the soma and the proximal dendrite of AII amacrine cells blocked the voltage-gated Na(+) current significantly more than application to the arboreal dendrite, indicating that the Na(+) channels are mainly localized in these regions. Our results suggest that the intensity of the glutamatergic input from rod bipolar cells is coded by the spike frequency at the soma and the proximal dendrite of AII amacrine cells, raising the possibility that the spikes could contribute to the OFF pathway to enhance release of neurotransmitter.",Excluded
4441,"Differential effects of genotoxic stress on both concurrent body growth and gradual senescence in the adult zebrafish Among vertebrates, fish and mammals show intriguing differences in their growth control properties with age. The potential for unlimited or indeterminate growth in a variety of fish species has prompted many questions regarding the senescent phenomena that appear during the aging process in these animals. Using zebrafish as our model system, we have attempted in our current study to examine the growth phenomena in fish in relation to the onset of senescence-associated symptoms, and to evaluate the effects of genotoxic stress on these processes. We observed in the course of these analyses that the zebrafish undergoes continuous growth, irrespective of age, past the point of sexual maturation with gradually decreasing growth rates at later stages. Animal population density, current body size and chronological age also play predominant roles in regulating zebrafish growth and all inversely influence the growth rate. Interestingly, the induction of genotoxic stress by exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) did not adversely affect this body growth ability in zebrafish. However, IR was found to chronically debilitate the regeneration of amputated caudal fins and thereby induce high levels of abnormal fin regeneration in the adult zebrafish. In addition, by resembling and mimicking the natural course of aging, IR treatments likewise enhanced several other symptoms of senescence, such as a decline in reproductive abilities, increased senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity and a reduction in melatonin secretion. Our current data thus suggest that during the lifespan of zebrafish, the onset of senescence-associated symptoms occurs in parallel with continuous growth throughout mid-adulthood. Moreover, our present findings indicate that genotoxic DNA damage may play a role as a rate-limiting factor during the induction of senescence, but not in the inhibition of continuous, density-dependent growth in adult zebrafish.",Included
4004,"Angiographic and clinical outcomes at 8 months of cutting balloon angioplasty and beta-brachytherapy for native vessel in-stent restenosis (BETACUT): results from a stopped randomized controlled trial The objective of this study was to assess angiographic and clinical outcomes of cutting balloon (CB) angioplasty and concomitant Sr/Y-90 beta-brachytherapy as a treatment modality for patients with native vessel in-stent restenosis (ISR). Procedural advantages over the standard balloon (SB) have been claimed for the CB. Intracoronary brachytherapy preceded by SB angioplasty is regarded as the treatment of choice in patients with ISR. In an interim analysis of a prospective randomized trial designed for 652 patients, 100 consecutive patients with ISR were assigned to treatment with SB angioplasty (n = 51) or CB angioplasty (n = 49), followed in either case by Sr/Y-90 beta-brachytherapy. Quantitative coronary angiography at baseline, postintervention, and at 8 months was performed by an independent central laboratory. More than 90% of target lesions in the overall patient population were diffuse, with 14% of stents totally occluded. Procedural parameters and immediate angiographic outcomes were essentially the same in either study arm. At 8 months, no statistically significant differences were observed in recurrent angiographic restenosis (SB = 26.1%; CB = 29.5%; P = 0.82), target lesion revascularizations (SB = 13.7%; CB = 8.2%; P = 0.53), and major adverse cardiac events (SB = 15.7%; CB = 8.2%; P = 0.36). In this interim analysis, there was no indication of a beneficial effect of CB use over SB use in terms of angiographic or clinical outcomes at 8-month follow-up. CB angioplasty appears to be as safe and efficacious as SB angioplasty in beta-radiation treatment of patients with predominantly diffuse native vessel ISR. It was decided to discontinue the trial.

4925,"Impact of chemical exposure on cancer mortality in a French cohort of uranium processing workers BACKGROUND: Nuclear workers may be exposed to a variety of chemical hazards, in addition to radiation. We examined the effect of chemical exposures on cancer mortality among French uranium processing workers at the AREVA NC Pierrelatte facility., METHODS: A cohort of 2,897 uranium processing workers employed for at least 6 months was followed from 1968 through 2006. Exposure to uranium and potentially carcinogenic chemicals was assessed with a plant-specific job-exposure matrix. Mortality hazard ratios (HRs) for cancers of the lung, lymphohematopoietic system, kidney and bladder, brain and central nervous system (BCNS), and prostate were estimated for each specific chemical exposure, with Cox regression models stratified for sex and calendar period and adjusted for socioeconomic status. Additional adjustments enabled us to examine the effect of co-exposure to uranium and other chemicals., RESULTS: Exposure to aromatic solvents was associated with increased risk of BCNS malignancies after adjustment for other chemicals (HR=6.53, 95% CI=1.14-37.41; n=6) and for other chemicals and uranium (HR=7.26, 95% CI=0.90-58.19) in the annual exposure status model. Selected groups of lymphohematopoietic cancers were found associated with solvent exposure. Inconclusive results were found regarding chromium (VI) exposure, since only 2 workers died from lung cancer among 109 exposed., CONCLUSION: Based on our pilot study, it seemed important to take into account chemical exposures in the analyses of cancer mortality among French uranium processing workers.

Overweight patients received 37% higher dose and obese patients 107% higher dose to the organs compared to normal-weight patients. There were no statistically significant differences between IQ, except between normal weight and overweight patients. A strong correlation (r = 0.733) was found between BMI and DAP and between BMI and E (r = 0.776).Copyright © The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

3895,"Predictive value of secondary signs of obstruction in follow-up computed tomography of ureteral stones: a study with dynamic computed tomography OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the ratio of obstruction and predictive values of secondary signs in follow-up computed tomography (CT) of ureterolithiasis patients; to correlate stone characteristics with obstruction; to compare enhancement of obstructed and non-obstructed kidneys; and to compare radiation dose of the dynamic CT protocol to an excretory-phase protocol., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study assessed 49 follow-up CT scans of patients with remaining ureterolithiasis after a renal colic episode. Obstruction was measured as time taken to excretion of contrast medium in dynamic CT. Degree of secondary signs of obstruction was evaluated from the unenhanced CT. Data were collected on patients' gender and age, stone size and location, time from renal colic to follow-up, attenuation of the renal cortex and radiation dose., RESULTS: Obstruction was present in 28% (n = 14) at follow-up. Predictive values (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value) were calculated for hydronephrosis (1.0, 0.63, 0.52, 1.0), hydroureter (1.0, 0.4, 0.4, 1.0), perirenal stranding (0.21, 0.94, 0.6, 0.75), Gerota's fascia (0.21, 0.97, 0.75, 0.76) and renal swelling (0.21, 0.97, 0.75, 0.76). Obstruction was not correlated with stone characteristics. Enhancement was lower in obstructed kidneys (p < 0.01). Radiation dose was reduced by 43% (1.8 mSv)., CONCLUSIONS: Obstruction was found in 28% of patients. Secondary signs were scarce and of indeterminate value to the diagnosis of obstruction. The absence of hydronephrosis and hydroureter contradicted obstruction. Stone characteristics were not correlated with obstruction. Enhancement of the renal cortex was lower in obstructed kidneys. The dynamic protocol reduced the radiation dose.",Excluded
3951,"Detrimental effects of electron beam irradiation on the cowpea bruchid Callosobruchus maculatus BACKGROUND: Electron beam (eBeam) irradiation technology is an environmentally friendly, chemical-free alternative for disinfesting insect pests of stored grains. The underlying hypothesis is that specific doses of eBeam will have defined detrimental effects on the different life stages. We evaluated the effects of eBeam exposure in a range of doses (0.03-0.12 kGy) on the development of the cowpea bruchid (Callosobruchus maculatus) at various stages of its life cycle., RESULTS: Differential radiosensitivity was detected during egg development. Early and intermediate stages of eggs never hatched after exposure to a dose of 0.03 kGy, whereas a substantial portion of black-headed (i.e. late) eggs survived irradiation even at 0.12 kGy. However, further development of the hatched larvae was inhibited. Although midgut protein digestion remained intact, irradiated larvae (0.06 kGy or higher) failed to develop into normal living adults; rather, they died as pupae or abnormally eclosed adults, suggesting a detrimental effect of eBeam on metamorphosis. Emerged irradiated pupae had shorter longevity and were unable to produce any eggs at 0.06 kGy or higher. At this dose range, eggs laid by irradiated adults were not viable. eBeam treatment shortened adult longevity in a dose-dependent manner. Reciprocal crosses indicated that females were more sensitive to eBeam exposure than their male counterparts. Dissection of the female reproductive system revealed that eBeam treatment prevented formation of oocytes., CONCLUSION: eBeam irradiation has very defined effects on cowpea bruchid development and reproduction. A dose of 0.06 kGy could successfully impede cowpea burchid population expansion. This information can be exploited for post-harvest insect control of stored grains.

4493,"Evaluation of endogenous control gene(s) for gene expression studies in human blood exposed to 60Co gamma-rays ex vivo In gene expression studies, it is critical to normalize data using a stably expressed endogenous control gene in order to obtain accurate and reliable results. However, we currently do not have a universally applied endogenous control gene for normalization of data for gene expression studies, particularly those involving (60)Co gamma-ray-exposed human blood samples. In this study, a comparative assessment of the gene expression of six widely used housekeeping endogenous control genes, namely 18S, ACTB, B2M, GAPDH, MT-ATP6 and CDKN1A, was undertaken for a range of (60)Co gamma-ray doses (0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 Gy) at 8.4 Gy min(-1) at 0 and 24 h post-irradiation time intervals. Using the NormFinder algorithm, real-time PCR data obtained from six individuals (three males and three females) were analyzed with respect to the threshold cycle (Ct) value and abundance, DELTACt pair-wise comparison, intra- and inter-group variability assessments, etc. GAPDH, either alone or in combination with 18S, was found to be the most suitable endogenous control gene and should be used in gene expression studies, especially those involving qPCR of gamma-ray-exposed human blood samples.

4619,"Regression models for near-infrared measurement of subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness Obesity is often associated with the risks of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and there is a need to measure subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) thickness for acquiring the distribution of body fat. The present study aimed to develop and evaluate different model-based methods for SAT thickness measurement using an SATmeter developed in our laboratory. Near-infrared signals backscattered from the body surfaces from 40 subjects at 20 body sites each were recorded. Linear regression (LR) and support vector regression (SVR) models were established to predict SAT thickness on different body sites. The measurement accuracy was evaluated by ultrasound, and compared with results from a mechanical skinfold caliper (MSC) and a body composition balance monitor (BCBM). The results showed that both LR- and SVR-based measurement produced better accuracy than MSC and BCBM. It was also concluded that by using regression models specifically designed for certain parts of human body, higher measurement accuracy could be achieved than using a general model for the whole body. Our results demonstrated that the SATmeter is a feasible method, which can be applied at home and in the community due to its portability and convenience.",Excluded
3802,"Timing of Adjuvant Fractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery Affects Local Control of Resected Brain Metastases Purpose: For resected brain metastases (BMs), stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is often offered to minimize local recurrence (LR). Although the aim is to deliver SRS within a few weeks of surgery, a variety of socioeconomic, medical, and procedural issues can cause delays. We evaluated the relationship between timing of postoperative SRS and LR. Methods and Materials: We retrospectively identified a consecutive series of patients with BM managed with resection and SRS or fractionated SRS at our institution from 2012 to 2018. We assessed the correlation of time to SRS and other demographic, disease, and treatment variables with LR, local recurrence-free survival, distant recurrence, distant recurrence-free survival, and overall survival. Result(s): A total of 133 patients met inclusion criteria. The median age was 64.5 years. Approximately half of patients had a single BM, and median BM size was 2.9 cm. Gross total resection was achieved in 111 patients (83.5%), and more than 90% of patients received fractionated SRS. The median time to SRS was 37.0 days, and the LR rate was 16.4%. Time to SRS was predictive of LR. The median time from surgery to SRS was 34.0 days for patients without LR versus 61.0 days for those with LR (P < .01). The LR rate was 2.3% with SRS administered <=4 weeks postoperatively, compared with 23.6% if SRS was administered >4 weeks postoperatively (P < .01). Local recurrence-free survival was also improved for patients who underwent SRS at <=4 weeks (P = .02). Delayed SRS was also predictive of distant recurrence (P = .02) but not overall survival. Conclusion(s): In this retrospective study, the strongest predictor of LR after postoperative SRS for BM was time to SRS, and a cutoff of 4 weeks was a reliable predictor of recurrence. These findings merit investigation in a prospective, randomized trial.Copyright © 2021",Excluded
4060,"Robotic stereotactic ablative radiotherapy for renal cell carcinoma in patients with impaired renal function Background: Robotic stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is currently under investigation as a noninvasive treatment option for patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). For radiation therapy of RCC, tumor motion and the need for high ablative doses while preserving the remaining renal parenchyma is a challenge. We aimed to analyze the safety and efficacy of robotic radiosurgery in RCC in a specific difficult subgroup of patients with impaired renal function. Method(s): We retrospectively identified all patients with RCC, treated with robotic SABR and motion compensation in our institution between 2012 and 2017. Either single fraction SABR of 24 or 25 Gy or 3 fractions of 12 Gy prescribed to the 70% isodose line was applied. Local control, overall survival, radiation side effects were evaluated together with renal function and tumor motion. Result(s): We analyzed data of 13 lesions treated in 10 patients with clear cell RCC and a mean age of 70.5 +/- 13.6 years (range: 48-87). Prior to SABR, 8 patients underwent previous complete and/or partial nephrectomy, 7 patients presented with chronic kidney disease >= stage 3. The median of minimum, mean and maximum planning target volume doses were 23.2, 29.5 and 35.0 Gy for single fraction and 24.4, 42.5 and 51.4 Gy for the three fractions regime. Persistent local control by robotic SABR was achieved in 9 out of 10 patients (92.3% of all lesions) within a median follow-up period of 27 month (range: 15-54). One patient underwent nephrectomy due to progressive disease and sufficient renal function of the contralateral kidney. Renal function remained stable with a mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 51.3 +/- 19.7 ml/min at baseline and 51.6 +/- 25.8 ml/min at follow-up. The largest respiratory-induced tumor motion was seen in superior-inferior direction, compensated by the CyberKnife with mean targeting errors of maximal 2.2 mm. Conclusion(s): Robotic SABR is technically feasible for the treatment of RCC in preexisting kidney disease with good local tumor control at about 2 years follow-up. Robotic SABR with motion tracking offers a valid treatment option for patients, who are at increased risk for progression to end-stage renal disease due to partial nephrectomy or ablative techniques.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).",Excluded
3848,"DNA damage and repair of head and neck cancer cells after radio- and chemotherapy DNA repair is critical for successful chemo- and radiotherapy of human tumours, because their genotoxic sensitivity may vary in different types of cancer cells. In this study we have compared DNA damage and the efficiency of its repair after genotoxic treatment with hydrogen peroxide, cisplatin and gamma-radiation of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Lymphocytes and tissue cells from biopsies of 37 cancer patients and 35 healthy donors as well as the HTB-43 larynx cancer cell line were employed. The cell sensitivity to genotoxic treatment was estimated by the MTT survival assay. The extent of DNA damage and efficiency of its repair was examined by the alkaline comet assay. Among the examined treatments, we found that HNSCC cells were the most sensitive to gamma-radiation and displayed impaired DNA repair. In particular, DNA damage was repaired less effectively in cells from HNSCC metastasis than healthy controls. In conclusion, our results suggest that the different genotoxic sensitivity of HNSCC cells may depend on their DNA repair capacity what in turn may be connected with the effectiveness of head and neck cancer therapy. © 2009 Verlag der Zeitschrift fur Naturforschung, Tubingen.",Included
4231,"Ionizing radiation accelerates the development of atherosclerotic lesions in ApoE-/- mice and predisposes to an inflammatory plaque phenotype prone to hemorrhage After radiotherapy treatment, there is an increased incidence of localized atherosclerosis in patients with Hodgkin's disease, breast cancer, and head and neck cancer. Here, we established a mouse model to study the development and progression of radiation-induced atherosclerosis and to compare the phenotype of these lesions with age-related atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis-prone ApoE-/- mice fed a regular chow diet received single radiation doses of 14 Gy or sham treatments (0 Gy) to the neck, including both carotid arteries. At 22, 28, and 34 weeks after irradiation, blood samples were taken, and the arterial tree was removed for histological examination. Cholesterol levels in irradiated mice were not significantly different from age-matched controls, and markers of systemic inflammation (soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and C-reactive protein) were not elevated. The lesions in irradiated arteries were macrophage rich, with a remarkable influx of inflammatory cells, predominantly granulocytes. Intraplaque hemorrhage and erythrocyte-containing macrophages were seen only in lesions of irradiated arteries. Based on these data, we propose that irradiation accelerates the development of macrophage-rich, inflammatory atherosclerotic lesions prone to intraplaque hemorrhage.",Included

Method(s): The present study is a retrospective analysis. Cases of hematologic malignancies and associated pre-malignant conditions were collected from the regional Central North Dakota Cancer Registry, and analysis of study-specific demographic factors was performed. Result(s): Significantly higher incidence of hematologic cancers and pre-malignant disorders was associated with residence in an ""urban"" county and rural city/town. Within the latter designation, there was a higher rate of self-reported agricultural occupation (40% vs 10%, P < 0.0001).

3930,"Workflow and radiation safety implications of (18)F-FDG PET/CT scans for radiotherapy planning UNLABELLED: The use of (18)F-FDG PET/CT for radiotherapy planning may lead to better tumor volume definition. Reproduction of the patient's position when setting up an (18)F-FDG PET/CT scan for radiotherapy planning is more accurate if a radiation therapist is involved. The aim of this study was to compare setup time and staff radiation dose between radiation therapists and nuclear medicine technologists., METHODS: Forty patients with newly diagnosed head and neck or non-small cell lung cancer were prospectively recruited into this study. Twenty patients (10 with head and neck cancer and 10 with non-small cell lung cancer) underwent (18)F-FDG PET/CT for radiotherapy planning, and 20 patients (10 with head and neck cancer and 10 with non-small cell lung cancer) underwent (18)F-FDG PET/CT for staging. Setup time was measured, and a radiation monitor recorded the highest dose (muSv/h) to staff during setup., RESULTS: For radiation therapists, the mean setup time for a lung scan (in min:s) was 5:22 +/- 2:11 (range, 2:22-9:23), with a highest dose of 4.94 +/- 3.78 muSv (range, 2.02-15.23 muSv), and the mean setup time for a head and neck scan was 4:49 +/- 1:45 (range, 2:03-8:21), with a highest dose of 3.93 +/- 1.45 muSv (range, 1.19-6.83 muSv). For nuclear medicine technologists, the mean setup time for a lung scan was 1:58 +/- 0:24 (range, 1:17-2:38), with a highest dose of 3.30 +/- 1.28 muSv (range, 1.92-5.47 muSv), and the mean setup time for a head and neck scan was 2:12 +/- 0:38 (range, 1:03-3:16), with a highest dose of 3.10 +/- 1.78 muSv (range, 1.56-7.49 muSv)., CONCLUSION: This study showed that setup time and operator radiation dose were greater for radiation therapists setting up planning (18)F-FDG PET/CT scans than for nuclear medicine technologists setting up routine (18)F-FDG PET/CT scans. These results have implications for scheduling of radiotherapy planning PET/CT; however, the additional radiation dose was not considered to be significant.",Excluded

All had clinical stage IV disease. The prescribed dose was 60-160 Gy. The local control rate, survival rate, and predictors of the prognosis were evaluated. Adverse events related to treatment were also noted. The average follow-up time was 29 months (range 9-74 months). Among the 23 patients, six had local failure and 11 died during the follow-up period. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 87.0%, 55.4%, and 47.5%, respectively. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year progression-free survival rates were 73.9%, 47.0%, and 39.2%, respectively. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year local control rates were 82.1%, 73.9%, and 73.9%, respectively. Age and distant metastasis were independent predictors of survival, while the preoperative duration of the disease was an independent predictor of local control.

4085,"Outcomes and prognostic stratification of patients with recurrent glioblastoma treated with salvage stereotactic radiosurgery OBJECTIVE Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most malignant form of astrocytoma. The average survival is 6-10 months in patients with recurrent GBM (rGBM). In this study, the authors evaluated the role of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in patients with rGBMs. METHODS The authors performed a retrospective review of their brain tumor database (1997-2016). Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) after salvage SRS were the primary endpoints evaluated. Response to SRS was assessed using volumetric MR images. RESULTS Fifty-three patients with rGBM underwent salvage SRS targeting 75 lesions. The median tumor diameter and volume were 2.55 cm and 3.80 cm3, respectively. The median prescription dose was 18 Gy (range 12-24 Gy) and the homogeneity index was 1.90 (range 1.11-2.02). The median OS after salvage SRS was estimated to be 11.0 months (95% CI 7.1-12.2) and the median PFS after salvage SRS was 4.4 months (95% CI 3.7-5.0). A Karnofsky Performance Scale score >= 80 was independently associated with longer OS, while small tumor volume (< 15 cm3) and less homogeneous treatment plans (homogeneity index > 1.75) were both independently associated with longer OS (p = 0.007 and 0.03) and PFS (p = 0.01 and 0.002, respectively). Based on these factors, 2 prognostic groups were identified for PFS (5.4 vs 3.2 months), while 3 were identified for OS (median OS of 15.2 vs 10.5 vs 5.2 months). CONCLUSIONS SRS is associated with longer OS and/or PFS in patients with good performance status, small-volume tumor recurrences, and heterogeneous treatment plans. The authors propose a prognostic model to identify a cohort of rGBM patients who may benefit from SRS.Copyright ©AANS 2019",Excluded
4512,"Anatomical and functional changes in the upper airways of sleep apnea patients due to mandibular repositioning: A large scale study The obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is a sleep related breathing disorder. A popular treatment is the use of a mandibular repositioning appliance (MRA) which advances the mandibula during the sleep and decreases the collapsibility of the upper airway. The success rate of such a device is, however, limited and very variable within a population of patients. Previous studies using computational fluid dynamics have shown that there is a decrease in upper airway resistance in patients who improve clinically due to an MRA. In this article, correlations between patient-specific anatomical and functional parameters are studied to examine how MRA induced biomechanical changes will have an impact on the upper airway resistance. Low-dose computed tomography (CT) scans are made from 143 patients suffering from OSAHS. A baseline scan and a scan after mandibular repositioning (MR) are performed in order to study variations in parameters. It is found that MR using a simulation bite is able to induce resistance changes by changing the pharyngeal lumen. The change in minimal cross-sectional area is the best parameter to predict the change in upper airway resistance. Looking at baseline values, the ideal patients for MR induced resistance decrease seem to be women with short airways, high initial resistance and no baseline occlusion. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Excluded

Since no difference in the biological effectiveness of electrons compared with megavoltage photons has been demonstrated in laboratory studies, there is no hesitation in combining electrons with photons. The selection of the various energies, the combination of electrons with photons, and the ratio of the given doses of each beam depend on the location of the tumor and the maximum depth to be treated.

4224,"A comparison of leg length discrepancy with function and satisfaction scores after cemented total hip replacement Introduction: Total Hip replacement (THR) is considered an effective surgical intervention for the relief of chronic pain and functional disability. However, a proportion of patients experience a poor outcome. Leg length discrepancy (LLD) can be introduced, or not corrected, at the time of operation. Previous research has shown that patients with LLD reported a lower functional outcome than those with equal leg lengths. We report on a cohort of 146 patients with a minimum of 3-year follow-up who underwent cemented total hip replacement. We have compared the data when looking at independent variables including age, sex, BMI, femoral head size, offset of stem, grade of surgeon, surgical approach and cup type. Material(s) and Method(s): 146 patients were followed up for a mean of 3.66 years (range 3.25-4.5 years). There were 96 females and 45 males. The mean age at surgery was 77 years (range 50-95 years). All patients were reviewed in clinic or contacted by postal survey for assessment of function and satisfaction. The pre-operative X-rays were compared with early post-operative X-rays. LLD was assessed radiologically according to the method of Woolson, as modified by Konyves and Bannister, on plain sequential AP pelvis radiographs by 2 independent observers. Result(s): Mean LLD was 2 mm (range -10 mm to +14 mm). No significant association was found for the above independent variables. The overall stem alignment was satisfactory. A non-significant reduction in function (measured by oxford hip score, SF- 12 and satisfaction score) was noted in association with LLD of greater than 5 mm. Discussion(s): We report radiological LLD after cemented THR. This has previously been reported as being linked to function. We found a non-significant correlation between reported function and satisfaction with LLD. However 94% of our observed limb lengths were within 1 cm of the other side. There was no significant association between LLD and other independent variables.",Excluded
4503,"Comprehensive toxicity risk profiling in radiation therapy for head and neck cancer: A new concept for individually optimised treatment Background and purpose: A comprehensive individual toxicity risk profile is needed to improve radiation treatment optimisation, minimising toxicity burden, in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. We aimed to develop and externally validate NTCP models for various toxicities at multiple time points. Material(s) and Method(s): Using logistic regression, we determined the relationship between normal tissue irradiation and the risk of 22 toxicities at ten time points during and after treatment in 750 HNC patients. The toxicities involved swallowing, salivary, mucosal, speech, pain and general complaints. Studied predictors included patient, tumour and treatment characteristics and dose parameters of 28 organs. The resulting NTCP models were externally validated in 395 HNC patients. Result(s): The NTCP models involved 14 organs that were associated with at least one toxicity. The oral cavity was the predominant organ, associated with 12 toxicities. Other important organs included the parotid and submandibular glands, buccal mucosa and swallowing muscles. In addition, baseline toxicity, treatment modality, and tumour site were common predictors of toxicity. The median discrimination performance (AUC) of the models was 0.71 (interquartile range: 0.68-0.75) at internal validation and 0.67 (interquartile range: 0.62-0.71) at external validation. Conclusion(s): We established a comprehensive individual toxicity risk profile that provides essential insight into how radiation exposure of various organs translates into multiple acute and late toxicities. This comprehensive understanding of radiation-induced toxicities enables a new radiation treatment optimisation concept that balances multiple toxicity risks simultaneously and minimises the overall toxicity burden for an individual HNC patient who needs to undergo radiation treatment.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s)",Excluded

We present our experience in the treatment on robotic system <>, UK. Material(s) and Method(s): Since 2010 this method therapy is applied for treating patients with brain tumors in Khabarovsk Clinical Oncology Centre. During the period of May 2010 - December 2012, 43 patients were treated using SRT. 30 patients with meningioma; 4 - with recurrent astrocytoma; 3 - with metastasis; 3 - with hemispheric cavernous malformation; 2 case of intracanalicular vestibular schwannoma; 1 patient with adenoma. Patients' age from 23 to 71 years old (mean, 52 Y). 10 men and 33 women. Formation of conformal dose distribution was obtained by multileaf (40-pair) collimator with a 0.25 mm accuracy of positioning. Frame fixation was standard. Dose distribution was calculated via XiO system. Patient positioning inaccuracy was measured by X-ray Volume Imaging (XVIm). The correction of patient's position was preformed automatically with HexaPod system, resulting in 0.1 mm accuracy by linear coordinates and 0.1degree by angular coordinates. Result(s): In the 6-months of postradiation period the stabilization of tumor and regression of symptoms was found in all patients. At the 12 months follow-up period tumor shrinking was found in 3 patients, in other cases the stabilization of tumor was observed. There were no severe adverse events. Conclusion(s): Our moderate experience of SRT of patients with brain tumors shows an effectiveness of the method. Moreover, in cases of tumor localization in eloquent areas and in patients with high operative risk, SRT implementation presents as the only accessible type of treatment.

Experimental and clinical studies showed an increased radiation effect with an acceptable toxicity by delivering drug via a continuous intravenous infusion., METHODOLOGY: From 1988 to 1998, 80 patients radically operated on for stages B2-C rectal cancer were irradiated with 3 fractions of 100 cGy per day to a total dose of 5,600 cGy. 34 out of these 80 patients underwent postoperative radiotherapy alone and 46 received radiotherapy combined with concomitant protracted infusion of fluorouracil at doses of 250 mg/m2 per day., RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 54 months, the 5-year overall and disease-free survival were 59% and 54%, respectively, in the combined modality group, as compared to 42% and 34%, respectively, in the radiation alone group. The differences were not significant, but the incidence of local relapse and patients' survival showed a better trend for combined approach., CONCLUSIONS: The data from international literature are in favor of a combined approach, both in preoperative and postoperative treatment of advanced rectal cancer. Adjuvant therapy must be re-evaluated in trials using total mesorectal excision as the standard operative technique.",Excluded
4798,"Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures treated by vertebroplasty with bone cements of different viscosity BACKGROUND: Vertebroplasty is one of the effective methods for minimally invasive treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. Bone cement as the most commonly used filling material is disputed on its clinical effects of different viscosity. OBJECTIVE(S): To compare the efficacy and safety of different viscosity bone cement vertebroplasty in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. METHOD(S): One hundred and eighty-three patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture were randomly divided into four groups: percutaneous vertebroplasty with high viscosity bone cement group (group A), percutaneous vertebroplasty with low viscosity bone cement group (group B), percutaneous kyphoplasty with high viscosity bone cement group (group C), and percutaneous kyphoplasty with low viscosity bone cement group (group D). RESULTS AND CONCLUSION(S): (1) The operative time and X-ray exposure time were longer in the two low viscosity bone cement groups than the two corresponding high viscosity bone cement groups, respectively. (2) After operation, visual analogue scale scores and disability index scores were gradually decreased in the all the groups. Compared with the group A, the visual analogue scale score and disability index score were lower in the group C; compared with group B, the visual analogue scale score and disability index score were lower in the group D. (3) After operation, the kyphosis Cobb angle was gradually reduced and the sagittal index of injured vertebrae were gradually increased in all the groups. The postoperative Cobb angle value was ranked as follows: group A > group C > group D. (4) Compared with two low viscosity bone cement groups, two high viscosity bone cement group had lower incidence of adverse events. These findings indicate that high viscosity bone cement has better safety and effectiveness in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. The clinical efficacy of percutaneous kyphoplasty with high viscosity bone cement is the best among the four systems.Copyright © 2018, Journal of Clinical Rehabilitative Tissue Engineering Research.

4303,"Treatment results and prognostic factors for advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy Objective: To review our experience with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) for patients with advanced resectable squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the larynx and to evaluate the factors affecting survival and larynx preservation. Study design: Retrospective study. Subjects and methods: The records of 102 patients with stage III or IV resectable SCC of the larynx treated with CCRT between February 1994 and March 2009 were reviewed. Of 102 patients, 59 were treated with high-dose regimens, including cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), methotrexate, and leucovorin or docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-FU, and 43 were treated with low-dose regimens, including carboplatin and uracil-tegafur or S-1. Radiotherapy was delivered 5 days a week using a single daily fraction of 1.8-2.0 Gray (Gy), to a total dose of 66.0-70.2 Gy. Overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and DSS with larynx preservation were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods. The log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to identify significant prognostic factors for DSS and DSS with larynx preservation. Result(s): The 5-year OS and DSS for all patients treated with CCRT were 63.9 and 70.7 %, respectively. The 5-year DSS with larynx preservation was 54.1 %. On multivariate analysis, N stage, synchronous multiple primary cancers, and the contents of chemotherapy were significant predictors of OS for patients undergoing CCRT; T stage, N stage, and the contents of chemotherapy were significant prognostic factors for larynx preservation. Conclusion(s): The treatment method including the indication for CCRT may be determined by the contents of the chemotherapy and the T and N stages of laryngeal SCC. It is important to diagnose multiple synchronous primary cancers before CCRT. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
4835,"Long-term survival for advanced esophageal cancer patients with an esophago-bronchial fistula can be achieved by timely multimodality therapy We reported four consecutive advanced esophageal cancer patients with esophago-bronchial fistula (EBF) who were managed well and achieved long-term survival with timely multimodality therapy including bypass operation. Eighty-four patients with esophageal cancer located in the upper or middle esophagus who were treated in our institute from 2005 to 2013 were diagnosed with cT4 at the time of admission. Eight (9.5%) of those 84 cT4 patients developed the esophago-bronchial/tracheal fistula. Out of eight patients, four (50%) who responded to prior chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy received esophageal bypass operations to manage their QOL and continue the following therapy. Not only nutrition and quality of life but also fighting spirit were maintained by allowing oral intake and resulted in completion of postoperative chemoradiotherapy in all 4 patients. Multimodality treatment including a bypass operation provided high QOL and long-term survival even in advanced esophageal cancer patients with EBFs.Copyright © The Japan Esophageal Society and Springer Japan 2014.",Excluded
4392,"Leg alignment does not affect tibial baseplate migration at 10 years following total knee arthroplasty INTRODUCTION: Adequate fixation of implant components is an important goal for all arthroplasty procedures, and aseptic loosening is one of the leading causes of revision surgery in total knee arthroplasty [1]. Recent findings supporting a natural ""physiologic varus"" alignment in some patients have launched an ongoing debate in total knee arthroplasty with respect to the optimal position of the implant components [2]. The purpose of the present study was to examine the long-term fixation of a cemented titanium fixed bearing polished tibial baseplate, and examine the effect of alignment on implant migration. Method(s): Patients enrolled in a previous two-year prospective trial were recalled at ten years. While 35 patients were enrolled in the original study, 16 were available for follow-up at 10 years after excluding patients that were deceased (n = 9), unable to attend due to poor health (n = 9), or lost to follow-up (n = 1). All patients underwent total knee arthroplasty by one of three surgeons, receiving a posterior-stabilized CoCr-on-polyethylene implant from a single manufacturer. Each patient underwent radiostereometric analysis (RSA) imaging in a supine position using a conventional RSA protocol at 1 week, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 10 years post-operatively. Patients also received a three-foot standing x-ray from which leg alignment was measured at the 10-year follow-up. Migration of the tibial component in all planes, measured from RSA, was compared between the 2 year and 10-year follow-up visits. Comparisons of tibial component migration at 10 years between neutral (0 +/- 3 deg) and varus (>3 deg varus) aligned limbs were performed. Outcome scores including the Knee Society Score, WOMAC, SF-12, Forgotten Joint Score, and UCLA Activity Score were recorded. Result(s): At 10 years, the mean migrations of the tibial component were less than 0.1 mm and 0.1 deg in all planes relative to the post-operative RSA exam. There was no significant difference in tibial component migration between the 2 year and 10 year follow-ups, nor was there a significant difference in migration between the neutral and varus limb-aligned groups at 10 years. Tibial component subsidence at 10 years (Figure 1A) was -0.05 +/- 0.15 mm in the neutral group and -0.11 +/- 0.25 mm in the varus limb-aligned group (p = 0.81). The change of tibial component coronal plane alignment at 10 years (Figure IB) was 0.01 +/- 0.14 deg towards valgus in the neutral group and 0.13 +/- 0.38 deg towards varus in the varus limb-aligned group (p =0 .97). There was no correlation between any changes in the position of the tibial component with femoral alignment, tibial alignment, or overall limb alignment. WOMAC and Knee Society Scores were significantly improved (p < 0.0001) at the latest follow-up versus pre-operative scores. There was no significant correlation between implant migration and UCLA Activity Score (r2 = 0.02 to 0.18) or the Forgotten Joint Score (r = 0.01 to 0.34). Discussion(s): The implant was well fixed at 10 years, with no significant difference in migration from the previous two-year follow-up. The excellent long-term fixation of this implant supports the high survivorship for this implant system reported in the literature [3]. Femoral, tibial, and overall limb alignment had no effect on the migration of the tibial baseplate at 10 years follow-up. Both the neutral and varus aligned groups demonstrated minimal change in position of the tibial baseplate overtime. SIGNIFICANCE: The implant demonstrated excellent long-term fixation with no effect of alignment on migration in any plane. Based on the results of the present study, further assessment of patient-specific, physiologic alignment for total knee arthroplasty could be indicated.",Excluded
4402,"What can space radiation protection learn from radiation oncology? Protection from cosmic radiation of crews of long-term space missions is now becoming an urgent requirement to allow a safe colonization of the moon and Mars. Epidemiology provides little help to quantify the risk, because the astronaut group is small and as yet mostly involved in low-Earth orbit mission, whilst the usual cohorts used for radiation protection on Earth (e.g. atomic bomb survivors) were exposed to a radiation quality substantially different from the energetic charged particle field found in space. However, there are over 260,000 patients treated with accelerated protons or heavier ions for different types of cancer, and this cohort may be useful for quantifying the effects of space-like radiation in humans. Space radiation protection and particle therapy research also share the same tools and devices, such as accelerators and detectors, as well as several research topics, from nuclear fragmentation cross sections to the radiobiology of densely ionizing radiation. The transfer of the information from the cancer radiotherapy field to space is manifestly complicated, yet the two field should strengthen their relationship and exchange methods and data.Copyright © 2021",Excluded
4889,"Possible involvement of the facial nucleus in regulation of respiration in rats The facial nucleus (FN) has been known as a motor nucleus to control the activity of the facial skeletal muscles by its efferent somatic motoneurons. Much less, however, is known about the non-motor control functions of its interneurons. The present study was designed to investigate if the interneurons of the FN participate in controlling rhythmic respiration in the sodium thiopental-anesthetized and vagotomized Sprague-Dawley rats with facial motoneurons retrogradely degenerated with techniques of electrical and chemical stimulation of the FN and extracellular recording of discharge of neurons in the FN. Single pulse stimulation (75-100 microA, 0.2 ms) of the FN during inspiration caused a transient restrain in phrenic discharge. Short train stimulation (75-100 microA, 0.2 ms, 100 Hz, 3-5 pulses) delivered during the early- or mid-term of inspiration augmented the inspiratory duration, but switched the inspiration off when delivered during the later stage of inspiration. Short train stimulation delivered during expiration prolonged the expiratory duration. Continuous stimulation could inhibit the inspiration. Microinjection of kainic acid into the FN caused an augmentation in inspiratory duration and amplitude and in expiratory duration. These data indicate that the interneurons of the FN might participate in the modulation of respiration. Different discharge patterns of interneurons in the FN, interestingly some respiratory related patterns, were observed, which provide a possible structural basis for the role of the FN in respiratory regulation.",Excluded
3766,"ATM and p53 combined analysis predicts survival in glioblastoma multiforme patients: A clinicopathologic study Glioblastoma is one of the most malignant cancers, with a distinguishing dismal prognosis: surgery followed by chemo- and radiotherapy represents the current standard of care, and chemo- and radioresistance underlie disease recurrence and short overall survival of patients suffering from this malignancy. ATM is a kinase activated by autophosphorylation upon DNA doublestrand breaks arising from errors during replication, byproducts of metabolism, chemotherapy or ionizing radiations; TP53 is one of the most popular tumor suppressor, with a preeminent role in DNA damage response and repair. To study the effects of the immunohistochemical expression of p-ATM and p53 in glioblastoma patients, 21 cases were retrospectively examined. In normal brain tissue, p-ATM was expressed only in neurons; conversely, in tumors cells, the protein showed a variable cytoplasmic expression (score: +,++,+++), with being completely undetectable in three cases. Statistical analysis revealed that high p-ATM score (++/+++) strongly correlated to shorter survival (P = 0.022). No difference in overall survival was registered between p53 normally expressed (NE) and overexpressed (OE) glioblastoma patients (P = 0.669). Survival analysis performed on the results from combined assessment of the two proteins showed that patients with NE p53 /low pATM score had longer overall survival than the NE p53/ high pATM score counterpart. Cox-regression analysis confirmed this finding (HR = 0.025; CI 95% = 0.002-0.284; P = 0.003). Our study outlined the immunohistochemical expression of p-ATM/p53 in glioblastomas and provided data on their possible prognostic/predictive of response role. A ""non-oncogene addiction"" to ATM for NEp53 glioblastoma could be postulated, strengthening the rationale for development of ATM inhibiting drugs.Copyright © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
4660,"Cell Salvage During Liver Transplantation for Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Retrospective Analysis of Tumor Recurrence Following Irradiation of the Salvaged Blood BACKGROUND: Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is the treatment option for early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). OLT is often associated with high blood loss, requiring blood transfusion. Retransfusion of autologous blood is a key part of blood conservation. There are, however, concerns that the retransfusion of salvaged blood might cause the spread of cancer cells and induce metastasis. Irradiation of salvaged blood before retransfusion eliminates viable cancer cells. Here, we analyzed the incidence of tumor recurrence in patients with HCC undergoing OLT who received irradiated cell-salvaged blood during transplant surgery., METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients undergoing OLT for HCC between 2002 and 2018 at our center. We compared the tumour recurrence in patients who received no retransfusion of autologous blood with patients who received autologous blood with or without preceding irradiation of the blood., RESULTS: Fifty-one (40 male, 11 female) patients were included in the analysis; 10 patients developed tumor recurrence within a time period of 2.45 +/- 2.0 years. Statistical analysis revealed that there was no significant difference in tumor recurrence between patients who received autologous blood with or without irradiation., CONCLUSION: Intraoperative transfusion of cell-salvaged blood did not increase tumor recurrence rates. Cell salvage should be used in liver transplantation of HCC patients as part of a blood conservation strategy. The effect of blood irradiation on tumor recurrence could not be definitively evaluated.

4690,"Gamma Knife surgery for parasellar meningiomas: long-term results including complications, predictive factors, and progression-free survival OBJECT: Stereotactic radiosurgery serves as an important primary and adjuvant treatment option for patients with many types of intracranial meningiomas. This is particularly true for patients with parasellar meningiomas. In this study, the authors evaluated the outcomes of Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) used to treat parasellar meningiomas., METHODS: The study is a retrospective review of the outcomes in 138 patients with meningiomas treated at the University of Virginia from 1989 to 2006; all patients had a minimum follow-up of 24 months. There were 31 men and 107 women whose mean age was 54 years (range 19-85 years). Eighty-four patients had previously undergone resection. The mean pre-GKS tumor volume was 7.5 ml (range 0.2-54.8 ml). Clinical and radiographic evaluations were performed, and factors related to favorable outcomes in each case were assessed., RESULTS: The mean follow-up duration was 84 months (median 75.5 months, range 24-216 months). In 118 patients (86%), the tumor volume was unchanged or had decreased at last follow-up. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated radiographic progression-free survival at 5 and 10 years to be 95.4% and 69%, respectively. Fourteen patients (10%) developed new cranial nerve palsies following GKS. Factors associated with tumor control included younger age, a higher isodose, and smaller tumor volume. A longer follow-up duration was associated with either a decrease or increase in tumor volume. Fourteen patients (10%) experienced new or worsening cranial nerve deficits after treatment. Factors associated with this occurrence were larger pretreatment tumor volume, lower peripheral radiation dose, lower maximum dose, tumor progression, and longer follow-up., CONCLUSIONS: Gamma Knife surgery offers an acceptable rate of tumor control for parasellar meningiomas and accomplishes this with a low incidence of neurological deficits. Radiological control after radiosurgery is more likely in those patients with a smaller tumor volume and a higher prescription dose.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): Prospectively collected registry data were retrospectively analyzed to compare the procedural, short- and long-term outcomes of consecutive F-BEVAR performed from January 2010 to December 2014 under standard mobile C-arm versus hybrid room guidance in a high-volume aortic center. Result(s): A total of 262 consecutive patients, including 133 patients treated with a mobile C-arm equipped operating room and 129 with a HOR guidance, were enrolled in this study. Patient radiation exposure and contrast media volume were significantly reduced in the HOR group. Short-term clinical outcomes were improved despite higher case complexity in the HOR group, with no statistical significance. At a median follow-up of 63.3 months (Q1 33.4, Q3 75.9) in the C-arm group, and 44.9 months (Q1 25.1, Q3 53.5, p=0.53) in the HOR group, there was no statistically significant difference in terms of target vessel occlusion and limb occlusion. When the endograft involved 3 or more fenestrations and/or branches (complex F-BEVAR), graft instability (36% vs 25%, p=0.035), reintervention on target vessels (20% vs 11%, p=0.019) and total reintervention rates (24% vs 15%, p=0.032) were significantly reduced in the HOR group. The multivariable Cox regression analysis did not show statistically significant differences for long-term death and aortic-related death between the 2 groups. Conclusion(s): Our study suggests that better long-term clinical outcomes could be observed when performing complex F-BEVAR in the latest generation HOR.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.",Excluded

3838,"Effect of vitamin D supplementation and ultraviolet B exposure on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations in healthy volunteers: A randomized, crossover clinical trial Background Solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation during the summer and vitamin D supplementation are two major sources of vitamin D for humans at northern latitudes. However, little is known about the relative efficiency of these two vitamin D sources. Objectives The main goal was to compare the efficiency of high-dose oral vitamin D3 supplementation (2000 IU per day for 30 days) with a simulated summer UV exposure [10 sunbed sessions to a total dose of 23.8 standard erythema doses (SED)] to improve vitamin D status. Methods Healthy volunteers were randomized into two groups: group 1 received vitamin D supplementation followed by 10 whole-body sunbed exposures; group 2 started with 10 sunbed exposures followed by vitamin D supplementation. Results The oral supplementation with vitamin D3 resulted in a mean (SEM) serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] increase of 25.3 (5.4) nmol L -1. A similar increase, 19.8 (5.4) nmol L-1, was observed after simulated summer UV exposure. At the end of the study, serum 25(OH)D concentrations were similar in both groups. Conclusions Twice-weekly whole-body sunbed exposure to a dose of 4.8 SED is equal to 2000 IU daily of oral vitamin D supplementation for 30 days and enough to achieve and maintain serum 25(OH)D concentrations > 75 nmol L-1 in ~55% of cases. Based on our calculations, this dose corresponds to a cumulative weekly whole-body exposure of 3.4 SED (~ 40 min around midday during the summer at the latitude of Oslo). What's already known about this topic? Solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation and vitamin D supplementation are two major sources of vitamin D for humans. During winter months (October-March) vitamin D formation in the skin is insufficient due to the low UVB fluences at latitudes above 40degreeN. Little is known about the relative efficiency of these two vitamin D sources, with respect to efficiency in increasing serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]. What does this study add? Twice-weekly whole-body UV exposure to a dose of 4.8 standard erythema doses (SED) for 5 weeks to a total dose of 23.8 SED is equal to 2000 IU daily of oral vitamin D supplementation for 30 days and enough to achieve and maintain serum 25(OH)D concentrations > 75 nmol L-1 in Eoe55% of cases.

The distribution of chromatid breaks induced in the late G2 portion of the cell cycle by 60 cGy of X-rays appeared bimodal in the study population. In six controls (13 percent) and in 12 of 19 (63 percent) A-T heterozygotes, the yields of X-ray-induced breaks observed were within the higher mode of the distribution. However, lymphocytes from A-T heterozygotes sensitive to the induction of chromatid breaks by 60 cGy did not contain increased numbers of aberrations following exposure to 20 cGy. The radio-resistant inhibition of DNA synthesis that occurs in A-T homozygotes was not observed in heterozygotes. Co-cultivation experiments showed an increased G2 delay in lymphocytes from an A-T heterozygote whose lymphocytes contained increased X-ray-induced chromatid breaks. The results show a significant association of A-T heterozygosity with G2 chromosomal sensitivity (P less than 0.001; Wilcoxon rank sum test). The measurement of X-ray-induced breaks, however, failed to identify 37 percent of A-T heterozygotes tested. The predicted prevalence of increased sensitivity to X-rays in controls is approximately three- to 30-fold greater than the estimated frequency of A-T heterozygotes in the general population. Therefore, although the increased sensitivity to X-ray-induced chromatid breaks appears to be associated with the A-T-gene, it is not a reliable indicator of A-T heterozygosity. Genetic or environmental factors other than the A-T gene also must be involved in the increased clastogenic response.",Included
4725,"Phase I trial of trametinib with neoadjuvant chemoradiation in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer Purpose: The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway is critical to the development of colorectal cancers, and KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF mutations foster resistance to radiation. We performed a phase I trial to determine the safety of trametinib, a potent MEK1/2 inhibitor, with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) chemoradiation therapy (CRT) in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). Patients and Methods: Patients with stage II/III rectal cancer were enrolled on a phase I study with 33 study design, with an expansion cohort of 9 patients at the MTD. Following a 5-day trametinib lead-in, with pre- and posttreatment tumor biopsies, patients received trametinib and CRT, surgery, and adjuvant chemotherapy. Trametinib was given orally daily at 3 dose levels: 0.5 mg, 1 mg, and 2 mg. CRT consisted of infusional 5-FU 225 mg/m2/day and radiation dose of 28 daily fractions of 1.8 Gy (total 50.4 Gy). The primary endpoint was to identify the MTD and recommended phase II dose. IHC staining for phosphorylated ERK (pERK) and genomic profiling was performed on the tumor samples. Result(s): Patients were enrolled to all dose levels, and 18 patients were evaluable for toxicities and responses. Treatment was well tolerated, and there was one dose-limiting toxicity of diarrhea, which was attributed to CRT rather than trametinib. At the 2 mg dose level, 25% had pathologic complete response. IHC staining confirmed dose-dependent decrease in pERK with increasing trametinib doses. Conclusion(s): The combination of trametinib with 5-FU CRT is safe and well tolerated, and may warrant additional study in a phase II trial, perhaps in a RAS/RAF-mutant selected population.Copyright © 2020 American Association for Cancer Research.",Excluded
4515,"Clinical outcomes of definitive chemoradiotherapy using carboplatin and paclitaxel in esophageal cancer Patients with nonmetastatic esophageal cancer not suitable for surgery can be treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy with curative intent. The purpose of this retrospective study is to evaluate the clinical outcomes of definitive chemoradiotherapy using carboplatin and paclitaxel. Medical records were reviewed of patients treated for nonmetastatic squamous cell or adenocarcinoma of the esophagus between January 2009 and December 2013 in two collaborating institutes. Treatment consisted of external beam radiotherapy (28 fractions of 1.8 Gy) and 6 weekly courses of carboplatin (AUC = 2) and paclitaxel (50 mg/m2). Data on survival, progression, toxicity, and effect on dysphagia were recorded. Sixty-six patients were included. Median overall survival (OS) was 13.1 months (95% CI 4.7-21.5 months) and a 2-year OS was 30% (95% CI 18%-42%). At 2 years, 26% of patients developed local progression (95% CI 15%-37%) and 49% developed distant metastases (95% CI 36%-64%). Acute toxicity grade >=3 was observed in 47% of patients. Late adverse events grade >=3 were seen in 20%, mostly esophageal stenoses. Of patients with available data 3 months after treatment, 70% had relief of dysphagia. Definitive chemoradiotherapy led to a median OS of 13 months. Toxicity was common, mostly due to hematological toxicity. Given the relatively short median survival, an adequate selection of patients for this intensive treatment is required.Copyright © The Authors 2017.

Anderson experience Background: The incidence and survival of melanoma are increasing, but little is known about its long-term health effects in adult survivors. Method(s): A health survey was available from 996 melanoma survivors (577 treated with surgery alone, and 391 with combined treatments). Their medical/physiologic and psychosocial responses were analyzed and compared with those of the survivors from other cancers. Result(s): The melanoma survivors were 44.8 +/- 12.8 years of age at diagnosis (significantly younger than the survivors of other cancers) and 63.7 +/- 12.8 years at survey. Melanoma survivors were less likely to report that cancer had affected their health than survivors of other cancers (15.8% vs. 34.9%). The 577 individuals treated with surgery alone reported arthritis/osteoporosis, cataracts, and heart problems most frequently (less often than survivors of other cancers). The 391 individuals who had undergone combined treatments reported circulation problems and kidney problems generally as often as survivors of other cancers. Health problems were not associated with number of decades since diagnosis but with age at diagnosis, treatment modality, and family relationships. Conclusion(s): We present information from a large cohort of long-term survivors of melanoma. As a group, they were less likely to report that cancer had affected their overall health than survivors of other cancers; a number of disease related and psychosocial factors appear to influence their health profiles. © 2006 Stava et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
3779,"Rotational angiography for diagnosis and surgical planning in the management of spinal vascular lesions OBJECT: The management of spinal vascular malformations has undergone significant evolution with the advent of advanced endovascular and angiographic technology. Three-dimensional rotational spinal angiography is an advanced tool that allows the surgeon to gain a better appreciation of the anatomy of these spinal vascular lesions and their relation to surrounding structures. This article describes the use of rotational angiography and 3D reconstructions in the diagnosis and management of spinal vascular malformations., METHODS: The authors present representative cases involving surgical treatment planning for spinal vascular malformations with focus on the utility and technique of rotational spinal angiography. They report the use of rotational spinal angiography for a heterogeneous collection of vascular pathological conditions., RESULTS: Eight patients underwent rotational spinal angiography in addition to digital subtraction angiography (DSA) for the diagnosis and characterization of various spinal vascular lesions. Postprocessed images were used to characterize the lesion in relation to surrounding bone and to enhance the surgeon's ability to precisely localize and obliterate the abnormality. The reconstructions provided superior anatomical detail compared with traditional DSA. No associated complications from the rotational angiography were noted, and there was no statistically significant difference in the amount of radiation exposure to patients undergoing rotational angiography relative to traditional angiography., CONCLUSIONS: The use of rotational spinal angiography provides a rapid and powerful diagnostic tool, superior to conventional DSA in the diagnosis and preoperative planning of a variety of spinal vascular pathology. A more detailed understanding of the anatomy of such lesions provided by this technique may improve the safety of the surgical approach.",Excluded

We evaluated UVN to guide percutaneous puncture in PTED. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 12 patients (8 men and 4 women), who had undergone PTED with the help of UVN or fluoroscopic guidance for lumbar disc herniation from November 2017 to December 2017. Result(s): The age of these 12 patients range was 26-71 years, and the body mass index range was 18.19-26.91 kg/m2. Of the 12 patients, 6 were in UVN group and 6 were in fluoroscopy group. The mean number of punctures was 1.00 in UVN group and 3.83 in fluoroscopy group. The mean exposure time was 3.60 and 13.80 seconds in UVN and fluoroscopy groups, respectively. The mean operation time was 48.17 minutes and 61.33 minutes in UVN and fluoroscopy groups, respectively. A positive relationship was found between operation time and exposure time (P < 0.05). All patients achieved excellent or good clinical outcomes. The Oswestry Disability Index and visual analog scales for leg pain and back pain all showed significant improvement after the procedure (P < 0.05). None of patients experienced a complication. Conclusion(s): UVN decreased the number of puncture attempts, radiation exposure, and operation time compared with fluoroscopic guidance in PTED. Therefore, UVN is a feasible and efficient method for guiding percutaneous puncture in PTED.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
4312,"Reproducibility of diaphragm position assessed with a voluntary breath-holding device Purpose: To evaluate the reproducibility of diaphragm position in our new breath-holding radiotherapy for abdominal tumors using image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) and a voluntary breath-holding device, Abches. Material(s) and Method(s): Patients treated with abdominal tumors using IGRT with Abches were enrolled. Twenty patients without dementia or severe lung disease were analyzed. Each fraction of all patients was set up with kV cone-beam CT with reference to the vertebral bodies. Before daily treatment, electronic portal imaging device (EPID) images of the diaphragm at breath-holding exhale phase were acquired. The difference in the diaphragm position relative to the vertebral body was analyzed by comparing EPID images and the digitally reconstructed radiograph of the planning CT. We evaluated the reproducibility of two axes: superior-inferior (S-I) and right-left (R-L) with the EPID measurements. Result(s): The 443 irradiation data sets were analyzed. The interfractional reproducibility of the diaphragm relative to vertebral bodies was 1.7 +/- 1.4 mm in the S-I and 1.4 +/- 1.2 mm in the R-L direction. Conclusion(s): This technique has good interfractional reproducibility and visibility of the diaphragm during irradiation. Its use is feasible in the routine clinical setting and irradiation. © 2013 Japan Radiological Society.",Excluded
4794,"Pulmonary nodules: effect of adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) technique on performance of a computer-aided detection (CAD) system-comparison of performance between different-dose CT scans PURPOSE: To evaluate the effects of ASIR on CAD system of pulmonary nodules using clinical routine-dose CT and lower-dose CT., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-five patients (body mass index, 22.17 +/- 4.37 kg/m(2)) were scanned by multidetector-row CT with tube currents (clinical routine-dose CT, automatically adjusted mA; lower-dose CT, 10 mA) and X-ray voltage (120 kVp). Each 0.625-mm-thick image was reconstructed at 0%-, 50%-, and 100%-ASIR: 0%-ASIR is reconstructed using only the filtered back-projection algorithm (FBP), while 100%-ASIR is reconstructed using the maximum ASIR and 50%-ASIR implies a blending of 50% FBP and ASIR. CAD output was compared retrospectively with the results of the reference standard which was established using a consensus panel of three radiologists. Data were analyzed using Bonferroni/Dunn's method. Radiation dose was calculated by multiplying dose-length product by conversion coefficient of 0.021., RESULTS: The consensus panel found 265 non-calcified nodules <= 30 mm (ground-glass opacity [GGO], 103; part-solid, 34; and solid, 128). CAD sensitivity was significantly higher at 100%-ASIR [clinical routine-dose CT, 71% (overall), 49% (GGO); lower-dose CT, 52% (overall), 67% (solid)] than at 0%-ASIR [clinical routine-dose CT, 54% (overall), 25% (GGO); lower-dose CT, 36% (overall), 50% (solid)] (p<0.001). Mean number of false-positive findings per examination was significantly higher at 100%-ASIR (clinical routine-dose CT, 8.5; lower-dose CT, 6.2) than at 0%-ASIR (clinical routine-dose CT, 4.6; lower-dose CT, 3.5; p<0.001). Effective doses were 10.77 +/- 3.41 mSv in clinical routine-dose CT and 2.67 +/- 0.17 mSv in lower-dose CT., CONCLUSION: CAD sensitivity at 100%-ASIR on lower-dose CT is almost equal to that at 0%-ASIR on clinical routine-dose CT. ASIR can increase CAD sensitivity despite increased false-positive findings. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded

4812,"Effectiveness of Stereotactic Radiotherapy and Bevacizumab for Recurrent High-Grade Gliomas: A Potential Therapy for Isocitrate Dehydrogenase Wild-Type Recurrent High-Grade Gliomas Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of stereotactic radiotherapy combined with bevacizumab (SRT-Bv) compared with Bv treatment for recurrent high-grade gliomas (HGGs). Method(s): Data for patients with recurrent HGGs who received SRT and Bv (n = 29) or Bv (n = 29) between June 2014 and September 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients received conventional radiotherapy (total, 60 Gy) before this study. SRT was administered at a median dose of 42 Gy in 3-7 fractions. The recurrence pattern was classified into 3 groups: in-field, marginal, and out-field. Result(s): The median overall survival in the SRT-Bv group was significantly longer than that in the Bv group (10.4 vs. 5.6 months; P = 0.02). In patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type tumors, the SRT-Bv treatment significantly prolonged survival more than the Bv treatment (10.9 vs. 8.2 months; P = 0.01). The World Health Organization grade and presence or absence of SRT were significant prognostic factors in the univariate analysis. Besides brain edema in 2 cases and asymptomatic subdural hematoma in 1 case, no other severe adverse effect due to SRT-Bv treatment was recorded. The pattern of recurrence was as follows: in-field, 2 cases (7%); marginal, 8 cases (28%); out-field, 11 cases (38%); no recurrence on radiologic findings, 6 cases (21%); and uncertain, 2 cases (7%). Conclusion(s): SRT-Bv treatment significantly prolonged survival duration more than Bv treatment and provides good local control in patients with recurrent HGGs, especially those with isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type tumors.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
4608,"Biodistribution, radiation dosimetry, and clinical application of a melanin-targeted PET probe,18F-P3BZA, in patients N-(2-(diethylamino)-ethyl)-18F-5-fluoropicolinamide (18F-P3BZA) is a radiotracer that demonstrates high binding selectivity and affinity in melanoma. The aim of the present study was to estimate the biodistribution and clinical radiation dosimetry of18F-P3BZA in healthy volunteers and perform a preliminary clinical application for PET/CT imaging in melanoma patients. Method(s):18F-P3BZA was produced efficiently with a radiosynthesizer. Six healthy volunteers were injected with18F-P3BZA (211.7 +/- 15.4 MBq) followed by serial whole-body PET/CT scans and blood tests to assess biodistribution, pharmacokinetic, and radiation dosimetry at 10 min, 1 h, 2 h, and 4 h after injection. The vital signs of volunteers were recorded in regular intervals during the imaging sessions. The effective dose for each subject after the medical internal radiation dosimetry schema was calculated with OLINDA/EXM software. For the preliminary clinical application, 5 patients with suspected melanomas underwent18F-P3BZA PET/CT imaging at 10 min and 1 h after injection. All patients also underwent18F-FDG PET/CT scans on the third day to compare the potential diagnostic ability of18F-P3BZA with18F-FDG. Result(s): The radiochem-istry yield of18F-P3BZA labeling was 12.3% +/- 3.9%, and the purity of18F-P3BZA after purification and formulation was higher than 99.5%. The highest uptake of18F-P3BZA was in the liver with an SUVmean of 8.3 +/- 1.0 at 10 min after injection. The resultant whole-body effective dose was 0.0193 mSv/MBq.18F-P3BZA showed high uptake and suggested an ability for specific imaging of melanoma and its metastasis in patients. The average SUVmean of18F-P3BZA and18F-FDG in tumors was 19.7 +/- 5.3 and 10.8 +/- 2.7 at 60 min after injection. Conclusion(s): Our study suggests that18F-P3BZA is safe and compatible for clinical use. The first-in-human clinical application to melanoma showed favorable delineated tumors in patients, demonstrating the potential of18F-P3BZA for diagnostic PET imaging of melanoma.Copyright © 2019 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging.",Excluded
4866,"Biochemical and hematologic values for 18 clinically healthy radiated tortoises (Geochelone radiata) on St Catherines Island, Georgia BACKGROUND: The radiated tortoise (Geochelone radiata) is a critically endangered species in its native land, the southern portion of the island of Madagascar. Captive breeding programs have generated data on the breeding behavior and ecology of G radiata; however, hematologic and biochemical data also are critically important in managing populations. OBJECTIVE(S): The purpose of this study was to evaluate sex and seasonal effects on hematologic and biochemical data from captive radiated tortoises. METHOD(S): Whole blood was collected in January and August 2001 from 18 radiated tortoises (10 male, 8 female) housed at the Wildlife Survival Center on St Catherines Island, Georgia, as part of a routine health assessment. Routine hematologic and plasma biochemical analyses and electrophoresis were done using standard methods. Data from male and female tortoises were compared within and between seasons using 2-way ANOVA. RESULT(S): RBC and HCT values were significantly higher in summer than in winter and were higher in males than in females. Total protein concentration did not differ significantly between males and females; however, female tortoises had significantly higher concentrations of alpha1- and beta-globulins in winter and summer compared to males. Male tortoises had significantly higher sodium and uric acid concentrations and LDH activity during winter, and higher urea concentration and LDH and CK activities in summer, compared with females. Female tortoises had significantly higher triglyceride and phosphorus concentrations in winter, and higher phosphorus, cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations in summer, compared with males. CONCLUSION(S): Sex and seasonal differences in hematologic and biochemical values for radiated tortoises likely reflect vitellogenesis and egg production in females, and altered hydration status and activity in summer. Data from the tortoises in this study will be useful for the seasonal health assessment of this species.",Excluded

4678,"Mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy in laboratory mice experimentally enclosed in the radioactive Chernobyl environment Mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy using the protein-coding cytochrome b (Mtcyb) gene was assessed in laboratory mice (C57BL/6 and BALB/c) exposed to the Chernobyl environment. Subacute to subchronic (30-40 days) exposure resulted in a cumulative radiation dose of 1.2-1.6 Gy ( approximately 0.04 Gy/day). Mice were sampled prior to introduction into the enclosures and again after removal from the enclosures. Nucleotide variation (site heteroplasmy) in 306 pre-exposure Mtcyb gene copies (122400 base pairs) was compared to variation in 354 postexposure gene copies (141600 base pairs). Five mutant copies, each characterized by a single nucleotide substitution, were observed (four in the pre-exposure samples, one in a postexposure sample). The frequencies of mutant gene copies and nucleotide substitutions in pre-exposure and postexposure samples were not significantly different. This suggests that this type of exposure (i.e. low dose rate) does not pose a significant mutation risk to the Mtcyb gene in digit tissue. Furthermore, no significant radiation risk to analogous human tissues may exist when occupational exposures involve low dose rates such as these. Finally, linear, cumulative models of genetic risk currently used to estimate radiation-induced effects are likely to be inappropriate for low-dose-rate exposures and need to be re-evaluated critically.",Included
3911,"Biological effects of low-dose chest CT on chromosomal DNA Background: Although the National Lung Screening Trial reported a significant reduction in lung cancer mortality when low-dose (LD) CT chest examinations are used for a diagnosis, their biologic effects from radiation exposure remain unclear. Purpose(s): To compare LD CT and standard-dose (SD) CT for DNA double-strand breaks and chromosome aberrations (CAs) in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Material(s) and Method(s): Between March 2016 and June 2018, 209 participants who were referred to a respiratory surgery department for chest CT studies were prospectively enrolled in this study. Individuals were excluded if they had undergone radiography examinations within the last 3 days or had undergone chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Peripheral blood samples were obtained before and 15 minutes after CT. The number of g-H2AX foci and unstable CAs in lymphocytes was quantified by immunofluorescent staining of g-H2AX and by fluorescence in situ hybridization by using peptide nucleic acid probes for centromeres and telomeres, respectively. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used for statistical analysis. Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple comparisons. Result(s): Of the 209 participants (105 women, 104 men; mean age, 67.0 years 6 11.3 [standard deviation]), 107 underwent chest LD CT and 102 underwent chest SD CT. Sex distribution, age, and body size metrics were similar between the two groups. The median effective dose of LD CT and SD CT was 1.5 and 5.0 mSv, respectively. The number of double-strand breaks and CAs increased after a SD CT examination (g-H2AX, P , .001; CAs, P = .003); the number of double-strand breaks and CAs before and after LD CT was not different (g-H2AX, P = .45; CAs, P = .69). Conclusion(s): No effect of low-dose CT on human DNA was detected. In the same setting, DNA double-strand breaks and chromosome aberrations increased after standard-dose CT.Copyright © RSNA, 2020.",Included

4724,"Three-dimensional anatomic analysis and navigation templates for C1 pedicle screw placement perpendicular to the coronal plane: a retrospective study OBJECTIVE: To explore the corridor for atlas pedicle screw placement perpendicular to the coronal plane and to develop patient-specific navigation templates for pedicle screw placement., METHODS: This study is a retrospective analysis. A total of 71 patients (41 males and 30 females) were involved in this study from June 2016 to June 2018, and they were divided into a template group (39 patients) and a conventional group (32 patients). The CT-based 3D reconstruction models were analyzed in the template group. From the perspective of the 3D atlas in a coronal view, the pedicle corridor was obtained. Taking the center of the tangential circle of the pedicle as the entry point, we simulated screw placement perpendicular to the coronal plane. Then, the individual navigation template was designed and used in surgery. In the conventional group, free-hand pedicle screw placement was performed perpendicular to the coronal plane. The diameter of the maximum tangential circle and screw length of the pedicle corridor were measured in the template group. The surgical time, radiation exposure time, screw grading criteria and so on were evaluated and compared between the two groups after surgery., RESULTS: ;The diameter of the maximum tangential circle and the distance between the entry point and posterior tubercle were significantly greater in males than in females. The operation was successfully completed in all patients, without aggravation of nerve injury, and the follow-up was 12-20 months, with an average of 15.6 months. A total of 78 screws were inserted in the template group, and 64 screws were inserted in the conventional group. The surgical times in the template group and conventional group were 76.47+/-24.44 min and 125.63+/-36.41 min, respectively. The radiation exposure times in the template group and conventional group were 3.51+/-1.77 and 10.15+/-4.95, respectively, and there was a significant difference between the two groups. In the template group, the deviation in the screw entry point and screw angle were 1.92+/-1.67 mm and 2.08+/-1.98degree, respectively. The medial angle deviation between the left and right sides was 2.71+/-1.88degree in the template group, which was significantly less than the deviation of 3.76+/-2.22degree in the conventional group., CONCLUSION: A pedicle screw trajectory perpendicular to the coronal plane can be quickly obtained based on the perspective of 3D models. The technique of screw placement perpendicular to the coronal plane assisted by navigation templates has a shorter operative time, lessintraoperative fluoroscopy and a higher safety of screw placement than traditional surgery.",Excluded
4290,"Radiation esophagitis in the treatment for lung cancer We retrospectively studied the 62 patients with primary lung cancer (56 males and 6 females) who were admitted to our department from January 1990 to December 1996. They were treated with radiation therapy (twice daily) for the chest, including the esophagus. The total radiation dose was 55.6Gy (mean). Esophagitis occurred in 48 patients (77%) after 29.7Gy (mean) of radiation. The symptoms of esophagitis included pharyngeal or chest pain, especially during swallowing. The incidence of esophagitis in the patients (n=46) who received chemotherapy before radiation was significantly higher than that in the patients (n=16) who did not receive it (87% vs. 50%; p<0.05). Esophagitis occurred in 22 (81%) among 27 patients who were given the preventive medicine. In spite of the optimal or supplemental administration of mucosal coating agents, esophagitis improved only in six patients (12%). Severe esophagitis was also observed in some patients, including two patients whose irradiation was terminated and one patient who was treated with intravenous hyperalimentation. Although radiation esophagitis is a very common complication in the treatment for lung cancer, it is refractory to usual treatments. Consequently, it is necessary to develop more effective prophylactic and treatment methods for radiation esophagitis.",Excluded

Method(s): We quantitatively analyzed 21 plans made by 11 clinicians in seven CyberKnife centers. The clinicians were provided with a raw data set (pituitary adenoma and meningioma) including clinical information, and were asked to delineate the lesions and create a treatment plan. Their contouring and plans (10 adenoma and 11 meningioma plans), were then compared. In addition, we estimated the influence of differences in contouring by superimposing the respective contours onto a default plan. Result(s): The median planning target volume (PTV) and the ratio of the largest to the smallest contoured volume were 9.22 cm3 (range, 7.17 - 14.3 cm3) and 1.99 for pituitary adenoma, and 6.86 cm3 (range 6.05 - 14.6 cm3) and 2.41 for meningioma. PTV volume was 10.1 +/- 1.74 cm3 for group 1 with a margin of 1 -2 mm around the CTV (n = 3) and 9.28 +/- 1.8 cm3(p = 0.51) for group 2 with no margin (n = 7) in pituitary adenoma. In meningioma, group 1 showed larger PTV volume (10.1 +/- 3.26 cm3) than group 2 (6.91 +/- 0.7 cm3, p = 0.03). All submitted plan keep the irradiated dose to optic tract within the range of 50 Gy (equivalent total doses in 2 Gy fractionation).

4802,"Survival outcomes and patterns of failure after D2 dissection and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced gastric cancer: A retrospective study objective: The goal of the study was to analyze the incidence and patterns of failure in patients with gastric cancer who received D2 dissection and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Method(s): From January 2004 to October 2015, 324 patients with gastric cancer who underwent radical D2 resection followed by postoperative CRT were enrolled. Clinicopathological characteristics and patterns of failure were retrospectively reviewed to identify factors associated with survival and recurrence. Result(s): After a median follow-up of 30 months, the 3-year overall survival and 3-year disease-free survival rates of these patients were 60.3 and 51.1%, respectively. 117 patients had recurrence or metastasis, with peritoneal recurrence as the most frequent (20.7%), followed by distant metastasis (14.2%). The most commonly involved distant organs were the liver (5.9%) and bone (4.9%). Locoregional failure occurred in 39 patients (12.0%), with isolated regional failure occurring in only 23 (7.1%). Further multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed N stage to be an independent risk factor for distant failure-free survival (p = 0.012). Independent risk factors for peritoneal metastasis were tumor differentiation (p = 0.022), T stage (p =0.035) and vascular invasion (p = 0.016). conclusion: Postoperative CRT has a potential effect on optimizing locoregional control, resulting in only 12.0% of locoregional failure.

Serum thyroid function tests before and after IMRT were regularly monitored. Univariable and multivariable analyses were carried out for predictors of biochemical and clinical hypothyroidism., RESULTS: In total, 149 patients were recruited. After a median follow-up duration of 3.1 years, 33 (22.1%) and 21 (14.1%) patients developed biochemical and clinical hypothyroidism, respectively. Eight (24.2%) patients who had biochemical hypothyroidism developed clinical hypothyroidism later. Univariable and multivariable analyses revealed that the volume of the thyroid (P=0.002, multivariable), VS60 (the absolute thyroid volume spared from 60 Gy or less) (P<0.001, multivariable) and VS45 (P<0.001, multivariable) of the thyroid were significant predictors of biochemical hypothyroidism. The freedom from biochemical hypothyroidism was longer for those whose VS60 >= 10 cm(3) (mean 90.9 versus 62.6 months; P<0.001) and VS45 >= 5 cm(3) (mean 91.9 versus 65.2 months; P=0.001). Similarly multivariable analyses revealed that VS60 (P=0.001) and VS45 (P=0.003) were significant predictors of clinical hypothyroidism.

4467,"Induction of micronuclei in human sperm-hamster egg hybrids at the two-cell stage after in vitro gamma-irradiation of human spermatozoa The efficiency of the micronucleus test to assess radiation-induced chromosomal damage in human spermatozoa has been investigated. Micronuclei were scored in human sperm-hamster egg hybrids at the two-cell stage, after exposure of human spermatozoa to in vitro gamma-rays at doses of 0.00, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 1.00, 2.00, and 4.00 Gy. The relationship between the yield of micronuclei per two-cell stage as well as the percentage of two-cell stages with micronuclei and the different doses of irradiation were fitted to linear equations. To evaluate whether scoring micronuclei is useful for the quantification of chromosomal damage occurring in human spermatozoa, induced micronuclei at the different doses of sperm irradiation were compared to the induction of breaks and fragments in sperm-derived chromosomes. After interspecific fertilization of zona-free hamster oocytes by irradiated spermatozoa, a total of 699 fertilized eggs at the two-cell stage and a total of 387 sperm-derived complements were analyzed. The incidence of fertilized eggs with micronuclei at the two-cell stage coincided well with the incidence of sperm-derived chromosome breaks and fragments (e.g., 8.9% vs. 6.7% in the 0.25 Gy group and 52.8% vs. 58.6% in the 4.00 Gy group). A similar correlation was found between the number of micronuclei per two-cell stage and the number of breaks and fragments per sperm complement (0.09 vs. 0.07 in the 0.25 Gy group and 0.71 vs. 0.81 in the 4.00 Gy group).

The tumors involved the tarsal (n = 3), bulbar (n = 2), and forniceal (n = 2) surfaces. All patients were treated with topical and injection IFNa2b, with complete regression achieved in 2 cases (at 1 months and 20 months) and partial regression in one case (at 9 months). All patients continue on chronic maintenance IFNa2b topically. There were no recurrences, and IFNa2b injection side effects of nausea and chills were minor, lasting 1 day. No patient required surgical removal of tumors from the socket and no patient required exenteration. CONCLUSION(S):: Patients wearing ophthalmic prosthesis over a socket should be monitored for the development of OSSN. Combined topical and injection IFNa2b could represent a potentially effective therapy for this condition. © 2011 The American Society of Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Inc.",Excluded
4950,"Vitamin K status in spaceflight and ground-based models of spaceflight Bone loss is a well-documented change during and after long-duration spaceflight. Many types of countermeasures to bone loss have been proposed, including vitamin K supplementation. The objective of this series of studies was to measure change in vitamin K status in response to microgravity under a variety of spaceflight and spaceflight analog (model) conditions, including long-duration spaceflight studies (n = 15), three bed rest studies (n = 15, 49, and 24), and a 14-day saturation dive (n = 6). In crew members who flew 2-6 months on the International Space Station, in-flight and postflight plasma phylloquinone concentrations were unchanged from the preflight mean. Consistent with this finding, urinary I-carboxyglutamic acid (GLA), a measure of vitamin K-dependent protein turnover, did not change in response to flight. Serum undercarboxylated osteocalcin (%ucOC), a measure of vitamin K function, was generally unchanged in response to flight. Spaceflight findings were corroborated by findings of no changes in phylloquinone, urinary GLA, or %ucOC during or after bed rest in three separate bed rest studies (21-90 days in duration) or after a 14-day saturation dive. The data presented here do not support either a need for vitamin K supplementation during spaceflight or the suggestion of using vitamin K as a bone loss countermeasure in spaceflight. © 2011 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.",Excluded

This prospective, comparative, partially blinded, single-centre, clinical trial of GaAlAs Laser, with 815 nm wavelength, included 44 BMS patients divided randomly into three groups: Group I (n = 16): GaAlAs laser 815 nm wavelength, 1 W output power, continuous emissions, 4 s, 4 J and fluence rate 133.3 J cm-2 ; Group II (n = 16): GaAlAs infrared laser, 815 nm wavelength, 1 W output power, continuous emissions, 6 s, 6 J and fluence rate 200 J cm-2 ; Group III (n = 12) placebo group, sham laser. All groups received a weekly dose for 4 weeks. Pain intensity was recorded using a 10-cm visual analogue scale; patients responded to the oral health impact profile (OHIP-14), xerostomia severity test and the hospital anxiety-depression scale (HAD). These assessments were performed at baseline, 2 and 4 weeks. LLLT decreased pain intensity and improved OHIP-14 scores significantly from baseline to 2 weeks in groups I and II compared with the placebo group. No statistically significant differences were found from 2 to 4 weeks. Overall improvements in visual analogue scale (VAS) scores from baseline to the end of treatment were as follows: Group I 15.7%; Group II 15.6%; Group III placebo 7.3%. LLLT application reduces symptoms slightly in BMS patients. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Included

4360,"Comparing different analysis methods for quantifying the MRI amide proton transfer (APT) effect in hyperacute stroke patients Amide proton transfer (APT) imaging is a pH mapping method based on the chemical exchange saturation transfer phenomenon that has potential for penumbra identification following stroke. The majority of the literature thus far has focused on generating pH-weighted contrast using magnetization transfer ratio asymmetry analysis instead of quantitative pH mapping. In this study, the widely used asymmetry analysis and a model-based analysis were both assessed on APT data collected from healthy subjects (n = 2) and hyperacute stroke patients (n = 6, median imaging time after onset = 2 hours 59 minutes). It was found that the model-based approach was able to quantify the APT effect with the lowest variation in grey and white matter (<= 13.8 %) and the smallest average contrast between these two tissue types (3.48 %) in the healthy volunteers. The model-based approach also performed quantitatively better than the other measures in the hyperacute stroke patient APT data, where the quantified APT effect in the infarct core was consistently lower than in the contralateral normal appearing tissue for all the patients recruited, with the group average of the quantified APT effect being 1.5 +/- 0.3 % (infarct core) and 1.9 +/- 0.4 % (contralateral). Based on the fitted parameters from the model-based analysis and a previously published pH and amide proton exchange rate relationship, quantitative pH maps for hyperacute stroke patients were generated, for the first time, using APT imaging.

4172,"Radical radiation treatment of invasive and locally advanced bladder carcinoma in elderly patients A total of 146 patients with invasive or locally advanced carcinoma of the bladder (T2-T4) underwent radiation treatment. A significantly higher complete response rate was observed with doses equal to or above 55 Gy and with doses corresponding to cumulative radiation effect (CRE) values of 1700 radiation effect units (reu) or more. In multivariate analysis, decreasing time from the first diagnosis of bladder carcinoma to radiation treatment and 1 or more transurethral resections was associated with a significant increase in survival; increases in T category and sedimentation rate were negative prognostic factors. Although both radiation dose and CRE levels had a significant effect on survival in univariate analysis, an increase in CRE levels alone was associated with a significant increase in survival in multivariate analysis. However, the most important predictor of survival was whether the patient showed a complete local response or not. This study emphasises the importance of treating patients with an adequate radiation dose over a short period of time in order to achieve the maximum radiobiological effect and thereby increase the possibility of cure.",Excluded
4523,"Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) of lesions occupying renal space. Indications, limits, personal experience In focal kidney disease, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) using 2 nd generation contrast enhancement allows continuous dynamic assessment of the arterial, venous and late perfusion phases of the renal parenchyma, as well as of focal lesions. CEUS is particularly useful in cases of an uncertain diagnosis after the performance of unenhanced ultrasound (US) and echocolorDoppler (ECD) (e.g. dromedary humps, hypertrophic column of Bertin, outcomes of pyelonephritis), and for differential diagnosis of simple cysts with a suspicious appearance (e.g. cysts with a dense content, calcified cysts) and complex cysts of Bosniak types 2, 3 and 4. Instead, lesions shown to be solid at unenhanced US must be directly evaluated by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), both to gain a panoramic view and because CEUS is often unable to reveal the precise nature of such lesions. In agreement with the literature, this experience (18 cases) confirms the utility of CEUS in the diagnosis of renal pseudolesions and complex cystic formations, reducing both the risk of radiation exposure and the use of the more costly CT and MRI methodologies.",Excluded
4126,"A novel strategy of radiofrequency hyperthermia (neothermia) in combination with preoperative chemoradiotherapy for the treatment of advanced rectal cancer: A pilot study The safety of weekly regional hyperthermia performed with 8 MHz radiofrequency (RF) capacitive heating equipment has been established in rectal cancer. We aimed to standardize hyperthermia treatment for scientific evaluation and for assessing local tumor response to RF hyperthermia in rectal cancer. Forty-nine patients diagnosed with rectal adenocarcinoma were included in the study. All patients received chemoradiation with intensity-modulated radiation therapy 5 days/week (dose, 50 Gy/25 times) concomitant with 5 days/week for five times of capecitabine (1700 mg/m2 per day) and once a week for five times of 50 min irradiations by an 8 MHz RF capacitive heating device. Thirty-three patients underwent surgery 8 weeks after treatment. Three patients did not undergo surgery because of progressive disease (PD) and 13 refused. Eight (16.3%) patients had a pathological complete response (ypCR) after surgery. Among patients without surgery, 3 (6.1%) had clinical complete response (CR) and 3 (6.1%) had local CR but distant PD (CRPD). Ninety percent of ypCR + CR patients were shown in 6.21 W min-1 m-2/treatment or higher group of average total accumulated irradiation output with 429degreeC min-1 m-2 or higher group of total accumulated thermal output. However, a patient with CRPD was in the higher total accumulated thermal output group. We propose a new quantitative parameter for the hyperthermia and demonstrated that patients can benefit from mild irradiation with mild temperature. Using these parameters, the exact output, optimal thermal treatment, and contraindications or indications of this modality could be determined in a multi-institutional, future study.Copyright © 2015 The Authors.",Excluded

4931,"Analysis of acute radiation-induced esophagitis in non-small-cell lung cancer patients using the Lyman NTCP model PURPOSE: To analyze acute esophagitis (AE) in a Chinese population receiving 3D conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), combined or not with chemotherapy (CT), using the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman (LKB) normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model., MATERIALS AND METHODS: 157 Chinese patients (pts) presented with NSCLC received 3DCRT: alone (34 pts) or combined with sequential CT (59 pts) (group 1) or with concomitant CT (64 pts) (group 2). Parameters (TD(50), n, and m) of the LKB NTCP model predicting for>grade 2 AE (RTOG grading) were identified using maximum likelihood analysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses using a binary regression logistic model were performed to identify patient, tumor and dosimetric predictors of AE., RESULTS: Grade 2 or 3 AE occurred in 24% and 52% of pts in group 1 and 2, respectively (p<0.001). For the 93 group 1 pts, the fitted LKB model parameters were: m=0.15, n=0.29 and TD(50)=46 Gy. For the 64 group 2 pts, the parameters were: m=0.42, n=0.09 and TD(50)=36 Gy. In multivariate analysis, the only significant predictors of AE were: NTCP (p<0.001) and V(50), as continuous variable (RR=1.03, p=0.03) or being more than a threshold value of 11% (RR=3.6, p=0.009)., CONCLUSIONS: A LKB NTCP model has been established to predict AE in a Chinese population, receiving thoracic RT, alone or combined with CT. The parameters of the models appear slightly different than the previous one described in Western countries, with a lower volume effect for Chinese patients. Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

4308,"Regional correlation between estimated UVB levels and skin cancer mortality in Japan Most ecological studies investigating the relationship between incidence and/or mortality of skin cancer and surrogate measures of ultraviolet radiation B (UVB) have been conducted among the Caucasian population. The objective of the present study was therefore to assess the geographical correlation between ambient UVB estimates and regional mortality rates for skin cancer in Japan. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for malignant melanoma and other malignant neoplasms of the skin was calculated by sex, region and time-period for all deaths occurring in the period 1973-1994. The Spearman's correlation coefficient was calculated between estimated ambient UVB and regional SMRs for the two types of skin cancer. There was no geographical correlation between UVB and skin cancer mortality, except for a significantly negative correlation in malignant melanoma among males and a significantly negative correlation in other malignant neoplasms of the skin confined to unexposed anatomic sites of the body among females. The characteristic ecological relationship adds to the importance of conducting further epidemiological studies at the individual level in Japan.",Excluded
4183,"Comparative toxicity of synchrotron and conventional radiation therapy based on total and partial body irradiation in a murine model Synchrotron radiation can facilitate novel radiation therapy modalities such as microbeam radiation therapy (MRT) and high dose-rate synchrotron broad-beam radiation therapy (SBBR). Both of these modalities have unique physical properties that could be exploited for an improved therapeutic effect. While pre-clinical studies report promising normal tissue sparing phenomena, systematic toxicity data are still required. Our objective was to characterise the toxicity of SBBR and MRT and to calculate equivalent doses of conventional radiation therapy (CRT). A dose-escalation study was performed on C57BLJ/6 mice using total body and partial body irradiations. Dose-response curves and TD50 values were subsequently calculated using PROBIT analysis. For SBBR at dose-rates of 37 to 41 Gy/s, we found no evidence of a normal tissue sparing effect relative to CRT. Our findings also show that the MRT valley dose, rather than the peak dose, best correlates with CRT doses for acute toxicity. Importantly, longer-term weight tracking of irradiated animals revealed more pronounced growth impairment following MRT compared to both SBBR and CRT. Overall, this study provides the first in vivo dose-equivalence data between MRT, SBBR and CRT and presents systematic toxicity data for a range of organs that can be used as a reference point for future pre-clinical work.",Excluded
4435,"Electromagnetic guided confirmation of nasogastric tube insertion: Ehancing patient safety Introduction: Opinions differ regarding the optimal method of confirmation of nasogastric (NG) or orogastric (OG) tube insertion. Auscultation, pH analysis, character of the NG aspirate, or the radiograph has been suggested to confirm placement with the radiograph remaining as the gold standard. Hypothesis: The purpose of this study is to compare electromagnetic guidance/confirmation of NG or OG tube placement to that of radiographic confirmation. Method(s): Medical surgical intensive care unit patients requiring NG or OG tube insertions were eligible for the study. The NG or OG tubes were inserted in the standard fashion by the bedside nurse. Prior to the insertion, a guide wire with an electromagnetic tip was inserted through the tube and secured. Care was taken to assure the tip did not protrude from the NG tube. A receiver for the electromagnetic signal was placed on the patient in the subxiphoid region. The guide wire was attached to a bedside unit that energized the guide wire tip and tracked the placement on a display. Following the NG or OG insertion, an abdominal radiograph was obtained. Result(s): Twenty-seven patients, 16 male and 11 female, with an average age of 69 +/- 14 years were enrolled. Two patients were excluded due one guide wire not energizing and one patient intolerant to the NG placement. Of the 25 patients receiving an NG or OG tube, the electromagnetic guided placement correlated with the abdominal radiograph 100%. Real time tracking of one of the NG tubes avoided placement of an NG tube into the airway. Conclusion(s): Electromagnetic guided NG or OG tube insertion correctly tracked 100% of the tubes compared to the abdominal radiograph results. These preliminary data suggest that electromagnetic guided placement of NG or OG tubes have the potential to replace the abdominal radiograph for confirmation thus enhancing patient safety by avoiding radiation exposure and inadvertent airway placement.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): Between January 1, 2000 and February 17, 2013, 10 patients were confirmed to have HGNE carcinoma of the rectum or anal canal and treated with pelvic chemoradiation (radiation dose >=45 Gy). Overall survival (OS), locoregional control (LRC), progression-free survival (PFS), and patterns of failure were evaluated. Result(s): Eight had pure HGNE carcinoma and 2 had HGNE carcinoma with minor component of adenocarcinoma. Median age was 62 years. Median follow-up was 15 months (range, 3 to 128 mo). Tumor stages included TxN0M0 (1), II (1), III (4), and IV (4) including 2 with only inguinal involvement. Median tumor size was 5.5 cm (range, 3 to 7 cm). Patients received postoperative chemoradiation (1), preoperative chemoradiation (2), and chemoradiation without surgery (7). Median dose was 50.4 Gy (range, 45 to 60 Gy). All patients received chemotherapy before or after chemoradiation. Seven had pelvic LRC; 2 had possible and 1 had confirmed local progression. Both patients who had preoperative chemoradiation only had microscopic focus of residual carcinoma at surgery. Seven had disease progression; of which all developed distant progression, with distant progression occurring as the first event in 6 (liver, lung, bone, and abdominal nodes). Actuarial 2-year PFS and OS were 30% and 46%, respectively. One patient received prophylactic cranial irradiation; only one of the other 9 patient developed brain metastasis. Conclusion(s): Pelvic chemoradiation provided LRC for the majority of the patients' lifetime. Most patients had distant failure, but patterns of distant failure do not support routine prophylactic cranial irradiation.© Copyright 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

In the first experiment, spontaneous electroencephalography (sEEG) was analyzed (n = 17); in the second experiment, auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) and automatic deviance detection processes reflected by mismatch negativity (MMN) were investigated in a passive oddball paradigm (n = 26). Both sEEG and ERP experiments followed a double-blind protocol where subjects were exposed to either genuine or sham irradiation in two separate sessions. In both experiments, electroencephalograms (EEG) were recorded at midline electrode sites before and after exposure while subjects were watching a silent documentary. Spectral power of sEEG data was analyzed in the delta, theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands. In the ERP experiment, subjects were presented with a random series of standard (90%) and frequency-deviant (10%) tones in a passive binaural oddball paradigm. The amplitude and latency of the P50, N100, P200, MMN, and P3a components were analyzed. We found no measurable effects of a 30 min 3G mobile phone irradiation on the EEG spectral power in any frequency band studied. Also, we found no significant effects of EMF irradiation on the amplitude and latency of any of the ERP components. In summary, the present results do not support the notion that a 30 min unilateral 3G EMF exposure interferes with human sEEG activity, auditory evoked potentials or automatic deviance detection indexed by MMN.

Patients had histologic proof of local-regional carcinoma of the esophagus or gastroesophageal (GE) junction, a Karnofsky performance status of 70 or greater, and normal liver, renal, and bone marrow functions. Chemotherapy consisted of continuous infusion of 5-FU (300 mg/m2/d) for 5 days a week for 5 weeks, plus paclitaxel (45 mg/m2) given during 3 hours every week for 5 weeks.

4697,"Raw data-based iterative reconstruction in body CTA: evaluation of radiation dose saving potential OBJECTIVE: To evaluate prospectively, in patients undergoing body CTA, the radiation dose saving potential of raw data-based iterative reconstruction as compared to filtered back projection (FBP)., METHODS: Twenty-five patients underwent thoraco-abdominal CTA with 128-slice dual-source CT, operating both tubes at 120 kV. Full-dose (FD) images were reconstructed with FBP and were compared to half-dose (HD) images with FBP and HD-images with sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction (SAFIRE), both reconstructed using data from only one tube-detector-system. Image quality and sharpness of the aortic contour were assessed. Vessel attenuation and noise were measured, contrast-to-noise-ratio was calculated., RESULTS: Noise as image quality deteriorating artefact occurred in 24/25 (96%) HD-FBP but not in FD-FBP and HD-raw data-based iterative reconstruction datasets (p < 0.001). Other artefacts occurred with similar prevalence among the datasets. Sharpness of the aortic contour was higher for FD-FBP and HD-raw data-based iterative reconstruction as compared to HD-FBP (p < 0.001). Aortoiliac attenuation was similar among all datasets (p > 0.05). Lowest noise was found for HD-raw data-based iterative reconstruction (7.23HU), being 9.4% lower than that in FD-FBP (7.98HU, p < 0.05) and 30.8% lower than in HD-FBP images (10.44HU, p < 0.001). Contrast-to-noise-ratio was lower in HD-FBP (p < 0.001) and higher in HD-raw data-based iterative reconstruction (p < 0.001) as compared to FD-FBP., CONCLUSION: Intra-individual comparisons of image quality of body CTA suggest that raw data-based iterative reconstruction allows for dose reduction >50% while maintaining image quality. Key Points * Raw data-based iterative reconstruction reduces image noise and improves image quality as compared to filtered back projection * At a similar radiation dose, raw data-based iterative reconstruction improves the sharpness of vessel contours * In body CTA a dose reduction of >50% might be possible when using raw data-based iterative reconstructions, while image quality can be maintained.",Excluded
3974,"Long-term results of radiation therapy for pituitary adenoma Purpose. Local control for pituitary adenomas treated with external beam radiation therapy was retrospectively analyzed to evaluate the efficacy of radiation. Materials and methods. Thirty-eight patients treated with radiation therapy between 1979 and 1994 were analyzed. The median age was 46. Nineteen newly diagnosed tumors were treated with surgery and radiation therapy, while the others were recurrent cases. Twenty-two tumors were non-functioning, while 10 produced growth hormone (GH) and three each were prolactin-, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-producing tumors. The median radiation dose was 50 Gy in 25 fractions. Results. Non-functioning adenomas and prolactin-producing adenomas were completely controlled, judging from the absence of tumor progression on neuroimaging studies and clinical symptoms, and normalization of the serum prolactin level (< 25 ng/ml). On the other hand, local control was obtained in only one of the 3 patients with ACTH-producing adenomas, and the control rate at 10 years was only 46% for GH-producing adenomas. Panhypopituitarism developed in 35% of the patients after radiation therapy. No other serious complications were noted. Conclusion. Non-functioning pituitary adenomas and prolactin-producing adenomas were well controlled with external radiation therapy combined with surgery. However, dose escalation might be necessary to control GH- or ACTH-producing tumors. It is important to replace corticosteroid hormone and thyroid hormone in many patients.",Excluded

4945,"[The aqueous humour antioxidative capacity in different types and color of the age-related cataract] BACKGROUND/AIM: Oxidative stress results from increased oxidative processes, decreased antioxidative protection, or both processes simultaneously. Photooxidative stress, as a form of oxidative stress, induced by the energy of solar radiation, today is considered as crucial in the age-related cataractogenesis. Other known and unknown, endogenous and egsogenous factors that contribute to the oxidative stress intensity, can influnce the cataract type and brunescence. Thus the oxidative stress intensity and its form might determine the cataract type and brunescence, and also make the efforts in cataract prevention more complex. Hence, the objective of the present paper was to investigate the current amount of antioxidative capacity in aqueous humour during the cataract genesis of different types and pigmentation of cataract., METHODS: Transversal review of 80 samples of humour aqueous obtained during extracapsular cataract extraction. Aqueouses were analyzed by tiobarbituric acid (TBA) method for the total antioxidant activity estimation, expressed as %iMDA, and by using 0.1 ml of aqueous., RESULTS: The mixed type of cataract showed the statistically significantly lower values of the intensities of antioxidative protection in aqueous humour compared to cortical and nuclear cataracts (p < 0.001, respectively). Between pure nuclear and cortical cataracts we found the small differences of the investigated parameter, but they pointed to the decreased level of antioxidative protection, i.e. the increased intensity of the aqueous humour oxidative stress in the cortical cataract type. A significant correlation betweer the cortical cataract maturation and the %iMDA (p < 0.05) was found., CONCLUSIONS: The role of the oxidative stress, here expressed as the antioxidative capacity of aqueous humour, could not be the same for all the cataract types. The lower level of antioxidative protection of aqueous in brunescent and mixed cataracts may point to the higher intensity of oxidative stress in those cataract types. The correlation betweer the cortical cataract maturity and %iMDA points to the significant decrease of the aqueous antioxidative protection in the cataract progression.",Excluded

It also reduces the number of radio-resistant CD133+ glioma stem cells. The antibody has been extensively evaluated in patients with advanced head and neck, glioma, lung, esophageal, pancreatic, and gastric cancer. In this single institution experience, 35 patients with anaplastic astrocytoma (AA ) or glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) were treated with irradiation and 200 mg doses of nimotuzumab. The first 6 doses were administered weekly, together with radiotherapy, and then treatment continued every 21 days until 1 year. The median number of doses was 12, and the median cumulative dose was thus 2400 mg of nimotuzumab. The most frequent treatment-related toxicities were increase in liver function tests, fever, nausea, anorexia, asthenia, dizziness, and tremors. These adverse reactions were classified as mild and moderate. The median survival time was 12.4 mo or 27.0 mo for patients with GBM or AA patients, respectively, who received curative-intent radiotherapy in combination with the antibody. The survival time of a matched population treated at the same hospital with irradiation alone was decreased (median 8.0 and 12.2 mo for GBM and AA patients, respectively) compared with that of the patients who received nimotuzumab and curative-intent radiotherapy. We have thus confirmed that nimotuzumab is a very well-tolerated drug, lacking cumulative toxicity after maintenance doses. This study, in a poor prognosis population, validates the previous data of survival gain after combining nimotuzumab and radiotherapy, in newly diagnosed high-grade glioma patients. © 2014 Landes Bioscience.",Excluded
4145,"Remotely Guided Breast Sonography for Long-Term Space Missions: A Case Report and Discussion Background: Space radiation can cause different types of cancers in crewmembers, especially during long-term space missions. Introduction: To date, a complete bilateral breast ultrasound has not been performed at the International Space Station (ISS). A breast screening imaging technique could be a useful tool for early identification of breast cancer in astronauts. We hypothesized that breast ultrasound performed by a crewmember while being remotely guided by a specialist from the ground could be an essential tool for medical diagnosis in space. This project aimed to test an ultrasound screening protocol for breast tissue using real-time remotely guided telemedicine techniques. Materials and Methods: One female volunteer, with no previous medical experience, performed a self-scanned bilateral breast ultrasound exam guided by a remote sonographer. Dynamic ultrasound images were collected using a 25 mm broadband linear array transducer. To simulate fluid shift on the volunteer during microgravity, the bed was tilted -6. Results: Recorded ultrasound images were analyzed by radiologists, comparing the findings with a gold standard. The experiment demonstrated that real-time remotely guided sonography exam is feasible and can yield meaningful clinical results. Discussion: This case study showed that remotely guided breast ultrasound can be performed and might become an important tool for diagnosis of breast cancer in space missions. Conclusion: The results cannot be generalized based on one subject, and additional research is warranted in this area in addition to its validation on the ISS. This technique, however, has potential for use as part of preventive medicine procedures for long-term space missions at the ISS, and eventually for human settlements on the Moon and Mars.

4198,"Evaluation of new bone formation in irradiated areas using association of mesenchymal stem cells and total fresh bone marrow mixed with calcium phosphate scaffold The consequences of the treatment of the squamous cell carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract (bone removal and external radiation therapy) are constant. Tissue engineering using biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) is considered as a promising alternative. We previously demonstrated the efficacy of BCP and total fresh bone marrow (TBM) in regenerating irradiated bone defect. The aim of this study was to know if adding MSC to BCP + TBM mixture could improve the bone formation in irradiated bone defects. Twenty-four Lewis 1A rats received a single dose of 20 Gy to the hind limbs. MSC were sampled from non-irradiated donors and amplified in proliferative, and a part in osteogenic, medium. 3 weeks after, defects were created on femurs and tibias, which were filled with BCP alone, BCP + TBM, BCP + TBM + uncommitted MSC, or BCP + TBM + committed MSC. 3 weeks after, samples were removed and prepared for qualitative and quantitative analysis. The rate of bone ingrowth was significantly higher after implantation of BCP + TBM mixture. The adding of a high concentration of MSC, committed or not, didn't improve the bone regeneration.

Osteoid osteoma (OO) of the cervical spine is frequently located close to the vertebral artery, spinal cord, or nerve roots and complete surgical excision is sometimes difficult by a limited approach and more extended surgery can require spinal fusion. Percutaneous radiofrequency coagulation (PRC) has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of OO of the pelvis and limbs however, its role in the cervical spine is still nuclear. The Authors present a series of nine cases of OO of the cervical spine, six treated with surgical excision and three with PRC. No neurological or vascular complications occurred in both series. One case of the surgical series had only partial relief of persistent pain for 1 year due to incomplete excision, but is doing well 4 years after surgery. All the other surgical cases had complete relief of symptoms immediately after surgery and are symptom-free 3-10 years later. Two cases of PRC had complete relief of symptoms 24-48 h after surgery and are symptom-free 2 and 3 years later. One case of recurrent OO after surgery and treated with PRC with a reduced dose improved only, and still requires anti-inflammatory drugs 2 years after the procedure. Our still limited experience suggests that PRC can be safely performed in local anaesthesia with the patient awake, enabling to check for signs and symptoms of possible neurological injury. PRC can substitute extensive posterior approaches and reconstructions for OO of the posterior arch and joint pillar. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.",Excluded

Patients and Methods: In 2005 and 2006, 55 patients (43 men, 12 women; median age 60 years) with locally advanced oesophageal cancer (cT3-4 Nx M0; 24 with squamous cell carcinoma, 31 with adenocarcinoma) underwent transthoracic en bloc oesophagectomy after completion of treatment with cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and radiotherapy ad 36 Gy in a prospective clinical trial. Of the 55 patients, 21 (38%) were classified as histopathological responders (<10% vital residual tumour cells) and 34 (62%) as nonresponders. FDG-PET was performed before (PET 1) and 3-4 weeks after the end (PET 2) of radiochemotherapy with assessment of maximum and average standardized uptake values (SUV) for correlation with histopathological response and survival. Result(s): Histopathological responders had a slightly higher baseline SUV than nonresponders (p<0.0001 between PET 1 and PET 2 for responders and nonresponders) and the decrease was more prominent in responders. Except for SUVmax in patients with squamous cell carcinoma neither baseline nor preoperative SUV nor percent SUV reduction correlated significantly with histopathological response. Histopathological responders had a 2-year overall survival of 91+/-9% and nonresponders a survival of 53+/-10% (p=0.007). Conclusion(s): Our study does not support recent reports that FDG-PET predicts histopathological response and survival in patients with locally advanced oesophageal cancer treated by neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Excluded
4706,"Intracoronary beta-brachytherapy using a rhenium-188 filled balloon catheter in restenotic lesions of native coronary arteries and venous bypass grafts Purpose: We have previously demonstrated the efficacy of intracoronary beta-brachytherapy using a liquid 188Re-filled balloon in a randomised trial including de novo lesions. Percutaneous coronary interventions in restenotic lesions and in stenoses of venous bypass grafts are characterised by a high recurrence rate for restenosis and re-interventions. Against this background, we wanted to assess the impact of intracoronary beta-brachytherapy using a liquid 188Re-filled balloon in restenotic lesions in native coronary arteries and venous bypass grafts. Method(s): In 243 patients, beta-brachytherapy with 22.5 Gy was applied at a tissue depth of 0.5 mm. Patients were followed up angiographically after 6 months and clinically for 12 months. The primary clinical endpoint was the incidence of MACE (death, myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularisation). Secondary angiographic endpoints were late loss and binary restenosis rate in the total segment. Result(s): All irradiation procedures were successfully performed. A total of 222 lesions were in native coronary arteries; 21 were bypass lesions. Mean irradiation length was 41.6+/-17.3 mm (range 20-150 mm) in native coronary arteries and 48.1+/-33.9 mm (range 30-180 mm) in bypass lesions; the reference diameter was 2.57+/-0.52 mm and 2.83+/-0.76 mm, respectively. There was no vessel thrombosis during antiplatelet therapy. Angiographic/clinical follow-up rate was 84%/100%. MACE rate was 17.6% in the native coronary artery group and 38.1% in the CABG group (p<0.03). Binary restenosis rate was 22.5% and 55.6% (p<0.01), and late loss was 0.38+/-0.72 mm and 1.33+/-1.11 mm (p<0.001), respectively. Conclusion(s): We conclude that intracoronary beta-brachytherapy with a liquid 188Re-filled balloon using 22.5 Gy at a tissue depth of 0.5 mm in restenotic lesions is safe. It is associated with a low binary restenosis rate, resulting in a low occurrence rate of MACE within 12 months in restenotic lesions in native coronary arteries but not in vein grafts. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.",Excluded
4502,"Image-guided stereotactic ablative radiotherapy for the liver: a safe and effective treatment AIMS: Stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) is a non-invasive treatment option for inoperable patients or patients with irresectable liver tumors. Outcome and toxicity were evaluated retrospectively in this single-institution patient cohort., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2010 and 2014, 39 lesions were irradiated in 33 consecutive patients (18 male, 15 female, median age of 68 years). All the lesions were liver metastases (n = 34) or primary hepatocellular carcinomas (n = 5). The patients had undergone four-dimensional respiration-correlated PET-CT for treatment simulation to capture tumor motion. We analyzed local control with a focus on CT-based response at three months, one year and two years after treatment, looking at overall survival and the progression pattern., RESULTS: All patients were treated with hypofractionated image-guided stereotactic radiotherapy. The equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions varied from 62.5 Gy to 150 Gy, delivered in 3-10 fractions (median dose 93.8 Gy, alpha/beta = 10). The CT-based regression pattern three months after radiotherapy revealed partial regression in 72.7% of patients with a complete remission in 27.3% of the cases. The site of first progression was predominantly distant. One- and two-year overall survival rates were 85.4% and 68.8%, respectively. No toxicity of grade 2 or higher according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 was observed., CONCLUSION: SABR is a safe and efficient treatment for selected inoperable patients or irresectable tumors of the liver. Future studies should combine SABR with systemic treatment acting in synergy with radiation, such as immunological interventions or hypoxic cell radiosensitizers to prevent distant relapse.

Tubal dysfunction prior to irradiation in these patients was due to functional impairment. However, tubal dysfunction after irradiation was due to both organic obstruction and functional impairment. Organic obstruction of the tube was found to be severe with higher dosages of irradiation (to 80 Gy) resulting in subsequent otitis media. In our experience, higher doses of irradiation should be avoided if possible, but insertion of a ventilation tube should be done if a high dose of irradiation is planned.",Excluded
4879,"Intraoperative radiotherapy for parotid cancer: A single-institution experience Purpose: Our practice policy has been to provide intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) at resection to patients with head-and-neck malignancies considered to be at high risk of recurrence. The purpose of the present study was to review our experience with the use of IORT for primary or recurrent cancer of the parotid gland. Methods and Materials: Between 1982 and 2007, 96 patients were treated with gross total resection and IORT for primary or recurrent cancer of the parotid gland. The median age was 62.9 years (range, 14.3-88.1). Of the 96 patients, 33 had previously undergone external beam radiotherapy as a component of definitive therapy. Also, 34 patients had positive margins after surgery, and 40 had perineural invasion. IORT was administered as a single fraction of 15 or 20 Gy with 4-6-MeV electrons. The median follow-up period was 5.6 years. Result(s): Only 1 patient experienced local recurrence, 19 developed regional recurrence, and 12 distant recurrence. The recurrence-free survival rate at 1, 3, and 5 years was 82.0%, 68.5%, and 65.2%, respectively. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rate after surgery and IORT was 88.4%, 66.1%, and 56.2%, respectively. No perioperative fatalities occurred. Complications developed in 26 patients and included vascular complications in 7, trismus in 6, fistulas in 4, radiation osteonecrosis in 4, flap necrosis in 2, wound dehiscence in 2, and neuropathy in 1. Of these 26 patients, 12 had recurrent disease, and 8 had undergone external beam radiotherapy before IORT. Conclusion(s): IORT results in effective local disease control at acceptable levels of toxicity and should be considered for patients with primary or recurrent cancer of the parotid gland. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
4651,"Radiation-induced sarcoma of head and neck: 50 years of experience at a single institution in an endemic area of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in China Radiation-induced sarcoma in the head and neck (RISHN) is a rare condition whose clinical presentation and management remain difficult because of its low incidence. In this retrospective study, we analyzed the symptoms, diagnosis, and the treatment of 16,634 patients with head and neck disease, who received radiotherapy between 1960 and 2010 at the Affiliated Tumor Hospital and its predecessor, Guangxi Medical University, China. Among these patients, 16 with a first tumor of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and 1 with squamous carcinoma of the tongue met the criteria of RISHN in the head and neck. Our epidemiological data showed that the incidence of RISHN rose from 0.06 to 0.17% from 1960 to 2010; the 3-year overall survival rate was 19.1%, and 3-year diseasefree survival rate was 11.1%. The mean latency (SD) period was 93.2 (33) months. Based on the experiences at our institution, we suggest that RISHN is a rare complication after radiotherapy for head and neck tumors, especially NPC. Owing to its low incidence, it should not be a major factor affecting decisions about radiotherapy. Nevertheless, there may be a possibility of increasing incidence of RISHN after radiotherapy of NPC, as shown in our epidemiological results. Given the poor prognosis of RISHN, this possibility should be taken into serious consideration before determination of high-dose radiotherapy for patients with NPC and other head and neck tumors. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.",Excluded

The course of symptoms was documented over 8 instillations at maximum, covering a period of approximately three months. All main symptoms of chronic cystitis declined consistently and statistically significantly (p < 0.0001). Both daytime and nighttime micturition frequencies as well as the score levels of urgency and pain declined significantly during the course of treatment. The functional bladder capacity as indicated by the volume of first morning voiding increased from 157.9 ml +/- 7.5 to 186.7 ml +/- 6.9 (mean +/- SE; p < 0.0001). The level of urgency decreased from 6.8 +/- 0.1 to 3.4 +/- 0.2 (mean +/- SE; numerical rating scale (11-point box scale); p < 0.0001) and nocturia decreased from 4.0 +/- 0.2 to 2.1 +/- 0.1 times (mean +/- SE; p < 0.0001). Chondroitin sulphate instillation was effective and well tolerated in the therapy of chronic forms of cystitis associated with a possible GAG layer deficit (GAG layer: mainly composed of the glycosaminoglycans chondroitin sulphate, dermatan sulphate and heparan sulphate), but the results need to be confirmed in a controlled study. © ECV .

3907,"Reduction of healthcare-associated infections in a long-term care brain injury ward by replacing regular linens with biocidal copper oxide impregnated linens Background: Contaminated textiles in hospitals contribute to endogenous, indirect-contact, and aerosol transmission of nosocomial related pathogens. Copper oxide impregnated linens have wide-spectrum antimicrobial, antifungal, and antiviral properties. Our aim was to determine if replacing non-biocidal linens with biocidal copper oxide impregnated linens would reduce the rates of healthcare-associated infections (HAI) in a long-term care ward. Method(s): We compared the rates of HAI in two analogous patient cohorts in a head injury care ward over two 6-month parallel periods before (period A) and after (period B) replacing all the regular non-biocidal linens and personnel uniforms with copper oxide impregnated biocidal products. Result(s): During period B, in comparison to period A, there was a 24% reduction in the HAI per 1000 hospitalization-days (p< 0.05), a 47% reduction in the number of fever days (>38.5. degreeC) per 1000 hospitalization-days (p< 0.01), and a 32.8% reduction in total number of days of antibiotic administration per 1000 hospitalization-days (p< 0.0001). Accordingly there was saving of approximately 27% in costs of antibiotics, HAI-related treatments, X-rays, disposables, labor, and laundry, expenses during period B.

3858,"Anatomic and procedural determinants of fluoroscopy time during elective endovascular aortic aneurysm repair Objective: To identify both the procedural and anatomic factors which determine duration of fluoroscopy during elective endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR). Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed our prospectively maintained EVAR database for the relationship between fluoroscopy time and both procedural (type of graft, configuration, number of components, surgeon) and anatomic factors reflective of aneurysm complexity (15 variables). Result(s): A total of 128 patients underwent elective EVAR with a mean fluoroscopy time of 5.7 +/- 3.4 min. The type of grafts used consisted of 41 (32%) Zenith, 85 (66.4%) Endurant and 2 (1.6%) Anaconda, with 105 (82%) being bifurcated and 23 (18%) being aorto-uni-iliac (AUI) in configuration. Both the surgeon performing the procedure (p = 0.001) and graft configuration (bifurcated vs. AUI, p = 0.03) were found to be predictive of fluoroscopy time; while procedural and anatomic variables were not. Conclusion(s): The surgeon's efficiency in the use of fluoroscopy during EVAR is the most important determinant of total fluoroscopy time. Anatomic complexity, make of device, and number of components inserted have minimal impact on duration of fluoroscopy. An endovascular surgeon's ability to curtail fluoroscopy duration is the key component in minimizing radiation exposure to both the surgical team and the patient.Copyright © 2015, The Author(s) 2015.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): Sixty consecutive patients were randomly assigned to two different retrospectively ECG-gated TRO-CTA protocols in this prospective trial: Thirty patients were examined with a 120-kV standard protocol (320 reference mAs with automatic tube current modulation, automatically adapted pitch and ECG-pulsing) and served as the control group (group 1), an otherwise identical 100 kV protocol was used in the other thirty patients (group 2) for a radiation dose reduction. Subjective image quality was assessed on a 5 point scale (1: excellent, 5: non-diagnostic) by two blinded observers. Quantitative image analysis assessed vascular attenuation, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in different vascular segments. The effective dose was calculated from the dose length product (DLP) using a conversion coefficient of 0.017 mSv mGy -1 cm-1. Result(s): There was no significant difference of age, BMI, heart rate, pitch or scan length between both patient groups. Subjective image quality was rated similar in both groups (group 1: 1.2 +/- 0.4, group 2: average score = 1.3 +/- 0.5). Vessel attenuation was significantly higher in group 2 than in group 1 (ascending aorta: 456 +/- 83 HU vs. 370 +/- 78 HU, p < 0.001; pulmonary artery: 468 +/- 118 HU vs. 411 +/- 91 HU, p = 0.03; left coronary artery: 437 +/- 110 HU vs. 348 +/- 89 HU, p < 0.001), however, there was no significant difference in SNR (13.2 +/- 7.6 vs. 14.5 +/- 7.5, p = 0.49) or CNR (13.8 +/- 6.6 vs. 15.9 +/- 7.7, p = 0.25).

4225,"A sentinel case series of cancer patients with occupational exposures to electromagnetic non-ionizing radiation and other agents Background. There are reports that intense prolonged occupational exposure to non-ionizing radiation may increase risks for cancer. We previously have reported a sentinel cluster, of 7 workers with high exposures and short latent periods, and individual patients with brain cancer high occupational exposures and short latent periods. We present a sentinel case series (n=47, 40M, 7F) of cancer patients, referred to our medical unit with occupational exposures to non-ionizing radiation of all types. Objectives. Our aims were to report the findings on tumour types, age of first diagnosis, and latency, to describe their exposures and to examine the hypothesis that latencies for all tumour types (solid tissue, hematolymphatic, testicular) were coherently related to high occupational exposures starting at young ages. Methods. We divided the patients into groups by latency. We categorized each patient's exposures in regard to types of radiation, far or near field exposure and direct body contact. For some we had data on frequencies, for others we provided assessments. We also present the patient data categorized by age of diagnosis.We used a case-case type comparison to examine latencies for tumour types [solid, hematolymphatic (HL), testicular]. Results. 15 patients developed cancer with latent periods of less than 5 years and 12 patients with latent periods between 5 and 10 years. The remaining 20 patients had longer latent periods between first occupational exposure to EMF and diagnosis of cancer. 6 patients (12.7%) had multiple tumours. 12 patients (25.5%) reported cancer cases in co-workers. In the <5 years latency group there were 8 hematolymphatic cancers, 3 testicular cancers and 6 solid tumours [head & neck (including brain) and GI tract]. In all latency groups there were patients who were exposed to intense levels of electromagnetic fields (EMF), to several types of EMF, or to EMF in combination with ionizing radiation (IR) or other exposures, and patients who had direct body contact with the equipment, were in direct focus of high radiation, or worked in small, electronically dense environments. Case classification by age showed shorter latencies with younger ages, but this association is complicated by the fact that shorter latencies co-vary with younger ages especially for testicular tumours. But patients with testicular and hematolymphatic tumours had shorter latencies than those with solid tumours. Conclusion. Many of the patients were young and had extremely short latent periods, especially for HL and testicular cancers. The fact that latent periods for testes were very short, HL longer and solid still longer suggests a coherent and biologically plausible pattern of latency in relation to the onset of exposure to EMF and other agents. The findings strengthen the hypothesis that these exposures may possibly be the major cause of many of these tumours. The findings state the case for (1) better modelling of exposure sources and penetration into the body and (2) preventive and protective measures based on control of exposure at source, barriers, and personal protection.",Excluded
4492,"Patient-reported voice and speech outcomes after whole-neck intensity modulated radiation therapy and chemotherapy for oropharyngeal cancer: Prospective longitudinal study Purpose To describe voice and speech quality changes and their predictors in patients with locally advanced oropharyngeal cancer treated on prospective clinical studies of organ-preserving chemotherapy-intensity modulated radiation therapy (chemo-IMRT). Methods and Materials Ninety-one patients with stage III/IV oropharyngeal cancer were treated on 2 consecutive prospective studies of definitive chemoradiation using whole-field IMRT from 2003 to 2011. Patient-reported voice and speech quality were longitudinally assessed from before treatment through 24 months using the Communication Domain of the Head and Neck Quality of Life (HNQOL-C) instrument and the Speech question of the University of Washington Quality of Life (UWQOL-S) instrument, respectively. Factors associated with patient-reported voice quality worsening from baseline and speech impairment were assessed. Results Voice quality decreased maximally at 1 month, with 68% and 41% of patients reporting worse HNQOL-C and UWQOL-S scores compared with before treatment, and improved thereafter, recovering to baseline by 12-18 months on average. In contrast, observer-rated larynx toxicity was rare (7% at 3 months; 5% at 6 months). Among patients with mean glottic larynx (GL) dose <=20 Gy, >20-30 Gy, >30-40 Gy, >40-50 Gy, and >50 Gy, 10%, 32%, 25%, 30%, and 63%, respectively, reported worse voice quality at 12 months compared with before treatment (P=.011). Results for speech impairment were similar. Glottic larynx dose, N stage, neck dissection, oral cavity dose, and time since chemo-IMRT were univariately associated with either voice worsening or speech impairment. On multivariate analysis, mean GL dose remained independently predictive for both voice quality worsening (8.1%/Gy) and speech impairment (4.3%/Gy). Conclusions Voice quality worsening and speech impairment after chemo-IMRT for locally advanced oropharyngeal cancer were frequently reported by patients, underrecognized by clinicians, and independently associated with GL dose. These findings support reducing mean GL dose to as low as reasonably achievable, aiming at <=20 Gy when the larynx is not a target. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Thus, we sought to compare the safety and clinical outcomes of the RRA and LRA during PCI in ""real-world"" patients with either stable angina or acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Method(s): To overcome the possible impact of the nonrandomized design, a propensity score was calculated to compare the 2 radial approaches. The study group comprised 18 716 matched pairs with stable angina and 46 241 with ACS treated with PCI and stent implantation between 2014 and 2017 in 151 tertiary invasive cardiology centers in Poland (the ORPKI Polish National Registry). Result(s): The rates of death and periprocedural complications were similar for the RRA and LRA in stable angina patients. A higher radiation dose was observed with PCI via the LRA in both clinical presentations (stable angina: 1067.0 +/- 947.1 mGy vs 1007.4 +/- 983.5 mGy, P = .001; ACS: 1212.7 +/- 1005.5 mGy vs 1053.5 +/- 1029.7 mGy, P = .001). More contrast was used in LRA procedures but only in ACS patients (174.2 +/- 75.4 mL vs 167.2 +/- 72.1 mL, P = .001). Furthermore, periprocedural complications such as coronary artery dissection (0.16% vs 0.09%, P = .008), no-reflow phenomenon (0.65% vs 0.49%, P = .005), and puncture site bleeding (0.09% vs 0.05%, P = .04) were more frequently observed with the LRA in ACS patients. There was no difference in mortality between the 2 groups (P = .90). Conclusion(s): Our finding of poorer outcomes with the LRA may be related to lower operator experience with this approach. While both the LRA and RRA are safe in the setting of stable angina, the LRA was associated with a higher rate of periprocedural complications during PCI in ACS patients.

3720,"Good genes and the maternal effects of polyandry on offspring reproductive success in the bulb mite Genetic benefits are potentially the most robust explanation of the controversial issue of evolutionary maintenance of polyandry, but the unambiguous demonstration of such benefits has been hindered by the possibility of their confusion with maternal effects. Previous research has shown that polyandrous bulb mite females produce daughters with higher fecundity than monandrous females. Here, we investigate whether this effect arises because polyandrous females invest more in their offspring, or because their offspring inherit 'good genes' from their fathers. Females were mated with either one or four (different) males. However, by sterilizing three of the four males with ionizing radiation, we eliminated any chance of sexual selection (in the polyandrous treatment) so that any differences in the female mating regimes must have been owing to maternal effects. Polyandry had no significant effect on daughter fecundity, thus indicating that any previously documented effects must have been genetic. This was further supported by a significant association between fathers' offensive sperm-competitive ability and the fecundity of their daughters. The association with fathers' sperm defensive ability was not significant, and neither was the association between fathers' sperm competitiveness and sons' reproductive success. However, sons of polyandrous females had lower reproductive success than sons of monandrous females. This shows that the maternal effects of polyandry should be taken into account whenever its costs and benefits are being considered.",Excluded

Severe toxicity events were defined using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03 and defined as grade >= 3. Univariate logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the effect of different factors on the incidence of severe toxicity events. Multicollinearity was assessed for all factors with P < 0.1 using Pearson correlation matrices. All factors not excluded due to multicollinearity were included in a multivariate logistic regression model for each measurement of severe toxicity., RESULTS: Severe (grade >= 3) toxicities occurred following 21.5% of the 79 treatments included in our analysis. The most common severe laboratory toxicities were severe alkaline phosphatase (17.7%), albumin (12.7%), and total bilirubin (10.1%) toxicities. Decreased pre-treatment albumin (OR = 26.2, P = 0.010) and increased pre-treatment international normalized ratio (INR) (OR = 17.7, P = 0.048) were associated with development of severe hepatic toxicity. Increased pre-treatment aspartate aminotransferase (AST; OR = 7.4, P = 0.025) and decreased pre-treatment hemoglobin (OR = 12.5, P = 0.025) were associated with severe albumin toxicity. Increasing pre-treatment model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score (OR = 1.8, P = 0.033) was associated with severe total bilirubin toxicity. Colorectal adenocarcinoma histology was associated with severe alkaline phosphatase toxicity (OR = 5.4, P = 0.043)., CONCLUSION: Clinicians should carefully consider pre-treatment albumin, INR, AST, hemoglobin, MELD, and colorectal histology when choosing appropriate candidates for (90)Y microsphere therapy.",Excluded

The union of diaphyseo epiphyseal of 1st metacarpal has been studied in 120 candidates (60 males and 60 females). The results were also compared with union of lower end of radius and ulna in these 120 candidates. The complete diaphyseo epiphyseal union at the base of Metacarpal was observed in the age group of 16-17 years in both the sexes. The complete diaphyseo epiphyseal union at the lower end of radius and Ulna was observed in the age group of 18-19 years in both the sexes.Copyright © 2015, Medicolegal Society.

4160,"Loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 5 in vicinity of the telomere in gamma-radiation-induced thymic lymphomas in mice Analysis of the loss of heterozygosity at the D5Mit143 locus was done for thymic lymphlomas induced by gamma-irradiation of mice from two reciprocal backcrosses (BALB/c x CcS-13)F1 x BALB/c and (BALB/c x CcS-13)F1 x CcS-13. BALB/c mice are susceptible to gamma-ray induction of lymphomas. The CcS-13 strain is one of 20 CcS/Dcm (CcS) series of recombinant congenic strains, and the CcS-13 mice are resistant to gamma-radiation-induced lymphomas [1, 8]. Our preliminary tests show 50% (6/12) frequency of allelic loss at the D5Mit143 locus in thymic lymphomas induced by gamma-irradiation of the mice from (BALB/c x CcS-13)F1 x BALB/c backcross. Yet, in gamma-radiation-induced lymphomas from the backcross made in opposite direction, namely, (BALB/c x CcS-13)F1 x CcS-13, the analysis with the DSMit143 marker revealed low incidence of the loss of heterozygosity, 6.7% (15). The D5Mit143 locus resides in the distal part of chromosome 5, close to the telomere. Allelic loss of heterozygosity at the D5Mit143 locus showed strain specificity.

4916,"Effectiveness of salvage radiation therapy following subtotal and gross total resection of atypical meningiomas Purpose/Objective(s): Postoperative management of WHO Grade II (atypical) meningioma remains controversial. Radiation therapy (RT) has been shown to improve local control in several retrospective studies, but outcomes of adjuvant versus salvage RT after a gross total resection (GTR) are not well understood.We reviewed the outcomes of patients treated with RT after GTR and subtotal resection (STR) at our institution, where radiation therapy (RT) has typically been reserved for salvage. Materials/Methods: Between 1997 and 2014, 76 patients with WHO Grade II meningiomas were treated at our institution. One patient with NF2 was excluded from this analysis. Of the 75 remaining patients, 62 underwent GTR (Simpson grade I e III) and 13 STR (Simpson IV-V). No patient with GTR received adjuvant RT. A total of 22 patients received RT: 10 as salvage of recurrence following GTR, 10 as salvage following STR, and 2 adjuvantly, each after biopsy only. Fractionated RT was employed in 18 patients, with doses ranging from 50.4-60 Gy (median 59.4 Gy) in 28-33 fractions, and stereotactic radiosurgery in 4 patients, with a single fraction of 15-18 Gy (median 17 Gy). Result(s): Extent of surgery was significantly predictive of progression-free survival (PFS). Following GTR and STR respectively, 2-year PFS was 75% versus 33%, and 4-year PFS 68% versus 17% (P = 0.0008). Despite a significant improvement in PFS after GTR, patients who recurred following GTR had a poor response to salvage RT, with 6 of the 10 patients continuing to progress despite RT. Conversely, none of the 12 patients who had undergone STR or biopsy experienced progression following RT. Respectively for GTR and STR, PFS following RT was 77% and 100% at 1 year, and 39% and 100% after 2 years (P = 0.04). Radiation dose was not significantly different between patients who progressed (median 56.7 Gy) and those who did not (median 60 Gy) following RT (P = 0.42). Likewise there was no difference in RT dose for those with GTR versus STR (median 60 Gy versus 59.4 Gy respectively, P = 0.94). Conclusion(s): In our patient cohort, salvage RT for recurrence following GTR was associated with a high rate of failure (61% at 2 years), whereas salvage or adjuvant RT following STR was effective, with no failures at 2 years. This data suggests that tumors recurring after GTR are biologically distinct from tumors that progress following STR. While extent of resection is predictive of PFS, the 4-year local failure following GTR alone was still 32%; therefore, adjuvant RT should be considered in this setting. Whether routine adjuvant RT following GTR of Grade II meningioma will significantly reduce subsequent failures remains to be determined. A randomized, prospective comparison of adjuvant RT after GTR is needed to resolve this question.",Excluded
3954,"Image quality and radiation exposure of coronary CT angiography in patients after coronary artery bypass graft surgery: Influence of imaging direction with 64-slice dual-source CT Background: The evaluation of native coronary arteries (NCAs) as well as coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) patency after surgery is essential. However, NCAs are often blurred in the craniocaudal scan direction because of long scan time with 64-slice CT. Objective(s): The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of scan direction on image quality and radiation exposure in assessment of NCAs and CABGs. Method(s): Retrospective analysis of 191 consecutive individuals undergoing coronary CT angiography to evaluate CABG patency using 64-slice dual source CT. A retrospectively ECG gated spiral acquisition protocol with ECG based tube current modulation and automatic adjustment of tube current to a reference of 320 mAs (""CareDose 4D"") was used. Tube current was 120 kVp. Scan direction was either cranio-caudal (CRC, n = 98) or caudo-cranial (CRC, n = 93) and the scan volume covered the entire course of all bypass grafts. Independent investigators determined quantitative image quality of the coronary arteries by evaluating contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), radiation exposure by comparing the effective dose, and qualitative image quality through a 5 point rating scale. Result(s): Quantitative image quality was not significantly different for the two groups except for the CNR of the right coronary artery which was significantly higher in patients with caudio-cranial scan direction (P= .0007). The qualitative image quality of the CaC group also was better for both NCAs and CABGs (P= .002 for NCAs and <.001 for CABGs), mostly because of the lower frequency of respiration artifacts on coronary arteries of the CaC group (P= .005). As an effect of automatic tube current adjustment, radiation dose was lower in patients with caudo-cranial scan direction (6.8 mSv vs. 9.6 mSv, p < 0.0001). Conclusion(s): In patients with coronary bypass grafts imaged by 64-slice dual source CT with spiral acquisition and automated tube current adjustment, a caudo-cranial scan direction results in improved image quality and reduced radiation exposure. © 2014 Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography.",Excluded
4715,"Survival Impact of Cardiac Dose Following Lung Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy Heart dose has been emerging as a strong predictor of outcomes in radiation therapy treatment for lung cancer. It is necessary to determine the impact of dose to substructures of the heart on overall survival. Heart substructures were contoured retrospectively on 189 patients treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy. Clinical variables and the dose to these structures were correlated with non-cancer-related deaths. Higher bilateral ventricles max dose is associated with poorer survival. Heart dose parameters should be considered when planning patients for stereotactic body radiotherapy. Introduction: The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of radiation dose to substructures of the heart in lung stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) patients on non-cancer-related deaths. Method(s): Patients treated with lung SBRT at a single institution from 2005 to 2013 were included. The heart and its substructures were contoured, and dose was calculated including mean, max, and max 10 cc dose. Clinical variables including stage, histology, age, gender, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), preexisting cardiac disease, pulmonary function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second, diffusion capacity), and smoking status were explored for association with non-cancer-related deaths in univariable (UVA) and multivariable (MVA) analyses. Heart dosimetric parameters were correlated with the risk of radiation pneumonitis (RP) using UVA and MVA. Result(s): A total of 189 patients were included with median age of 76 years (range, 48-93 years). Of these patients, 45.5% were female, 27.5% were T2, 16.9% were current smokers, 64% had preexisting cardiac risk factors, and 34.5% had CCI score of >= 3. Mean lung dose +/- SD was 456 +/- 231 cGy. Heart max, mean, and 10 cc doses were 1867 +/- 1712 cGy, 265 +/- 269 cGy, and 1150 +/- 1075 cGy, respectively. There were 14 (7.4%) >= Grade 2 RP and 3 (1.6%) were >= Grade 3. The median overall survival was 37.3 months (95% confidence interval, 29.8-45.3 months). On UVA, female gender (P <.01), higher Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (P =.01), cardiac risk (P <.01), CCI (P <.01), and bilateral ventricles max dose (P =.02) were associated with non-cancer-related deaths; on MVA, bilateral ventricles max dose was significant (P =.05). No heart parameters were associated with RP. Conclusion(s): Higher bilateral ventricles max dose is associated with poorer survival. Heart dose parameters should be considered when planning patients for SBRT.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
4568,"Neoadjuvant radiotherapy combined with capecitabine and sorafenib in patients with advanced KRAS-mutated rectal cancer: A phase I/II trial (SAKK 41/08) Background KRAS mutation occurs in ~40% of locally advanced rectal cancers (LARCs). The multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib has radiosensitising effects and might improve outcomes for standard preoperative chemoradiotherapy in patients with KRAS-mutated LARC. Methods Adult patients with KRAS-mutated T3/4 and/or N1/2M0 LARC were included in this phase I/II study. The phase I dose-escalation study of capecitabine plus sorafenib and radiotherapy was followed by a phase II study assessing efficacy and safety. Primary end-points were to: establish the maximum tolerated dose of the regimen in phase I; determine the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate in phase II defined as Dworak regression grade 3 and 4. Results Fifty-four patients were treated at 18 centres in Switzerland and Hungary; 40 patients were included in the single-arm phase II study. Recommended doses from phase I comprised radiotherapy (45 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks) with capecitabine 825 mg/m2 twice daily x 33 plus sorafenib 400 mg/d. Median daily dose intensity in phase II was radiotherapy 100%, capecitabine 98.6%, and sorafenib 100%. The pCR rate (Dworak 3/4) was 60% (95% CI, 43.3-75.1%) by central independent pathologic review. Sphincter preservation was achieved in 89.5%, R0 resection in 94.7%, and downstaging in 81.6%. The most common grade 3 toxicities during phase II included diarrhoea (15.0%), skin toxicity outside radiotherapy field (12.5%), pain (7.5%), skin toxicity in radiotherapy field, proctitis, fatigue and cardiac ischaemia (each 5%). Conclusions Combining sorafenib and standard chemoradiotherapy with capecitabine is highly active in patients with KRAS-mutated LARC with acceptable toxicity and deserves further investigation. www.clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00869570.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
3767,"Optimization of 131I ablation in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma: comparison of early outcomes of treatment with 100 mCi versus 60 mCi INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to compare the early outcomes between two groups of patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) who received 60 or 100 mCi of (131)I for remnant ablation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 224 DTC patients with primary tumor > 1 cm of diameter or multifocal were randomised into prospective clinical trial. Patients with extrathyroideal extension of primary tumor and nodal metastases or M1 were not enrolled. 99 patients received 60 mCi, and 125--100 mCi of radioiodine as the first ablative dose. RESULT(S): The effectiveness of thyroid ablation was evaluated after one year, during endogenous TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) stimulation, and after two years during Lthyroxine therapy. Whole body scintigraphy (WBS) was performed under thyroxine withdrawal and thyroglobulin serum level was assessed. Distant micrometastases were detected in 9.8% of patients by post-therapy WBS, 11 patients in group A treated with 60 mCi and 11 in group B treated with 100 mCi. In other patients no symptoms of persistent disease were detected. At one year follow up full remission was diagnosed in 176 patients: 76 in group A and 100 in group B. The remaining ones, 13.3% and 11.2% respectively, received the second course of (131)I for remnant ablation. There were no statistically significant differences in Tg (thyroglobulin) serum level either 12 or 24 months after 131I treatment. CONCLUSION(S): Our evaluation of early efficacy of adjuvant radioiodine treatment in low risk DTC patients shows no differences between two radioiodine activities - 60 and 100 mCi in relation to thyroid ablation. Thus, the activity of 60 mCi is recommended.",Excluded
4720,"The effectiveness of radiotherapy for painful humeroscapular periarthritis (PHS) Study aim. The analysis of radiotherapy effectiveness as a treatment modality for periarthritis humeroscapularis (PHS) Material and method. 30 patients irradiated because of PHS (1 Gy per fraction up to 6 Gy). Follow-up ranged from 1 to 216 months. The arm mobility and pain relief were assessed at the completion of radiotherapy and during follow-up examinations. Correlation between some biological factors evaluated before radiotherapy and the aforementioned endpoints was assessed using Spearman's test. Results. The mean degree of pain relief ranged from 42% to 93%. Mean improvement of arm abduction, flexion and reflexion angles ranged from 24degree to 83degree, from 47degree to 91degree and from 4degree to 13degree, respectively. The sole prognostic factor found in this study was the degree of orthopedic disability before the treatment. Small impairment at the onset correlated with significant improvement after radiotherapy. No radiation toxicity or secondary malignancies were observed. Conclusion. Radiotherapy of PHS is an effective, safe and economical treatment modality, which could form an alternative for standard orthopedic and pharmacological treatment in recurrent or persistent disease.",Excluded
4795,"Radionuclide therapy in cancer patients with bone metastases Aim: We submit our experience in the application of radionuclides for therapy of bone metastases of cancer patients with different foci of appearance of the cancer process: breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer and others. Material(s) and Method(s): In 167 patients with bone metastases we used 32-P in 71 patients and 89-Sr in 96 patients. 93 are women and 74 are men; 90 women are with cancer of the breast, 52- with prostate cancer, 24 are with lung cancer and 1 with renal cell carcinoma. All patients are observed for side effects when an application of a radiopharmaceutical is done-32-P per os and 89-Sr intravenous, as well as for the changes of haemoglobin, leucocyte and thrombocyte count. Result(s): One months after the radionuclide therapy we observed a significant reduction of the leucocyte and thrombocyte count in the group accepted 32-P (t = 3.83, p < 0.05; t = 5.29, p < 0.001). For the group, where 89-Sr is applied we did not calculate statistically significant decrease of the tested indicators mentioned above. At the same time the basic reason for which the radionuclides are applied- pain, decreases in intensity and patients return to their normal activity.This is more typical for patients with cancer of the breast and prostate cancer. Discussion(s): The serious symptom 'pain' is influenced by the not so high applied activity of 2 mCi of 32-P speaks in favour of the use of this radiophar-maceutic, although there is a resistance among authors of its application with regard to myelosuppression. According to our observations it is light, the blood indicators restore quickly even without special therapy and patients can take the advantage of this additional method to overcome pain syndrome. The intravenous applicaton of 89-Sr in activity of 4 mCi also influences pain in a very good way, but the price per patient is high and all patients wait for an reimbursement from the health insurance. This is a significant factor for wider use. The use of 32-P is cheaper but the delivery stopped and for the moment we can use only 89-Sr. Conclusion(s): The application of 32-P and 89-Sr is additional possibility for the treatment of pain due to bone metastases of cancer patients- easy and effective especially for those that are not treated effectively after local irradiation. The myelosuppressive effect is not statistically significant and both isotopes can be used successfully in the treatment of pain in cancer patients.",Excluded
3959,"Comparative analysis of SmartArc-based dual arc volumetric-modulated arc radiotherapy (VMAT) versus intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for nasopharyngeal carcinoma The purpose of this study was to evaluate and quantify the planning performance of SmartArc-based volumetric-modulated arc radiotherapy (VMAT) versus fixed-beam intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) using a sequential mode treatment plan. The plan quality and performance of dual arc-VMAT (DA-VMAT) using the Pinnacle3 Smart-Arc system (clinical version 9.0; Philips, Fitchburg, WI, USA) were evaluated and compared with those of seven-field (7F)-IMRT in 18 consecutive NPC patients. Analysis parameters included the conformity index (CI) and homogeneity index (HI) for the planning target volume (PTV), maximum and mean dose, normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) for the specified organs at risk (OARs), and comprehensive quality index (CQI) for an overall evaluation in the 11 OARs. Treatment delivery time, monitor units per fraction (MU/fr), and Gamma(3 mm, 3%) evaluations were also analyzed. DA-VMAT achieved similar target coverage and slightly better homogeneity than conventional 7F-IMRT with a similar CI and HI. NTCP values were only significantly lower in the left parotid gland (for xerostomia) for DA-VMAT plans. The mean value of CQI at 0.98 +/- 0.02 indicated a 2% benefit in sparing OARs by DA-VMAT. The MU/fr used and average delivery times appeared to show improved efficiencies in DA-VMAT. Each technique demonstrated high accuracy in dose delivery in terms of a high-quality assurance (QA) passing rate (> 98%) of the Gamma(3 mm, 3%) criterion. The major difference between DA-VMAT and 7F-IMRT using a sequential mode for treating NPC cases appears to be improved efficiency, resulting in a faster delivery time and the use of fewer MU/fr.",Excluded
4436,"Early and late lung radiographic injury following stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) OBJECTIVE: To describe early and late CT patterns of radiographic lung injury after SBRT for lung cancer, and to correlate radiological findings with patient and treatment characteristics., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Follow-up CT scans of 68 patients with 70 tumors were divided into 4 periods: (1) 6 weeks; (2) 2-6 months; (3) 7-12 months and (4) 13-18 months after SBRT. Early (within 6 months) and late radiological injuries were evaluated according to Ikezoe and Koening, respectively. The correlation between CT findings and patient characteristics was evaluated., RESULTS: Radiographic injury in periods 1 and 2 was: (1) diffuse consolidation 3 and 27%, (2) patchy consolidation and ground-glass opacity (GGO) 13.2 and 33%, (3) diffuse GGO 13.2 and 21%, (4) patchy GGO 16.2 and 6%, and (5) no findings 54.4 and 21%, respectively. Late injury in periods 3 and 4 were: (1) modified conventional pattern (consolidation, volume loss, bronchiectasis) 54 and 44%, (2) mass-like 20 and 28%, (3) scar-like 14 and 16% and (4) no findings 20 and 12%, respectively. The proportion of emphysema grades 2-4 was significantly higher in patients who had no radiological findings 6 weeks after treatment (p=0.021). Both patchy consolidation and GGO patterns resulted more frequently in patients who were not administered steroids (p=0.035). No relationship was found with smoking, tumor dimension and radiation dose., CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients had no evidence of radiographic lung injury 6 weeks after SBRT; the most prevalent findings were diffuse or patchy GGO. Patchy and diffuse consolidation develops 2-6 months after SBRT. Modified conventional pattern was the most prevalent in the late periods. Copyright 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In this study, 20 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were enrolled. Functional liver tissues were defined according to quantitative liver-spleen contrast ratios >=1.5 on a hepatobiliary phase scan. Functional images were fused with the planning computed tomography (CT) images; the following 2 SBRT plans were designed using a ""step-and-shoot"" static IMRT technique for each patient: (1) an anatomical SBRT plan optimization based on the total liver; and (2) a functional SBRT plan based on the functional liver. The total prescribed dose was 48 gray (Gy) in 4 fractions. Dosimetric parameters, including dose to 95% of the planning target volume (PTV D95%), percentages of total and functional liver volumes, which received doses from 5 to 30Gy (V5 to V30 and fV5 to fV30), and mean doses to total and functional liver (MLD and fMLD, respectively) of the 2 plans were compared. Compared with anatomical plans, functional image-guided SBRT plans reduced MLD (mean: plan A, 5.5Gy; and plan F, 5.1Gy; p<0.0001) and fMLD (mean: plan A, 5.4Gy; and plan F, 4.9Gy; p<0.0001), as well as V5 to V30 and fV5 to fV30. No differences were noted in PTV coverage and nonhepatic organs at risk (OARs) doses.

3904,"Lack of high-dose radiation mediated prostate cancer promotion and low-dose radiation adaptive response in the TRAMP mouse model Cancer of the prostate is a highly prevalent disease with a heterogeneous aetiology and prognosis. Current understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying the responses of prostate tissue to ionizing radiation exposure, including cancer induction, is surprisingly limited for both high- and low-dose exposures. As population exposure to radiation increases, largely through medical imaging, a better understanding of the response of the prostate to radiation exposure is required. Low-dose radiation-induced adaptive responses for increased cancer latency and decreased cancer frequency have been demonstrated in mouse models, largely for hematological cancers. This study examines the effects of high- and low-dose whole-body radiation exposure on prostate cancer development using an autochthonous mouse model of prostate cancer: TRansgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate (TRAMP). TRAMP mice were exposed to single acute high (2 Gy), low (50 mGy) and repeated low (5 x 50 mGy) doses of X rays to evaluate both the potential prostate cancer promoting effects of high-dose radiation and low-dose adaptive response phenomena in this prostate cancer model. Prostate weights and histopathology were examined to evaluate gross changes in cancer development and, in mice exposed to a single 2 Gy dose, time to palpable tumor was examined. Proliferation (Ki-67), apoptosis, DNA damage (gamma-H2AX) and transgene expression (large T-antigen) were examined within TRAMP prostate sections. Neither high- nor low-dose radiation-induced effects on prostate cancer progression were observed for any of the endpoints studied. Lack of observable effects of high- or low-dose radiation exposure suggests that modulation of tumorigenesis in the TRAMP model is largely resistant to such exposures. However, further study is required to better assess the effects of radiation exposure using alternative prostate cancer models that incorporate normal prostate and in those that are not driven by SV40 large T antigen. © 2013 by Radiation Research Society.",Excluded
3888,"Identifying predictors of early growth response and adverse radiation effects of vestibular schwannomas to radiosurgery Purpose: To determine whether pre-treatment growth rate of vestibular schwannomas (VS) predict response to radiosurgery., Methods: A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of all VS patients treated with 12Gy prescription dose between September 2005 and June 2011 at our institution using the Leksell Model 4C Gamma Knife Unit was conducted. Patients who had a minimum of 12-months clinical and radiological assessment before and after radiosurgery were included in this study. Tumor growth rates were calculated using specific growth rate (SGR). Tumor volumes were measured on FIESTA-MRI scans using ITK-SNAP v2.2., Results: Following radiosurgery, twenty-seven (42.9%) patients showed a significant decrease in volume after one year, twenty-nine (46.0%) stabilized, and seven (11.1%) continued to grow. There was no correlation between VS pre-treatment SGRs with post-treatment SGRs (p= 0.34), and incidence of adverse radiation effects (ARE). The reduction in tumors' SGRs after radiosurgery was proportional to pre-treatment SGRs, although this correlation was not statistically significant (p = 0.19). Analysis of risk factors revealed a positive correlation between post-treatment SGRs and incidence of non-auditory complications, most of which were attributed to ARE (p=0.047)., Conclusion: Pre-treatment growth rate of VS does not predict tumor response to radiosurgery or incidence of ARE.

Patients with resectable rectal cancer were randomised to total mesorectal excision with or without preoperative radiotherapy (PRT). Preoperatively and at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months postoperatively, SD scores were filled out in questionnaires. Possible risk factors for postoperative deterioration of sexual functioning, including patients' demographics, tumour-specific factors and treatment-related variables, were investigated with univariate and multivariable regression analyses. Increase in general SD, erectile dysfunction and ejaculatory problems were reported by 76.4, 79.8 and 72.2 percent of the male patients, respectively. Risk factors were nerve damage, blood loss, anastomotic leakage, PRT and the presence of a stoma. In female patients, increase in general SD, dyspareunia and vaginal dryness were reported by 61.5, 59.1 and 56.6 percent, respectively. This was associated with PRT and the presence of a stoma. SD occurs frequently after rectal cancer treatment and is caused by surgical (nerve) damage with an additional effect of PRT. Patients should be informed preoperatively, and education of surgeons in neuroanatomy may provide the key to the improvement of functional outcome.",Excluded
4082,"Can Radiation Dose Burden of CT Angiography be Reduced While Still Accurately Diagnosing Etiology of Acute Chest Pain? Background: Multidetector-row computed tomography is often used as a first-line test in the diagnostic evaluation of cardiovascular diseases including aortic dissection, coronary artery disease and pulmonary embolism. This study evaluated the impact of reducing the tube potential from 120 kVp to 100 kVp in a selected group of patients presenting to the Emergency Room with acute chest pain. The primary end point was how the reduction of radiation dose affected image quality. Method(s): The current study was performed over a period of 2 years between July, 2016 and July, 2018. This study included patients who presented to the Emergency Room or to an outpatient clinic and were suspected to have a coronary, a pulmonary (pulmonary embolism), or an aortic (aortic dissection) etiology. Suspicion was determined by the medical provider based on clinical picture, EKG, and lab results when available. All patients were referred for computed tomography angiography (CTA) testing as part of their diagnostic evaluation. A total of 84 patients were involved in the study. Seventy of the patients underwent the low acquisition Kvp technique (100 Kvp - Group I). In the remaining 14 patients, the standard acquisition technique (120-140 Kvp - Group II) was utilized. Result(s): This study showed the feasibility of using low energy CTA to significantly reduce the patient's radiation exposure without markedly affecting the image quality and diagnostic accuracy. Conclusion(s): The use of low energy CTA protocols in cases of acute chest pain revealed no major difference regarding the image quality with marked reduction of the radiation dose received by the patient.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
3782,"Dynamic magnetic resonance of pelvic floor in the diagnosis of pelvic floor dysfunctions Aim: Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvic floor (DMRPF) is a complementary diagnostic tool allowing dynamic and/or static assessment of all compartments of the pelvis (anterior, middle and posterior) in a single study. Method(s): We present a prospective and consecutive series of 288 patients evaluated between April 2005 and November 2013 undergoing DMRPF. Of the total patient number, 10 (3.47%) were male. Result(s): Due to the coexistence of pathology in different parts of the pelvic floor - more often in women - diagnostic confirmation is necessary so that the appropriate treatments can be accomplished in one single surgical approach. Outlet obstruction syndrome (OOS) was present in 262 patients. In 239 (82.4%) patients, an anterior rectocele was confirmed. In 55 (23%) of these cases, an anterior retrocele was the only finding. In 207 patients, other abdomino-pelvic anatomical dislocations were found that had not been clinically suspected or detected during physical examination. Conclusion(s): DMRPF is a study that does not expose patients to ionizing radiation providing dynamic interactive anatomical and functional data at rest and during provocative manoeuvers. Multi-plane imaging provides a clear view of the organs in the pelvis and the pelvic floor muscles which is not always accurately detected on physical examination. Currently, DMRPF is the recommended study designed to evaluate pelvic floor dysfunction as it can be used to confirm presumptive diagnoses and to quantify the impact of the dislocation of pelvic floor viscera, to define intestinal emptying dynamics, and to outline inadequate relaxation of the puborectalis during straining and simulated evacuation.",Excluded
4243,"Cosmic rays activity and monthly number of deaths: a correlative study We studied the relation between the intensity of cosmic rays, the level of solar/geomagnetic activity, and the monthly numbers of deaths in a large hospital in Israel and in all Lithuania. The Israeli data include 30526 hospital deaths, two groups of fatal suicides (2359, 2763), and 15435 suicidal attempts for two periods of 108 and 236 consecutive months. The national data for the entire Republic of Lithuania include 424925 deaths for the period of 120 consecutive months. Cosmic rays intensity was measured by an Apatity neutron monitor. We obtained the data on solar, geomagnetic radiovawe propagation, ionosphere ionization hours, proton flux of two energy levels (>90 and 60 MeV) from the National Geophysical Data Center at Goddard Space Flight Center, National Space Environment Center at Boulder, Colorado, USA, and from the Institute of Terrestrial Magnetism, Ionosphere and Radio Wave Propagation (IZMIRAN), Russia. We calculated Pearson coefficients and their probabilities for correlation between monthly space activity level and monthly number of male and female deaths from different causes. Cosmic rays activity revealed significant negative correlation with solar/geomagnetic activity indices and related physical phenomena levels. This activity strongly correlated with flux of protons with the energies >90 MeV proton flux and did not exhibit significant correlation with 60 MeV proton fluxes. Cosmic rays intensity correlation with monthly numbers of deaths was strong for noncardiovascular deaths, suicides, and traffic accidents. The correlation was much weaker for deaths caused by ishemic heart disease and strokes.",Excluded
4545,"When cervical pain is actually migraine: An observational study in 207 patients Introduction: A large proportion of migraine patients remain undiagnosed or misdiagnosed in Italy. In our experience, many migraineurs self-diagnose their condition as ""cervical pain attack"" or ""cervical pain syndrome"" (CP), assuming cervical spine pathology as the cause. We aimed to phenotype and classify the headache of patients with self-diagnosed CP, and to describe this sample of patients. Method(s): Consecutive patients aged 18 to 75 years, referred to the Headache Center of the Mondino Institute (Pavia, Italy) for a first visit for headache, completed a questionnaire about CP and were subsequently examined by an experienced clinician. Result(s): Out of 207 patients, 132 (64%) believed they suffered from CP. According to ICHD-IIIbeta criteria, these patients suffered from migraine or probable migraine in 91% of cases. The great majority of patients who believed that they suffered from CP underwent unnecessary medical exams (including radiation exposure in 40% of cases) and used treatments that were inadequate for their real diagnosis. Conclusion(s): The majority of patients with CP suffer from typical migraine. The misdiagnosis produces an economic burden (for patients and the health care system) and leads to impaired quality of life of patients.Copyright © 2016, © International Headache Society 2016.",Excluded

4257,"Importance of surveillance and success of salvage strategies after definitive chemoradiation in patients with esophageal cancer Purpose: Patients with esophageal carcinoma (EC) who are treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy (bimodality therapy [BMT]) experience frequent relapses. In a large cohort, we assessed the timing, frequency, and types of relapses during an aggressive surveillance program and the value of the salvage strategies. Patients and Methods: Patients with EC (N = 276) who received BMT were analyzed. Patients who had surgery within 6 months of chemoradiotherapy were excluded to reduce bias. We focused on local relapse (LR) and distant metastases (DM) and the salvage treatment of patients with LR only. Standard statistical methods were applied. Result(s): The median follow-up time was 54.3 months (95% CI, 48.4 to 62.4). First relapses included LR only in 23.2% (n = 64), DM with or without LR in 43.5% (n = 120), and no relapses in 33.3% (n = 92) of patients. Final relapses included no relapses in 33.3%, LR only in 14.5%, DM only in 15.9%, and DM plus LR in 36.2% of patients. Ninety-one percent of LRs occurred within 2 years and 98% occurred within 3 years of BMT. Twenty-three (36%) of 64 patients with LR only underwent salvage surgery, and their median overall survival was 58.6 months (95% CI, 28.8 to not reached) compared with those patients with LR only who were unable to undergo surgery (9.5 months; 95% CI, 7.8 to 13.3). Conclusion(s): Unlike in patients undergoing trimodality therapy, for whom surveillance/salvage treatment plays a lesser role,1 in the BMT population, approximately 8% of all patients (or 36% of patients with LR only) with LRs occurring more than 6 months after chemoradiotherapy can undergo salvage treatment, and their survival is excellent. Our data support vigilant surveillance, at least in the first 24 months after chemotherapy, in these patients.Copyright © 2014 by American Society of Clinical Oncology. All rights reserved.",Excluded
4624,"T95 nucleophosmin phosphorylation as a novel mediator and marker of regulated cell death in acute kidney injury The function of site-specific phosphorylation of nucleophosmin (NPM), an essential Bax chaperone, in stress-induced cell death is unknown. We hypothesized that NPM threonine 95 (T95) phosphorylation both signals and promotes cell death. In resting cells, NPM exclusively resides in the nucleus and T95 is nonphosphorylated. In contrast, phosphorylated T95 NPM (pNPM T95) accumulates in the cytosol after metabolic stress, in multiple human cancer cell lines following gamma-radiation, and in postischemic human kidney tissue. Based on the T95 phosphorylation consensus sequence, we hypothesized that glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) regulates cytosolic NPM translocation by phosphorylating T95 NPM. In a cell-free system, GSK-3beta phosphorylated a synthetic NPM peptide containing T95. In vitro, bidirectional manipulation of GSK-3beta activity substantially altered T95 phosphorylation, cytosolic NPM translocation, and cell survival during stress, mechanistically linking these lethal events. Furthermore, GSK-3beta inhibition in vivo decreased cytosolic pNPM T95 accumulation in kidney tissue after experimental ischemia. In patients with acute kidney injury, both cytosolic NPM accumulation in proximal tubule cells and NPM-rich intratubular casts were detected in frozen renal biopsy tissue. These observations show, for the first time, that GSK-3beta promotes cell death partly by phosphorylating NPM at T95, to promote cytosolic NPM accumulation. T95 NPM is also a rational therapeutic target to ameliorate ischemic renal cell injury and may be a universal injury marker in mammalian cells.Copyright © 2020 the American Physiological Society",Excluded
4192,"Mortality from solid cancers other than lung, liver, and bone in relation to external dose among plutonium and non-plutonium workers in the Mayak Worker Cohort Exposure to ionizing radiation has well-documented long-term effects on cancer rates and other health outcomes in humans. While in vitro experimental studies had demonstrated that the nature of some radiation effects depend on both total dose of the radiation and the dose rate (i.e., the pattern of dose distribution over time), the question of whether or not the carcinogenic effect of radiation exposure depends on the dose rate remains unanswered. Another issue of interest concerns whether or not concomitant exposure to external gamma rays and inhaled plutonium aerosols has any effect on the external exposure effects. The analyses of the present paper focus on the risk of solid cancers at sites other than lung, liver, and bone in Mayak workers. Recent findings are reviewed indicating that there is no evidence of plutonium dose response for these cancers in the Mayak worker cohort. Then the evidence for differences in the external dose effects among workers with and without the potential for exposure to alpha particles from inhaled plutonium is examined. It is found that there is no evidence that exposure to plutonium aerosols significantly affects the risk associated with external exposure. While the Mayak external dose risk estimate of an excess relative risk of 0.16 per Gy is somewhat lower than an appropriately normalized risk estimate from the Life Span Study of Japanese atomic bomb survivors, the uncertainties in these estimates preclude concluding that the external dose excess relative risks of this group of solid cancers differ in the two cohorts.",Included

Integrilin WRIST The Integrilin Washington Radiation for In-Stent Restenosis Trial (WRIST) aimed to study the impact of IIb/IIIa inhibitors as adjunct therapy to intracoronary radiation therapy (IRT) for patients with in-stent restenosis (ISR). The impact of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor (eptifibatide) as adjunct therapy to vascular brachytherapy using (192)Ir emitter was examined in patients with in-stent restenosis. In the study, 150 patients were assigned to eptifibatide (Integrilin) and 150 patients to heparin only. Clinical composite endpoints at 30 days were similar between the patients treated with and without eptifibatide (4.7% vs. 4.0%; P = 0.78). There was a similarity in the non-Q-wave myocardial infarction (MI) rates between the eptifibatide and the control group. Major bleeding was similar in patients treated with and without eptifibatide. Overall, the use of eptifibatide as adjunct therapy for patients with ISR that are treated with IRT did not impact the clinical outcome at 30 days. Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Excluded

The main objective was to determine late toxicity and optimization of the dose of intraluminal radiation. All patients had external radiation of 50 Gy over 5 1/2 weeks, followed by ILBT of 20 Gy for 50 patients (group 1) and 15 Gy for a subsequent 50 patients (group 2), using a dose rate of 315-330 eGy/h with the prescription at 1 cm off axis. The 5-fluorouracil infusion was 500 mg/m2 administered 12 h prior to ILBT.

4727,"Design of a motion simulation system to assist respiratory gating for radiation therapy Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) aims to deliver high doses of radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors in less than or equal to 6 fractions. However, organ motion during treatment is a challenging issue for this kind of technique. We develop a control system via Bluetooth technology to simulate and correct body motion during SABR. Method(s): Radiation doses were analyzed, and the radiation damage protection capability was checked by external beam therapy 3 (EBT3) films irradiated by a linear accelerator. A wireless signal test was also performed. A validation was performed with 8 previously treated patient respiratory pattern records and 8 healthy volunteers. Result(s): The homemade simulation system consisted of 2 linear actuators, one movable stage with a maximal moving distance of 6.5 cm x 12.5 cm x 5 cm to simulate the respiratory pattern of 8 patients precisely with a median error of 0.36 mm and a maximal motion difference of 1.17 mm, and 3.17 and chipset transited signals to display them as a waveform. From the test with 8 volunteers, the chip could detect deep respiratory movement up to 3 cm. The effect of the chip on a radiation dose of 400 monitor units (MUs) by 6 MV photons and 200 MUs by 10 MV photons showed high penetration rates of 98.8% and 98.6%, respectively. Conclusion(s): We invented a tubeless and wireless respiratory gating detection chip. The chip has minimal interference with the treatment angles, good noise immunity and the capability to easily penetrate a variety of materials. The simulation system consisting of linear actuators also successfully simulates the respiratory pattern of real patients.Copyright © 2021 American Association of Medical Dosimetrists",Excluded
3864,"Post-treatment skin reactions reported by cancer patients differ by race, not by treatment or expectations Cancer patients may experience skin problems while undergoing chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Frequency of skin reactions may be influenced by skin pigmentation and psychological factors. A Symptom Inventory completed by 656 cancer patients nationwide before and after chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy plus radiation therapy was analysed to determine if treatment type, race (Black vs White), and pretreatment expectations influenced post-treatment skin reactions. Subsequent analysis of a local Symptom Inventory completed weekly for 5 weeks by 308 patients receiving radiation therapy examined severity of reported skin reactions. Significantly more patients receiving radiation therapy had stronger expectations of skin problems (62%) than patients receiving chemotherapy (40%, P=0.001) or chemotherapy plus radiation therapy (45%, P=0.003). Overall, expectations did not correlate with patient reported post-treatment skin problems in white (r=0.014, P=0.781) or black (r=0.021, P=0.936) patients. Although no significant difference was found between black and white patients in their pretreatment expectations of skin problems (P=0.32), black patients (10 out of 18, 56%) reported more skin problems than white patients (90 out of 393, 23%, P=0.001). Similarly, the local study showed that significantly more black patients (1 out of 5, 20%) reported severe skin reactions at the treatment site than white patients (12 out of 161, 8%). A direct correlation was observed between severity of skin problems and pain at the treatment site (r=0.541, P<0.001). Total radiation exposure did not significantly correlate with the report of skin problems at the treatment site for white or black patients. Overall, black patients reported more severe post-treatment skin problems than white patients. Our results suggest that symptom management for post-treatment skin reactions in cancer patients receiving radiation treatment could differ depending on their racial background.",Excluded
3960,"Normal tissue complication probability modeling for cochlea constraints to avoid causing tinnitus after head-and-neck intensity-modulated radiation therapy Background: Radiation-induced tinnitus is a side effect of radiotherapy in the inner ear for cancers of the head and neck. Effective dose constraints for protecting the cochlea are under-reported. The aim of this study is to determine the cochlea dose limitation to avoid causing tinnitus after head-and-neck cancer (HNC) intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Method(s): In total 211 patients with HNC were included; the side effects of radiotherapy were investigated for 422 inner ears in the cohort. Forty-nine of the four hundred and twenty-two samples (11.6%) developed grade 2+ tinnitus symptoms after IMRT, as diagnosed by a clinician. The Late Effects of Normal Tissues-Subjective, Objective, Management, Analytic (LENT-SOMA) criteria were used for tinnitus evaluation. The logistic and Lyman-Kutcher-Burman (LKB) normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) models were used for the analyses. Result(s): The NTCP-fitted parameters were TD 50 = 46.31Gy (95% CI, 41.46-52.50),GAMMA 50 = 1.27 (95% CI, 1.02-1.55), and TD 50 = 46.52Gy (95% CI, 41.91-53.43), m = 0.35 (95% CI, 0.30-0.42) for the logistic and LKB models, respectively. The suggested guideline TD 20 for the tolerance dose to produce a 20% complication rate within a specific period of time was TD 20 = 33.62Gy (95% CI, 30.15-38.27) (logistic) and TD 20 = 32.82Gy (95% CI, 29.58-37.69) (LKB). Conclusion(s): To maintain the incidence of grade 2+ tinnitus toxicity <20% in IMRT, we suggest that the mean dose to the cochlea should be <32Gy. However, models should not be extrapolated to other patient populations without further verification and should first be confirmed before clinical implementation.Copyright © 2015 Lee et al.",Excluded
4688,"Influence of Needle Position on Lumbar Segmental Nerve Root Block Selectivity Background and Objectives: In patients with chronic low back pain radiating to the leg, segmental nerve root blocks (SNRBs) are performed to predict surgical outcome and identify the putative symptomatic spinal nerve. Epidural spread may lead to false interpretation, affecting clinical decision making. Systematic fluoroscopic analysis of epidural local anesthetic spread and its relationship to needle tip location has not been published to date. Study aims include assessment of epidural local anesthetic spread and its relationship to needle position during fluoroscopy-assisted blocks. Method(s): Patients scheduled for L4, L5, and S1 blocks were included in this prospective observational study. Under fluoroscopy and electrostimulation, they received 0.5 mL of a mixture containing lidocaine 5 mg and iohexol 75 mg. X-rays with needle tip and contrast were scored for no epidural spread (grade 0), local spread epidurally (grade 1), or to adjacent nerve roots (grade 2). Result(s): Sixty-five patients were analyzed for epidural spread, 62 for needle position. Grade 1 epidural spread occurred in 47% of L4 and 28% of L5 blocks and grade 2 spread in 3 blocks (5%; L5 n = 1, S1 n = 2). For lumbar blocks, the needle was most frequently found in the lateral upper half of the intervertebral foramen. Epidural spread occurred more frequently with medial needle positions (P = .06). Conclusion(s): The findings suggest (P = .06) that the risk of grade 1 and 2 lumbar epidural spread, which results in decreased SNRB selectivity, is greater with medial needle positions in the intervertebral foramen. The variability in anatomic position of the dorsal root ganglion necessitates electrostimulation to guide SNRB in addition to fluoroscopy. © 2006 American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine.",Excluded

3893,"Is routine postoperative chest radiography needed after open nephrectomy? OBJECTIVES: To assess whether routine postoperative chest radiography (CXR) is required after open nephrectomy for the detection and possible management of a pneumothorax. It has become the standard of care by many urologists to obtain routine postoperative CXRs after open nephrectomy to assess for the presence of a pneumothorax. However, at our institution, very few patients have developed a pneumothorax postoperatively, and, furthermore, the CXR findings almost never affected the clinical management., METHODS: Retrospective data were collected on the last 150 open nephrectomies performed by two urologists at our institution. All laparoscopic nephrectomies and thoracoabdominal nephrectomies were excluded from analysis., RESULTS: A total of 150 patients underwent open nephrectomy between 1998 and 2003. The procedure was performed with an anterior subcostal, 11th rib, 12th rib, midline, and 10th rib incision in 60 (40%), 51 (34%), 18 (12%), 20 (13.3%), and 1 (0.67%) patient, respectively. Of the 150 patients, 92 (61.3%) underwent postoperative CXR and 58 (38.7%) did not. Of the 150 patients, 92 of whom had undergone postoperative CXR, 4 (2.7%) had a postoperative pneumothorax. One of these patients (0.67%) received a chest tube. Of the 4 patients with a pneumothorax, 3 had had a recognized pleural tear that was repaired at nephrectomy and the fourth had had an unrecognized pleural injury., CONCLUSIONS: Routine postoperative CXRs are not needed after open nephrectomy. Obtaining a selective CXR when a recognized intraoperative pleural tear has occurred, a central line is placed, the physical examination reveals an abnormality (ie, decreased breath sounds), or the patient experiences respiratory difficulties in the postoperative period is safe, cost-effective, and decreases the radiation exposure to patients.",Excluded

Furthermore, distant metastases represent the most frequent cause of thyroid cancer-related death of patients with HCTC. The aim of this study was to report outcomes of patients with distant metastases. Method(s): Altogether 109 patients were treated because of HCTC during the period from 1972 to 2011 in our tertiary center and 33 patients (19 females, 14 males; median age 69 years) had either initially metastatic disease (N=12; 9 females, 3 males; median age 66.5 years) or distant progression of HCTC after initial treatment (N=21; 10 females, 11 males; median age 70 years). Patients with metastases were followed for 1-201 (mean 66, median 41) months. The data on gender and age of the patients, disease history, extent of disease, morphologic characteristics, mode of therapy, outcome, and survival were collected. Statistical correlation between possible prognostic factors and cause-specific survival from time of detection of metastases was analyzed by univariate analysis and log-rank test. Result(s): Single organ and multiple organ metastases were diagnosed in 29 and 4 cases, respectively. The most common were lung metastases, followed by bone, mediastinum, kidney and liver in 26, 8, 2, 2 and 1 case, respectively. Total thyroidectomy, lobectomy, subtotal thyroidectomy and neck dissection were performed in 19, 11, 3 and 7 patients, respectively.

3837,"Cone beam computerized tomography: basics for digital planning in oral surgery and implantology For the diagnosis of bone pathology, planning of complex implant-supported prosthetic restorations, and guaranteeing oral surgery that is as safe and free of complications as possible, a three-dimensional radiological display is frequently indicated. Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), which can cover a large part of the indications of the dental and oral surgical spectrum, represents an alternative to computed tomography. Moreover, the method offers the advantage that it can also be used in the dental practice, taking the existing radiation protection regulations into account. This guarantees optimum patient and user friendliness, because referral to a specialized CT facility is thus no longer necessary in most cases. In the first 12 months of the trials of the Planmeca Promax 3D at the Department of Dental Surgery and Radiology of the University Clinic for Oral and Maxillofacial Medicine in Graz, the overwhelming majority of referrals for CBCT (almost 90%) was concerned with the field of oral surgery and implantology. Oral surgical questions mainly covered aspects of wisdom tooth anatomy, position of impacted canines, premolars, and mesiodents, as well as cystic lesions. Diagnoses of the maxillary sinuses and the area of tooth preservation represented further indications. Apart from diagnostic purposes, the objective of the referrals was facilitating optimum preparation for the pending operation. In the area of implantology, this was combined frequently with pre- or post-augmentative three-dimensional digital therapy planning.

According to Tubiana, 73 hands had Stage N, 61 Stage N/I (<= 10degree flexion deformity), 59 Stage I (11 to 45degree) and 5 Stage II disease (46 to 90degree). Radiotherapy was randomly delivered: group A (63 patients/95 hands) received 10 times 3 Gy (total: 30 Gy) in 2 series (each 5 times 3 Gy) separated by 8 weeks; group B (66 patients/103 hands) received 7 times 3 Gy (total: 21 Gy) within 2 weeks. Orthovoltage radiotherapy (120 kV) with 40 cm standard cones and individual shielding was applied. Patient and disease parameters were equally distributed in both groups. Evaluation (toxicity, efficacy) was performed at 3 and 12 months with regard to subjective (patient's opinion) and objective parameters (palpation, measurements, comparative photographs - physician). Result(s): Acute toxicity was minimal: 76 (38%) hands had skin reactions CTC Grade 1, 12 (6%) CTC Grade 2. Chronic side effects (dryness, skin atrophy, change of sensation, LENT Grade 1) occurred in 9 (5%) hands without differences between treatment groups. At 3 and 12 months follow-up, subjective symptoms and objective signs, nodules and cords, were reduced in both groups (p < 0.01) with no differences between groups: a total of 110 (55%) hands (group A: 55, group B: 55) regressed, 74 (37%) hands (group A: 35; group B: 39) were stable. Overall and mean number of nodules, cords and skin changes decreased at 3 and 12 months. 16 of 198 (8%) hands (group A: 7; group B: 9) progressed at 12 months follow-up (""treatment failure""); at 1 year, 7 of 60 patients with unilateral Dupyutren's disease required prophylactic radiotherapy for the contralateral hand due to disease progression.

4898,"Assessment of the degradation rates and effectiveness of different coated Mg-Zn-Ca alloy scaffolds for in vivo repair of critical-size bone defects Surgical repair of bone defects remains challenging, and the search for alternative procedures is ongoing. Devices made of Mg for bone repair have received much attention owing to their good biocompatibility and mechanical properties. We developed a new type of scaffold made of a Mg-Zn-Ca alloy with a shape that mimics cortical bone and can be filled with morselized bone. We evaluated its durability and efficacy in a rabbit ulna-defect model. Three types of scaffold-surface coating were evaluated: group A, no coating; group B, a 10-mum microarc oxidation coating; group C, a hydrothermal duplex composite coating; and group D, an empty-defect control. X-ray and micro-computed tomography(micro-CT) images were acquired over 12 weeks to assess ulnar repair. A mechanical stress test indicated that bone repair within each group improved significantly over time (P < 0.01). The degradation behavior of the different scaffolds was assessed by micro-CT and quantified according to the amount of hydrogen gas generated; these measurements indicated that the group C scaffold better resisted corrosion than did the other scaffold types (P < 0.05). Calcein fluorescence and histology revealed that greater mineral densities and better bone responses were achieved for groups B and C than for group A, with group C providing the best response. In conclusion, our Mg-Zn-Ca-alloy scaffold effectively aided bone repair. The group C scaffold exhibited the best corrosion resistance and osteogenesis properties, making it a candidate scaffold for repair of bone defects.",Excluded
4636,"A combination therapy of ethanol injection and radiofrequency ablation under general anesthesia for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma Aim: To summarize the effects of laparoscopic ethanol injection and radiofrequency ablation (L-EI-RFA), thoracoscopic (T-EI-RFA) and open-surgery assisted EI-RFA (O-EI-RFA) under general anesthesia for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Method(s): Time-lag performance of RFA after ethanol injection (Time-lag PEI-RFA) was performed in all cases. The volume of coagulated necrosis and the applied energy for total and per unit volume coagulated necrosis were examined in the groups treated under general (group G) or local anesthesia (group L). Result(s): The results showed that the total applied energy and the applied energy per unit volume of whole and marginal, coagulated necrosis were significantly larger in group G than those in the group L, resulting in a larger volume of coagulated necrosis in the group G. The rate of local tumor recurrence within one year was extremely low in group G. Conclusion(s): These results suggest that EI-RFA, under general anesthesia, may be effective for the treatment of HCC because a larger quantity of ethanol and energy could be applied during treatment under pain-free condition for the patients. © 2008 WJG.

4922,"Predictors of the therapeutic effect of corticosteroids on radiation-induced optic neuropathy following nasopharyngeal carcinoma Radiation-induced optic neuropathy (RION) is a severe visual complication resulting from radiotherapy of the head and neck, which mostly occurs in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in the southern part of China. The mechanism of RION is unclear. Therefore, identifying risk factors for RION is an important step towards enhancing our understanding. In the current study, we retrospectively reviewed patients with NPC who were admitted to Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital for visual loss between 2006 and 2017. The study included 38 participants (68 eyes) in the corticosteroid-effective group and 35 participants (64 eyes) in the corticosteroids-ineffective group. We analyzed potential risk factors for RION and developed a prediction model for the therapeutic effect of corticosteroid effect based on a random forests method. The prediction model showed a high accuracy with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.932 (95% confidence interval = 0.889-0.975). Our results revealed that blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was significantly associated with RION and that RION patients with higher BUN levels responded better to corticosteroid treatment. Altogether, these results suggest that a prediction model, based on clinical factors, could be applied to estimate the therapeutic effect of corticosteroids on RION. Further investigation, however, is needed to confirm the study conclusion.Copyright © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
4131,"Analysis of radiological factors promoting degeneration in adjacent disc levels after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion Objective: Adjacent segment disease (ASD) is considered an important prognostic factor of long-term results after cervical anterior fusion. However, factors contributing to ASD are not clearly understood. The objective of this study was to evaluate the radiological factors contributing to ASD after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF). Method(s): Disc levels (145) of 72 patients who underwent ACDF and had radiological observation for more than 5 years after surgery were included in this study. There were 49 males and 23 females, with a mean age of 54.3 years at the time of surgery. All patients underwent the modified Smith-Robinsons method using titanium cages. Radiological assessments were performed by dynamic X-ray and MRI prior to surgery, 1 or 2 weeks postoperatively, and at final follow-up. When any radiological degeneration was detected at follow-up, ASD was judged as present at the level of interest. Radiological factors (e.g., range of motion, pre-operative status, post-operative change) were analyzed on all operated levels and adjacent disc levels and on cervical alignment of all patients. Intra-operative needle placement to the disc space for marking was also studied to determine contribution to ASD. Result(s): ASD was significantly related to canal stenosis (p = 0.00328, Chi square test), pre-operative larger segmental range of motion (ROM) of adjacent segments (p = 0.00911), and preoperative intensity change of adjacent discs on MRI (p = 0.000527). None of the factors on operated levels and cervical alignment statistically contributed to ASD. Intra-operative needle insertion to the non-operated disc levels was more frequently related to ASD (p = 0.00330). Conclusion(s): ASD may be related to adjacent disc levels not the operated level or cervical alignment. Patients with canal stenosis, preoperative degeneration or larger ROM of adjacent levels have a significantly higher incidence of ASD. Although ACDF is a useful and widely accepted method for cervical spondylosis, careful post-operative observation is needed.",Excluded
4099,"Long-term outcomes of hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for refractory functional pituitary adenoma Objective: Refractory functional pituitary adenomas are often treated with single-session stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or conventionally fractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). While single-fraction SRS offers convenience and short time to biochemical remission, large tumors with cranial nerve or chiasmatic involvement often preclude single-fraction SRS, and toxicity may be worse following single-fraction SRS compared with IMRT. The purpose of our study was to explore the long-term outcomes of a unique hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT) regimen delivered in 2-5 fractions. Method(s): After approval, we studied 16 consecutive patients treated with HSRT for refractory functional pituitary adenoma. Study endpoints included local control, biochemical control, and toxicity. Descriptive statistics summarized endpoints and clinicopathologic factors. Result(s): Sixteen patients with adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion (n = 9, 56%), growth hormone secretion (n = 4, 25%), and prolactin secretion (n = 3, 19%) were studied with a median follow-up time after HSRT of 10 years (IQR 2-14 years). Patients were treated with two (n = 8), three (n = 1), or five (n = 7) fractions to median dose of 20.5 Gy (range 16-32 Gy). HSRT was well-tolerated with no acute side effects greater than CTCAE grade 1. Local control was 100%, and biochemical control at last follow-up was 58%. Over 142 years patient-years, no instances of optic neuropathy, secondary malignancy, malignant transformation, radionecrosis, cavernous sinus cranial neuropathy, or cerebrovascular complications were noted. Conclusion(s): HSRT for refractory pituitary adenoma is well-tolerated with long-term local and biochemical control comparable with single-fraction SRS or IMRT. Prospective studies should evaluate whether HSRT provides non-inferior biochemical control and improved toxicity compared with single-fraction SRS.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
4554,"Dosimetric implications of the addition of 18 fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography in CT-based radiotherapy planning for non-small-cell lung cancer Summary The aim of this study was to assess the impact of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) CT on radiotherapy planning parameters for patients treated curatively with radiotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Five patients with stages I-III NSCLC underwent a diagnostic FDG-PET CT (dPET CT), planning FDG-PET CT (pPET CT) and a simulation CT (RTP CT). For each patient, three radiation oncologists delineated a gross tumour volume based on RTP CT alone, and fused with dPET CT and pPET CT. Standard expansions were used to generate PTVs, and a 3D conformal plan was created. Normal tissue doses were compared between plans. Coverage of pPET CT PTV by the plans based on RTP CT and dPET CT was assessed, and tumour control probabilities were calculated. Mean PTV was similar between RTP CT, dPET CT and pPET CT, although there were significant inter-observer differences in four patients. The plans, however, showed no significant differences in doses to lung, oesophagus, heart or spinal cord. The RTP CT plan and dPET CT plan significantly underdosed the pPET PTV in two patients with minimum doses ranging from 12 to 63% of prescribed dose. Coverage by the 95% isodose was suboptimal in these patients, but this did not translate into poorer tumour control probability. The effect of fused FDG-PET varied between observers. The addition of dPET and pPET did not significantly change the radiotherapy planning parameters. Although FDG-PET is of benefit in tumour delineation, its effect on normal tissue complication probability and tumour control probability cannot be predicted.",Excluded
3712,"Analysis of age as a factor in NASA astronaut selection and career landmarks NASA's periodic selection of astronauts is a highly selective process accepting applications from the general population, wherein the mechanics of selection are not made public. This research was an effort to determine if biases (specifically age) exist in the process and, if so, at which points they might manifest. Two sets of analyses were conducted. The first utilized data requested via the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) on NASA astronaut applicants for the 2009 and 2013 selection years. Using a series of multinomial and logistic regressions, the data were analyzed to uncover whether age of the applicants linearly or nonlinearly affected their likelihood of receiving an invitation, as well as their likelihood of being selected into the astronaut program. The second used public data on age at selection and age at other career milestones for every astronaut selected from 1959 to 2013 to analyze trends in age over time using ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression and Pearson's correlation. The results for the FOIA data revealed a nonlinear relationship between age and receiving an interview, as well as age and selection into the astronaut program, but the most striking observation was the loss of age diversity at each stage of selection. Applicants younger or older than approximately 40 years were significantly less likely to receive invitations for interviews and were significantly less likely to be selected as an astronaut. Analysis of the public-source data for all selections since the beginning of the astronaut program revealed significant age trends over time including a gradual increase in selectee age and decreased tenure at NASA after last flight, with average age at retirement steady over the entire history of the astronaut program at approximately 48 years.",Excluded
4551,"A U.S. Multicenter Study of Recorded Occupational Radiation Badge Doses in Nuclear Medicine Purpose To summarize occupational badge doses recorded for a sample of U.S. nuclear medicine technologists. Materials and Methods Nine large U.S. medical institutions identified 208 former and current nuclear medicine technologists certified after 1979 and linked these individuals to historic badge dose records maintained by a commercial dosimetry company (Landauer), yielding a total of 2618 annual dose records. The distributions of annual and cumulative occupational doses were described by using summary statistics. Results Between 1992 and 2015, the median annual personal dose equivalent per nuclear medicine technologist was 2.18 mSv (interquartile range [IQR], 1.25-3.47 mSv; mean, 2.69 mSv). Median annual personal dose equivalents remained relatively constant over this period (range, 1.40-3.30 mSv), while maximum values generally increased over time (from 8.00 mSv in 1992 to 13.9 mSv in 2015). The median cumulative personal dose equivalent was 32.9 mSv (IQR, 18.1-65.5 mSv; mean, 51.4 mSv) for 45 technologists who had complete information and remained employed through 2015. Conclusion Occupational radiation doses were well below the established occupational limits and were consistent with those observed for nuclear medicine technologists worldwide and were greater than those observed for nuclear and general medical workers in the United States These results should be informative for radiation monitoring and safety efforts in nuclear medicine departments. © RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",Excluded
3877,"Developmental switch from LTD to LTP in low frequency-induced plasticity The stimulation of the Schaffer collateral/commissural fibers at low frequency (1 Hz) for 3-5 min can trigger a slow-onset form of low-frequency stimulation (LFS)-long-term potentiation (LTP) (LFS-LTP) in the CA1 area of the adult rat hippocampus. Here we have examined the developmental profile of this plasticity. In 9-15 day-old rats, the application of 1 Hz for 5 min induced long-term depression (LFS-LTD). In 17-21 day-old rats, 1 Hz stimulation had no effect when applied for 5 min but mediated LTD when stimulus duration was increased to 15 min. Over 25 day-old, 1 Hz stimulation mediated LFS-LTP. LFS-LTD was dependent on both N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and mGlu5 receptor activation. Antagonists of mGlu1alpha and cannabinoid type 1 receptor were ineffective to block LTD induction. LFS-LTD was not associated with a change in paired-pulse facilitation ratio, suggesting a postsynaptic locus of expression of this plasticity. Next, we examined whether LFS-LTD was related to 'chemical' LTDs obtained by the direct stimulation of mGlu5 and NMDA receptors. The saturation of LFS-LTD completely occluded NMDA- and (RS)-2-Chloro-5-hydroxyphenylglycine (CHPG)-induced LTD. CHPG-LTD and NMDA-LTD occluded each other. In addition, we observed that NMDA-LTD was dependent on mGlu5 receptor activation in 9-12 day old rats while it was not in animals older than 15 day-old. Therefore we postulate that during LFS application, NMDA and mGlu5 receptor could interact to trigger LTD. Low-frequency-mediated synaptic plasticity is subject to a developmental switch from NMDA- and mGlu5 receptor-dependent LTD to mGlu5 receptor-dependent LTP with a transient period (17-21 day-old) during which LFS is ineffective.",Excluded
4404,"Phase II clinical trial of preoperative combined chemoradiation for T3 and T4 resectable rectal cancer: preliminary results PURPOSE: Although preoperative chemoradiation for high-risk rectal cancer may improve survival and local recurrence rate, its adverse effects are not well defined. This prospective study evaluated the use of preoperative chemoradiation for T3 and T4 resectable rectal cancer, with special emphasis on treatment morbidity, pathologic remission rate, quality of life, and anorectal function., METHODS: Forty-two patients (30 men, 12 women) were enrolled in the study. Median distance of the distal tumor margin from the anal verge was 6.5 cm. Preoperative staging was based on digital rectal examination, endorectal ultrasound, and computed tomography. None of the patients had distant metastases. All patients had 45 Gy (1.8 Gy/day in 25 fractions) over five weeks, plus 5-fluorouracil (350 mg/m(2)/day) and leucovorin (20 mg/m(2)/day) bolus on days 1 to 5 and 29 to 33. Quality of life was assessed with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 30-item quality-of-life questionnaire (QLQ-C30) and its colorectal cancer-specific module (QLQ-CR38) questionnaires. Objective anorectal function was assessed by anorectal manometry and pudendal nerve terminal motor latency. Surgery was performed 46 (range, 24-63) days after completion of adjuvant therapy., RESULTS: Nineteen patients (45 percent) had Grade 3 or 4 chemoradiation-induced toxic reactions. Four patients developed intercurrent distant metastases or intraperitoneal carcinomatosis at completion of chemoradiation. Thirty-eight patients underwent surgical resection: abdominoperineal resection, anterior resection, and Hartmann's procedure were performed in 55 percent, 39 percent (11 of 15 patients had a diverting stoma), and 5 percent, respectively. Major surgical complications occurred in 7 patients (18 percent) and included anastomotic leak (n = 1), pelvic abscess (n = 1), small-bowel obstruction (n = 3), and wound breakdown (n = 2). Final pathology was Stage 0 (no residual disease), I, II, and III in 6 (16 percent), 7 (18 percent), 9 (24 percent), and 16 (42 percent) patients, respectively. There was a deterioration, after chemoradiation and surgery, in the quality of life on all subscales assessed, with physical, role, and social function being most severely affected. The symptoms most adversely affected were micturition, defecation, and gastrointestinal problems. Body image and sexual enjoyment deteriorated in both men and women. Chemoradiation alone led to prolonged pudendal nerve terminal motor latency in 57 percent of 7 patients assessed., CONCLUSION: Preliminary results have identified defined costs with preoperative chemoradiation, which included treatment-induced toxicity, a high stoma rate, and adverse effects on quality of life and anorectal function.",Excluded
4265,"Combined use of automatic tube potential selection with tube current modulation and iterative reconstruction technique in coronary CT angiography Purpose: To analyze the effect of automatic tube potential selection with tube current modulation (APSCM) and iterative reconstruction on image quality, diagnostic accuracy, and radiation dose at computed tomographic (CT) angiography and compare it with APSCM-only and body mass index (BMI)-based examination protocols. Material(s) and Method(s): This study was approved by the institutional review board, and informed consent was obtained from all patients. Images from 185 patients who underwent a BMI-based protocol and 197 patients who underwent an APSCM protocol with filtered back projection (FBP) and an APSCM protocol with sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction (SAFIRE) were retrospectively evaluated. Diagnostic performance was compared with that of conventional coronary angiography in a subgroup of 51 patients. Statistical analysis was performed by using the independent or paired t test, Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon signed rank test, x2 statistics, linear weighted k statistics, and generalized estimating equation. Result(s): The APSCM group with SAFIRE had a significant reduction in image noise and a significant increase in CT number, contrast enhancement, signal-to-noise ratio, and contrast-to-noise ratio compared with the APSCM group with FBP (P < .0001) and the BMI-based group (P < .001, except P = .002 for image noise). Image quality and diagnostic accuracy showed no significant difference between the three groups. The use of APSCM resulted in a significant reduction in radiation dose compared with the BMI-based protocol. Conclusion(s): The combination of SAFIRE and APSCM at coronary CT angiography significantly improves objective image quality while maintaining diagnostic accuracy and reduced radiation dose. © RSNA, 2013.",Excluded

Method(s): This phase III trial comprises two cohorts of patients deemed fit to receive cisplatin (100 mg/m2 Q3W) (cohort 1) or unfit to cisplatin (cohort 2). The SOC was Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) with cisplatin in cohort 1 (arm A) and with weekly cetuximab in cohort 2 (arm D). In both cohorts, experimental arms (arms B and C) were IMRT with cetuximab and avelumab (10 mg/kg day 7 and every 2 weeks) followed by avelumab every two weeks for 12 months. A safety phase was planned among the first 41 patients in experimental arms by monitoring grade >=IV adverse events (AEs) with an unacceptable rate of 35%. Result(s): Between September 2017 and August 2018, 82 patients with LA-SCCHN were randomised including 41 patients in experimental arms. All patients of experimental arms except one (arm C) received entire radiotherapy as planned. Most common grade >=III AEs were mucositis, radio-dermatitis, and dysphagia. Grade >=IV AEs occurred in 5/41 (12%) patients, all in arm C (no grade V). This rate was acceptable according to the hypotheses of the safety phase. In the SOC arms, grade >=IV AEs occurred in 3/21 patients (14%) in arm A and 2/20 (10%) in arm D. One grade V haemorrhage occurred in arm A. Conclusion(s): The avelumab-cetuximab-RT combination was tolerable for patients with LA-SCCHN, and the approval was given for continuing the trial without modification.

3923,"Thigh Ultrasound Used to Identify Frail Elderly Patients with Sarcopenia Undergoing Surgery: A Pilot Study BACKGROUND: Computed tomography (CT) scan quantifying skeletal muscle mass is the gold standard tool to identify sarcopenia. Unfortunately, high cost, limited availability, and radiation exposure limit its use. We suggest that ultrasound of the thigh muscle could be an objective, reproducible, portable, and risk-free tool, used as a surrogate to a CT scan, to help identify frail patients with sarcopenia., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included 49 patients over 64 y old, referred to the acute care surgery service. An ultrasound of thigh muscle thickness was standardized to patient thigh length (U/Swhole/L). CT skeletal muscle index (SMI) was calculated using skeletal muscle surface area of the L3 region divided by height2. Frailty status was assessed using the Canadian Study of Healthy Aging Clinical Frailty Scale., RESULTS: The mean (SD) age was 76 (8) y, and 34% (n = 17) were men. CT-defined sarcopenia was identified in 65% (n = 11) of men and 75% (n = 24) of women. In general, women had longer stay in hospital than men (mean + SD 14 +/- 9 versus 7 +/- 3 d, P = 0.003). There was a significant positive correlation between thigh U/Swhole/L and CT SMI. There was an inverse correlation between thigh U/Swhole/L and frailty score; a similar relationship was observed between CT SMI and frailty. There was an association between U/Swhole/L and postoperative major complications., CONCLUSIONS: This prospective observational study illustrates that the U/Swhole/L index can be used as a surrogate to CT scan, whereby it can identify elderly frail patients with sarcopenia. Thigh ultrasound should be further tested as an objective tool to assess for stratifying frailty. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
4084,"Efficacy of RADPAD R protection drape in reducing radiation exposure to the primary operator during Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) BACKGROUND: The efficacy of RADPAD R (a sterile, lead-free drape) has been demonstrated to reduce the scatter radiation to the primary operator during fluoroscopic procedures. However, the use of the RADPAD R during TAVI procedures has not been studied. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is now an established treatment for patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis who are deemed inoperable or at high risk for conventional surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR). Consequently the radiation exposure to the patient and the interventional team from this procedure has become a matter of interest and importance. Methods to reduce radiation exposure to the interventional team during this procedure should be actively investigated. In this single center prospective study, we determined the radiation dose during this procedure and the efficacy of RADPAD R in reducing the radiation dose to the primary operator., METHODS: Fifty consecutive patients due to undergo elective TAVI procedures were identified. Patients were randomly assigned to undergo the procedure with or without the use of a RADPAD R drape. There were 25 patients in each group and dosimetry was performed at the left eye level of the primary operator. The dosimeter was commenced at the start of the procedure, and the dose was recorded immediately after the end of the procedure. Fluoroscopy times and DAP were also recorded prospectively., RESULTS: Twenty-five patients underwent transfemoral TAVI using a RADPAD R and 25 with no-RADPAD R. The mean primary operator radiation dose was significantly lower in the RADPAD group at 14.8 mSv vs. 24.3 mSv in the no-RADPAD group (P=0.008). There was no significant difference in fluoroscopy times or dose-area products between the two patient groups. The dose to the primary operator relative to fluoroscopy time (RADPAD: slope=0.325; no RADPAD: slope=1.148; analysis of covariance F=7.47, P=0.009) and dose area product (RADPAD: slope=0.0007; no RADPAD: slope=0.002; analysis of covariance F=7.38; P=0.009) was smaller in the RADPAD group compared to no-RADPAD group., CONCLUSIONS: Use of a RADPAD R significantly reduces radiation exposure to the primary operator during TAVI procedures.",Excluded
4230,"Urological applications of computerized axial tomography Computerized tomography (CT scanning) of the chest and abdomen has been used as a diagnostic technique in more than 7,200 patients since 1974, 250 of whom had histological proved disorders of the genitourinary system and retroperitoneum. On the basis of this experience CT scanning has been found to be safe and effective, and offers certain advantages over conventional techniques. The number, extent and content of adrenal and renal mass lesions can be determined with relatively great accuracy. The presence and extent of metastases into the retroperitoneum, liver and chest often can be shown by CT scanning when other tests are negative. Placement of needles for aspiration, biopsy, injection of contrast medium or insertion of drainage tubes can be done accurately under computerized tomographic control. Air contrast scanning of the bladder can be of real help in staging bladder tumors, espically in obese patients. Computerized tomography in itself is non-invasive, carries a low radiation exposure comparable to other radiographic procedures and therefore, can, be valuable in following the course of patients with various diseases during and after therapy. While CT scanning will not replace other diagnostic procedures it should lead to a more judicious selection of potentially hazardous tests, such as angiography, aspiration and open biopsy.",Excluded
3884,"Use of supero-temporal free conjunctivo-limbal autograft in the surgical management of pterygium: our technique and results A pterygium is a fibro-vascular, wing shaped encroachment of the conjunctiva on to the cornea. The prevalence rates ranges from 0.7 to 31% among different populations and also influenced by age, race, and exposure to solar radiations. Ultraviolet light-induced damage to the limbal stem cell barrier with subsequent conjunctivalisation of the cornea is the currently accepted aetiology of this condition. Indication of surgery include visual impairment, cosmetic disfigurement, motility restriction, recurrent inflammation and interference with contact lens wear. This Study was conducted to know the safety, efficacy and success with supero-temporal free conjunctivo-limbal auto graft transplantation in the surgical management of pterygium. Prospective case series where supero temporal free conjunctivo-limbal auto grafting was performed on 72 eyes of 72 patients with vascular progressive pterygia. Pterygium recurrence was considered a surgical failure. Recurrence was defined as fibro vascular tissue crossing the corneo-scleral limbus on to the clear cornea in the area of previous pterygium excision before 6 months. Recurrence of pterygium was noted in three out of 72 eyes (4.16%), after a minimum follow up of 12 months to maximum of 25 months (Mean 14.6 months). No major intra-operative or postoperative complications were encountered. Supero temporal free conjunctivo-limbal auto graft appears to be a safe and effective technique in the surgical management of pterygium. The inclusion of limbal tissue in the conjunctival auto graft following pterygium excision appears to be essential to ensure low recurrence rate.",Excluded
4246,"Does race influence survival for esophageal cancer patients treated on the radiation and chemotherapy arm of RTOG 85-01? Purpose: In reported retrospective non-randomized trials of treatment of esophageal carcinoma, blacks have a lower survival from esophageal cancer than whites. None of these studies has accounted for the extent of disease, or the methods and quality of treatment. We reviewed the data that included only patients treated on the chemoradiation arm of the RTOG-8501 esophageal carcinoma trial to see if there were differences in overall survival between black and white patients receiving the same standard of care. Methods and Materials: One hundred-nineteen patients, 37 blacks and 82 whites were evaluated who met the criteria for receiving chemoradiation of 5000 cGy and four courses of Cisplatin (75 mg/m2) and Fluorouracil (1000 mg/m2 for 4 days). Result(s): Blacks had squamous histology only, with 86% of blacks having weight loss of 10 lbs. or more compared to 56% of whites (p = 0.001). In addition, blacks had larger tumors and more difficulty eating (p = 0.010). Overall, there was no difference in the Kaplan-Meier median survival estimate by race (p = 0.2757). Only when we limited the analysis to the 'squamous histology' subgroup, stratified according to age >70 vs. <70 years (p = 0.0002), and nodal status (p = 0.0177) in a Cox regression model analysis, did race appear to be a significant factor (p = 0.0012). However, using the entire database, the age effect was found to be a 'bimodal' effect, wherein the 'youngest' ( 70 years) did poorly. Because of the dramatic differences in the age and histology distributions between blacks and whites, this issue could not be resolved in the subset of squamous only who received chemoradiation. Conclusion(s): The increasing incidence of adenocarcinoma among white patients without a corresponding increase of this histology in blacks reflects a difference in diet and or lifestyle compared to blacks that deserves additional study. When treated aggressively with chemoradiation, race did not appear to be a statistically significant factor for overall survival.",Excluded
4222,"Observer variation in target volume delineation of lung cancer related to radiation oncologist-computer interaction: a 'Big Brother' evaluation BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To evaluate the process of target volume delineation in lung cancer for optimization of imaging, delineation protocol and delineation software., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eleven radiation oncologists (observers) from five different institutions delineated the Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) including positive lymph nodes of 22 lung cancer patients (stages I-IIIB) on CT only. All radiation oncologist-computer interactions were recorded with a tool called 'Big Brother'. For each radiation oncologist and patient the following issues were analyzed: delineation time, number of delineated points and corrections, zoom levels, level and window (L/W) settings, CT slice changes, use of side windows (coronal and sagittal) and software button use., RESULTS: The mean delineation time per GTV was 16 min (SD 10 min). The mean delineation time for lymph node positive patients was on average 3 min larger (P = 0.02) than for lymph node negative patients. Many corrections (55%) were due to L/W change (e.g. delineating in mediastinum L/W and then correcting in lung L/W). For the lymph node region, a relatively large number of corrections was found (3.7 corr/cm2), indicating that it was difficult to delineate lymph nodes. For the tumor-atelectasis region, a relative small number of corrections was found (1.0 corr/cm2), indicating that including or excluding atelectasis into the GTV was a clinical decision. Inappropriate use of L/W settings was frequently found (e.g. 46% of all delineated points in the tumor-lung region were delineated in mediastinum L/W settings). Despite a large observer variation in cranial and caudal direction of 0.72 cm (1 SD), the coronal and sagittal side windows were not used in 45 and 60% of the cases, respectively. For the more difficult cases, observer variation was smaller when the coronal and sagittal side windows were used., CONCLUSIONS: With the 'Big Brother' tool a method was developed to trace the delineation process. The differences between observers concerning the delineation style were large. This study led to recommendations on how to improve delineation accuracy by adapting the delineation protocol (guidelines for L/W use) and delineation software (double window with lung and mediastinum L/W settings at the same time, enforced use of coronal and sagittal views) and including FDG-PET information (lymph nodes and atelectasis).",Excluded
4830,"Acute massive gastrointestinal bleeding: Detection and localization with arterial phase multi-detector row helical CT Purpose: To prospectively evaluate accuracy of arterial phase multi-detector row helical computed tomography (CT) for detection and localization of acute massive gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, with angiography as reference standard. Material(s) and Method(s): Institutional review board approved this study; written informed consent was obtained from each patient or patient's family after procedures, including radiation dose, were explained. Twenty-six consecutive patients (17 men, nine women; age range, 18-89 years) had acute massive GI bleeding (defined as requirement of transfusion of at least 4 units of blood during 24 hours in the hospital or as hypotension with systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg) and underwent arterial phase multi-detector row CT before angiography. Scans were obtained during arterial phase to identify extravasation of contrast material with attenuation greater than 90 HU within bowel lumen; this finding was considered diagnostic for active GI bleeding. Presence of contrast medium extravasation in each anatomic location was recorded. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy of multi-detector row CT for detection of acute GI bleeding were assessed. Accuracy for localization of acute GI bleeding was assessed by comparing locations of active bleeding at both multi-detector row CT and angiography in each patient who had active bleeding. Result(s): Arterial phase multi-detector row CT deplicted extravasation of contrast material in 21 of 26 patients. Overall location-based sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive and negative predictive values of multi-detector row CT for detection of GI bleeding were 90.9% (20 of 22), 99% (107 of 109), respectively. Overall patient-based accuracy of multi-detector row CT for detection of acute GI bleeding was 88.5% (23 of 26). The location of contrast material extravasation on multi-detector row CT scans corresponded exactly to that of active bleeding on angiograms in all patients with contrast medium extravasation at both multi-detector row CT and angiography. Conclusion(s): Arterial phase multi-detector row CT is accurate for detection and localization of bleeding sites in patients with acute massive GI bleeding. © RSNA, 2006.",Excluded
3741,"Pretherapeutic dosimetry before 131P therapy of benign thyroid disease: A clinical practice assessment of dosimetric parameters Aim: To compare uptake measurements and different methods for the pretherapeutic determination of the effective thyroidal 131I half life (Teff) to the results of posttherapeutic dosimetric measurements. Patients, methods: Retrospective study of 1538 patients who received their first RIT in our department for autonomous thyroid nodules (ATN), autonomous multinodular goiter (AMG) or Graves' disease (GD) between November 1999 and January 2011. Pretherapeutic measurements were performed at any combination of 24 h, 48 h and 6 days after 131I administration. Post-therapy dosimetric measurements were performed in 12 h intervals until discharge. Teff was determined through monoexponential curve fitting. Result(s): Pretherapeutic Teff values based on measurements at 24 h and 48 h, 24 h and 6 d, 48 h and 6 d as well as on day 24 h, 48 h and 6 d yielded implausible (< 2 d or > 8 d) values for Teff, in 60.4%, 25.7%, 29.1 and 21.4% of available calculations, respectively. The plausible results showed significant, clinically relevant and sometimes considerable overestimations of Teff. Using empirically determined fixed disease specific Teff values resulted in a better congruence between the pre- and posttherapeutic dosimetry results. 24 h measurements were marginally more accurate than 48 h ones in AMG and GD whereas 48 h measurements were marginally more accurate in ATN; these differences are however not clinically relevant. 6 d measurements are clearly less accurate than those after 24 h or 48 h. Conclusion(s): In ATN, AMG and GD, pretherapeutic dosimetry can be performed by a single uptake measurement at 24 h or 48 h using a fixed, disease specific value for Teff. Additional later measurements do not yield a further clinically relevant contribution to accuracy of pretherapeutic dosimetry.Copyright © Schattauer 2015.",Excluded
3998,"Is computerised 3D templating more accurate than 2D templating to predict size of components in primary total hip arthroplasty? Introduction: The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy of preoperative templating in total hip arthroplasty (THA) using conventional 2-dimensional (2D) and computed tomography (CT)-based 3-dimensional (3D) measures. Method(s): One hundred and sixteen consecutive primary THAs were analysed. The preoperative diagnosis was primary osteoarthritis in all cases. The 2D templating and the 3D templating were performed by two different residents. All templating results were available for the orthopaedic surgeon performing the procedure. Accuracies with regard to the predicted and actual implant sizes were determined for each procedure. Implantation of the size as planned was defined as ""exact"", whereas the use of components within one size larger or smaller (+/-1) as planned were defined as ""accurate."" Results: The 3D templating was significantly more accurate in predicting implant sizing compared to 2D templating for primary total hip arthroplasty (THA). The difference was statistically significant for the cup templating (''exact'' p = 0.02; ''accurate'' p = 0.01) and for the stem templating (''exact'' p = 0.04; ''accurate'' p = 0.01). Conclusion(s): Our results support the superiority of 3D templating over 2D templating in predicting implant size.Copyright © The Author(s) 2018.",Excluded
4702,"Determinants of model of renarrowing after beta radiation for in-stent restenosis UNLABELLED: It is unknown whether model of renarrowing after beta-radiation for in-stent restenosis (ISR) is influenced by the type of geographic miss (GM)., METHODS: In 166 ISR treated with Galileo, serial quantitative coronary angiographic analysis was done. Minimal lumen diameters and lengths were measured for (1) stent, (2) peri-stent subsegments subjected to angioplasty with/without irradiation, and (3) irradiation margins. GM was defined as: (Type 1) edge injury within the 32P source dose fall-off: 2.0 mm inside and outside the source end marker or (Type 2) overt, nonirradiated injury: beyond the outer 2.0-mm long dose fall-off zone., RESULTS: Restenosis rate was 28.3% at 8.9+/-4.5 months with 60% located exclusively outside the stent. Type 1 GM was present in 24.7% of proximal edges, whereas Type 2 in 18.1%. Respective percentages for distal edges were 23.5% and 15.7%. Regardless of presence and type of GM, significant late lumen loss occurred only outside the stent. However, the biggest late lumen loss at the proximal edge was induced by the Type 1 GM (0.65+/-0.79, p<0.001), while proximal Type 2 GM was not associated with edge renarrowing (-0.04+/-0.48, p=NS). Both reference lumen diameter and proximal Type 1 GM influenced restenosis independently (OR 0.47; 95%CI 0.24-0.90; p=0.023 and OR 2.46; 95%CI 1.12-5.40; p=0.025)., CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of presence and type of geographic miss, late lumen loss after beta-radiation occurs only outside the stent. However, injury within the proximal 32P dose fall-off but not overt edge injury is associated with the biggest late lumen loss at the respective edge, triggering recurrent restenosis.",Excluded
4874,"Irradiation of male mammary gland for the prevention of hormone induced gynecomastia Treatment of carcinoma of the prostate with female sex hormones causes not only impotence but also swollen, painfully mammary glands. The radiobiological response of the mammary glands renders it possible to prevent hormone induced gynecomastia by means of radiotherapy. On this indication, 121 patients treated with female sex hormones between 1961 and 1972 for carcinoma of the prostate were subjected to irradiation of both mammary glands. On 4 successive days, daily doses of 300 r surface dose were administered to each mammary gland, corresponding to a focal dose of 840 r at 3 cm tissue depth. The parameters were: roentgen radiation, 150 kV, 20 mA, 0.5 mm Cu, focus skin distance 40 cm, field size 6 x 6 m. 84 patients could be followed up more than 6 mth after the treatment. In 67 cases (79.8%), development of gynecomastia was completely suppressed, while in 16 cases, a slight degree of gynecomastia had occurred in spite of the irradiation. In one case, the gynecomastia that had already been completely developed at the time of the radiotherapy, had remained uninfluenced apart from a mitigation of the sensation of tension. In 6 of the patients who were free from gynecomastia (8.9%) the hormone treatment had been started prior to the radiotherapy. This proportion was considerably larger among the patients with mild gynecomastia, viz. 75% (12 cases). The lesser effect of the radiotherapy is considered to be correlated with the duration and dosage of the hormone treatment started prior to the radiotherapy, and may also be correlated with the duration of the interval between the end of the hormone treatment and the start of the irradiation.",Excluded

Patients and Methods: Thirty patients were treated according to the neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery versus surgery-alone trial scheme with VMAT radiation therapy. Patients presented mainly T3-T4 stage (80%) and N1-2 (96.6%) disease. The chemotherapy scheme consisted of 3-5 cycles, while a radiotherapy course of 41.4 Gy in 23 fractions was administered to all patients. Result(s): The median age of patients was 65 years, and there was a predominance of males (80%), smokers or ex-smokers (90%) and modest alcohol habit (80% negative). Primary tumor localisation was in the medium and distal third of the oesophagus in 57% of the cases, the rest being in the gastro-oesophageal junction. Modest toxicity profiles were observed, with limited incidence of grade 2-3 events. Partial or complete response was observed in more than 90% of the cases (radiological/metabolic) and was confirmed after surgical intervention (67% partial or complete and 27% stable response). Tumor down-staging was recorded in 67% of patients and nodal down-staging in 50%.

4621,"Ultraviolet-B induces ERCC6 repression in lens epithelium cells of age-related nuclear cataract through coordinated DNA hypermethylation and histone deacetylation Background: Ultraviolet-B (UVB) exposure attributes to the formation of age-related nuclear cataract (ARNC), which is mediated with DNA damage. DNA damage, an important factor for pathogenesis of ARNC, is induced by UVB, and is generally resolved by the nucleotide excision repair (NER) repair mechanism. Cockayne syndrome complementation group B (CSB) protein coded by ERCC6 is a vital component for NER. However, we found no association between selected ERCC6 polymorphisms and ARNC. In this study, we investigated whether UVB exposure could alter ERCC6 expression and the process could involve epigenetic changes of DNA methylation and/or histone acetylation of ERCC6 in the lens epithelial cells (LECs). We also assessed the involvement of those coordinated changes in lens tissue from ARNC patients. Result(s): mRNA and protein expression of ERCC6 in lens tissue (LECs) were lower in ARNCs than those in the controls. This reduction corresponded to methylation of a CpG site at the ERCC6 promoter and histone modifications (methylation and acetylation) nearby this site. UVB-treated human lens epithelium B3 (HLE-B3) and 239T cell presented (1) increased apoptosis, suggesting reduced UV-damage repair, (2) hypermethylation of the CpG site located at position -441 (relative to transcription start site) within the binding region for transcriptional factor Sp1 in the ERCC6 promoter, (3) the enhancement of histone H3K9 deacetylation, (4) induction in DNA methyltransferases 3b (DNMT3b) and histone deacetylase1 (HDAC1) associated to the CpG site of ERCC6 by CHIP assay. Conclusion(s): These findings suggest an orchestrated mechanism triggered by UVB radiation where the concurrent association of specific hypermethylation CpG site, H3K9 deacetylation of ERCC6, and repression of ERCC6 gene expression. Taken together, with the similar changes in the lens tissue from ARNC patients, our data unveiled a possible mechanism of epigenetic modification of DNA repair gene in the pathogenesis of ARNC.Copyright © 2016, The Author(s).",Excluded
4865,"Induction chemotherapy with cisplatin and ifosfamide in locally advanced inoperable squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: A single-institution experience BACKGROUND: Induction chemotherapy (ICT) in patients with head and neck cancer has been studied since a long time. The addition of taxanes to the cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5FU) (PF) regimen results in superior antitumor activity. We did this study to see the response and toxicity of ICT with cisplatin and ifosfamide followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in locally advanced, unresectable squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN). AIMS: The aim of this study was to see the results of ICT using cisplatin and ifosfamide regimen in locally advanced unresectable SCCHN in terms of acute and chronic toxicity and response to treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with Stage III and IV, nonmetastatic SCCHN were enrolled in the study. They were given two cycles of ICT with cisplatin and ifosfamide followed by CRT. RESULT(S): After ICT, the overall response rate (ORR) was 75.0% at the primary site and 70.0% at the nodal site. ORR for combined primary and nodal disease was observed to be 67.5%. The complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) for combined primary and nodal site were seen in 4 (10.0%) and 23 (57.5%) patients. Of 32 patients who received CRT after ICT, CR was 53.1% and PR was 31.3%. Mucositis, skin reaction, and pharyngeal and laryngeal toxicities were the most common but tolerable. CONCLUSION(S): ICT with cisplatin and ifosfamide gives comparable results to the standard paclitaxel, PF regimen. We conclude that this combination regimen for ICT is not only an economical alternative of taxol-based regimen but also well tolerated by the patients.Copyright © 2017 Indian Journal of Cancer.",Excluded
3812,"Dose-response relationships for radium-induced bone sarcomas The incidence of bone sarcomas among 3055 female radium-dial workers who entered the dial industry before 1950 was used to determine dose-response relationships for the induction of bone sarcomas by radium. Two subpopulations were analyzed: all measured cases who survived at least 5 yr after the start of employment and all cases who survived at least 2 yr after first measurement. The first constituted a group based on year of entry; it contained 1468 women who experienced 42 bone sarcomas; the expected number was 0.4. The second comprised a group based on first measurement; it contained 1257 women who experienced 13 bone sarcomas; the expected number was 0.2. The dose-response function, I = (C + alpha D + beta D2)e-gammaD, and simplifications of this general form, were fit to each data set. Incidence (I) was in units of bone sarcomas per person-yr; (D) was the quantity (muCi) of radium that entered the blood. Two functions, I = (C + alpha D + beta D2)e-gammaD and I = (C + beta D2)e-gammaD, fit the data for year of entry (p greater than or equal to 0.05); both these functions and I = (C + alpha D) fit the data for first measurement. The function I = (C + beta D2)e-gammaD was used to predict the number of bone sarcomas in all other pre-1950 radium cases (medical, laboratory and other exposures); fewer were actually observed than the fit of this function to the female dial workers predicted.",Excluded

Thyroid volume has been reported as one of the factors influencing radioiodine therapy outcome in man and cats. The goal of this study was to describe the most reliable and practically applicable formula to determine thyroid volume using scintigraphy. The volume of each thyroid lobe of 32 hyperthyroid cats was determined by ultrasound and scintigraphy. The ultrasonographically determined volume (ellipsoid formula) for each thyroid lobe was compared with the scintigraphic volume that was calculated using eight different formulas: F1 [(pi/6) x L x H x W], F2 [(pi /2) x L x W(2)], F3 [0.33 x (area cm(2))(3/2)], F4 [1.08 x (pi /6) x L x W(2)], F5 (area x H), F6 (0.27 x area x L), F7 (pi x L x W(2)) and F8 [pi x (4/3) x W(3)]. F1, F3, F4 and F6 did not differ statistically from the volumes measured on ultrasound, while F2, F5, F7 and F8 did. Subjective shape assessment of the thyroid lobes, assigned as cylindrical or spherical, and the use of corresponding formulas, did not appear to be useful.",Excluded
4540,"Transition to radial approach for neurovascular procedures is safe and convenient: Characterization of a learning experience BACKGROUND: The transradial access for endovascular procedures has become a popular access point of preference for both patients and for many neuro-endovascular practitioners. OBJECTIVE(S): To describe a single-center experience on the transition to a radial-first approach for neurovascular procedures, focused on diagnostic angiographies, and to compare the differences in terms of length of procedure within the first 5 mo of its execution. METHOD(S): We performed a retrospective review of a prospective maintained cerebrovascular registry at an academic institution within the United States, to identify the expected adoption curve required to transition to a transradial route first approach focused mainly on diagnostic procedures. The 5 mo of experience were divided into 4 quartiles evenly distributed in time. The primary outcome was the total length of procedure. Secondary outcomes were access failure, radiation dose, the usefulness of ultrasound assistance and complications. RESULT(S): A total of 121 transradial procedures were performed: 113 diagnostic angiographies (93%) and 8 therapeutic interventions (7%). We identified 6 access failures (5%) and 1 complication (1%). The mean length for diagnostic angiographies was 24 +/- 10 min, and for therapeutic procedures was 58 +/- 19 min. A multivariate regression analysis demonstrated a significant decrease in the total length of procedures after the first quartile. CONCLUSION(S): The transradial route shows to be a safe and convenient approach. The total length of procedure starts decreasing as providers gain experience and become more confident with this route, as seen in our 5-mo experience.Copyright © 2020 by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons",Excluded
4553,"Clustered Ca2+ Channels Are Blocked by Synaptic Vesicle Proton Release at Mammalian Auditory Ribbon Synapses A Ca2+ current transient block (ICaTB) by protons occurs at some ribbon-type synapses after exocytosis, but this has not been observed at mammalian hair cells. Here we show that a robust ICaTB occurs at post-hearing mouse and gerbil inner hair cell (IHC) synapses, but not in immature IHC synapses, which contain non-compact active zones, where Ca2+ channels are loosely coupled to the release sites. Unlike ICaTB at other ribbon synapses, ICaTB in mammalian IHCs displays a surprising multi-peak structure that mirrors the EPSCs seen in paired recordings. Desynchronizing vesicular release with intracellular BAPTA or by deleting otoferlin, the Ca2+ sensor for exocytosis, greatly reduces ICaTB, whereas enhancing release synchronization by raising Ca2+ influx or temperature increases ICaTB. This suggests that ICaTB is produced by fast multivesicular proton-release events. We propose that ICaTB may function as a submillisecond feedback mechanism contributing to the auditory nerve's fast spike adaptation during sound stimulation., Mature inner hair cells in the cochlea contain compact active zones where clustered Ca2+ channels are tightly coupled to the sites of vesicle fusion. Vincent et al. show that vesicle exocytosis leads to the release of protons into the synaptic cleft, which transiently blocks a subset of Ca2+ channels.Copyright © 2018",Excluded
4016,"Noninvasive Determination of Epidermal and Stratum Corneum Thickness in vivo Using Two-Photon Microscopy and Optical Coherence Tomography: Impact of Body Area, Age, and Gender Background: High-resolution images of the epidermis are important to understand the transdermal penetration and changes in epidermal components. Both ex vivo and in vivo technologies are available to picture the epidermal thickness (ET). So far, the illustration of the stratum corneum (SC) has not been possible without artifacts. Objective(s): Precision in vivo measurement of the ET and SC, duly considering the impact of location on the body, age, and gender. Method(s): In this pilot study on 20 skin-healthy subjects aged 18-66 years, the ET was imaged by two-photon microscopy (2PM) and optical coherence tomography (OCT), and the SC by using 2PM at five different body sites. Result(s): On solar-exposed body areas, both the epidermis and SC are thicker compared to solar-protected areas (p < 0.05), the epidermis at the gluteal region being the thickest (p < 0.05). The ET decreases with age (p < 0.05). Males show a thicker epidermis than females (p < 0.05).

4548,"The relationship between dose heterogeneity ('hot' spots) and complications following high-dose rate brachytherapy Purpose: It is generally believed that 'hot' spots should be avoided in radiotherapy because they lead to complications. Dose homogeneity within the target volume is much more difficult to achieve during brachytherapy than during external beam irradiation, and implants are rarely geometrically perfect. To not underdose some parts of the target volume, therefore, it may be necessary to accept hot spots in other parts of the target volumes, but it is not at all clear from the literature how much dose heterogeneity should be considered excessive. We undertook this study in an effort to determine just how high a dose to a hot spot is associated with clinically significant complications. Methods and Materials: We studied 40 patients treated by high- dose rate brachytherapy with or without external irradiation. For each patient, we calculated the minimum dose to the 'hottest' 1 cubic centimeter (cc) volume (Dmax1) and, for 18 patients, the minimum dose to the hottest 10 cc volume (Dmax10) as well. Result(s): Considerable dose heterogeneity existed within the target volume. The Dmax1 ranged from 150-2000% (median 320%) of the minimum target dose (MTD). The median MTD/fraction was 2.50 Gy (range 1.50-25.00), and the median Dmax1/fraction was 10.00 Gy (range 3.75-150.00). The median Dmax1 from the entire course of brachytherapy was 75.00 Gy (range 25.00-550.00). Adding the doses from planned external irradiation, plus any prior irradiation to the same area, the median total Dmax1 was 112.50 Gy (range 30.00-580.00), yet the incidence of complications, even among those in the highest quartile of this dose range, was not greater than the lowest quartile. The total median Dmax10 was 85.00 Gy (range 32.00-130.00), but the incidence of complications was, again, similar whether the dose was in the lower or the upper half of this range (32.00-85.00 Gy, or 86.00-130.00 Gy, respectively). Conclusion(s): We had expected to find that the patients with the highest Dmax1 and/or Dmax10 would be the ones most likely to suffer complications, but the results did not support this hypothesis. Thus, dose heterogeneity, within the scope of our study, turned out to be rather unimportant with regard to complications. This finding contradicts the conventional wisdom and suggests that concerns about hot spots need not preclude optimization to ensure adequate dosage to all parts of the target volume.",Excluded

This study sought to determine if the findings can be expanded to obese patients. Method(s): Fifty obese patients (>100 kg) referred for MPI underwent stress-rest or rest-stress studies with a half dose of Tc-99m sestamibi in a 1-day protocol using OSEM-RR processing. Image quality and clinical results were compared with matched patients (by age, sex, weight, presence/probability of coronary artery disease) evaluated with standard ""full-dose"" Tc-99m sestamibi, mostly in a 2-day protocol. Dose activities were adjusted individually by weight. Result(s): Mean Tc-99m activity was 33.4 +/- 13.9 mCi in the half-dose group and 60 +/- 10 mCi in the full-dose group (P <.0001). Respective mean effective doses per study were 10 +/- 4 and 18 +/- 3 mSv (P <.0001). Overall image quality was good-to-excellent in 94% of the half-dose group and 80% of the full-dose group (P <.045). There was no between-group difference in rate or size of ischemia or infarction, except for stress left ventricular ejection fraction.

Median age at RT was 76 years (range 30-92), including 27 patients (41%) aged >= 80 years. Median RT dose was 58.05 Gy (range 37.5-67.5), all delivered in 15 daily fractions. Thirty-two patients received proton RT and 34 patients received photon RT., RESULTS: Median follow-up times from diagnosis and RT start were 21 months and 14 months, respectively. In total, five patients (7.6%) developed local failure. The 2-year outcomes were 84% local control (LC) and 58% OS. Among the 51 patients treated with definitive intent, the 2-year LC rate was 93% and the OS rate was 62%. On multivariate analysis for LC, older age was associated with a lower risk of local failure [hazard ratio (HR) 0.91; p = 0.02], while prior surgery (HR 16.5; p = 0.04) and macrovascular invasion (HR 123.93; p = 0.02) were independently associated with an increased risk of local failure. On multivariate analysis for OS, female sex (HR 0.33; p = 0.001) and prior chemotherapy (HR 0.38; p = 0.003) remained significantly associated with OS. On multivariate analysis for OS, compared with photon RT, there was a trend towards improved survival with proton RT (HR 0.50; p = 0.05). The rate of overall grade 3 + toxicity was 11%.

4514,"Preoperative Prediction of Pathologic Response to Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy in Patients With Esophageal Cancer Using 18F-FDG PET/CT and DW-MRI: A Prospective Multicenter Study Purpose: Accurate preoperative prediction of pathologic response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) in patients with esophageal cancer could enable omission of esophagectomy in patients with a pathologic complete response (pCR). This study aimed to evaluate the individual and combined value of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography with integrated computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) during and after nCRT to predict pathologic response in patients with esophageal cancer. Methods and Materials: In this multicenter prospective study, patients scheduled to receive nCRT followed by esophagectomy for esophageal cancer underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT and DW-MRI scanning before the start of nCRT, during nCRT, and before esophagectomy. Response to nCRT was based on histopathologic evaluation of the resection specimen. Relative changes in 18F-FDG PET/CT and DW-MRI parameters were compared between patients with pCR and non-pCR groups. Multivariable ridge regression analyses with bootstrapped c-indices were performed to evaluate the individual and combined value of 18F-FDG PET/CT and DW-MRI. Result(s): pCR was found in 26.1% of 69 patients. Relative changes in 18F-FDG PET/CT parameters after nCRT (DELTA standardized uptake value [SUV]mean,post P = .016, and DELTA total lesion glycolysis post P = .024), as well as changes in DW-MRI parameters during nCRT (DELTA apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC]during P = .008) were significantly different between pCR and non-pCR. A c-statistic of 0.84 was obtained for a model with DELTAADCduring, DELTASUVmean,post, and histology in classifying patients as pCR (versus 0.82 for DELTAADCduring and 0.79 for DELTASUVmean,post alone). Conclusion(s): Changes on 18F-FDG PET/CT after nCRT and early changes on DW-MRI during nCRT can help identify pCR to nCRT in esophageal cancer. Moreover, 18F-FDG PET/CT and DW-MRI might be of complementary value in the assessment of pCR.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
4162,"Altered proliferation and differentiation of human epidermis in cases of skin fibrosis after radiotherapy PURPOSE: To characterize, at the histopathologic and molecular levels, the irradiated epidermis in cases of human skin fibrosis induced by radiotherapy., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Surgical samples were obtained from 6 patients who had developed cutaneous fibronecrotic lesions from 7 months to 27 years after irradiation. The proliferation and differentiation status of the irradiated epidermis was characterized with specific markers using immunohistochemical methods., RESULTS: All samples presented with hyperplasia of the epidermis associated with local inflammation. The scar epidermis exhibited an increased expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, which revealed hyperproliferation of keratinocytes. Furthermore, an abnormal differentiation was found, characterized by the expression of K6 and K16, and by alterations in protein amounts and localization of cytokeratins, involucrin, and transforming growth factor-beta1., CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that late damage of irradiated skin is not only characterized by fibrosis in the dermis but also by hyperplasia in the epidermis.

Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the association between AKI and repeated ICM administrations. A similar supplementary analysis was performed including both ICM and GBCA. RESULT(S): When ICM was only considered ignoring GBCA, among 300 patients, 207 patients received a single dose of ICM, 58 had repeated doses within 4 hours (0-4-hour group), and 35 patients had repeated doses between 4 to 48 hours (4-48-hour group). Most patients (> 95%) had a baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of >= 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. AKI occurred in 7.2%, 13.8%, and 8.6% of patients in the single-dose, 0-4-hour, and 4-48-hour groups, respectively. In the 0-4-hour and 4-48-hour groups, additional exposure to ICM was not associated with AKI after adjusting for comorbidities and nephrotoxic drugs (all p values > 0.05). CONCLUSION(S): Repeated intravascular administrations of ICM within a short interval did not increase the risk of AKI in our study patients suspected of acute stroke with a baseline eGFR of >= 30 mL/min/1.73 m2.Copyright © 2021 The Korean Society of Radiology.",Excluded
4272,"Effects of a compound vitamin B mixture in combination with GeneTime R on radiation-induced oral mucositis OBJECTIVE: Both compound vitamin B mixtures and GeneTime R have been used in treatment of oral inflammation. This study aimed to assess the therapeutic effects of a compound vitamin B mixture combined with GeneTime R on radiation-induced oral mucositis., METHODS: A total of 100 patients with radiation-induced oral mucositis were randomly divided into a control group (vitamin B alone; n = 50 patients) and an observation group (vitamin B plus GeneTime R, n = 50 patients). Clinical outcomes were compared between the two groups for the following 3 weeks., RESULTS: The observation group had a significantly greater number of grade 0-I patients and significantly fewer grade II-IV patients than the control group. Among patients in the observation group, a significantly greater number of ulcers healed within 1-2 weeks, compared with those in patients in the control group. Significantly fewer ulcers healed among patients in the observation group at 3 weeks; notably, there were fewer ulcers to heal in the observation group, compared with the control group., CONCLUSIONS: Use of a compound vitamin B mixture combined with GeneTime R exerted obvious therapeutic effects on radiation-induced oral mucositis and markedly shortened ulcer healing time. Therefore, this strategy may be useful in clinical applications.",Excluded
4691,"Phase II trial of induction gemcitabine and carboplatin followed by conformal thoracic radiation to 74 Gy with weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin in unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer Introduction: The survival for patients with locally advanced, unresectable non-small cell lung cancer receiving standard of care concomitant chemoradiation remains disappointingly low. A reduction in both local and distant recurrence is needed to improve patients' outcome. Performing molecular studies on serially collected tumor specimens may result in a better selection of therapeutic options. Method(s): We conducted a phase II single-institution trial of two cycles of induction chemotherapy with gemcitabine and carboplatin followed by high-dose conformal radiation concomitant with weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin in 39 patients. The trial required a dedicated tumor biopsy before treatment initiation. In addition, tumor biopsies were requested, if safely feasible, before initiation of chemoradiation and 2 months after completion all therapy. Result(s): Induction chemotherapy was well tolerated, and 38 patients proceeded with chemoradiation. The mean delivered radiation dose was 70.2 Gy, 23 patients received the full dose of 74 Gy, and 19 patients completed all treatment on schedule without dose reductions or delays. Median overall and progression-free survivals were 22.7 and 14.3 months, respectively. A total of 82 procedures, including 46 transthoracic core needle biopsies, were performed. Thirteen patients had all three serial tumor biopsies. Three of these procedures resulted in complications that required an intervention; all for the treatment of a biopsy-induced pneumothorax. Conclusion(s): We conclude that induction gemcitabine/carboplatin followed by concurrent paclitaxel/carboplatin with conformal radiation to 74 Gy is safe and tolerable with promising efficacy. We demonstrated that dedicated and serial tumor collections are safe, feasible, and acceptable for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

4566,"Model-based iterative reconstruction and adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction techniques in abdominal CT: comparison of image quality in the detection of colorectal liver metastases PURPOSE: To prospectively evaluate dose reduction and image quality characteristics of abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scans reconstructed with model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) compared with adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) in oncology patients with colorectal liver metastases., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study complied with HIPAA guidelines and was approved by the ethics committee of the institutional review board. All patients gave written informed consent. Fifty-one patients with colorectal liver metastases underwent body CT (thorax and abdomen) with a 64-section multidetector unit. With a radiation dose reduction by 2.36 mGy compared to standard of care CT with ASIR 50% (radiation dose, 7.54 mGy), MBIR can provide diagnostically acceptable CT scans without compromising image quality. Two radiologists independently assessed randomized images in a blinded manner. Imaging sets were compared for lesion detection, lesion conspicuity, overall image quality, and signal-to-noise ratio with a paired sample t test. Inter- and intraobserver agreement was assessed with the Cohen kappa., RESULTS: The mean volume CT dose index was 5.18 mGy +/- 0.76, mean dose-length product 374 mGy . cm +/- 63.47, mean effective diameter 29.38 cm +/- 3.46, and mean size-specific dose estimate 6.52 mGy +/- 0.73. In small liver lesions (<10 mm), detection and conspicuity were significantly higher with MBIR than with ASIR for both right (t = 3.245, P = .004 and t = 2.696, P = .013, respectively) and left (t = 2.390, P = .038 and t = 2.283, P = .046) liver lobes. Subjective image noise (t = 4.506, P < .001), artifacts (t = 3.479, P = .001), and diagnostic confidence (t = 2.643, P = .011) were significantly better with MBIR than with ASIR., CONCLUSION: MBIR performed better than ASIR 50% at providing diagnostically acceptable CT scans without compromising image quality and in the detection of colorectal liver metastases.

4762,"Noninvasive evaluation of radiation-enhanced glioma cells invasiveness by ultra-high-field (1)H-MRS in vitro INTRODUCTION: Glioma is the most common type of the primary CNS tumor. Radiotherapy is an important treatment measure after surgery. However, its highly invasive character is the main reason of postoperative recurrence. The aim of the study was to probe the correlation between the invasion ability and the metabolite characteristics of glioma cells at the cellular level after irradiation by using 14.7T high-resolution nuclear proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS)., METHODS: To determine the matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) activity and metabolite ratios of glioma cells after irradiation with different doses of X-rays, U87 and C6 glioma cells were exposed to X-ray irradiation of 0, 1, 5, 10, and 15Gy. After 20h, the perchloric acid (PCA) extraction method was used to evaluate water-soluble metabolites [choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), and N-acetylaspartate (NAA)], and (1)H-MRS patterns and changes in metabolite ratios were observed in vitro by 14.7T high resolution (1)H-MRS. Matrigel invasion assays and gelatin zymography were performed to test the invasion ability of U87 and C6 glioma cells., RESULTS: Good MR spectra were obtained from PCA method extracts of U87 and C6 glioma cells. Both radiation-induced MMP-2 activity and the Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA ratios increased after irradiation, and their increase occurred in a dose-dependent manner. The MMP-2 activity and the Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA ratios of glioma cells increased after irradiation up to 10Gy and decreased thereafter. In particular, the Cho/NAA ratio of U87 cells increased from 3.55+/-0.06 (0Gy) to 9.13+/-0.30 (10Gy) and then declined to 5.94+/-0.15 (15Gy). Furthermore, the invasion ability of glioma cells had a strong positive correlation with the Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA ratios. Both the Cho/Cr ratio and the Cho/NAA ratio of U87 glioma cells were highly positively correlated with the number of invading cells in the Matrigel invasion assay. The Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) values of U87 cells were 0.89 (Cho/Cr ratio versus invasion ability) and 0.91 (Cho/NAA ratio versus invasion ability) (P<0.01). C6 cells exhibited similar changes to those of U87 cells., CONCLUSIONS: In vitro high-resolution (1)H-MRS is useful for detecting glioma invasiveness at the cellular level. Copyright © 2016.

4646,"Predicting late effects of pelvic radiotherapy: is there a better approach? PURPOSE: Significant chronic symptoms following pelvic radiotherapy occur more frequently than commonly realized. Predictive factors for the development of late symptoms are poorly defined. Moderate sustained acute (cumulative) toxicity might predict severe late effects better than peak reaction., METHODS AND MATERIALS: To determine prospectively whether peak or cumulative gastrointestinal (GI) acute symptoms better predict late symptoms in patients receiving pelvic radiotherapy. Symptom scores were measured weekly from the start of radiotherapy, and at 1 year using the Modified Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire-Bowel subset. The possible prognostic impact of patient-related factors was explored., RESULTS: Three hundred and eight patients were recruited. 100 were excluded due to lack of follow-up data at one year resulting from death, too ill, stoma, relapsed, non-response or withdrawal. A further 15 were excluded for incomplete data, leaving 193 patients with evaluable data. Of these, 28 had GI, 101 urological, and 64 gynecological cancers. Patients' median age was 65 years (range, 23-82), and they were treated with median 60 Gy dose for a median of 6 weeks. Univariate analysis revealed a significant association between cumulative acute symptom scores and scores at 1 year (p < 0.001), which was dose-independent (p < 0.001). Acute peak and 1-year scores were not associated (p = 0.431). The correlation coefficient between cumulative acute symptoms and symptoms at 1 year was 0.367 and for peak acute symptoms was weaker at 0.057. Patients with an abnormal body mass index and current smokers were more likely to experience worse symptoms at 1 year., CONCLUSION: Cumulative acute symptoms are more predictive of late symptoms than peak acute changes in score. This association is independent of the radiotherapy dose delivered and is suggestive of a consequential late effect. Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
4680,"Individualized dosimetry of kidney and bone marrow in patients undergoing 177Lu-DOTA-octreotate treatment The organs at risk in radionuclide therapy with 177Lu-octreotate are the bone marrow and the kidneys. The primary aim of this study was to develop an individualized dosimetry protocol for the bone marrow. The secondary aim was to identify those patients, undergoing fractionated therapy with 7.4 GBq/cycle, who first reached an accumulated dose of either 2 Gy to the bone marrow or 23 Gy to the kidneys. Method(s): Two hundred patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors with high somatostatin receptor expression were included. After the administration of 7.4 GBq of 177Lu-octreotate, blood samples were drawn 6 times within the first 24 h. In 50 patients, additional blood samples were obtained at 96 and 168 h. Moreover, urine was collected from 30 patients during the first 24 h. Planar whole-body and SPECT/CT images over the abdomen were acquired at 24, 96, and 168 h after the infusion. Calculation of the absorbed radiation dose to the bone marrow was based on blood and urinary activity curves combined with organ-based analysis of the whole-body images. The absorbed dose to the kidney was calculated from the pharmacokinetic data obtained from SPECT/CT. Result(s): For a single cycle of 7.4 GBq, the absorbed dose to the bone marrow and the kidney ranged from 0.05 to 0.4 Gy and from 2 to 10 Gy, respectively. In 197 of 200 patients, the kidneys accumulated an absorbed dose of 23 Gy before the bone marrow reached 2 Gy. Between 2 and 10 cycles of 177Lu-octreotate could be administered before the upper dose limit for the individual patient was reached. Conclusion(s): A method based on repeated whole-body imaging in combination with blood and urinary activity data over time was developed to determine the absorbed dose to the bone marrow. The dose-limiting organ was the kidney in 197 of 200 patients. In 50% of the patients, more than 4 cycles of 7.4 GBq of 177Lu-octreotate could be administered, whereas 20% of the subjects were treated with fewer than 4 cycles. Individualized absorbed dose calculation is essential to optimize the therapy. Copyright © 2013 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Inc.",Excluded
3793,"Diels-alder reaction for tumor pretargeting: In vivo chemistry can boost tumor radiation dose compared with directly labeled antibody Current pretargeting systems use noncovalent biologic interactions, which are prone to immunogenicity. We previously developed a novel approach based on the bioorthogonal reaction between a radiolabeled tetrazine and an antibody-conjugated trans-cyclooctene (TCO). However, the tumor-to-blood ratio was low due to reaction with freely circulating antibody-TCO. Method(s): Here we developed 2 tetrazine-functionalized clearing agents that enable rapid reaction with and removal of a TCO-tagged antibody (CC49) from blood. Next, we incorporated this approach into an optimized pretargeting protocol in LS174T-bearing mice. Then we compared the pretargeted 177Lu-labeled tetrazine with 177Lu-labeled CC49. The biodistribution data were used for mouse and human dosimetry calculations. Result(s): The use of a clearing agent led to a doubling of the tetrazine tumor uptake and a 125-fold improvement of the tumor-to-blood ratio at 3 h after tetrazine injection. Mouse dosimetry suggested that this should allow for an 8-fold higher tumor dose than is possible with nonpretargeted radioimmunotherapy. Also, humans treated with CC49-TCO-pretargeted 177Lu-tetrazine would receive a dose to nontarget tissues 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower than with directly labeled CC49. Conclusion(s): The in vivo performance of chemical pretargeting falls within the range of results obtained for the clinically validated pretargeting approaches in mice, with the advantage of potentially allowing for fractionated radiotherapy as a result of a lower likelihood of immunogenicity. These findings demonstrate that biologic pretargeting concepts can be translated to rapid bioorthogonal chemical approaches with retained potential. © 2013 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Inc.",Excluded
3736,"Low-dose ultraviolet exposure early in development can lead to widespread melanoma in the opossum model Suckling young of opossums (Monodelphis domestica) were exposed to ultraviolet radiation (UVR, predominantly UVB: 290-320 nm) in part to determine an optimal protocol for induction and progression of melanoma in this species. In all, 620 litters were introduced to one of seven protocols. The lowest dose (175 J/m2) administered three times a week for almost three weeks led to the highest incidence of melanotic lesions with melanoma potential (8.1%) among young (5-month-old) adults. Among 101 much older animals (> 17 months at necropsy), 43% showed metastatic melanoma to the lymph nodes and almost one-third of these had progressed to widespread dissemination. Three of the latter animals, from a total of 13 obtained so far, were selected for detailed histological examination of disseminated disease. At necropsy, all three showed widespread metastases beyond the lymph nodes to the spleen, lungs, and other distant sites. Histological changes typical of malignant melanoma included junctional activity, mitotic figures, and nerve and vessel invasion. This novel finding leads us to conclude that UVR can act as a complete carcinogen for progression to widely disseminated disease and that exposure of sucklings can lead, in old age, to widespread metastatic melanoma in this model. The results are thus not inconsistent with the view that, in humans, early exposure to sunlight might act as an initiating factor in a later progression to malignant melanoma.",Excluded
4601,"Single-balloon versus double-balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures Twenty-eight patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCF) were treated with single-balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty (Group A), and 40 patients were treated with double-balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty (Group B). Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score, vertebral height, and kyphotic angle (KA) were evaluated pre-operatively, post-operatively (3 days after surgery) and at final follow-up. Operative time, X-ray exposure frequency and costs were recorded. The mean operative time and X-ray exposure frequency in Group A were greater than in Group B (p < 0.05). Significant improvement of the VAS score was noted in each group, and remained unchanged at final follow-up. Mean increases of anterior and middle height of the fractured vertebral body were 5.14 mm and 4.14 mm in Group A, respectively, and 6.22 mm and 5.06 mm in Group B, respectively, and the differences between the groups were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Mean reduction of KA was 6.9degree in Group A and 8.8degree in Group B, which was statistically significant (p < 0.05). No statistically significant difference was observed in terms of cement leakage between groups. The mean cost of Group A (US$4202) was significantly less than that of Group B (US$6220) (p < 0.001). Single-balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty is a safe and cost-effective surgical method for the treatment of OVCF. It can achieve pain relief comparable with double-balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty. However, double-balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty is more efficacious in terms of the restoration of vertebral height and reduction of KA, and the operative time and X-ray exposure frequency are lower.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

4355,"Association between trunk and leg fat and incidence of diabetes Background: General obesity defined by body mass index (BMI) is a major risk factor of diabetes mellitus (DM). Although body fat distribution is also considered to be a predictor of DM, only a few longitudinal studies have examined the association between DM risk and body composition, estimated directly using such methods as DEXA, in particular with reference to Asian populations who have a higher prevalence of DM at lower BMI levels compared with CaucAsians. Objective(s): To determine whether fat distribution is associated with DM incidence, independently of BMI, in an elderly Japanese population. Method(s): We analyzed 1,550 subjects without DM (472 men and 1,078 women, average age of 65.3 years) in the Adult Health Study, consisting of atomic bomb survivors and their controls, whose body composition was measured using DEXA during the period 1994-96. Fat-mass percentages for the trunk and legs were calculated by dividing each of the specific body partTMs fat mass by total soft tissue mass. DM was defined as glucose 126mg/dl fasting or 200mg/dl nonfasting, or physician-diagnosed DM, or the use of medication for DM. We followed-up through the end of 2011. Result(s): During a mean follow-up period of 11.4 years, 85 men and 110 women developed DM. Almost 20% of men and 28% of women were overweight/obese (BMI25kg/m2) at baseline. After multivariate analysis with adjustment made for age, metabolic syndrome risk factors other than central obesity, radiation dose, and smoking and alcohol consumption status, only overweight/obese women had a significant association with DM incidence compared with non-obese women (relative risk [RR] 1.52; 95% CI 1.01-2.27). Percentages of trunk fat and leg fat were associated with incidence of DM, independently of each other, after adjustment for age, BMI, and other risk factors. Increased percentage of trunk fat was a significant risk factor for incidence of DM; the RR for 1% increase in trunk fat were 1.13 (95% CI 1.06-1.20) in men and 1.08 (95% CI 1.02-1.14) in women, whereas, leg fat had protective effects regarding incidence of DM (men RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.71-0.96, women RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.79-0.95, for 1% increase in leg fat). These significant associations were observed for non-obese subjects. Conclusion(s): Trunk and leg fat were associated with incidence of DM, independently of each other. In addition to evaluation of general and abdominal obesity, the assessment of body fat distribution might also be useful in the prevention of DM.",Included
4285,"Clinical and molecular recursive partitioning analysis of high-grade glioma treated with IMRT Introduction: Despite multimodal treatment for high-grade gliomas, prognosis remains grim. Prior Radiation Therapy Oncology Group-Recursive Partitioning Analysis (RTOG-RPA) reports indicate based on pretreatment and treatment-related factors, a subset of patients experience a significantly improved survival. Since the development of the RTOG-RPA, high-grade gliomas have seen the widespread introduction of temozolomide and tumor oncogenetics. Here we aimed to determine whether the RTOG-RPA retained prognostic significance in the context of modern treatment, as well as generate an updated RPA incorporating both clinical and genetic variables. Method(s): Patients with histologically proven glioblastoma, gliosarcoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, and anaplastic oligodendroglioma treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) between 2004 and 2017 were reviewed. The primary endpoint was overall survival from date of diagnosis. Primary analysis compared actual survival rates to that expected of corresponding RTOG-RPA class. Secondary analysis utilized the rpart function to recursively partition overall survival by numerous clinical and genetic pretreatment and treatment-related variables. A tertiary analysis recursively partitioned a subset of patients in which the status of all genetic markers were known. Result(s): We identified 878 patients with histologically proven high-grade glioma treated with IMRT and 291 patients in our genetic subset. Median overall survival for the entire cohort was 14.2 months (95% confidence interval, 13.1-15.3). Applying the RTOG-RPA to our cohort validated the relative prognostic ordering of the survival classes except class II. Generating our new RPA created 7 significantly different survival classes (P<0.001, chi 2 =584) with median survival ranging from 96.4 to 2.9 months based on age, histology, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation status, radiation fractions, tumor location, radiation dose, temozolomide status, and resection status. Our second RPA of our genetic subset generated 5 significantly different survival classes (P<0.001, chi 2 =166) with survival ranging from 65.3 to 5.6 months based on age, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutation status, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation status, neurological functional classification, hospitalization during IMRT, temozolomide status, and Karnofsky performance status. Conclusion(s): The RTOG-RPA retains partial prognostic significance, however, should be updated to reflect recent advancements. This series represents a large RPA analyzing both clinical and genetic factors and generated 7 distinct survival classes. Further assessment of patients with fully available genetic markers generated 5 distinct survival classes. These survival classifications need to be validated by a prospective data set and compared against the RTOG-RPA to determine whether they provide improved prognostic power.© Copyright 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

4579,"Radiosurgery of vestibular schwannoma: prognostic factors for hearing outcome using 3D-constructive interference in steady state (3D-CISS) Purpose: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is an effective treatment for vestibular schwannoma (VS). Three-dimensional (3D) constructive interference in steady state (CISS) is the preferred magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence for evaluating signal changes in the inner ear endolymph. Previous studies demonstrated a correlation between pretreatment cochlear signal intensity in 3D-CISS and posttherapeutic hearing outcomes. The purpose of our study was to compare 3D-CISS sequences before and after primary SRS of unilateral VSs to evaluate the effect of radiosurgery on the 3D-CISS signal intensities of cochlea and sacculus/utriculus. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed 47 patients with unilateral VS treated with SRS. The neuroradiological MRI datasets were analysed to evaluate the signal intensity of the inner ear structure, tumour size, Koos grade, tumour volume, and infiltration of the cochlear aperture before therapy and at follow-up. The differences in these signal intensities before SRS and at follow-up were correlated with clinical symptoms, cochlear radiation dose, tumour volume and infiltration of the cochlear aperture. Result(s): No differences were found between signal intensities in cochlea and utriculus/sacculus before and after SRS and no correlation with clinical symptoms, cochlear radiation dose, tumour volume, Koos grade or infiltration of the cochlear aperture (all p> 0.05). Conclusion(s): Our study supports the theory of a complex interaction causing alteration of the endolymph protein concentration and not a direct dependency on the SRS. Use of modern dosing schemes will have a positive impact on clinical outcome with preservation of hearing in patients with VS.Copyright © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded

In contrast to upward trends observed for older men and women (i.e., over 40), downward trends were noted for younger age groups. The risk of dying from skin melanoma appears to have peaked for male cohorts born during the 1950s and for female cohorts born during the 1930s. Assuming no future environmental or lifestyle changes, the upward trend in age-adjusted mortality rates, which averaged 2 to 3% per annum since 1950, is projected to discontinue and bend downward by the second decade of the 21st century. Skin melanoma incidence data, which was limited to a series of 12 years (1973-84) and inadequate for cohort analyses, were included to demonstrate that trends in age-specific rates were comparable with those observed for mortality during the overlapping time period. Incidence trends according to anatomical site are also described. These results indicate that baseline data necessary for assessing the potential effects on this disease from future depletions of the ozone layer, and predicted increases of solar ultra-violet radiation exposure, would be improved with the inclusion of cohort data and age-specific trend analyses.",Excluded

Fourteen patients underwent combined 3-port pars plana vitrectomy and TSS PC-IOL implantation (vitrectomy group), and 104 patients underwent TSS PC-IOL implantation only (nonvitrectomy group). All surgeries were performed under the same coaxial illuminated microscope. All diagnoses were confirmed through careful fundus examination and fluorescein angiography (FA)., RESULTS: Diagnoses of retinal phototoxic maculopathy were established in 10 (8.47%) of 118 TSS PC-IOL implantation cases. Phototoxic maculopathy occurred more frequently in the vitrectomy group than in the nonvitrectomy group (6/14 versus 4/104, respectively; P < 0.001, chi-square = 24.21). Affected patients reported decreased vision and were found to have coarse alterations of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). In 5 of the phototoxic maculopathy cases (50%), the visual acuity was 20/200 or worse., CONCLUSION: Operating microscope light-induced retinal phototoxic maculopathy can occur more frequently after TSS PC-IOL implantation than after casual cataract surgery, especially when TSS PC-IOL is combined with vitrectomy surgery. Surgeons should take precautions to prevent retinal phototoxicity after TSS PC-IOL implantation and vitrectomy.",Excluded
4848,"YWHAZ amplification/overexpression defines aggressive bladder cancer and contributes to chemo-/radio-resistance by suppressing caspase-mediated apoptosis The objective of this study was to characterize the oncogenic actions of a recently identified cancer-associated gene YWHAZ (also named as 14-3-3 zeta/delta) in urothelial carcinomas of the urinary bladder (UCUB). A genome-wide study revealed YWHAZ to be involved in the amplicon at 8q22.3, and its genetic amplification was detected predominantly in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). Immunohistochemical staining confirmed the association of YWHAZ overexpression with higher tumor stages, lymph node/vascular invasion, and mitotic activity. Univariate and multivariate analyses further indicated the prognostic potential of YWHAZ for more aggressive cancer types. Both gene set enrichment analysis and STRING network studies suggested involvement of YWHAZ in regulating caspase-mediated apoptosis. Ectopic expression of YWHAZ in bladder cells with low endogenous YWHAZ levels boosted cell resistance to doxorubicin and cisplatin, as well as to ionizing radiation. Conversely, YWHAZ-knockdown using specific shRNA in cells with high endogenous YWHAZ levels diminished survival activity, suppressing cell growth and increasing cell death. Our findings confirm the essential role played by YWHAZ in sustaining cell proliferation during chemo/radiotherapy. Treatments based on anti-YWHAZ strategies may thus be beneficial for UCUB patients overexpressing YWHAZ. © 2019 The Authors.

We defined 16 oncology-specific triggers using diagnosis and procedure codes. To distinguish treatment-related complications from comorbidities, we required a logical and temporal relationship between a treatment and the associated trigger. We tabulated the prevalence of triggers by cancer type and metastatic status during 1-year of follow-up, and examined cancer trigger risk factors., RESULTS: Cancer-specific trigger events affected 19% of patients over the initial treatment year. The trigger burden varied by disease and metastatic status, from 6% of patients with nonmetastatic prostate cancer to 41% and 50% of those with metastatic colorectal and lung cancers, respectively. The most prevalent triggers were abnormal serum bicarbonate, blood transfusion, non-contrast chest CT scan following radiation therapy, and hypoxemia. Among patients with metastatic disease, 10% had one trigger event and 29% had two or more. Triggers were more common among older patients, women, non-whites, patients with low family incomes, and those without a college education., CONCLUSIONS: Oncology-specific triggers offer a promising method for identifying potential patient safety events among patients across cancer care settings.

3920,"Transanal minimally-invasive surgery for treating patients with regressed rectal cancer after preoperative chemoradiotherapy Purpose: Although the standard treatment for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer managed by preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is a radical resection, local excisions are used in highly-selective cases. Recently, transanal minimally-invasive surgery (TAMIS) has emerged as a feasible technique for local excision of midrectal lesions. We assess the feasibility of using TAMIS to treat patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who showed good response to CRT. Method(s): From October 2010 to June 2013, 35 consecutive patients with rectal cancer managed by using preoperative CRT underwent TAMIS. After a single-incision laparoscopic surgery port had been introduced into the anal canal, a fullthickness local excision with conventional laparoscopic instruments was performed. We retrospectively reviewed a prospectively collected database of these cases. Result(s): Of the 35 patients analyzed, 18 showed pathologic complete responses and 17 had residual lesions (2 ypTis, 4 ypT1, 9 ypT2, and 2 ypT3); 34 (97.1%) showed clear deep, lateral margins. The median distance of lesions from the anal verge was 5 cm. All procedures were completed laparoscopically, and the median operating time was 84 minutes. No intraoperative events or morbidities were seen in any of the patients, except one with wound dehiscence, who was treated conservatively. The median postoperative hospital stay and follow-up period were 4 days and 36 months, respectively. During the study period, no patients died, but 5 (14.3%) experienced recurrence, including one recurrence at the TAMIS site. Conclusion(s): TAMIS seems to be a feasible, safe modality for treating patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who show good response to preoperative CRT.Copyright © 2017 The Korean Society of Coloproctology.",Excluded
4881,"A retrospective review of pain control by a two-step irradiance schedule during topical ALA-photodynamic therapy of non-melanoma skin cancer Background and Objective Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with topical delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) of non-melanoma skin cancers is often associated with treatment-limiting pain. A previous study on basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) at Roswell Park Cancer Institute evaluated a two-step irradiance scheme as a means of minimizing pain, preserving outcomes, and limiting treatment time. We used an initial low irradiance until 90% of the protoporphyrin IX was photobleached, followed by a high irradiance interval until the prescribed fluence was delivered. Success of this pilot investigation motivated integration of the protocol into routine practice. Here, we present a retrospective review of recent clinical experience in a broad patient population. Study Design/Materials and Methods This was a retrospective review of an existing dermatology database. Fourteen caucasion patients - nine men and five women, ages 18-80, with a total of 51 superficial and 73 nodular BCCs, and three Bowen's disease lesions - were included. ALA was applied to each lesion for approximately 4 hours. Lesions received an initial irradiance of 30-50 mW/cm2 for 20 J/cm2, followed by 150 mW/cm2 for a total fluence of 200-300 J/cm2. Pain was assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS). Clinical outcome was determined at 6-12 months. Results Median VAS scores were 1.0 for both irradiances. Five of 127 lesions required pain control with 1% xylocaine. Pain was strongly influenced by lesion location but not by lesion type, number, or size. Complete responses were achieved in 84.1% of BCCs, which compares favorably with reported results for single ALA-PDT treatments. Two of three Bowen's disease lesions showed a complete response. Complete responses for nodular BCCs were 37%, which are also within the range of reported outcomes. Conclusions A two-step irradiance protocol in ALA-PDT effectively minimizes pain, maintains excellent clinical outcomes in superficial lesions, and adds minimal treatment time. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
4395,"Efficacy of extracranial stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) added to standard treatment in patients with solid tumors (breast, prostate and non-small cell lung cancer) with up to 3 bone-only metastases: study protocol for a randomised phase III trial (STEREO-OS) BACKGROUND: Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) is an innovative modality based on high precision planning and delivery. Cancer with bone metastases and oligometastases are associated with an intermediate or good prognosis. We assume that prolonged survival rates would be achieved if both the primary tumor and metastases are controlled by local treatment. Our purpose is to demonstrate, via a multicenter randomized phase III trial, that local treatment of metastatic sites with curative intent with SBRT associated of systemic standard of care treatment would improve the progression-free survival in patients with solid tumor (breast, prostate and non-small cell lung cancer) with up to 3 bone-only metastases compared to patients who received systemic standard of care treatment alone., METHODS: This is an open-labeled randomized superiority multicenter phase III trial. Patients with up to 3 bone-only metastases will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio.between Arm A (Experimental group): Standard care of treatment & SBRT to all bone metastases, and Arm B (Control group): standard care of treatment. For patients receiving SBRT, radiotherapy dose and fractionation depends on the site of the bone metastasis and the proximity to critical normal structures. This study aims to accrue a total of 196 patients within 4 years. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival at 1 year, and secondary endpoints include Bone progression-free survival; Local control; Cancer-specific survival; Overall survival; Toxicity; Quality of life; Pain score analysis, Cost-utility analysis; Cost-effectiveness analysis and Budget impact analysis., DISCUSSION: The expected benefit for the patient in the experimental arm is a longer expectancy of life without skeletal recurrence and the discomfort, pain and drastic reduction of mobility and handicap that the lack of local control of bone metastases eventually inflicts., TRIALS REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03143322 Registered on May 8th 2017.

4666,"Natural radiation background in metropolitan Taipei A high-pressure ionization chamber was used to measure the natural background radiation in metropolitan Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C. during a period in 1987-1988. The average exposure rate was 27.55 x 10(-10) C kg-1 h-1 including cosmic radiation, but the radon contribution was excluded. Scintillation survey meter, gamma-ray spectroscopy for soil samples, in-situ measurement with a NaI(Tl) detector coupled to a portable multichannel analyzer, instrumental neutron activation analysis of rock samples, and even thermoluminescent dosimeters were used as complementary measuring devices. Areas of higher radiation background were detected. They are the radium-bearing Peitou stones, an unusual occurrence of uraniferous zone at Sanhsia, and uranium precipitation in the glassy olivine basalt in a tea field at Tachi. All these areas are located in suburban sites of Taipei. Three types of building in Taipei City were selected for radon detection.

4152,"Occupational radiation exposure to the surgeon Increased use of intraoperative fluoroscopy exposes the surgeon to significant amounts of radiation. The average yearly exposure of the public to ionizing radiation is 360 millirems (mrem), of which 300 mrem is from background radiation and 60 mrem from diagnostic radiographs. A chest radiograph exposes the patient to approximately 25 mrem and a hip radiograph to 500 mrem. A regular C-arm exposes the patient to approximately 1,200 to 4,000 mrem/min. The surgeon may receive exposure to the hands from the primary beam and to the rest of the body from scatter. Recommended yearly limits of radiation are 5,000 mrem to the torso and 50,000 mrem to the hands. Exposure to the hands may be higher than previously estimated, even from the mini C-arm. Potential decreases in radiation exposure can be accomplished by reduced exposure time; increased distance from the beam; increased shielding with gown, thyroid gland cover, gloves, and glasses; beam collimation; using the low-dose option; inverting the C-arm; and surgeon control of the C-arm.",Excluded
3783,"A Multiinstitutional Study on Wasted CT Scans for Over 60,000 Patients OBJECTIVE. Repeated imaging is an unnecessary source of patient radiation exposure, a detriment to patient satisfaction, and a waste of time and money. Although analysis of rates of repeated and rejected images is mandated in mammography and recommended in radiography, the available data on these rates for CT are limited. MATERIALS AND METHODS. In this retrospective study, an automated repeat-reject rate analysis algorithm was used to quantify repeat rates from 61,102 patient examinations obtained between 2015 and 2018. The algorithm used DICOM metadata to identify repeat acquisitions. We quantified rates for one academic site and one rural site. The method allows scanner-, technologist-, protocol-, and indication-specific rates to be determined. Positive predictive values and sensitivity were estimated for correctly identifying and classifying repeat acquisitions. Repeat rates were compared between sites to identify areas for targeted technologist training. RESULTS. Of 61,102 examinations, 4676 instances of repeat scanning contributed excess radiation dose to patients. Estimated helical overlap repeat rates were 1.4% (95% CI, 1.2-1.6%) for the rural site and 1.1% (95% CI, 1.0-1.2%) for the academic site. Significant differences in rates of repeat imaging required because of bolus tracking (11.6% vs 4.3%; p < 0.001) and helical extension (3.3% vs 1.8%; p < 0.001) were observed between sites. Positive predictive values ranged from 91% to 99% depending on the reason for repeat imaging and site location. Sensitivity of the algorithm was 92% (95% CI, 87-96%). Rates tended to be highest for emergent imaging procedures and exceeded 9% for certain protocols. CONCLUSION. Our multiinstitutional automated quantification of repeat rates for CT provided a useful metric for unnecessary radiation exposure and identification of technologists in need of training.",Excluded
4813,"Differentiation between recurrent gliomas and radiation necrosis using arterial spin labeling perfusion imaging Arterial spin labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion imaging has been proposed as an effective method to measure brain tumor perfusion. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the utility of this technique in the differentiation of recurrent gliomas from radiation necrosis. Twenty-one patients with surgically treated primary gliomas, including 16 cases of recurrent glioma and 5 of radiation necrosis were examined using 3.0T MR imaging (MRI). ASL and dynamic susceptibility contrast-weighted (DSC) perfusion MRI scans were performed. Maps of normalized cerebral blood flow (CBF) in ASL imaging and cerebral blood volume (CBV) in DSC imaging were computed and analyzed in the regions of interest. In cases of glioma recurrence, the normalized ASL-CBF ratio (4.45+/-2.72) was higher than that in cases of radiation injury (1.22+/-0.61) (P<0.01). The normalized DSC-relative CBV ratio was also significantly higher in glioma recurrence (3.38+/-2.08) than it was in radiation injury (1.09+/-0.55) (P<0.05). A close linear correlation was found between the ASL and DSC MRI techniques (linear regression coefficient, R=0.85; P=0.005) in the differentiation of recurrent glioma from radiation injury. The results indicate that ASL perfusion is an accurate method of distinguishing between glioma recurrence and radiation necrosis.Copyright © 2016, Spandidos Publications.

4381,"A new grading system for ototoxicity in adults Objective: This study aimed to propose an ototoxicity grading system sensitive to the effect of ototoxicity on specific daily life situations like speech intelligibility and the perception of ultra-high sounds and to test its feasibility compared to current criteria. Method(s): Pure tone averages (PTAs) for speech perception (1-2-4 kHz) and ultra-high frequencies (8-10-12.5 kHz) were incorporated. Threshold shift and hearing level posttreatment were taken into account. Criteria were tested on head and neck cancer patients treated with (chemo-)radiotherapy ([C]RT) and compared with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4 (CTCAEv4) and the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association criteria (ASHA). Result(s): Grades 1 and 2 were based on threshold shifts from baseline (in dB) and subjective complaints. Grades 3 and 4 were defined as treatment-induced hearing loss of >= 35 dB at PTA 1-2-4 kHz and >= 70 dB at PTA 1-2-4 kHz, respectively. In high-dose cisplatin CRT incidences by the new criteria, CTCAEv4 and ASHA were comparable (78%-88%). In RT and low-dose cisplatin CRT, incidences were 36% to 39% in the new criteria versus 22% to 53% in CTCAEv4 and ASHA. Conclusion(s): The new criteria show an increased sensitivity to ototoxicity compared to CTCAEv4 and ASHA and provide insight into the effect of hearing loss on certain daily life situations.

3719,"Concentrated adipose tissue infusion for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis: clinical and histological observations Purpose: Osteoarthritis (OA) is characterized by articular cartilage degeneration and subchondral bone sclerosis. OA can benefit of non-surgical treatments with collagenase-isolated stromal vascular fraction (SVF) or cultured-expanded mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs). To avoid high manipulation of the lipoaspirate needed to obtain ASCs and SVF, we investigated whether articular infusions of autologous concentrated adipose tissue are an effective treatment for knee OA patients. Method(s): The knee of 20 OA patients was intra-articularly injected with autologous concentrated adipose tissue, obtained after centrifugation of lipoaspirate. Patients' articular functionality and pain were evaluated by VAS and WOMAC scores at three, six and 18 months from infusion. The osteogenic and chondrogenic ability of ASCs contained in the injected adipose tissue was studied in in vitro primary osteoblast and chondrocyte cell cultures, also plated on 3D-bone scaffold. Knee articular biopsies of patients previously treated with adipose tissue were analyzed. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were performed to detect cell differentiation and tissue regeneration. Result(s): The treatment resulted safe, and all patients reported an improvement in terms of pain reduction and increase of function. According to the osteogenic or chondrogenic stimulation, ASCs expressed alkaline phosphatase or aggrecan, respectively. The presence of a layer of newly formed tissue was visualized by IHC staining and SEM. The biopsy of previously treated knee joints showed new tissue formation, starting from the bone side of the osteochondral lesion. Conclusion(s): Overall our data indicate that adipose tissue infusion stimulates tissue regeneration and might be considered a safe treatment for knee OA.Copyright © 2018, SICOT aisbl.",Excluded

This study compares the transbronchial route with augmented fluoroscopic bronchoscopy (AFB) and conventional transthoracic CT-guided methods for preoperative dye localization in thoracoscopic surgery., METHODS: Between April 2015 and March 2019, a total of 231 patients with small pulmonary lesions who received preoperative dye localization via AFB or percutaneous CT-guided technique were enrolled in the study. A propensity-matched analysis, incorporating preoperative variables, was used to compare localization and surgical outcomes between the two groups., RESULTS: After matching, a total of 90 patients in the AFB group (N = 30) and CT-guided group (N = 60) were selected for analysis. No significant difference was noted in the demographic data between both the groups. Dye localization was successfully performed in 29 patients (96.7%) and 57 patients (95%) with AFB and CT-guided method, respectively.

3732,"High ambient solar UV correlates with greater beta HPV seropositivity in New South Wales, Australia Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is highly prevalent worldwide and may have a role, with sun exposure, in causing cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Little is known about the relationship of UV exposure and seroprevalence of cutaneous HPVs in the general population. Method(s): Using multiplex serology, we estimated the seroprevalence of 23 beta and 7 gamma HPVs and 7 other antigens (mu HPV1, HPV63, nu HPV41, alpha HPV16; polyomaviruses HPyV7 and MCV; p53) in a population-based sample of 1,161 Australian 45 and Up Study participants with valid data from blood specimens collected from 2010 to 2012. We calculated prevalence ratios (PR) for the association of each antigen with residential ambient solar UV and other UV-related variables. Result(s): Seropositivity for at least one beta or gamma HPV was high at 88% (beta HPVs 74%, gamma HPVs 70%), and less in women than men [e.g., PR beta-2 HPV38 1/4 0.70; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.56-0.87; any gamma 1/4 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84-0.97]. A high ambient UV level in the 10 years before study enrollment was associated with elevated seroprevalence for genus beta (PRtertile3vs1 any beta 1/4 1.17; 95% CI, 1.07-1.28), and beta-1 to beta-3 species, but not for gamma HPVs. Other UV-related measures had less or no evidence of an association. Conclusion(s): Seroprevalence of cutaneous beta HPVs is higher with higher ambient UV exposure in the past 10 years. Impact: The observed association between ambient UV in the past 10 years and cutaneous HPVs supports further study of the possible joint role of solar UV and HPV in causing skin cancer.Copyright ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.",Excluded

The aim of this study is to summarize the factors related to survival of patients with brain metastases from NSCLC. Method(s): A total of 111 NSCLC patients with brain metastases (from September 1995-May 2004) were defined as symptomatic group (37 patients) and asymptomatic group (74 patients) according to central nervous system (CNS) symptoms. The patients in the symptomatic group were given whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT, DT 30-40 Gy/20 f) first, and then received cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The patients in the asymptomatic group were given cisplatin-based chemotherapy first, and then received WBRT. During the treatment, 49 patients received chemotherapy of BCNU or VM-26 irregularly. Result(s): The median survival time was 11 months. The 1- and 2-year survival rate was 40.79% and 13.26% respectively. The survival time was not significantly different between the symptomatic group and asymptomatic group. Median chemotherapy of asymptomatic group was 3 cycles (1-6 cycles) before WBRT. Those patients who received 3 or 4 cycles of chemotherapy before WBRT had better survival (P = 0.0188, P = 0.0035). The treatment of BCNU or VM-26 was a benefit factor for survival (P = 0.0219) in asymptomatic group. The hematologic toxicity of grade III or IV was not significantly different between the two groups (P>0.05). The number of brain metastasis (P = 0.000), extracranial metastasis (P = 0.022) and WHO performance status (P = 0.001) were independent prognostic factors. Conclusion(s): The patients with asymptomatic brain metastases receive 3-4 cycles of chemotherapy before WBRT may be reasonable.

The study on tennis player exposure took place at a tennis club in Valencia during the month of June 2011. With respect to the hiking group, the hikes studied took place in several mountainous areas of Spain and France from June to August 2011. Finally, the exposure suffered by ten runners while participating in a running circuit in the province of Valencia, from March to November 2011, was studied.

The median daily personal UV exposure for the hikers was 8.1 Standard Erythema Dose (SED) and for the tennis players 7.5 SED per day of training. The runners received a median of 14.6 SED while participating in the running circuit and about 2 SED per competition day. Median daily UV exposure of the hikers and tennis players exceeded 5 SED, which means that, in the case of non-sun-adapted skin type III and the non-use of sun protection, erythema may be induced in these subjects. However, the exposure suffered by the runners did not exceed the maximum personal exposure of 5 SED.

Several flavonoids are known to be good antioxidants. Therefore, the effect of orientin and vicenin on radiation-induced lipid peroxidation in vivo and their antioxidant activity in vitro were studied. Adult mice were injected intraperitoneally with 50 mug/kg of orientin or vicenin and exposed whole-body to 3 Gy of gamma radiation. Lipid peroxidation was measured in the liver 15 min to 8 h postirradiation. The antioxidant activity of orientin/vicenin (10-500 muM) was studied by measuring inhibition of hydroxyl radicals generated by the Fenton reaction (Fe3+-EDTA-ascorbic acid-H2O2) in vitro. The compounds were also tested for possible pro-oxidant and iron chelation activities at the above concentrations in the in vitro system. Orientin and vicenin provided almost equal protection against radiation-induced lipid peroxidation in mouse liver. Both compounds showed a significantly greater free radical-inhibiting activity in vitro than DMSO. Neither orientin nor vicenin showed any pro-oxidant activity at the concentrations tested. Both compounds inhibited free radical formation in the absence of EDTA. Free radical scavenging appears to be a likely mechanism of radiation protection by these flavonoids.

The aim of this study is to investigate dosimetric and clinical predictors for AE grade >= 2 in patients treated with accelerated radiotherapy for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)., PATIENTS AND METHODS: 66 NSCLC patients were included in the present analysis: 4 stage II, 44 stage IIIA and 18 stage IIIB. All patients received induction chemotherapy followed by dose differentiated accelerated radiotherapy (DART-bid). Depending on size (mean of three perpendicular diameters) tumors were binned in four dose groups: <2.5 cm 73.8 Gy, 2.5-4.5 cm 79.2 Gy, 4.5-6 cm 84.6 Gy, >6 cm 90 Gy. Patients were treated in 3D target splitting technique. In order to estimate the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP), two Lyman models and the cutoff-logistic regression model were fitted to the data with AE >= grade 2 as statistical endpoint. Inter-model comparison was performed with the corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc), which calculates the model's quality of fit (likelihood value) in relation to its complexity (i.e. number of variables in the model) corrected by the number of patients in the dataset. Toxicity was documented prospectively according to RTOG., RESULTS: The median follow up was 686 days (range 84-2921 days), 23/66 patients (35 %) experienced AE >= grade 2. The actuarial local control rates were 72.6 % and 59.4 % at 2 and 3 years, regional control was 91 % at both time points. The Lyman-MED model (D50 = 32.8 Gy, m = 0.48) and the cutoff dose model (Dc = 38 Gy) provide the most efficient fit to the current dataset. On multivariate analysis V38 (volume of the esophagus that receives 38 Gy or above, 95 %-CI 28.2-57.3) was the most significant predictor of AE >= grade 2 (HR = 1.05, CI 1.01-1.09, p = 0.007)., CONCLUSION: Following high-dose accelerated radiotherapy the rate of AE >= grade 2 is slightly lower than reported for concomitant radio-chemotherapy with the additional benefit of markedly increased loco-regional tumor control. In the current patient cohort the most significant predictor of AE was found to be V38. A second clinically useful parameter in treatment planning may be MED (mean esophageal dose).",Excluded
4602,"Utilization of stem cells in alginate for nucleus pulposus tissue engineering In a general view of anatomy, intervertebral disc is composed of three parts: annulus fibrosus (AF), nucleus pulposus (NP), and cartilage endplate (CEP). Recently, several types of stem cells were successfully isolated from these corresponding regions, but up to now, no research was performed about which kind of stem cells is the most efficient candidate for NP tissue engineering or for stem cell-based disc regeneration therapy. In this study, we compared the regenerative potentials of the above-mentioned three kinds of disc-derived stem cells with that of the classic bone marrow (BM)-mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in a rabbit disc degeneration model. By magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), X-ray, histology, etc. evaluations, we found that cartilage endplate-derived stem cells (CESCs) showed superior capacity compared with the annulus fibrosus-derived stem cells (AFSCs), nucleus pulposus-derived stem cells (NPSCs), and BM-MSCs (p<0.05); additionally, when comparing the CESC group with the normal control group, there existed no statistical difference in X-ray (p>0.05). Those results demonstrated that the CESC-seeded alginate construct performed the most powerful ability for NP regeneration, while AFSCs showed the most inferior potency, NPSCs and BM-MSCs had similar regenerative capacity and located in the middle. All in all, our study showed that CESCs might act as an efficient seed cell source for NP tissue engineering, which paved a new way for the biological solution of disc degeneration diseases. © Copyright 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2014.",Excluded

The quantity of epidermal melanin diminished as the age advanced. There was no significant difference among different ethnic groups in Pakistan, and the amount of epidermal melanin was significantly higher in exposed than in unexposed parts of body among the population of Karachi. The distribution of epidermal melanin appeared to be inversely proportional to the advancing age, it remained constant among different ethnic groups of Pakistan, but the intensity was significantly higher in exposed than in unexposed parts of body among Karachiites.",Excluded
3978,"Hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy using the cyberknife for external auditory canal carcinoma Purpose/Objective(s): This is a retrospective study to evaluate the outcomes of external auditory canal carcinoma (EACC) treated with CyberKnife (CK) alone. Materials/Methods: Between May 2005 and March 2010, 37 patients with EACC were treated with hypofractionated SRT using CK at Yokohama CK center. The beam energy was 6 MV. Patients were lightly restrained with a custom-made thermoplastic face mask, and the 6D automated skull-tracking tracking method was utilized in all cases for patient alignment and target position correction during treatment. Of them, 24 patients were followed up more than 12 months, which were analyzed. They were 12 male and 12 female. According to Stell classification, 4 patients were Stage I, 8 patients were Stage II, and 12 patients were Stage III. Age was ranging 47 years to 89 years, median 61 years. Tumor volume was raging 7.2ml to 105.6ml, median 42.6ml. The subscribed marginal dose (D95) was 28.0Gy to 42.5Gy (median 35.0Gy) with 3 to 5 stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT). No patient underwent previous radiation therapy. Result(s): Follow-up periods was raging three to 32 months, median 26 months. One patient died of acute myocardial infarction 4 months after CK treatment. The control rate of Stell I, II and III was 75%, 62% and 75%, respectively. One patient with Stell III was showing cerebella abscess three months after CK treatment. This patient was showing dural invasion at CT treatment. There was no direct radiation injury observed at present. Facial nerve function was preserved. Conclusion(s): Surgical approach to EACC is invasive and results in mal function of facial movement and mandible. Our data is preliminary; however showing CK treatment is feasible for EACC. CK treatment is less invasive and able to maintain function.",Excluded
3731,"A prospective, matched comparison of ultra-low and standard-dose computed tomography for assessment of renal colic OBJECTIVE: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of ultra-low-dose computed tomography (ULDCT) compared with standard-dose CT (SDCT) in the evaluation of patients with clinically suspected renal colic, in addition to secondary features (hydroureteronephrosis, perinephric stranding) and additional pathological entities (renal masses)., PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective, comparative cohort study was conducted amongst patients presenting to the emergency department with signs and symptoms suggestive of renal or ureteric colic. Patients underwent both SDCT and ULDCT. Single-blinded review of the image sets was performed independently by three board-certified radiologists., RESULTS: Among 21 patients, the effective radiation dose was lower for ULDCT [mean (SD) 1.02 (0.16) mSv] than SDCT [mean (SD) 4.97 (2.02) mSv]. Renal and/or ureteric calculi were detected in 57.1% (12/21) of patients. There were no significant differences in calculus detection and size estimation between ULDCT and SDCT. A higher concordance was observed for ureteric calculi (75%) than renal calculi (38%), mostly due to greater detection of calculi of <3 mm by SDCT. Clinically significant calculi (>=3 mm) were detected by ULDCT with high specificity (97.6%) and sensitivity (100%) compared to overall detection (specificity 91.2%, sensitivity 58.8%). ULDCT and SDCT were highly concordant for detection of secondary features, while ULDCT detected less renal cysts of <2 cm. Inter-observer agreement for the ureteric calculi detection was 93.9% for SDCT and 87.8% for ULDCT., CONCLUSION: ULDCT performed similarly to SDCT for calculus detection and size estimation with reduced radiation exposure. Based on this and other studies, ULDCT should be considered as the first-line modality for evaluation of renal colic in routine practice.

4098,"Phase 1 Fractional Dose-Escalation Study of Equipotent Stereotactic Radiation Therapy Regimens for Early-Stage Glottic Larynx Cancer PURPOSE: Early-stage glottic larynx squamous cell carcinoma (GLC) is a relatively common disease with excellent oncologic control, but treatment is associated with acute dysphagia and long-term voice quality changes. This phase 1 study of hypofractionated radiation therapy for early-stage GLC increased the fraction size while reducing the number of fractions until 5-fraction stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SABR) was delivered., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eligible patients had received a diagnosis of stage Tis to T2 GLC. Patients who had undergone prior curative-intent surgery were excluded. The equipotent dose levels were as follows: (1) level 0, 50 Gy in 15 fractions (n = 4); (2) level 1, 45 Gy in 10 fractions (n = 13); and (3) level 2, 42.5 Gy in 5 fractions (SABR level, n = 12). Grade 3 or 4 laryngeal edema, voice, dyspnea, stridor, or cough were the predefined dose-limiting toxicities., RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were enrolled from November 2013 to March 2017. The median and minimum follow-up times were 39.2 and 13 months, respectively. Two actively smoking patients, 1 treated in level 1 (grade 4 laryngeal edema, grade 3 dysphagia) and 1 treated in level 2 (grade 3 laryngeal necrosis, dysphagia), developed dose-limiting toxicities. The former patient soon developed a local recurrence, and the latter patient recovered. There were a total of 5 local recurrences: 2 in level 0 and 3 in level 1. The Voice Handicap Index results showed robust long-term voice quality with median values of 7 and 0 at 6 and 12 months, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Given the tolerability, excellent voice outcomes, and preliminary efficacy data of 5-fraction glottic larynx SABR, this regimen warrants further study.

4480,"Cardiac and Renal Delayed Effects of Acute Radiation Exposure: Organ Differences in Vasculopathy, Inflammation, Senescence and Oxidative Balance We have previously shown significant pathology in the heart and kidney of murine hematopoietic-acute radiation syndrome (H-ARS) survivors of 8.7-9.0 Gy total-body irradiation (TBI). The goal of this study was to determine temporal relationships in the development of vasculopathy and the progression of renal and cardiovascular delayed effects of acute radiation exposure (DEARE) at TBI doses less than 9 Gy and to elucidate the potential roles of senescence, inflammation and oxidative stress. Our results show significant loss of endothelial cells in coronary arteries by 4 months post-TBI (8.53 or 8.72 Gy of gamma radiation). This loss precedes renal dysfunction and interstitial fibrosis and progresses to abnormalities in the arterial media and adventitia and loss of coronary arterioles. Major differences in radiation-induced pathobiology exist between the heart and kidney in terms of vasculopathy progression and also in indices of inflammation, senescence and oxidative imbalance. The results of this work suggest a need for different medical countermeasures for multiple targets in different organs and at various times after acute radiation injury to prevent the progression of DEARE.",Included
4555,"Factors determining fluoroscopy time during ureteroscopy Purpose: The aim of this study was to prospectively identify predictors of radiation exposure during ureteroscopy. Patients and Methods: Eighty-five consecutive patients who presented for ureteroscopies and laser lithotripsy were considered. Fluoroscopy time (FT) was obtained from radiology reports for each patient, and clinical data were obtained from chart review. Nine patients were excluded (three unconfirmed FTs, four staghorn calculi, one ectopic kidney, and one multiple ureteral strictures). Seventy-six patients were included in the study. Univariate and multivariate linear regression were used to identify factors that determined FT. Result(s): The patient cohort was 65.8% male with a mean age of 52.7 years. Mean FT was 183s, and mean surgical time was 68.4+/-29 minutes. Mean stone size was 10+/-5mm in the greatest dimension. A large proportion of patients (50%) had renal stones, multiple stones were present in 31.6% of cases, and 22.3% of stones were radiolucent. Cases were equally distributed between surgeons A and B, and 46% of patients had preoperative stents. On multivariate analysis, increased FT was independently associated with surgeon A (104 additional seconds per case, P<0.001), longer duration of surgery (14s per 10 minutes, P<0.001), and male patients (54s per procedure, P=0.02). Age, stone characteristics, presence of ureteral stent, and stone-free status did not correlate with FT. Conclusion(s): Surgeon behavior, longer duration of surgery, and male gender were significant predictors of FT and, hence, radiation exposure during ureteroscopy. In the present study, stone characteristics were not found to be predictors of FT. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Excluded

3773,"Evaluation of light-emitting diode (LED-835 NM) application over human gingival fibroblast: An in vitro study Since the laser and photomodulation were discovered over 50 years, they have been used for many applications in medicine and in dentistry also. In particular, light-emitting diodes therapy (LT) achieved a great success in medical treatment and photo-therapy. In the decades, LT has been used for several therapeutic purposes. Many beneficial effects have been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo, including antibacterial, antiviral, antitumor, cell differentiation, immune potentiating and tissue repair activities. Beneficial effects of LT have also been observed in clinical settings. Although there are lots of cell culture studies in low-level laser therapy, there are only a few cell culture studies in LT that have similar characteristics. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of LT on primary human gingival fibroblast cells (HGF) on elastin (ELN) gene activation using Real Time PCR. ELN gene activation is directly connected with elastin protein production and HGF functionality. Human gingival tissue biopsies were obtained from three healthy patients during tooth extraction. The gingival specimens were fragmented with a scalpel and transferred in culture dishes containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (FBS) and antibiotics, i.e. penicillin 100U/ml and streptomycin 100mug/ml. Cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37C. The medium was changed the next day and twice a week. After 15 days, the samples of gingival tissue were removed from the culture dishes. Cells were harvested after an additional 24 h incubation. Human gingival fibroblasts at the second passage were seeded on multiple 6-well plates. The cells stimulation was performed with a light-emitting diodes (LEDs) medical device type E-Light. The LED irradiation seems to be directly correlated with the elastin (ELN) gene activation. Interestingly, ELN gene expression in the cultured human gingival fibroblasts seems to be inversely related to the patients' age; in fact, its expression tends to decrease with aging. In summary, the result of the present study shows that LED irradiation promoted ELN gene expression more in elderly than in younger adults.Copyright © by BIOLIFE, s.a.s.",Excluded
3881,"Straylight Measurements in Two Different Apodized Diffractive Multifocal Intraocular Lenses PURPOSE: To evaluate differences in straylight between eyes implanted with a hydrophilic multifocal IOL (Seelens MF; Hanita Lenses, Hanita, Israel) and a hydrophobic multifocal IOL (SN6AD1; Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Fort Worth, TX)., METHODS: In a prospective cohort study, routinely obtained straylight measurements (C-Quant; Oculus Optikgerate, Wetzlar, Germany) 3 months after standard phacoemulsification for either cataract or refractive lens procedures were compared. Patients were implanted with either the SeeLens MF IOL or the SN6AD1 IOL. Postoperative straylight values, visual acuity, and refractive outcomes were compared., RESULTS: The SeeLens MF IOL was implanted in 84 eyes and the SN6AD1 IOL in 79 eyes. The difference in straylight was 0.08 (P = .01), with the SeeLens MF IOL having less straylight. Postoperative CDVA was logMAR -0.03 +/- 0.06 in the SeeLens MF group, and logMAR -0.02 +/- 0.08 in the SN6AD1 group. Mean postoperative refraction was +0.01 +/- 0.43 and +0.06 +/- 0.35 D, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: The Seelens MF IOL showed a stray-light of log(s) 0.08 lower than the SN6AD1 IOL. In terms of spherical equivalent and visual acuity the lenses performed equally. More study will aid in understanding the causes and clinical impact of this difference.

Carboplatin (25 mg/m2) i.v. was given immediately before each morning thoracic radiotherapy. Blood samples were taken to measure the blood free platinum pharmacokinetics on day 1., RESULTS: All 31 patients completed the protocol treatment without delay. The median age was 73 years, and the majority had Stage IIIA (32%) or IIIB (48%) disease. Major acute toxicity (> or = Grade 3) included 17 patients (55%) with leukopenia, 5 patients (16%) with thrombocytopenia, and 7 patients (23%) with esophagitis. One possible treatment-related death due to diffuse pneumonitis was observed. There were three complete responses (CRs) and 23 partial responses (PRs) in the radiation field, for a response rate of 84%. The relapse pattern was predominantly loco-regional, and the median survival time was 9.8 months. The area under the plasma level-time curve (AUC) of free platinum correlated significantly (r = -0.41, p = 0.04) with the surviving fraction of leukocytes, but not with the severity of the esophagitis. Responders had significantly (p = 0.04 by Welch's t-test) higher AUCs than nonresponders., CONCLUSIONS: This combination therapy was feasible and efficacious against locally advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer. Although long-term local control still remains unsatisfactory, pharmacokinetic data are suggestive of a role for platinum in enhancing the radiation effect.",Excluded

Method(s): The clinical and CT data of 16 patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed. Dynamic CTs were performed continuously after admission. Result(s): Of the patients, 14 were moderate cases, and 2 were severe. Twelve patients underwent CT at the early onset stage. Single nodules or ground-glass opacities (GGOs) were found in 2 patients and multiple bilateral pulmonary lesions in 8 (consolidation-like opacities with or without small nodules in five and large GGOs with interlobular septal thickening in three). Ten had lesion growth and enlargement on the second CT. Fourteen patients underwent CT during the progressive stage, which revealed GGOs and focal consolidation in 6 of them, lung consolidation opacities in 5, and simple, large GGOs with interlobular septal thickening in 3. In both severe cases, the lesions continued to enlarge and grow, and the extent of consolidation continued to expand. Conclusion(s): Low-dose chest CT can clearly reflect the morphology, density, and extent of COVID-19 nodules, and is beneficial for observing dynamic nodule changes and disease screening and monitoring.Copyright © 2020 Beijing You'an Hospital affiliated to Capital Medical University",Excluded

Methods Among lung cancer patients receiving SBRT between 2005 and 2016, we evaluated those treated with a total dose of 40-60 Gy in five fractions with curative intent who either were staged as cT1-4N0M0 or experienced postoperative isolated local recurrence. We analyzed the incidence of radiation pneumonitis (RP) in all patients and local recurrence and overall survival (OS) in T1a-2a patients. Results A total of 508 patients were eligible, including 42 with IIPs. The median follow-up was 32.3 (6.0-120.9) months. Significantly more patients with IIPs had grade >=3 RP than did those without IIPs (12% vs. 3%, p = 0.009). The 2-year local recurrence rate was low in both groups (3.4% vs. 5.6%, p = 0.38). The 2-year OS rate was significantly lower in the patients with IIPs (42.2% vs. 80.9%, p < 0.001), although death from lung cancer was comparable (p = 0.74). Conclusion SBRT achieved excellent local control with acceptable pulmonary toxicity in lung cancer patients with IIPs.

3845,"Interval between neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and surgery for squamous cell carcinoma of the thoracic esophagus does delayed surgery have an impact on outcome? Objective: Aim of this study was to evaluate whether delayed surgery after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) affects postoperative outcomes in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the thoracic esophagus. Background(s): Esophagectomy is usually recommended within 4 to 6 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant CRT. However, the optimal timing of surgery is not clearly defined. Method(s): A total of 129 consecutive patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer, treated between 1998 and 2007, were retrospectively analyzed using prospectively collected data. Patients were divided into 3 groups on the basis of timing to surgery: group 1, <=30 days (n = 17); group 2, 31 to 60 days (n = 83); and group 3, 61 to 90 days (n = 29). Subsequently, only 2-numerically more consistent-groups were studied, using the median value of timing intervals as a cutoff level: group A, <=46 days (n = 66); and group B, <46 days (n = 63). Result(s): Groups were comparable in terms of patient and tumor characteristics, type of neoadjuvant regimen, toxicity, postoperative morbidity and mortality rates, tumor downstaging, and pathologic complete responses. The overall 5-year actuarial survival rate was 0% in group 1, 43.1% in group 2, and 35.9% in group 3 (P = 0.13). After R0 resection (n = 106), the 5-year actuarial survival rate was 0%, 51%, and 47.3%, respectively (P = 0.18). Tumor recurrence after R0 resection seemed to be inversely related, even if not significantly (P = 0.17), to the time interval between chemoradiation and surgery: 50% in group 1, 40.6% in group 2, and 21.7% in group 3. When considering only 2 groups, the overall 5-year survival was 33.1% in group A and 42.7% in group B (P = 0.64); after R0 resection, the 5-year survival was 37.8% and 56.3%, respectively (P = 0.18). The rate of tumor recurrence was significantly lower in group B (25%) than in group A (48.3%) (P = 0.02). Conclusion(s): Delayed surgery after neoadjuvant chemoradiation does not compromise the outcomes of patients with locally advanced SCC of the esophagus. Delaying surgery up to 90 days offers relevant advantages in the clinical management of the patients, can reduce tumor recurrences, and may improve prognosis after complete R0 resection surgery.

4951,"Risk of oxidative damage and bone resorption from increased iron stores during space flight An increased amount of stored iron from neocytolysis of red blood cells and a high dietary intake of iron during space flight have raised concern about the risk of excess iron causing oxidative damage, particularly in bone. To investigate this risk, biomarkers of iron status, oxidative damage, and bone resorption during space flight were analyzed for 23 (16 M/7 F) International Space Station crewmembers. As many as 5 in-flight blood samples and 24-h urine pools were collected from each crewmember. Serum iron increased slightly during space flight and decreased at landing (P < 0.0004). An increase in serum ferritin early in flight (217% in women and 68% in men, P < 0.0004), returning to preflight concentrations at landing, and a decrease in transferrin and transferrin receptors during flight indicated that a transient increase in iron stores occurred. No inflammatory response was observed during flight. The oxidative damage markers 8-hydroxy-2'- deoxyguanosine and prostaglandin F2alpha were positively correlated (both P < 0.001) with serum ferritin. A greater area under the curve for ferritin during flight was correlated with greater changes in bone mineral density of several bone regions after flight. The results suggest that increased iron stores do constitute a risk factor for oxidative damage and bone resorption, during space flight and on Earth.",Excluded

In head and neck cancer (HNC) patients, long-term treatment-related complications include radiotherapy (RT)-induced carotid vasculopathy and stroke. The current study investigated the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics of the carotid wall in long-term HNC survivors treated with RT.Methods. MRI of the carotid arteries was performed within a prospective cohort of 42 HNC patients on average 7 years after RT. Two independent radiologists assessed maximal vessel wall thickness of common and internal carotid arteries. In case of wall thickening (>= 2 mm) the MRI signals as well as length of the thickened segment were assessed.Results. Mean (SD) age of the 42 patients at baseline was 53 (13) years and mean (SD) follow-up time after RT was 6.8 (1.3) years. In total 62% were men and 60% had one or more cerebrovascular risk factors. Mean (SD) dose of RT on the common carotid arteries and internal carotid arteries was 57 Gy (11) and 61 Gy (10), respectively. Wall thickening was observed in 58% of irradiated versus 27% of non-irradiated common carotid arteries and 24% of irradiated versus 6% of non-irradiated internal carotid arteries (p < 0.05). Mean (SD) thickness of the irradiated and non-irradiated common carotid arteries was 2.5 (0.9) and 2 (0.7) mm (p = 0.02). Mean thickness of the irradiated and non-irradiated internal carotid arteries was 1.8 (0.8) and 1.5 mm (0.3) (n.s.). Mean length of the thickened vessel wall was 48 mm versus 36 mm in the irradiated versus non-irradiated common carotid arteries (p = 0.03) and 20 mm versus 15 mm in the irradiated versus non-irradiated internal carotid arteries (n.s.). No significant differences were observed for signal intensities of the vessel walls.Conclusions. Our study showed significantly more vessel wall thickening in irradiated versus non-irradiated carotid arteries years after RT for HNC, while no differences in signal intensities were observed.Copyright © 2015 Informa Healthcare.",Excluded

No changes of body weight indicating systemic effects were found. Skin thickness was increased significantly after irradiation. These changes were partially antagonized by cream or milk bases and completely prevented by the corresponding formulations containing sunscreen agents. Under the chosen conditions ultimate load of excised skin samples was increased by irradiation. This effect was not reversed by the bases but by the sunscreen products. Ultimate strain of excised skin samples proved to be the most sensitive indicator. The decrease of ultimate strain after irradiation was partially antagonized by the bases. The sunscreen products had more powerful effect. Due to the effects on skin thickness and ultimate load tensile strength and modulus of elasticity did not show significant changes under the chosen conditions. Likewise, collagen and elastin content per gram wet weight did not show significant changes. Considering the increase of thickness of skin which is prevented by sunscreen products one may conclude also a prevention of formation of additional intercellular material. The results prove the value of sunscreen products. Furthermore, they demonstrate a new method for evaluation of chemicals and sun protection preparations.",Excluded
4901,"TWO FACTORS INFLUENCING DOSE RECONSTRUCTION IN LOW DOSE RANGE: THE VARIABILITY OF BKG INTENSITY ON ONE INDIVIDUAL AND WATER CONTENT A fast and accurate retrospective dosimetry method for the triage is very important in radiation accidents. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) fingernail dosimetry is a promising way to estimate radiation dose. This article presents two factors influencing dose reconstruction in low dose range: the variability of background signal (BKG) intensity on one individual and water content. Comparing the EPR spectrum of dried and humidified fingernail samples, it is necessary to add a procedure of dehydration before EPR measurements, so as to eliminate the deviation caused by water content. Besides, the BKGs of different fingers' nails are not the same as researchers thought previously, and the difference between maximum and minimum BKG intensities of one individual can reach 55.89 %. Meanwhile, the variability of the BKG intensity among individuals is large enough to impact precise dose reconstruction. Water within fingernails and instability of BKG are two reasons that cause the inaccuracy of radiation dose reconstruction in low-dosage level.Copyright © The Author 2015.

4182,"Biodistribution and radiation dosimetry in healthy volunteers of a novel tumour-specific probe for PET/CT imaging: BAY 85-8050 Purpose: Novel tracers for the diagnosis of malignant disease with PET and PET/CT are being developed as the most commonly used 18F deoxyglucose (FDG) tracer shows certain limitations. Employing radioactively labelled glutamate derivatives for specific imaging of the truncated citrate cycle potentially allows more specific tumour imaging. Radiation dosimetry of the novel tracer BAY 85-8050, a glutamate derivative, was calculated and the effective dose (ED) was compared with that of FDG. Method(s): Five healthy volunteers were included in the study. Attenuation-corrected whole-body PET/CT scans were performed from 0 to 90 min, at 120 and at 240 min after injection of 305.0 +/- 17.6 MBq of BAY 85-8050. Organs with moderate to high uptake at any of the imaging time points were used as source organs. Total activity in each organ at each time point was measured. Time-activity curves (TAC) were determined for the whole body and all source organs. The resulting TACs were fitted to exponential equations and accumulated activities were determined. OLINDA/EXM software was used to calculate individual organ doses and the whole-body ED from the acquired data. Result(s): Uptake of the tracer was highest in the kidneys due to renal excretion of the tracer, followed by the pancreas, heart wall and osteogenic cells. The mean organ doses were: kidneys 38.4 +/- 11.2 muSv/MBq, pancreas 23.2 +/- 3.8 muSv/MBq, heart wall 17.4 +/- 4.1 muSv/MBq, and osteogenic cells 13.6 +/- 3.5 muSv/MBq. The calculated ED was 8.9 +/- 1.5 muSv/MBq. Conclusion(s): Based on the distribution and dose estimates, the calculated radiation dose of BAY 85-8050 is 2.67 +/- 0.45 mSv at a patient dose of 300 MBq, which compares favourably with the radiation dose of FDG (5.7 mSv). © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded

Method(s): We inspected the results of 106 patients with the diagnoses of idiopathic neuralgia that treated with percutaneous radiofrequency trigeminal rhizotomy retrospectively. The scores of visual analog scale(VAS) were noted preoperative and postoperative periods at 1st, 3rd, 6th and 12th months and were used for statistical analysis. Result(s): Mean age of 106 patients was 67.31+/-8.85 years. Duration of symptoms was 19.1+/-13.1 months. Duration of symptoms did not change significantly according to gender (p=0.755), or site of trigeminal pain (p=0.158). There was not any statistical significance between gender, effected branch of trigemial nerve and side of the pain. Preoperative mean VAS score was 9.6+/-0.75. Postoperative mean VAS score values were 3.25+/-2.44 at first month, 3.23+/-2.43 at third months, 3.12+/-2.78 at sixth months and 2.59+/-3.18 at postoperative twelfth months. We found statistically significant difference between preoperative and postoperative 1st, 3rd, 6th and 12th months VAS scores (p<0.001). Conclusion(s): Percutaneous radiofrequency trigeminal rhizotomy is the minimally invasive treatment modality with lower complication rates and it has a high rate of efficacy when compared with invasive methods. It is most cost-effective procedure to choose if the pain recurs.Copyright © 2018, AVES Ibrahim KARA. All rights reserved.",Excluded
3846,"Characterization of sulfated polysaccharide from Laurencia obtusa and its apoptotic, gastroprotective and antioxidant activities This study was designed to characterize the physico-chemical properties of the sulfated polysaccharide (SP) isolated from the red alga Laurencia obtusa and to evaluate its apoptotic, gastroprotective and antioxidant activities. The different macromolecular characteristics of SP were determined by size exclusion chromatography combined with multi-angle laser light-scattering detection (SEC-MALLS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR and 13C NMR). The native molecular weight of the extracted polysaccharide is high (>=336,900g.mol-1). It showed high amounts of sulfated groups (28.2%) and low levels of proteins. It was found to be a potent inducer of apoptosis on acute monocytic leukaemia THP-1cell lines with EC50 value of 53mug.mL-1. Furthermore, a significant gastroprotective effect (p<0.01) was also observed with a gastric ulcer inhibition of 63.44%, 78.42% and 82.15% at the doses 25, 50 and 100mg.kg-1, respectively. In addition, SP significantly increased glutathione levels (GSH) and decreased the concentration of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) in EtOH/HCl-damaged gastric mucosa in rats; it also exhibited an important antioxidant activity in vitro. Therefore, SP, derived from the red alga Laurencia obtusa, may have a potential therapeutic effect against acute myeloid leukaemia and a beneficial potential as gastroprotective and antioxidant natural product.

4367,"Radiation-induced micro-RNA expression changes in peripheral blood cells of radiotherapy patients Purpose: MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of noncoding small RNAs that regulate gene expression, are involved in numerous physiologic processes in normal and malignant cells. Our in vivo study measured miRNA and gene expression changes in human blood cells in response to ionizing radiation, to develop miRNA signatures that can be used as biomarkers for radiation exposure. Methods and Materials: Blood from 8 radiotherapy patients in complete remission 1 or 2 was collected immediately before and 4 hours after total body irradiation with 1.25 Gy x-rays. Both miRNA and gene expression changes were measured by means of quantitative polymerase chain reaction and microarray hybridization, respectively. Hierarchic clustering, multidimensional scaling, class prediction, and gene ontology analysis were performed to investigate the potential of miRNAs to serve as radiation biomarkers and to elucidate their likely physiologic roles in the radiation response. Result(s): The expression levels of 45 miRNAs were statistically significantly upregulated 4 hours after irradiation with 1.25 Gy x-rays, 27 of them in every patient. Nonirradiated and irradiated samples form separate clusters in hierarchic clustering and multidimensional scaling. Out of 223 differentially expressed genes, 37 were both downregulated and predicted targets of the upregulated miRNAs. Paired and unpaired miRNA-based classifiers that we developed can predict the class membership of a sample with unknown irradiation status, with accuracies of 100% when all 45 upregulated miRNAs are included. Both miRNA control of and gene involvement in biologic processes such as hemopoiesis and the immune response are increased after irradiation, whereas metabolic processes are underrepresented among all differentially expressed genes and the genes controlled by miRNAs. Conclusion(s): Exposure to ionizing radiation leads to the upregulation of the expression of a considerable proportion of the human miRNAome of peripheral blood cells. These miRNA expression signatures can be used as biomarkers of radiation exposure. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
4165,"Metformin use and improved response to therapy in rectal cancer Locally advanced rectal cancer is commonly treated with chemoradiation prior to total mesorectal excision (TME). Studies suggest that metformin may be an effective chemopreventive agent in this disease as well as a possible adjunct to current therapy. In this study, we examined the effect of metformin use on pathologic complete response (pCR) rates and outcomes in rectal cancer. The charts of 482 patients with locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma treated from 1996 to 2009 with chemoradiation and TME were reviewed. Median radiation dose was 50.4 Gy (range 19.8-63). Nearly, all patients were treated with concurrent 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy (98%) followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (81.3%). Patients were categorized as nondiabetic (422), diabetic not taking metformin (40), or diabetic taking metformin (20). No significant differences between groups were found in clinical tumor classification, nodal classification, tumor distance from the anal verge or circumferential extent, pretreatment carcinoembryonic antigen level, or pathologic differentiation. pCR rates were 16.6% for nondiabetics, 7.5% for diabetics not using metformin, and 35% for diabetics taking metformin, with metformin users having significantly higher pCR rates than either nondiabetics (P = 0.03) or diabetics not using metformin (P = 0.007). Metformin use was significantly associated with pCR rate on univariate (P = 0.05) and multivariate (P = 0.01) analyses. Furthermore, patients taking metformin had significantly increased disease-free (P = 0.013) and overall survival (P = 0.008) compared with other diabetic patients. Metformin use is associated with significantly higher pCR rates as well as improved survival. These promising data warrant further prospective study. © 2013 The Authors.

4828,"Reproducibility of trial-based functional MRI on motor imagery The investigation of the reproducibility in functional MRI (fMRI) is an important step in the quantification and analysis of paradigm-related brain activation. This article reports on reproducibility of cortical activation characterized by repeated fMRI runs (10 times) during the performance of a motor imagery and a passive auditory stimulation as a control task. Two parameters, the size of activation and BOLD signal contrast, were measured from regions-of-interest for 10 subjects across different threshold conditions. The variability of these parameters was normalized with respect to the mean obtained from 10 runs, and represented as the intrasession variability. It was found that the variability was significantly lower in the measurement of BOLD signal contrast as compared to the measurement of the size of activation. The variability of the activation volume measurement was greater in the motor imagery task than in the auditory tasks across all thresholds. This task-dependent difference was not apparent from the measurement of the BOLD signal contrast. The presence of threshold dependence in the variability measurement was also examined, but no such dependency was found. The results suggest that a measurement of BOLD signal itself is a more reliable indicator of paradigm-related brain activation during repeated fMRI scans.",Excluded
4037,"Serial MR Imaging Post Trigeminal Radiosurgery - Identifying Radiosurgical Shot Accuracy in Euclidean Space Purpose/Objective(s): To evaluate imaging changes at DREZ target zone post-image guided radiosurgery for medically refractory trigeminal neuralgia (TN). Materials/Methods: 15 pts. ( 12 male, 3 female) with medically refractory primary TN having BNI class III B & Class IV pain level & history of no prior neurosurgical intervention underwent double reinforced face mask immobilization, 0.625mm slice thickness CT,0.625mm thickness 3D-SPACE, postcontrast VIBE, Diffusion weighted MR sequences. Median dose of 82 gray (80-86gy) was planned on retrogasserian target close to pars triangularis using single isocenter multiarc non-coplanar beams on a Monte-Carlo optimizer. Treatment was delivered using 5mm stereotactic cones with FFF beams at dose rate of 1200mu/mt, 3-D CBCT image guidance, intrafraction imaging and 6-DOF couch. All patients underwent serial MR imaging at time points 72 hrs, 1 week, 1 mo, 3 mo, 6 mo, & 12 mo post SRS. Targeting accuracy was assessed from deviation of the coordinates of the intended target compared with the center of enhancement on 1 month post-SRS MRI. Radiation dose delivered at the borders of contrast enhancement was evaluated. ""Favorable"" responders were patients rendered free of pain, either with or without medications. Complications were defined as lasting neurologic deficits attributable to treatment, and included anesthesia, paresthesia or dysesthesia. Result(s): At median follow-up of 14 mo. pain relief was complete in 13 patients with BNI class 1 response (no medication) and 2 patients BNI had class 2 response (occasional pain not requiring medication). The actuarial rate of obtaining complete pain relief was 93.3%. Imaging changes were same in all the patients post radiosurgery. Nerve edema is seen at 72 hrs post treatment, minimal brainstem edema (nearby DREZ) is noted at 7 days post treatment. Focal enhancement corresponding to SRS shot is seen at 1 month. The enhancement persisted through 6mon. scan but the brainstem edema decreased to pretreatment levels. At 12mo. MR the enhancement faded in intensity. The median deviation of the coordinates between the intended target and the center of contrast enhancement was 0.5 mm (0.3-0.7mm) in Euclidean space. The median radiation doses fitting within the borders of the contrast enhancement of the shot ranged from 78gy. Conclusion(s): Warping original treatment doses on the 1 month post SRS postcontrast MRI gives the clinical team an idea about the accuracy of the treatment and accordingly the errors in treatment. This is the first study reported in literature where serial MR imaging was done post trigeminal radiosurgery.Copyright © 2019",Excluded
4465,"Intracranial Autograft Fat Placement to Separate the Optic Chiasm from Tumor to Improve Stereotactic Radiotherapy Dosimetry BACKGROUND: Radiation therapy for intracranial lesions is constrained by dose to neurologic organs at risk., CASE DESCRIPTION: We report 2 cases, a newly diagnosed chondrosarcoma and a previously irradiated meningioma, with tumors that abutted the optic chiasm following subtotal resection. Definitive radiotherapy would have required either undercoverage of the tumor or treatment of the chiasm with doses posing an unacceptable risk of blindness. Therefore, the patients underwent open surgery with placement of an abdominal fat autograft to provide space between the tumor and the optic structures at risk. Patients received definitive fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy. For each patient, we retrospectively compared the treated plan (with fat autograft) to a second plan generated using the pre-autograft imaging, maintaining similar tumor coverage. For the chondrosarcoma, the fat autograft reduced the optic chiasm maximum dose by 21% (70.4 Gy to 55.3 Gy). For the reirradiated peri-optic meningioma, the optic chiasm maximum dose was reduced by 10% (50.8 Gy to 45.9 Gy), the left optic nerve by 17% (48.9 Gy to 40.4 Gy), and the right optic nerve by 30% (32.3 Gy to 22.6 Gy)., CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the utility of abdominal fat autograft placement to maximize coverage of tumor while minimizing dose to intracranial organs at risk.

Both young and adult, un-irradiated and irradiated hamsters were highly susceptible to L. carinii but mice (un-irradiated or irradiated) were poor hosts. All hamsters (18 un-irradiated and seven irradiated) became infected. Seven out of nine mice in an un-irradiated series became infected. There was apparently 'age resistance' or 'young susceptibility' in the hamsters. The susceptibility of young hamsters appeared similar to that of new-born Carworth white rats and cotton rats. The pattern of infection in un-irradiated and irradiated hamsters was similar. Results from irradiated animals were insufficient to draw any clear conclusions on the effect of irradiation to susceptibility to infection with L. carinii.

Our target population included 55-year-old patients who present to their primary care physicians with stable chest pain., RESULTS: All diagnostic strategies yielded similar health outcomes, but performing CCTA-with or without stress testing or performing stress single-photon emission computed tomography-marginally minimized adverse events and maximized longevity and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Health outcomes associated with these strategies were comparable, with CCTA in men and women yielding the greatest QALYs but only by modest margins. Overall differences were small, and performing the most effective test-compared with the least effective-decreased adverse event rates by 3% in men and women. Comparable increases in longevity and QALYs were 2 months and 0.1 QALYs in men and 1 month and 0.03 QALYs in women. CCTA raised overall costs, partly through the follow-up of incidental findings, and when performed with stress testing, its incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ranged from $26,200/QALY in men to $35,000/QALY in women. Health outcomes were marginally less favorable in women when radiation risks were considered., CONCLUSIONS: CCTA is comparable to other diagnostic studies and might hold good clinical value, but large randomized controlled trials are needed to guide policy.",Excluded

The collateral damage induced on healthy tissues during radiation and the minimal therapeutic effect on the organ-of-interest (target) is a major clinical concern. Ultra-small, renal clearable, silica based gadolinium chelated nanoparticles (SiGdNP) provide simultaneous MR contrast and radiation dose enhancement. The high atomic number of gadolinium provides a large photoelectric cross-section for increased photon interaction, even for high-energy clinical radiation beams. Imaging and therapy functionality of SiGdNP were tested in cynomolgus monkeys and pancreatic tumor-bearing mice models, respectively. A significant improvement in tumor cell damage (double strand DNA breaks), growth suppression, and overall survival under clinical radiation therapy conditions were observed in a human pancreatic xenograft model. For the first time, safe systemic administration and systematic renal clearance was demonstrated in both tested species.

High risk patients were defined as those who had previously undergone chemoradiation therapy and autologous platelet adhesives were administered to the surgical wound intraoperatively. The low risk group consisted of patients undergoing salvage neck dissections following radiation only and acted as controls.

Method(s): We included 157 consecutive patients who underwent SBRT alone for stage I non-small-cell lung cancer and whose pretreatment lung computed tomography images were available for retrospective review. The pretreatment computed tomography images were evaluated retrospectively for the presence of ILD. The incidence of RP, overall survival (OS) rate, and the incidence of disease progression and local progression were evaluated between patients with ILD (ILD[+]) and without ILD (ILD[-]). Result(s): Pre-existing ILD was identified in 20 patients. The median follow-up period was 39.5 months. The incidences of RP worse than grade 2 (>= Gr2 RP) and worse than grade 3 (>= Gr3 RP) were significantly higher in ILD(+) than ILD(-) (1 year >= Gr2 RP rate, 55.0% versus 13.3%; p < 0.001 and 1year >= Gr3 RP rate 10.0% versus 1.5%; p = 0.020).

3867,"Influence of muscle strength to weight ratio on functional task performance Existing models of muscle deconditioning such as bed rest are expensive and time-consuming. We propose a new model utilizing a weighted suit to manipulate muscle strength, power, or endurance relative to body weight. The aims of the study were to determine as to which muscle measures best predict functional task performance and to determine muscle performance thresholds below which task performance is impaired. Twenty subjects performed seven occupational astronaut tasks (supine and upright seat egress and walk, rise from fall, hatch opening, ladder climb, object carry, and construction board activity), while wearing a suit weighted with 0-120 % of body weight. Models of the relationship between muscle function/body weight and task completion time were developed using fractional polynomial regression and verified with pre- and post-flight astronaut performance data. Spline regression was used to identify muscle function thresholds for each task. Upright seat egress and walk was the most difficult task according to the spline regression analysis thresholds. Thresholds normalized to body weight were 17.8 N/kg for leg press isometric force, 17.6 W/kg for leg press power, 78.8 J/kg for leg press work, 5.9 N/kg isometric knee extension and 1.9 Nm/kg isokinetic knee extension torque. Leg press maximal isometric force/body weight was the most reliable measure for modeling performance of ambulatory tasks. Laboratory-based manipulation of relative strength has promise as an analog for spaceflight-induced loss of muscle function. Muscle performance values normalized to body weight can be used to predict occupational task performance and to establish relevant strength thresholds.",Excluded

To date, submillisievert coronary angiography has not been considered feasible., PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 2011, we compared results from 100 consecutive patients undergoing elective coronary angiography using the latest-generation flat-panel angiography system (FPS) with results from examinations by the same operator using 106 historic controls with a conventional image-intensifier system (IIS) that was new in 2002., RESULTS: The median patient exposure parameters were measured as follows: dose-area product (DAP) associated with radiographic cine acquisitions (DAP(R)) and fluoroscopy (DAP(F)) scenes, radiographic frames and runs, and cumulative exposure times for radiography and fluoroscopy. On the FPS as compared to the traditional IIS, radiographic detector entrance dose levels were reduced from 164 to 80 nGy/frame and pulse rates were lowered from 12.5/s to 7.5/s during radiography and from 25/s to 4/s during fluoroscopy. The cardiologist's performance patterns remained comparable over the years: fluoroscopy time was constant and radiography time even slightly increased. Overall patient DAP decreased from 7.0 to 2.4 Gy x cm(2); DAP(R), from 4.2 to 1.7 Gy x cm(2); and DAP(F), from 2.8 to 0.6 Gy x cm(2). Time-adjusted DAP(R)/s decreased from 436 to 130 mGy x cm(2) and DAP(F)/s, from 21.6 to 4.4 mGy x cm(2).

We randomized 50 patients with primary knee osteoarthritis into 2 groups. We used CT scan axial images to measure the PCA. In the first group we followed the CT scan plan (group 1), but in the second we did not follow the plan and adjusted rotation to the standard three degrees (group 2). The mean age of the included patients was 63 years. The radiological data of the included patients showed 5 patients with valgus deformity and 45 patients with varus deformity with the mean coronal alignment of 7.5 degrees. CT scan showed the mean PCA of 3.7 degrees (1.3 degrees). The axial knee postoperative X-ray showed the mean patellar tilt angle of 2.1 degrees (0.5 degrees) and 1.9 degrees (0.5 degrees) in groups 1 and 2, respectively. The congruence angle was 4 degrees (2.6 degrees) in group 1 and 5.5 degrees (3.2 degrees) in group 2. The median Knee Society functional score in group 1 was 85 (12), while it was 84 (7.5) in group 2. The median postoperative Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index score in group 1 was 84 (18.6) whereas 80.2 (13.6) in group 2. The median postoperative Bartlett score in group 1 was 30 (5), while it was 30 (6) in group 2.

3979,"Characteristics of induced mutations in offspring derived from irradiated mouse spermatogonia and mature oocytes The exposure of germ cells to radiation introduces mutations in the genomes of offspring, and a previous whole-genome sequencing study indicated that the irradiation of mouse sperm induces insertions/deletions (indels) and multisite mutations (clustered single nucleotide variants and indels). However, the current knowledge on the mutation spectra is limited, and the effects of radiation exposure on germ cells at stages other than the sperm stage remain unknown. Here, we performed whole-genome sequencing experiments to investigate the exposure of spermatogonia and mature oocytes. We compared de novo mutations in a total of 24 F1 mice conceived before and after the irradiation of their parents. The results indicated that radiation exposure, 4 Gy of gamma rays, induced 9.6 indels and 2.5 multisite mutations in spermatogonia and 4.7 indels and 3.1 multisite mutations in mature oocytes in the autosomal regions of each F1 individual. Notably, we found two types of deletions, namely, small deletions (mainly 1~12 nucleotides) in non-repeat sequences, many of which showed microhomology at the breakpoint junction, and single-nucleotide deletions in mononucleotide repeat sequences. The results suggest that these deletions and multisite mutations could be a typical signature of mutations induced by parental irradiation in mammals.",Excluded
4401,"Clinical Spectrum and Outcomes of Ocular and Periocular Complications following External-Beam Radiotherapy for Inoperable Malignant Maxillary Sinus Tumors Purpose: To highlight the clinical spectrum, management, and outcomes of ocular/periocular complications following high-dose external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) for inoperable malignant maxillary sinus-involving tumors (MMST). Method(s): A retrospective, interventional case series. All patients who were diagnosed with inoperable MMST (with orbital involvement) and treated with high-dose fractionated EBRT (65 Gy in 30 fractions) at James Cook University Hospital, UK, were included. Result(s): Seven patients with advanced MMST (T4aN0M0-T4bN2cM0) were included and were followed up for 23.8 +/- 10.2 months. Severe lid margin disease, dry eye, and neurotrophic keratopathy were universally observed. Other complications included cicatricial conjunctivitis (71%), corneal perforation (57%), limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD; 43%), glaucoma (29%), and superimposed candida keratitis (14%). Amniotic membrane transplant (AMT; 71%), tarsorrhaphy (43%), tectonic keratoplasty (29%), and evisceration (14%) were warranted. Intact corneal epithelium was observed in all patients and good corrected-distance visual acuity (>=20/60) was observed in 3 (43%) patients at final follow-up. Conclusion(s): High-dose EBRT for inoperable MMST can lead to a wide array of severe ocular/periocular complications. AMT serves as a potentially useful treatment modality to restore the ocular surface integrity after severe radiation keratopathy. We advocate active monitoring for any evolving ophthalmic complications during and after EBRT to enable timely intervention.Copyright © 2020 S. Karger AG, Basel.",Excluded
4197,"MediGuide in supraventricular tachycardia: Initial experience from a multicentre registry AimsCurrently, fluoroscopy-based catheter visualization is the standard modality in invasive electrophysiological procedures. Recently a new technology for non-fluoroscopic visualization of diagnostic (since 2010) and ablation catheters (since May 2012) has been introduced. The MediGuideTM-Technology (MediGuide) projects catheter tips on prerecorded cine loops in a high time resolution.Methods and resultsWe report on MediGuide-based supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) cases [atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT), atrioventricular reentry tachycardia (AVRT), Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW), ectopic atrial tachycardia (EAT) and typical atrial flutter) from two European centres. In all patients, diagnostic and/or ablation catheters with a special sensor were used to perform the ablation procedures. All procedural data such as acute success, duration of the procedure, fluoroscopy time, and dose and patients' characteristics were analyzed and compared with conventionally ablated patients (n = 1865). Procedure-related complications during the hospital stay were recorded. A total of 24 consecutive patients were analyzed: no significant difference to the control group was seen in the baseline characteristics. The MediGuide patients were predominantly male (66%), aged 58 +/- 14 years and were ablated for 6 AVNRT (25%), 4 AVRT/WPW (17%), 1 EAT (4%), and 13 typical atrial flutter (54%). The acute success rate was 100% (98% in the control group, n.s.). The median fluoroscopy time was 0.5 +/- 1.4 min (10.2 +/- 9.6 in the control group, P < 0.001), the median fluoroscopy dose was 187 +/- 554 cGy cm2 (996 +/- 2593 cGy cm2, P < 0.05). Mean procedure time was 70 +/- 25 min (60 +/- 36 min, n.s.). No complications during the hospital stay were recorded.ConclusionIn several different forms of supraventricular tachycardias the MediGuide-Technology contributed to a dramatic reduction in irradiation exposure. With a median fluoroscopy time of 30 s all SVT cases were effectively performed with no complications; the fluoroscopy burden can be significantly reduced not only for the patient but also for the nurses and the physicians performing the case. The overall procedure times are not prolonged due to the use of MediGuide Technology compared with a control group of >1800 patients undergoing conventional ablation procedures. © 2013 The Author.",Excluded
4868,"Reduced intensity VEPEMB regimen compared with standard ABVD in elderly Hodgkin lymphoma patients: Results from a randomized trial on behalf of the Fondazione Italiana Linfomi (FIL) Survival rates for elderly Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) have not improved substantially in recent years, mainly because of a lack of prospective randomized studies, due to difficulties in enrolling patients. Between 2002 and 2006, 54 untreated HL patients, aged between 65 and 80 years and considered 'non-frail' according to a comprehensive geriatric evaluation, were enrolled into a phase III randomized trial to compare a reduced-intensity regimen (vinblastine, cyclophosphamide, procarbazine, prednisone, etoposide, mitoxantrone, bleomycin; VEPEMB) with standard ABVD (adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine). Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Seventeen patients were in early stage (I-IIA), while 37 were advanced stage. Median age was 72 years and median follow-up was 76 months. Five-year PFS rates were 48% vs. 70% [adjusted Hazard ratio (HR) = 2.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.94-5.10, P = 0.068] and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 63% vs. 77% (adjusted HR = 1.67, 95% CI = 0.69-4.03, P = 0.254) for VEPEMB compared to ABVD. Overall treatment-related mortality was 4%. World Health Organization grade 4 cardiac and lung toxicity occurred in four patients treated with ABVD versus no cases in the VEPEMB arm. Standard ABVD regimen resulted in better PFS and OS than the VEPEMB, although the differences were not statistically significant. The low toxicity of both treatments was probably attributable to stringent selection of patients based on a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment that excluded frail patients.Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Excluded
4283,"Morphologic alterations in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma after preoperative high dose rate intraluminal brachytherapy BACKGROUND: Total esophagectomy specimens from 4 patients given preoperative high dose rate intraluminal brachytherapy (HDRILBT) of 20 Gray (GY) in 2 fractions of 10 Gy each week were reviewed for radiation changes., METHODS: In all patients, preoperative biopsy specimens showed moderate to poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with minimal to negligible keratin production. The esophagectomy specimens were sampled at the resection margins, the edge of irradiated length, 1 cm from the proximal and distal edge of visible tumor, the center of the tumor, and the lymph nodes., RESULTS: Radiation change in the form of fibrosis was limited to the submucosa at the resection margins, the circular muscle layer at the edge of irradiated length, and full thickness at 1 cm from the edge of the visible tumor and the center of the tumor. Surface epithelium did not show any changes at the resection margins but did show basal cell hyperplasia at the edge of the irradiated length and ulceration at 1 cm from the edge of the visible tumor and the center of the tumor. Endarteritis obliterans was seen only 1 cm from the edge of the visible tumor and the center of the tumor. Necrosis, intense keratin formation, and giant cell reaction were observed at the center of the tumor. When compared with the preradiotherapy biopsies, the amount of keratin in the postradiotherapy specimens was extensive. HDRILBT may cause induction of the keratin gene in the irradiated cells to stimulate differentiation toward better differentiated cells., CONCLUSIONS: HDRILBT may cause the keratin gene in the irradiated cells to induce differentiation toward better differentiated cells. Preoperative high dose rate intraluminal brachytherapy may have a role in improving the prognosis of patients with early esophageal cancer treated with a combination of radiotherapy and surgery.",Excluded
4501,"Ultraviolet-radiation-induced erythema and suppression of contact hypersensitivity responses in patients with polymorphic light eruption Ultraviolet-radiation suppresses cell-mediated immunity in healthy humans. It has been postulated that, in the short term, this immunosuppression prevents autoimmune responses to ultraviolet-radiation damaged skin. Patients with polymorphic light eruption (PLE) demonstrate abnormal responses to ultraviolet-radiation suggestive of an immune response to an ultraviolet-radiation-induced antigen. We investigated whether PLE patients (n=22) were resistant to ultraviolet-radiation-induced immunosuppression compared to skin-type, aged-matched controls (n=23). Groups of patients and controls (six subjects per group) received a single dose of solar-simulated ultraviolet-radiation of either 0, 0.6, 1 or 2 minimal erythema doses (MED). Erythema was quantified using a reflectance meter and all volunteers were sensitised on the irradiated site with dinitrochlorobenzene. Contact hypersensitivity responses (CHS) to dinitrochlorobenzene were quantified after challenge using ultrasound. Ultraviolet-radiation-induced erythema was comparable in patients and controls. CHS was comparable in unirradiated patients and controls. UVR-induced a dose-dependent suppression of CHS in all volunteers but patients were more resistant to immunosuppression after 1MED. Exposure to 1MED suppressed CHS by 78% in controls but induced less suppression in patients (44%, p < 0.01).

4745,"Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase Upregulation by Phenylephrine Reduces Radiation Injury in Submandibular Gland PURPOSE: Radiation therapy for head and neck cancer commonly leads to radiation sialadenitis. Emerging evidence has indicated that phenylephrine pretreatment reduces radiosensitivity in the salivary gland; however, the underlying cytoprotective mechanism remains unclear. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is not only a key enzyme for the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide salvage pathway, but also a cytokine participating in cell survival, metabolism, and longevity, with a broad effect on cellular functions in physiology and pathology. However, the regulatory events of NAMPT in response to the irradiated salivary gland are unknown., METHODS AND MATERIALS: The cell viability of primary cultured submandibular gland cells was determined using the PrestoBlue assay. NAMPT expression was measured using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting in vitro and in vivo. Silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) and phosphorylated Akt protein levels were examined by Western blotting. The cellular locations of NAMPT and SIRT1 were detected by immunohistochemistry. NAMPT promoter activity was assessed using the luciferase reporter gene assay., RESULTS: NAMPT was mainly distributed in the cytoplasm of granular convoluted tubule cells and ductal cells in normal submandibular glands. mRNA and protein expression of NAMPT was downregulated after radiation but upregulated with phenylephrine pretreatment both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, the protein expression of phosphorylated Akt and SIRT1 was decreased in irradiated glands, and phenylephrine pretreatment restored the expression of both. SIRT1 was mainly located in the cell nucleus and cytoplasm in the normal submandibular gland. Phenylephrine dramatically enhanced the expression of SIRT1, which was significantly reduced by radiation. Furthermore, phenylephrine induced a marked increase of NAMPT promoter activity., CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal the regulatory mechanisms of NAMPT expression, which help to understand the mechanism of the cytoprotective role of phenylephrine on irradiated tissues.

3836,"The value of Coronary Artery computed Tomography as the first-line anatomical test for stable patients with indications for invasive angiography due to suspected Coronary Artery Disease: CAT-CAD randomized trial Background: The aim of this prospective, randomized trial was to evaluate whether the use of coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) as the first-line anatomical test in patients with suspected significant coronary artery disease (CAD) may reduce the number of coronary invasive angiographies (ICA), and expand the use of CCTA in patients currently diagnosed invasively. Method(s): 120 patients (age:60.6 +/- 7.9 years, 35% female) with indications to ICA were randomized 1:1 to undergo CCTA versus direct ICA. Outcomes were evaluated during the diagnostic and therapeutic periods. Result(s): The number of invasively examined patients was reduced by 64.4% in the CCTA group as compared to the direct ICA group (21vs59,p < 0.0001). The number of patients with ICAs not followed by coronary intervention was reduced by 88.1% with the CCTA strategy (5vs42,p < 0.0001). Over the diagnostic and therapeutic course there were no significant differences regarding the median volume of contrast (CCTA 80.3 ml[65.0-165.0] vs ICA 90.0 ml[55.0-100.0], p = 0.099), while a non-significant trend towards higher radiation dose in the CCTA group was observed (9.9 mSv[7.0-22.1] vs 9.4 mSv[5.2-14.0], p = 0.05). There were no acute cardiovascular events. Conclusion(s): CCTA may hypothetically act as an effective 'gatekeeper' to the catheterization laboratory in the diagnosis of stable patients with current indications for ICA. This strategy may result in non-invasive, outpatient-based triage of two thirds of individuals without actionable CAD, obviating unnecessary invasive examinations. However, the longer follow-up is indispensable. ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT02591992 The aim of our trial was to evaluate the clinical value of coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) as the first-line anatomical test in the diagnosis of stable patients with indications for invasive coronary angiography (ICA) due to suspected significant coronary artery disease (CAD).

4112,"Postoperative low-dose follow-up computed tomography for patients with stomach cancer: Optimal blending ratio of adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction for image quality and diagnostic performance OBJECTIVE: To compare the diagnostic performance of adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction applied low-dose computed tomography (CT) (LDCT) with that of the standard-dose CT (SDCT) for local recurrence in patients with stomach cancer. METHOD(S): Seventy-nine consecutive patients who had undergone surgical resection for stomach cancer were enrolled. To monitor recurrence, SDCT (120 kilovolt peak [kVp], 200mAs) had been performed. The LDCT (120 kVp, 100 mA s) was taken, and images were reconstructed with 4 levels of adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) blending (0%, 30%, 50%, and 70%). Two blinded radiologists recorded the diagnostic confidence scores for local recurrence in each data set using a 5-point scale. Endoscopic biopsy results served as the reference standard. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to calculate the diagnostic performance. RESULT(S): The diagnostic performance of LDCT with variable ASIR blending ratios was comparable to that of SDCT (area under ROC curve, 0.727-0.734, 0.687, respectively, P > 0.05).

4214,"[ERCP procedures as a source of radiation risk to a single gastroenterologist] BACKGROUND: One of the numerous sub-areas of interventional radiology is the use of X-rays in gastroenterology. X-ray fluoroscopy is applied in therapeutic procedures, including endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) that is frequently performed. The ERCP procedure is aimed at imaging the pancreatic duct and biliary tracts., MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this paper radiation risk to the gastrenterologist performing ERCP procedures was investigated. The procedures were performed by a single gastroenterologist in the ERCP Laboratory, University Clinical Hospital Military Memorial Medical Academy - Central Veterans' Hospital in Lodz, Poland. The study comprised 2 series of measurements, one taken during the procedures with continuous fluoroscopy mode, the other during procedures with fluoroscopy in pulsed mode at a frequency of 3 pulses/s. Exposure parameters, anatomical data of patient and dose equivalents for the eyes, skin of the hand and the effective dose for whole body of the gastroenterologist were recorded during each procedure., RESULTS: The collected data cover 70 ERCP procedures - 40 procedures were controlled by continuous fluoroscopy and 30 by pulsed fluoroscopy. The results reveal that pulsed fluoroscopy makes it possible to reduce doses received by the gastroeneterologist from 45% to 60% compared to continuous fluoroscopy., CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography procedures can cause radiation risk to the gastroenterologist performing them. The use of continuous fluoroscopy can result in achieving an equivalent dose to eye lens nearly 20 mSv per year, i.e., the decreased annual limit recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP).

4726,"An optimized test bolus for computed tomography pulmonary angiography and its application at 80kV with 10ml contrast agent Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is usually used for pulmonary embolism (PE) detection. However, the determination of scan timing remains a challenge due to the short scan duration of CTPA. We aimed to develop an optimized test bolus to determine scan delay in CTPA. The time-enhancement curves were obtained by measuring the enhancement within a region of interest in the main pulmonary artery and vein. A total of 70 patients were randomly divided into two groups (n=35 each): the control group underwent CTPA using the test bolus approach and the test group underwent CTPA using the biphasic time-enhancement curves approach. Tube voltages of 100 kVp and 80 kVp and 20ml and 10ml contrast agent were adopted in the control and test groups, respectively. The CT numbers, image quality, PE detection was evaluated. There was a point of intersection between the pulmonary artery and vein test bolus enhancement curves. The scan delay time (TDELAY) was obtained based on the time at intersection (TCROSS) and the scan duration (TSD): TDELAY=TCROSS - TSD. The mean CT numbers for pulmonary vein in the control were higher than those in the test group (all p<0.001). The image quality for the pulmonary arteries in the test group was better than that in the control group (p<0.01), with artifact reduction in the superior vena cava. Segmental PE could be detected using the optimized protocol. The radiation dose and iodine load in the test group were all lower than those in the control (p<0.01). We established an approach to calculate the scan delay of CTPA, and this approach could be used for CTPA at 80 kVp with 10ml contrast agent.",Excluded
4588,"Geographical clustering of mortality from systemic lupus erythematosus in the United States: contributions of poverty, Hispanic ethnicity and solar radiation The objective was to investigate whether spatial variation in poverty, Hispanic ethnicity, and solar radiation explains the strong pattern of geographical clustering of mortality from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in the United States. SLE mortality counts for women and men of black and white race in US counties, 1979-1998, were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics. County-level poverty rates and proportions of Hispanic residents were drawn from the 1990 national census. The annual cumulative level of ambient ultraviolet 'B' radiation (UVB) was estimated for each county according to latitude, longitude, and elevation. Maps for the full study population and for sex - and race-specific subpopulations showed that the national pattern of geographical variation in SLE mortality primarily reflected the experience of white women. Formal spatial analysis of the data for white women identified 10 statistically significant, multi-county clusters--four with elevated and six with reduced SLE mortality rates. Multivariate regression modeling established that higher levels of poverty, Hispanic ethnicity, and UVB were each associated with elevated local rates of SLE mortality among white women. Statistical adjustment via the regression model was used to remove effects of these factors on local rates. In a re-application of spatial analysis to the adjusted rates, four clusters 'disappeared'. In those clusters, poverty, Hispanic ethnicity and UVB had explained an average of 58.2% of the deviations between local and national SLE mortality rates. In six clusters (including three that disappeared with adjustment), Hispanic ethnicity explained a larger percentage of the deviations between local and national rates than either poverty or UVB. In multivariate models based on data for black women and for men of both races, poverty and UVB had similar effects on SLE mortality rates to those observed among white women. However, Hispanic ethnicity was not a significant predictor of SLE mortality in any of these other groups. The contributions of poverty, Hispanic ethnicity and solar radiation to geographical variation of SLE mortality in the United States are substantial, but these factors do not fully account for the clustering phenomenon.",Excluded

Recently, a relatively nontoxic monophosphoryl Lipid A (LAM) that retains many of the immunobiologic properties of LPS has been isolated from a polysaccharide deficient Re mutant strain of Salmonella minnesota (R595). The ability of the native endotoxic glycolipid (GL) from S. minnesota (R595) as well as diphosphoryl lipid A (LAD) and nontoxic monophosphoryl lipid A (LAM) derived from GL to protect LPS responsive (CD2F1 or C3H/HeN) and nonresponsive (C3H/HeJ) mice from 60Co gamma irradiation has been studied. Administration of GL, LAD, or LAM to CD2F1 or C3H/HeN mice (400 micrograms/kg) 24 h prior to exposure provided significant radioprotection. No protection was afforded to C3H/HeJ mice. Experiments were also conducted to determine the relative abilities of GL, LAD, and LAM to stimulate hematopoiesis as reflected by the endogenous spleen colony (E-CFU) assay.

4043,"Radiation Dose-Dependent Hippocampal Atrophy Detected With Longitudinal Volumetric Magnetic Resonance Imaging PURPOSE: After radiation therapy (RT) to the brain, patients often experience memory impairment, which may be partially mediated by damage to the hippocampus. Hippocampal sparing in RT planning is the subject of recent and ongoing clinical trials. Calculating appropriate hippocampal dose constraints would be improved by efficient in vivo measurements of hippocampal damage. In this study we sought to determine whether brain RT was associated with dose-dependent hippocampal atrophy., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Hippocampal volume was measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 52 patients who underwent fractionated, partial brain RT for primary brain tumors. Study patients had high-resolution, 3-dimensional volumetric MRI before and 1 year after RT. Images were processed using software with clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration and Conformite Europeene marking for automated measurement of hippocampal volume. Automated results were inspected visually for accuracy. Tumor and surgical changes were censored. Mean hippocampal dose was tested for correlation with hippocampal atrophy 1 year after RT. Average hippocampal volume change was also calculated for hippocampi receiving high (>40 Gy) or low (<10 Gy) mean RT dose. A multivariate analysis was conducted with linear mixed-effects modeling to evaluate other potential predictors of hippocampal volume change, including patient (random effect), age, hemisphere, sex, seizure history, and baseline volume. Statistical significance was evaluated at alpha = 0.05., RESULTS: Mean hippocampal dose was significantly correlated with hippocampal volume loss (r=-0.24, P=.03). Mean hippocampal volume was significantly reduced 1 year after high-dose RT (mean -6%, P=.009) but not after low-dose RT. In multivariate analysis, both RT dose and patient age were significant predictors of hippocampal atrophy (P<.01)., CONCLUSIONS: The hippocampus demonstrates radiation dose-dependent atrophy after treatment for brain tumors. Quantitative MRI is a noninvasive imaging technique capable of measuring radiation effects on intracranial structures. This technique could be investigated as a potential biomarker for development of reliable dose constraints for improved cognitive outcomes. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Limited data are available regarding long-term vision-targeted health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of adult retinoblastoma survivors. OBJECTIVE To examine vision-targeted HRQoL as reported on the 25-item National Eye Institute Visual Field Questionnaire for overall and specific scale scores among adult survivors of retinoblastoma. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Retinoblastoma Survivor Study is a retrospective cohort of adult retinoblastoma survivors treated at 3 academic medical centers in New York between 1932 and 1994. Participants completed a comprehensive questionnaire between April 2008 and June 2010. Items were scored in January 2013 and preliminary analyses were performed in July 2015. Models were finalized in May 2017. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Self-reported vision-targeted HRQoL as reported on the 25-item National Eye Institute Visual Field Questionnaire. Items are scored from 0 to 100, with 100 representing the highest quality of life. RESULTS Among 470 adult retinoblastoma survivors (53.6% with bilateral disease; 52.1% female; 86.4% white and non-Hispanic; mean age at study, 43.3 years; range, 18.0-77.0 years), 86% had at least 1 eye removed (1 eye, 74.5%; both eyes, 11.5%); 56.5% were previously treated with radiotherapy; and 61.3% rated their eyesight as excellent/good while 16.2% reported complete blindness. The overall mean (SD) VFQ composite score for all survivors was 81.1 (17.2) (mean [SD] score for unilateral retinoblastoma survivors, 91.4 [7.7]; bilateral retinoblastoma survivors, 72.3 [18.2]; difference between survivors with unilateral and bilateral disease, 19.1 [95% CI, 16.5-21.7; P < .001]). Prior exposure to radiotherapy was not associated with decreased overall VFQ (s = -0.08; 95% CI, -0.15 to 0.002; P = .06) but was related to a few specific subdomains of visual functioning. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings suggest retinoblastoma-related oculo-visual problems are associated with functional status and vision-targeted HRQoL of adult survivors, particularly among those with bilateral disease.Copyright © 2018 American Medical Association.

4150,"Utility of postoperative radiographs after anterior lumbar interbody fusion with or without posterior instrumentation STUDY DESIGN.: Retrospective clinical and radiographical review. OBJECTIVE.: To evaluate the utility of plain radiographical surveillance after anterior lumbar interbody fusion and determine to what extent radiographical findings affect postoperative decision making. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA.: Postoperative radiographical surveillance is a ubiquitous practice among spine surgeons, which lacks evidence and has received growing attention in an environment of increasing health care cost and receding resources. Lumbar interbody fusions are being performed with increasing frequency from numerous approaches; nonetheless, there are no evidence-based guidelines for postoperative radiographical evaluation of patients after these procedures. METHODS.: One hundred forty-six consecutive patients who underwent anterior lumbar interbody fusion with or without short segment posterior fusion from 2008 to 2011 were reviewed. Exclusion criteria were less than 6 months of follow-up, prior surgery, hybrid constructs with disc arthroplasty, and concurrent posterior fusion of greater than 3 levels. Three hundred fifty-nine radiographical series and 330 clinic notes of the included 67 patients were reviewed. Radiographs were evaluated for abnormalities and clinic notes reviewed for any changes in clinical management by multiple reviewers. Interobserver reliability, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated. RESULTS.: There was no single instance of a change in treatment course based on radiographical findings alone in any of the 330 clinic visits of the 67 included patients during an average 15.8-month postoperative follow-up period. Thirty-four of the 67 patients (51%) had some change in their management on the basis of their clinical symptoms and/or examination. Interobserver agreement for change in management was 0.96 (kappa = 0.918). Sensitivity (6%), specificity (97%), positive predictive value (67%), and negative predictive value (50%) were calculated. CONCLUSION.: Routine postoperative radiographical surveillance has minimal value for asymptomatic patients after anterior lumbar interbody fusion with or without posterior fusion. Obtaining a limited number of postoperative films of these patients in the absence of clinical symptoms or risk factors could significantly reduce health care costs and unnecessary radiation exposure. © 2013, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Excluded
4716,"Assessing Sensorimotor Function Following ISS with Computerized Dynamic Posturography INTRODUCTION: Postflight postural ataxia reflects both the control strategies adopted for movement in microgravity and the direct effects of deconditioning. Computerized dynamic posturography (CDP) has been used during the first decade of the International Space Station (ISS) expeditions to quantify the initial postflight decrements and recovery of postural stability., METHODS: The CDP data were obtained on 37 crewmembers as part of their pre- and postflight medical examinations. Sensory organization tests evaluated the ability to make effective use of (or suppress inappropriate) visual, vestibular, and somatosensory information for balance control. This report focuses on eyes closed conditions with either a fixed or sway-referenced base of support, with the head erect or during pitch-head tilts (+/- 20degree at 0.33 Hz). Equilibrium scores were derived from peak-to-peak anterior-posterior sway. Motor-control tests were also used to evaluate a crewmember's ability to automatically recover from unexpected support-surface perturbations., RESULTS: The standard Romberg condition was the least sensitive. Dynamic head tilts led to increased incidence of falls and revealed significantly longer recovery than head-erect conditions. Improvements in postflight postural performance during the later expeditions may be attributable to higher preflight baselines and/or advanced exercise capabilities aboard the ISS., CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic assessment of postural instability is more pronounced during unstable-support conditions requiring active head movements. In addition to supporting return-to-duty decisions by flight surgeons, the CDP provides a standardized sensorimotor measure that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of countermeasures designed to either minimize deconditioning on orbit or promote reconditioning upon return to Earth.",Excluded
4505,"Straylight measurements as an indication for cataract surgery PURPOSE: To assess adding straylight measurements to the indication for cataract surgery., SETTING: Onze Lieve Vrouwe Hospital, Amsterdam, and Zonnestraal Eye Clinic, Hilversum, The Netherlands., DESIGN: Prospective interventional cohort study., METHODS: Before and after cataract extraction, corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) and straylight were recorded in all patients. Subjective complaints were documented by the 39-item National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-39) and a straylight questionnaire., RESULTS: The population comprised 217 patients with a mean age of 72 years +/- 9.12 (SD) (range 29 to 90 years). Preoperatively, the mean straylight was 1.55 +/- 0.29 log(s) and the mean CDVA, 0.28 +/- 0.21 logMAR. Visual acuity and straylight showed little correlation (R(2) = 0.08). The mean postoperative improvement in CDVA was 0.26 +/- 0.20 logMAR (range -0.12 to 1.12 logMAR) and in straylight, 0.31 +/- 0.32 log(s) (range -0.50 to 1.27 log[s]). The preoperative breakeven point (50% chance of postoperative improvement) was 0.06 logMAR for CDVA and 1.29 log(s) for straylight. Preoperative and postoperative questionnaires showed straylight had almost the same influence as visual acuity on quality of vision., CONCLUSIONS: Straylight and visual acuity measure different aspects of quality of vision and influenced subjective visual quality almost equally. When straylight was added to preoperative considerations of cataract extraction, postoperative results were more predictable., FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE: The Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences has a proprietary interest in the C-Quant Straylight meter.

4860,"Dual-energy CT angiography-derived virtual non-contrast images for follow-up of patients with surgically clipped aneurysms: a retrospective study Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic performance, image quality, artifacts, and radiation doses of virtual non-contrast (VNC) images, relative to true non-contrast (TNC) images, in patients with surgically clipped aneurysms. Method(s): Seventy-six patients who underwent unenhanced computed tomography (CT) and dual-energy (DE)-CT angiography after surgical clipping of 85 intracranial aneurysms were included in the study. Diagnostic performances of VNC and TNC images were compared with respect to sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values. The results of quantitative and qualitative analyses were compared between VNC and TNC images. Radiation doses were also compared between VNC and TNC images. Result(s): Diagnostic performance of VNC images was lower than that of TNC images; however, addition of contrast-enhanced images improved diagnostic performance. Image noise and mean attenuation of VNC images were significantly higher than those of TNC images in the centrum semiovale, cerebellum, and pons. The quality of VNC images was excellent or sufficient (85.5% for observer 1, 85.5% for observer 2), and complete acceptance of VNC images was achieved in 64.5% for observer 1 and in 71.0% for observer 2; however, the addition of contrast-enhanced images increased the level of acceptance (92.0% for observer 1, 90.9% for observer 2). Clip artifacts were significantly lower in VNC images than in TNC images. CT dose index, dose-length product, and effective dose were significantly lower without TNC images. Conclusion(s): VNC images showed lower diagnostic performance and image quality, and higher image noise than TNC images; however, VNC images could reduce clip artifacts and radiation doses.Copyright © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded

4059,"Investigation of awareness levels about the radiation safety of personnel working in the imaging units of the hospitals in Agri, Turkey Radiation treatments, which are frequent and hidden hazards in imaging centers in hospitals, seriously affect employee health. In general, people think that there will be nothing to them because they do not know the damage of the radiation. It is not possible to stay away from radiation in some professions. For example, the radiology officials, their job is to identify the disease in people with radiographic method has no chance of dealing with radiation. That's why we need to do our job by getting enough information about radiation and its hazards, and by protecting ourselves and our environment from the dangers of radiation. Therefore, our study aimed to determine the level of information about employee safety of the health personnel working in public and private hospitals in Agri city centrum. Data was collected through a questionnaire by answering the questions of the personnel under observation in the imaging centers of hospitals. All official permits required for our work have been obtained from the necessary authorities. Results showed the inadequacy of knowledge related to ionizing radiation of the personnel, and the necessity of the implementation of radiological examinations by planning training for the safe use.Copyright © 2017 The Egyptian Society of Radiation Sciences and Applications",Excluded
4826,"Alterations in expression and structure of the DNA repair gene XRCC1 The repair-associated gene XRCC1 was previously cloned by complementing the hamster mutant EM9, which has a high rate of spontaneous SCE and hypersensitivity to DNA damaging agents. In analyzing XRCC1 gene expression, similar levels of steady-state mRNA were found in normal cells, Bloom's syndrome cells with altered SCE, and in squamous carcinoma cells with differential X-ray sensitivity. An EcoRI restriction fragment-length polymorphism previously identified in XRCC1 did not correlate with the repair phenotypes of these cells. The mRNA of XRCC1 decreased to 20-40% after treatment of cells with a DNA damaging agent. XRCC1 also showed tissue specific expression in rats. The mRNA levels were high in testis (7-8 fold), ovary (3-4 fold) and brain (4-5 fold), when compared with those in intestine, liver and spleen (1-2 fold). These data and the high levels of XRCC1 protein detected in testis indicate that XRCC1 may play an important role in DNA processing during meiogenesis and recombination in germ cells.",Excluded
4783,"Taste dysfunction in patients receiving radiotherapy BACKGROUND: Taste loss is a major cause of morbidity in patients undergoing head and neck irradiation., METHODS: In a prospective study, 51 patients undergoing radical head and neck irradiation at the Tokyo University Hospital were assessed for taste loss. Taste ability was measured by the taste threshold for the four basic tastes (sweet, sour, salt, and bitter qualities) plus another taste of ""umami"" quality using a filter-paper-disc method in patients before, during, and after radiotherapy (RT)., RESULTS: All tastes declined on the fifth week after the start of RT and improved on the 11th week. Anatomic pathologic analyses in rats revealed that taste buds diminished completely on the sixth day after irradiation of 15 Gy in a single fraction, and the appearance of taste buds returned almost to the preirradiation state on the 28th day., CONCLUSIONS: The main cause of taste disorder resulting from RT was believed to be a disappearance of taste buds and not damage to the taste nerves.",Excluded
4297,"Surgeon's radiation exposure during percutaneous vertebroplasty OBJECT: In this study the authors evaluated levels of radiation exposure to surgeons' protected and unprotected hands during fluoroscopically assisted vertebroplasty., METHODS: The amount of radiation administered to 30 patients during 41 procedures in a controlled prospective trial over 6 months was assessed, comparing radiation exposure to the right and left hands in two neurosurgeons. Effective skin doses were evaluated using thermoluminescent finger dosimeters (ring dosimeters). The ratios of finger dosimeter exposure were compared between the glove-protected and unprotected left hands of two surgeons and both unprotected right hands. In addition, dose-area product (DAP) and fluoroscopy times were recorded in all patients. The mean treatment-effective dose to the surgeons' hands was 0.49 +/- 0.4 mSv in the glove-protected left hand and 1.81 +/- 1.31 mSv in the unprotected left hand (p < 0.05). The mean effective hand doses were 0.59 +/- 0.55 mSv in the unprotected right hand of the glove-protected surgeon and 0.62 +/- 0.55 mSv in the unprotected right hand of the control surgeon. The total corresponding fluoroscopy time was 38.55 minutes for the protected surgeon and 41.23 minutes for the unprotected one (p > 0.05). Lead glove shielding resulted in a radiation dose reduction of 75%. The total DAP for all procedures was 256,496 mGy/cm2 and 221,408 mGy/cm2 (p > 0.05) for the protected and unprotected surgeons, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasizes the importance of surgeons wearing lead glove protection on their leading hands during percutaneous vertebroplasty procedures and demonstrates a 75% reduction rate of exposure to radiation.",Excluded

4685,"Multivariable normal-tissue complication modeling of acute esophageal toxicity in advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with intensity-modulated (chemo-)radiotherapy Background and purpose The majority of normal-tissue complication probability (NTCP) models for acute esophageal toxicity (AET) in advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer (AS-NSCLC) patients treated with (chemo-)radiotherapy are based on three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT). Due to distinct dosimetric characteristics of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), 3D-CRT based models need revision. We established a multivariable NTCP model for AET in 149 AS-NSCLC patients undergoing IMRT. Materials and methods An established model selection procedure was used to develop an NTCP model for Grade >=2 AET (53 patients) including clinical and esophageal dose-volume histogram parameters. Results The NTCP model predicted an increased risk of Grade >=2 AET in case of: concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCR) [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 14.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.70-42.19; p < 0.001], increasing mean esophageal dose [Dmean; OR 1.12 per Gy increase, 95% CI 1.06-1.19; p < 0.001], female patients (OR 3.33, 95% CI 1.36-8.17; p = 0.008), and >=cT3 (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.12-6.50; p = 0.026). The AUC was 0.82 and the model showed good calibration. Conclusions A multivariable NTCP model including CCR, Dmean, clinical tumor stage and gender predicts Grade >=2 AET after IMRT for AS-NSCLC.

4466,"Intracranial Autograft Fat Placement to Separate the Optic Chiasm from Tumor to Improve Stereotactic Radiotherapy Dosimetry Background: Radiation therapy for intracranial lesions is constrained by dose to neurologic organs at risk. Case Description: We report 2 cases, a newly diagnosed chondrosarcoma and a previously irradiated meningioma, with tumors that abutted the optic chiasm following subtotal resection. Definitive radiotherapy would have required either undercoverage of the tumor or treatment of the chiasm with doses posing an unacceptable risk of blindness. Therefore, the patients underwent open surgery with placement of an abdominal fat autograft to provide space between the tumor and the optic structures at risk. Patients received definitive fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy. For each patient, we retrospectively compared the treated plan (with fat autograft) to a second plan generated using the pre-autograft imaging, maintaining similar tumor coverage. For the chondrosarcoma, the fat autograft reduced the optic chiasm maximum dose by 21% (70.4 Gy to 55.3 Gy). For the reirradiated peri-optic meningioma, the optic chiasm maximum dose was reduced by 10% (50.8 Gy to 45.9 Gy), the left optic nerve by 17% (48.9 Gy to 40.4 Gy), and the right optic nerve by 30% (32.3 Gy to 22.6 Gy). Conclusion(s): We demonstrate the utility of abdominal fat autograft placement to maximize coverage of tumor while minimizing dose to intracranial organs at risk.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

To evaluate the utility of serum and urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) in depicting an event of contrast material-induced nephropathy (CIN) in patients who received iodinated contrast media, gadoterate meglumine, or radiopharmaceutical technetium-99m ( 99mTc) and to evaluate the protective effect exerted by isotonic saline infusion, sodium bicarbonate administration, or N-acetylcysteine administration. Material(s) and Method(s): Institutional ethics committee approval was given, and informed consent was obtained. One hundred twenty patients were enrolled in a prospective study and divided into three groups: iomeprol group, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging group (gadoterate meglumine), and renal scintigraphy group (99mTc). They randomly received Nacetylcysteine, physiologic saline, or sodium bicarbonate. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, Kaplan- Meier curves, and Cox proportional hazard regression analysis were used. Result(s): In the MR imaging and renal scintigraphy groups, there were significant changes in serum creatinine and NGAL levels, and there were no cases of CIN. In the iomeprol group, an early rise in NGAL was found, while serum creatinine level changes occurred 24 hours after contrast material administration. At ROC analysis, NGAL showed high sensitivity and specificity (serum NGAL: area under the curve, 0.995; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.868, 0.992; urinary NGAL: area under the curve, 0.992; 95% CI: 0.925, 1.000) in identifying CIN 8 hours after iomeprol administration.

Patients and Methods Patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC, performance status of 0 to 1, and adequate organ function were accrued in 2 strata, low- and high-risk (squamous histology, hemoptysis, tumor with cavitation and/or adjacent to a major vessel). Cohort 1 patients received cisplatin 50 mg/m2 days (d) 1 and 8, etoposide 50 mg/m2 (d 1-5) for 2 cycles concurrent with radiotherapy (64.8 Gy) followed by docetaxel (D) 75 mg/m2 and B 15 mg/kg for 3 cycles. If safety was established, then accrual would continue to cohort 2 (B, d 15, 36, 57) and then subsequently to cohort 3 (B, d 1, 22, 43). Results Twenty-nine patients (17 low- and 12 high-risk) registered to cohort 1. Twenty-six patients (including 4 squamous, 1 adenosquamous) were assessable. Twenty-five completed CRT. Grade 3/4 toxicities during CRT included acceptable rates of hematologic toxicity, esophagitis, and pneumonitis. Of 21 assessable for safety with D/B consolidation, major adverse events were pneumonitis (2 Grade 3) and 2 episodes of fatal hemoptysis in the high-risk group, resulting in closure of this stratum. The low-risk stratum subsequently closed because of slow accrual. Median overall survival was 46 months for low-risk and 17 months for high-risk strata. Conclusion Bevacizumab was not safely integrated into CRT for stage III NSCLC in patients considered at high risk for hemoptysis. In lower risk patients, data are insufficient to determine safety or efficacy.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
4406,"Tolerance of half-body irradiation as systemic therapy for patients with locally advanced breast cancer Background. Locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) is one of the main causes of cancer death among women in Bulgaria. In 1988, when this study started, there was still controversy about the role of chemotherapy in controlling systemic disease. There were encouraging results from the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 82-06 study suggesting that half-body irradiation (HBI) should be used earlier in the disease course to prevent the development of metastases. There were many patients with LABC requiring treatment, but there was a problem with obtaining the drugs needed; they were expensive and not consistently available. Procedure. Taking into account the medical contraindications to chemotherapy treatment, its toxicity, and the possibility of chemoresistance, we initiated this study to look at the effects of HBI given as two fractions of 4 Gy to the upper and then lower parts of the body, after surgery and before local radiotherapy. Results. The acute tolerance of this regimen in 36 patients with LABC was as good as it was in 4 additional LABC patients with M1 disease, and hematologic recovery was satisfactory. Conclusions. We conclude that systemic treatment with HBI is tolerable. It therefore may be a convenient and cost-effective treatment for LABC, although better treatments are still needed.",Excluded
4024,"Dynamic in vivo profiling of DNA damage and repair after radiotherapy using canine patients as a model Time resolved data of DNA damage and repair after radiotherapy elucidates the relation between damage, repair, and cell survival. While well characterized in vitro, little is known about the time-course of DNA damage response in tumors sampled from individual patients. Kinetics of DNA damage after radiotherapy was assessed in eight dogs using repeated in vivo samples of tumor and co-irradiated normal tissue analyzed with comet assay and phosphorylated H2AX (gammaH2AX) immunohistochemistry. In vivo results were then compared (in silico) with a dynamic mathematical model for DNA damage formation and repair. Maximum %DNA in tail was observed at 15-60 min after irradiation, with a rapid decrease. Time-courses of gammaH2AX-foci paralleled these findings with a small time delay and were not influenced by covariates. The evolutionary parameter search based on %DNA in tail revealed a good fit of the DNA repair model to in vivo data for pooled sarcoma time-courses, but fits for individual sarcoma time-courses suffer from the heterogeneous nature of the in vivo data. It was possible to follow dynamics of comet tail intensity and gammaH2AX-foci during a course of radiation using a minimally invasive approach. DNA repair can be quantitatively investigated as time-courses of individual patients by integrating this resulting data into a dynamic mathematical model.Copyright © 2017 by the authors.

The main objective was to study the change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) over 6 months from ranibizumab 0.5 mg (experimental) compared to focal laser of the macula and panretinal laser treatment of the ischemic retina (control) in patients with radiation retinopathy in choroidal melanoma. The secondary objectives of the radiation retinopathy study were to compare functional and anatomical results between ranibizumab and laser group over 12 months and to measure the frequency of vitreous hemorrhage and rubeosis iridis., RESULTS: The intention-to-treat analysis included 31 patients assigned to ranibizumab (n = 15) or laser treatment (n = 16). In terms of BCVA at month 6, ranibizumab was superior to laser treatment, with an advantage of 0.14 logMAR, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.25, p = 0.030. The positive effect of ranibizumab disappeared after treatment was discontinued. Similar results without statistically significant difference were found with respect to macular thickness. In both groups, no change was observed at month 6 in the size of ischemia in the macula or periphery compared to baseline. There was 1 case of vitreous hemorrhage in the laser group and no case of rubeosis iridis over time., CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a statistically significant improvement in visual acuity and clear superiority of ranibizumab compared to laser treatment up to 26 weeks, but this effect disappeared at week 52 after completion of intravitreal treatment. Ranibizumab and PRP are considered equivalent in terms of the non-appearance of proliferative radiation retinopathy during the study., TRIAL REGISTRATION: EudraCT Number: 2011-004463-69.",Excluded
3948,"The risk of level IB nodal involvement in oropharynx cancer: Guidance for submandibular gland sparing irradiation Purpose Xerostomia remains a common side effect of head and neck irradiation. Conflicting data exist regarding the likelihood of level IB involvement for patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (OPSCC), and data are limited on this risk in patients with human papillomavirus-positive disease. This study examined surgically treated OPSCC to determine the risk of pathologic level IB nodal involvement and to identify a cohort of patients in whom ipsilateral level IB radiation therapy may be safely omitted. Methods and materials A total of 102 submandibular nodal dissections were identified (92 ipsilateral and 10 contralateral) in 92 patients from 2010 to 2016 in those undergoing primary surgical treatment and dissection of ipsilateral level IB lymph nodes. Radiographically positive cases were excluded. Retrospective chart review was used for data collection, and the rate of pathologic level IB involvement was determined. Results The ipsilateral level IB nodal station had negative imaging and pathologically positive nodes at rates of 4.3% in OPSCC and 5.3% in human papillomavirus-positive OPSCC. Positive node burden in the ipsilateral neck at stations other than IB appeared to correlate with the risk of pathologic positive IB (pIB+) nodes: 50% of pathologically IB-negative patients had 2 or more positive nodes versus 75% of pIB+ patients who had 4 or more positive nodes. Conclusions Our data indicate a low risk of pathologic level IB involvement in early-stage OPSCC. High positive node burden in stations near level IB may be associated with a higher chance of pathologic level IB involvement.Copyright © 2017 American Society for Radiation Oncology",Excluded
3740,"Cytogenetic assessment of heterogeneous radiation doses in cancer patients treated with fractionated radiotherapy The purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vivo dose-response relation of chromosome aberration formation and distribution in a context of localised and fractionated radiotherapy. Cytogenetic analysis was applied to eight patients, all treated for the same tumour localisation; the same localisation was used to prevent the variability usually observed between patients treated with radiotherapy and to allow the corresponding roles of the size of irradiation field and of the dose rate to be studied. The yield of dicentrics, centric rings and fragments was measured in blood samples taken before treatment, during the course of radiotherapy and up to 6 months after. After the first fraction of radiotherapy, we observed that the whole-body dose estimated from the yield of dicentrics and rings was higher (0.35+/-0.2 Gy) than the calculated equivalent whole-body dose (0.07+/-0.04 Gy). By contrast, the partial-body dose derived from the Qdr (quotient of dicentrics and rings) model was estimated to be 2.2+/-0.3 Gy, which agreed quite well with the dose delivered to the tumour (2.1+/-0.1 Gy). We also found a correlation between the yield of induced chromosome aberrations and the target field size (p = 0.014). U-value analysis showed that the distribution of dicentrics and rings was overdispersed, despite the fractionation of the exposure, and a positive correlation between the U-value and the dose rate was observed (p = 0.017). Overall, these results suggest that the proportion of undamaged lymphocytes could increase with the dose rate.",Excluded
4765,"Feasibility and Safety of Ultrasonography Guidance and Flank Position during Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy Purpose: Percutaneous nephrolithotomy is generally performed using fluoroscopy, which is associated with exposure to radiation. Another drawback of fluoroscopic guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy is the prone position, which is not suitable for all patients. In this study we evaluated the feasibility, safety and efficacy of ultrasound guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy with the patient in the flank position. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 603 patients with a mean +/- SD age of 50.9 +/- 13 years were included in this study from December 2010 to July 2016. Access to the collecting system and tract dilation were performed under ultrasound guidance. Perioperative data on the stone-free rate, operative time, length of stay and complication rates were recorded. Result(s): Successful access was achieved in all but 1 patient. Mean operative time was 56.6 +/- 6.5 minutes. Complete stone clearance was achieved in 529 patients (87.7%) and Clavien-Dindo grade 3 complications were noted in 17 (2.8%). Blood transfusion was necessary in 43 patients (7.1%). However, bleeding was self-limited in all cases and did not require angioembolization. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge this is the largest series of ultrasound guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy with the patient in the flank position. Unlike in other studies we used this procedure in all patients irrespective of stone burden, renal anomaly and body habitus. Ultrasound guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy has outcomes comparable to those of conventional percutaneous nephrolithotomy and it is not associated with radiation exposure. Furthermore, anesthesia while in the flank position might be less harmful in some patients, including those with obesity or cardiopulmonary comorbidities.Copyright © 2018 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.",Excluded
4432,"The influence of radiotherapy techniques on the plan quality and on the risk of secondary tumors in patients with pituitary adenoma Background: This planning study compares different radiotherapy techniques for patients with pituitary adenoma, including flatness filter free mode (FFF), concerning plan quality and secondary malignancies for potentially young patients. The flatness filter has been described as main source of photon scatter. Material(s) and Method(s): Eleven patients with pituitary adenoma were included. An Elekta SynergyTM linac was used in the treatment planning system Oncentra and for the measurements. 3D plans, IMRT, and VMAT plans and non-coplanar varieties were considered. The plan quality was evaluated regarding homogeneity, conformity, delivery time and dose to the organs at risk. The secondary malignancy risk was calculated from dose volume data and from measured dose to the periphery using different models for carcinoma and sarcoma risk. Result(s): The homogeneity and conformity were nearly unchanged with and without flattening filter, neither was the delivery time found substantively different. VMAT plans were more homogenous, conformal and faster in delivery than IMRT plans. The secondary cancer risk was reduced with FFF both in the treated region and in the periphery. VMAT plans resulted in a higher secondary brain cancer risk than IMRT plans, but the risk for secondary peripheral cancer was reduced. Secondary sarcoma risk plays a minor role. No advantage was found for non-coplanar techniques. The FFF delivery times were not shortened due to additional monitor units needed and technical limitations. The risk for secondary brain cancer seems to depend on the irradiated volume. Secondary sarcoma risk is much smaller than carcinoma risk in accordance to the results of the atomic bomb survivors. The reduction of the peripheral dose and resulting secondary malignancy risk for FFF is statistically significant. However, it is negligible in comparison to the risk in the treated region. Conclusion(s): Treatments with FFF can reduce secondary malignancy risk while retaining similar quality as with flattening filter and should be preferred. VMAT plans show the best plan quality combined with lowest peripheral secondary malignancy risk, but highest level of second brain cancer risk. Taking this into account VMAT FFF seems the most advantageous technique for the treatment of pituitary adenomas with the given equipment.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).",Excluded

Method(s): Sixteen male and 12 female patients aged 17-67 years (mean 31.3 years) were retrospectively identified among 868 patients who underwent GKS for AVM at our hospital. The pathological characteristics of the reddish nodular lesion and chronic encapsulated expanding haematoma associated with cyst following GKS for AVM were examined. Result(s): Cyst was associated with chronic encapsulated expanding haematoma in 13, and with nodular lesion in 12 patients. The nidus volume at GKS was 0.1-36 ml (median 6.0 ml), and the prescription dose at the nidus margin was 18-25 Gy (median 20 Gy). Cyst formation was detected from 1.1 to 16 years (mean 7.3 years) after GKS. Seven of the 12 patients with nodular lesion underwent surgery. Ten of the 13 patients with expanding haematoma underwent surgical removal of expanding haematoma. Histological examination was possible in 17 cases. Dilated capillary vessels with wall damage such as hyalinisation and fibrinoid necrosis, marked protein exudation and haemorrhage were the most common findings. Brain parenchyma was observed among the dilated vessels in some cases. Structureless necrotic tissue was not evident. Conclusion(s): The present study suggests that enhanced nodular lesion on magnetic resonance imaging and chronic encapsulated expanding haematoma associated with cyst may have common aetiopathology caused by late radiation effects, mainly consisting of dilated capillary vessels with wall damage. Massive protein exudation from such damaged capillary vessels is important in cyst development.Copyright © 2014, Springer-Verlag Wien.",Excluded

Method(s): This is a retrospective single-centre review of fTEVAR endografts for aortic arch pathology over 24 months. Seven patients with mean age of 72.8 years (range 63-84 years) were included. A total of 15 supra-aortic branches were treated [left subclavian artery (n = 7), left carotid artery (n = 5), innominate artery (n = 1), bovine origins (n = 2)], involving a total of nine fenestrations and six scallops. No supra-aortic debranching was required. Result(s): Median follow-up was 15 months. Technical success was 86%, and one patient had malalignment of the fTEVAR endograft requiring salvage with double chimney technique. There were no early endoleaks with one type 2 endoleak detected in the follow-up period. Two access site pseudoaneurysms required intervention. There was a learning curve involved reflected by higher than average mean operative time of 224 min with average radiation dose of 3029.86 mGy and mean contrast volume of 283 mls. Conclusion(s): fTEVAR in the aortic arch is feasible in Asian patients, although there was a learning curve involved, and careful patient selection is advised. Longer term data in a larger population are required to assess its durability.Copyright © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature and the Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe (CIRSE).",Excluded
4157,"Evaluation of non ionizing radiation around the dielectric heaters and sealers: A case report Dielectric heaters and sealers present the most common source of occupational exposure to excessive radio frequency (RF) fields. These systems are used industrially to heat or melt dielectric materials. Nowadays, the effects of high frequency electromagnetic (EM) fields on the health have been discussed frequently but there are few health studies done for workers around dielectric heaters and sealers. In this study, the leakage fields around dielectric heaters and sealers (27.12MHz) were measured in MKE Mechanical and Chemical Industry Corporation, Gazi Rocket Factory and evaluated in terms of standards. It has been observed that operators exposed to same RF fields with occupational exposure limits. Many workers have health complaints, such as elevated body temperatures in the factory. Safe distances or areas for workers should be recommended in these systems. Protective measures could be implemented to minimize these exposures. Further measurements and occupational exposure studies of RF exposed women and men are needed to demonstrate the levels of exposed Radio Frequency Radiation (RFR). Precautions should therefore be taken either to reduce the leakage fields or minimise the exposed fields. 2010 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.",Excluded
4294,"Efficacy and safety of single-session argon plasma coagulation in the management of chronic radiation proctitis Background: Chronic radiation proctitis (CRP) manifests as rectal bleeding 12 to 24 months after pelvic radiotherapy. No criterion standard of treatment has been established, although argon plasma coagulation (APC) has increasingly become the treatment of choice. Previous studies have applied APC over multiple sessions, necessitating increased numbers of treatments. Objective(s): To assess the safety and efficacy of large-volume APC application in the treatment of CRP with the intention of a single-session treatment protocol. Design(s): Prospective study. Setting(s): Tertiary referral hospital. Patient(s): Over an 8-year period, consecutive patients with CRP with rectal bleeding were prospectively enrolled. Intervention(s): Large-volume APC application to affected rectal mucosa. Main Outcome Measurements: Number of treatments, bleeding scores, complications. Result(s): Fifty patients (mean age 72.1 years; range 51-87 years) were treated; 45 were men (prostate cancer). The mean period between radiotherapy and initial APC treatment was 23 months (range 4-140 months). Seventeen (34%) patients had grade A endoscopic severity, 23 (46%) grade B, and 10 (20%) grade C. Other therapies failed in 16 (32%) patients. The mean number of treatments was 1.36 (range 1-3) with a mean follow-up of 20.6 months (range 6-48 months). Sixty-eight percent of patients were successfully treated after 1 session and 96% after 2 sessions. Bleeding scores improved in all patients (P < .001). Seventeen (34%) patients experienced short-term, self-limiting complications; 1 (2%) patient experienced a long-term complication. Limitation(s): Nonrandomized study. Conclusion(s): Large-volume APC treatment was successful in the treatment of CRP, including those in whom other therapies had previously failed, and resulted in a decreased number of treatments compared with other published studies. The benefits were offset by an increased incidence of short-term complications but no increase in long-term complications. © 2010 American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.",Excluded

4148,"Infratentorial craniospinal irradiation for von Hippel-Lindau: A retrospective study supporting a new treatment for patients with CNS hemangioblastomas Patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome with diffuse CNS hemangioblastomas have morbidity related to their disease and require a lifetime of surgical resections. Ninety-seven percent of tumors progress, and 5-year surgery rates are 20%-60%. Stereotactic radiosurgery and fractionated radiotherapy have had limited success. For the first time, we have used infratentorial craniospinal radiation therapy (ICSRT) for VHL patients with CNS hemangioblastomas. Consecutive VHL patients treated at the National Institutes of Health with radiographic evidence of hemangioblastomas were included if they received ICSRT. Patients underwent neurologic examinations and imaging at 3- to 12-month intervals. Seven patients with 84 hemangioblastomas met eligibility criteria. ICSRT was commonly administered to 43.2 Gy in 24 fractions. Mean pre-ICSRT tumor volume was 5.48 cm3. At a mean follow-up of 73.8 months, mean post-ICSRT tumor volume was 6.87 cm3, and 91 tumors were identified. Complete radiographic resolution was achieved in 17.9% of lesions. Although many patients were no longer optimal surgical candidates, only 4 surgeries were needed for symptomatic lesions after ICSRT, compared with 33 prior. Acute toxicity was mild and no patient developed grade >=1 late spinal cord toxicity according to the criteria of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer, despite the high dose that the entire spinal cord received. Clinical and radiographic stability or resolution was demonstrated in the majority of tumors. Tumor growth rate in this study was less than reported in natural history studies, and the rate of surgical intervention was reduced. ICSRT was well tolerated, can decrease hemangioblastoma growth rate, and is a potential therapeutic option for VHL patients that warrants further investigation. © 2011 The Author(s).",Excluded
4237,"Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or robotic radiosurgery (RRS) for salvage treatment of colorectal liver metastases Background. Stereotactic radiation therapy is an evolving modality to treat otherwise unresectable liver metastases. In this analysis, two local therapies: 1) single session robotic radiosurgery (RRS) and 2) percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) were compared in a total of 60 heavily pretreated colorectal cancer patients. Methods. Thirty patients with a total of 35 colorectal liver metastases not qualifying for surgery that were treated in curative intent with RRS were prospectively followed. To compare efficacy of both treatment modalities, patients treated with RFA during the same period of time were matched according to number and size of the treated lesions. Local tumor control, local disease free survival (DFS), and freedom from distant recurrence (FFDR) were analyzed for efficacy. Treatment-related side effects were recorded for comparison. Results. The median diameter of the treated lesions was 33 mm (7-53 mm). Baseline characteristics did not differ significantly between the groups. One- and two-year local control rates showed no significant difference but favored RRS (85% vs. 65% and 80% vs. 61%, respectively). A significantly longer local DFS of patients treated with RRS compared to RFA (34.4 months vs. 6.0 months; p < 0.001) was found. Both, median FFDR (11.4 months for RRS vs. 7.1 months for RFA p = 0.25) and the recurrence rate (67% for RRS and 63% for RFA, p > 0.99) were comparable. Conclusion. Single session RRS is a safe and effective method to treat colorectal liver metastases. In this analysis, a trend towards longer DFS was seen in patients treated with RRS when compared to RFA.Copyright © 2013 Informa Healthcare.",Excluded
3939,"Long-term outcome, relapse patterns, and toxicity after radiotherapy for orbital mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma: Implications for radiotherapy optimization Objectives: Although mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (MALToma) is sensitive to radiation therapy (RT), the optimal RT dose and treatment volumes have not been established. This study aimed to assess the relapse patterns and outcomes of patients with orbital MALToma who underwent RT and to suggest implications for optimized RT. Method(s): We reviewed 212 patients (246 orbits) diagnosed with orbital MALToma who received RT between 1993 and 2013. Median RT dose was 25.2 Gy. Generally, conjunctival and eyelid lesions were irradiated with electrons, whereas retrobulbar and lacrimal gland lesions with photons. Lens shielding was used for 70% of treated eyes, mainly conjunctival and eyelid tumors. Result(s): Relapse occurred in 29 patients. Among 11 patients with local relapse (LR), 4 were attributed to insufficient dose (n = 2) and improper RT volume (n = 2). The 10-year LR, contralateral orbit relapse, and distant relapse rates were 8.6%, 12.8% and 4.9%, respectively. Twelve patients died of disease-specific causes (n = 1) and intercurrent diseases (n = 11). The 10-year relapse-free survival, overall survival, and cause-specific survival rates were 69.7%, 88.2% and 98.8%, respectively. Grade 3 cataracts and nasolacrimal duct obstruction were observed in 27 and 4 orbits, respectively. Conclusion(s): Low-dose RT with proper lens shielding is an appropriate treatment for orbital MALToma in terms of high disease control rate and acceptable morbidity. However, lower RT dose may be attempted to further reduce toxicity while maintaining excellent outcomes.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.",Excluded
4134,"Effects of (12)C(6+) ion radiation and ferulic acid on the zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryonic oxidative stress response and gene expression The effects of carbon ion irradiation and ferulic acid (FA) on the induction of oxidative stress and alteration of gene expression were studied in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. Zebrafish embryos at 8 hpf were divided into seven groups: the control group; the 1Gy, 3Gy and 7Gy irradiation groups; and three FA-pre-treated irradiation groups. In the irradiated groups, a significant increase in the teratogenesis of the zebrafish embryos and oxidative stress was accompanied by increased malondialdehyde (MDA) content, decreased glutathione (GSH) content and alterations in antioxidant enzyme activities (such as catalase [CAT] and superoxide dismutase [SOD]). Moreover, the mRNA levels for Cu/Zn-sod, Mn-sod, cat and gpx, the genes encoding these antioxidant proteins, were altered significantly. However, the mRNA expression patterns were not in accordance with those of the antioxidant enzymes and were more sensitive under low-dose irradiation. In addition, we detected the mRNA expression of ucp-2 and bcl-2, which are located at the mitochondrial inner membrane and related to reactive oxidative species (ROS) production. In the irradiated groups, the mRNA level of ucp-2 was significantly increased, whereas the mRNA level of bcl-2 was significantly decreased. Supplementation with FA, an antioxidant, was better able to reduce the irradiation-induced oxidative damage marked by changes in mortality, morphology, antioxidant enzyme activities and the MDA and GSH content, as well as in the mRNA expression levels. Overall, this study provided helpful information about the transcriptional effects of irradiation to better understand the mechanism of carbon ion-induced oxidative stress and FA-induced radioprotective effects.

Attenuation values of abdominal organs and image noise were measured, and the contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were calculated. Subjective image quality was assessed by three independent radiologists. Radiation exposure was assessed by size-specific dose estimate (SSDE)., RESULTS: The mean attenuation of the kidney increased by 20% at 100 kVp (p<0.0001), and the mean image noise was 27% higher in the 100 kVp (p=0.003). The CNR did not significantly differ between the groups (120 kVp, 6.6+/-2.8; 100 kVp, 7.4+/-3.6; p=0.26). Except for subjective image noise (p<0.001), no other subjective quality parameters (e.g., contrast, artefacts) were significantly different between the two groups (p between 0.094 and 0.761). The mean SSDE in the 100-kVp group (9.8+/-1.8 mGy) was reduced by 19% compared to the 120-kVp group (12.1+/-1.8 mGy; p<0.0001)., CONCLUSION: Manual reduction of tube voltage from the standard 120 to 100 kVp for portal-venous phase CT in patients with body weights <=75 kg resulted in a 19% dose reduction while maintaining objective and subjective image quality.

4542,"Preoperative Chemoradiotherapy Versus Immediate Surgery for Resectable and Borderline Resectable Pancreatic Cancer: Results of the Dutch Randomized Phase III PREOPANC Trial PURPOSE Preoperative chemoradiotherapy may improve the radical resection rate for resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer, but the overall benefit is unproven. PATIENTS AND METHODS In this randomized phase III trial in 16 centers, patients with resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer were randomly assigned to receive preoperative chemoradiotherapy, which consisted of 3 courses of gemcitabine, the second combined with 15 3 2.4 Gy radiotherapy, followed by surgery and 4 courses of adjuvant gemcitabine or to immediate surgery and 6 courses of adjuvant gemcitabine. The primary end point was overall survival by intention to treat. RESULTS Between April 2013 and July 2017, 246 eligible patients were randomly assigned; 119 were assigned to preoperative chemoradiotherapy and 127 to immediate surgery. Median overall survival by intention to treat was 16.0 months with preoperative chemoradiotherapy and 14.3 months with immediate surgery (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.05; P = .096). The resection rate was 61% and 72% (P = .058). The R0 resection rate was 71% (51 of 72) in patients who received preoperative chemoradiotherapy and 40% (37 of 92) in patients assigned to immediate surgery (P, .001). Preoperative chemoradiotherapy was associated with significantly better disease-free survival and locoregional failure-free interval as well as with significantly lower rates of pathologic lymph nodes, perineural invasion, and venous invasion. Survival analysis of patients who underwent tumor resection and started adjuvant chemotherapy showed improved survival with preoperative chemoradiotherapy (35.2 v 19.8 months; P = .029). The proportion of patients who suffered serious adverse events was 52% versus 41% (P = .096). CONCLUSION Preoperative chemoradiotherapy for resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer did not show a significant overall survival benefit. Although the outcomes of the secondary end points and predefined subgroup analyses suggest an advantage of the neoadjuvant approach, additional evidence is required.Copyright © 2020 by American Society of Clinical Oncology",Excluded
3945,"Comparison of dynamic expiratory CT with bronchoscopy for diagnosing airway malacia: A pilot evaluation Objective: To assess the accuracy of dynamic expiratory CT for detecting airway malacia using bronchoscopy as the diagnostic ""gold standard."" Material(s) and Method(s): A computerized hospital information system was used to retrospectively identify all patients with bronchoscopically proven airway malacia referred for CT airway imaging at our institution during a 19-month period. CT was performed within I week of bronchoscopy. All patients were scanned with a standard protocol, including end-inspiratory and dynamic expiratory volumetric imaging, using an eight-detector multislice helical CT scanner. For both CT and bronchoscopy, malacia was defined as >= 50% expiratory reduction of the airway lumen. CT and bronchoscopic findings were subsequently jointly reviewed by the radiologist and bronchoscopist for concordance. Result(s): Twenty-nine patients (12 men and 17 women; mean age, 60 years; range, 36 to 79 years) comprised the study cohort. CT correctly diagnosed malacia in 28 of 29 patients (97%). The most common presenting symptoms were dyspnea in 20 patients (69%), severe or persistent cough in 16 patients (55%), and recurrent infection in 7 patients (24%). The estimated radiation dose (expressed as dose-length product) for the dual-phase study is 508 mGy-cm, which is comparable to a routine chest CT. Conclusion(s): Dynamic expiratory CT is a highly sensitive method for detecting airway malacia and has the potential to serve as an effective, noninvasive test for diagnosing this condition.",Excluded
4843,"The in situ repair kinetics of epidermal thymine dimers and 6-4 photoproducts in human skin types I and II We assessed the in situ time-dependent loss of epidermal thymine dimers and 6-4 photoproducts in skin types I and II after exposure to two minimal erythema doses of solar-simulating radiation on previously unexposed buttock skin. Using quantitative image analysis, we evaluated biopsy sections stained with monoclonal antibodies. We then made comparisons, in the same volunteers, with unscheduled DNA synthesis, which is a direct marker of overall excision repair. Removal of thymine dimers was slow (half-life = 33.3 h), with high levels of lesions still present 24 h post-irradiation; some lesions were still present at 7 d. In contrast, removal of 6-4 photoproducts was rapid (half-life = 2.3 h), the decay kinetics of which correlated better with the decline in epidermal unscheduled DNA synthesis (half-life = 7.1 h). These data show that as in mouse, monkey, and in vitro models, the 6-4 photolesion is repaired preferentially in human epidermis in situ. They also raise the possibility that poor thymine dimer repair may be a feature of skin types I and II, who are more prone to skin cancer than are types III and IV. There was an inverse relationship between the onset of erythema and 6-4 photoproduct repair, suggesting that this repair process initiates erythema.",Excluded
4370,"Why to start the concomitant boost in accelerated radiotherapy for advanced laryngeal cancer in week 3 PURPOSE: We analyzed toxicity and the local control rates for advanced laryngeal cancer, treated with two accelerated fractionation schedules. The main difference between the schedules was the onset of the concomitant boost, in Week 3 or Week 4. Overall treatment time and total dose were equivalent., METHODS AND MATERIALS: In a prospective, nonrandomized study of T3, T4, and advanced T2 laryngeal cancer, concomitant boost schedules were used in 100 patients. Thirty patients received a schedule of twice daily 1.2 Gy in Weeks 1-3, followed by twice daily 1.7 Gy in Weeks 4 and 5; total dose was 70 Gy (the hyperfractionated accelerated schedule [HAS] regimen). Seventy patients were treated with 5 times 2 Gy in Weeks 1 and 2, followed by daily 1.8 Gy and 1.5 Gy (boost) in Weeks 3-5; total dose 69.5 Gy (the accelerated schedule only [ASO] regimen). Distribution of T stage was 47%, 40%, and 12% for T2, T3, and T4, respectively. In 24% of the patients, lymph nodes were positive. Pretreatment tracheotomy or stridor or both occurred in 8 patients. The distribution of prognostic factors was not significantly different between the two fractionation schedules. Acute and late toxicity was assessed. Results were estimated by the use of actuarial methods. For late toxicity and local control univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Tumor control probability analysis was used to model cure rate differences., RESULTS: Overall acute mucositis score was equal for both schedules. Acute mucositis started and decreased significantly earlier in the HAS regimen. In all patients acute mucositis healed completely. The treatment was completed within 38 days in all patients. The regional control rate was 100% for clinical N0, and 75% for the clinical N+ patients. The 3-year local control rate was 59% and 78% for the HAS and ASO regimens, respectively (p = 0.05); the ultimate local control was 80% and 94%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, besides the fractionation schedule (relative risk [RR], 2.6 for HAS vs. ASO), pretreatment tracheotomy/stridor (RR 4.3, yes vs. no), and local tumor response 3-6 weeks after radiotherapy (RR 5.1, no vs. yes) were independent factors for local control. Tumor control probability analysis indicated that the onset of repopulation may be about 4-6 days earlier for the HAS regimen. The onset of repopulation in the HAS regimen is probably at the end of the second week or at the beginning of the third week. Severe late toxicity was observed in the HAS group and ASO group in, respectively, 11% and 16%. In multivariate analysis this toxicity related significantly to the field size and pretreatment tracheotomy/stridor., CONCLUSIONS: In our study the timing of the boost in accelerated radiotherapy for advanced laryngeal cancer was an independent factor for local control, favoring the use of a concomitant boost in Week 3. This finding may indicate that accelerated repopulation of tumor cells starts early in the treatment phase.",Excluded
4949,"Histopathological examination of spine tumors after treatment with radiosurgery OBJECTIVE Increased survival time after diagnosis of neoplastic disease has resulted in a gradual increase in spine tumor incidence. Radiosurgery is frequently a viable alternative to operative management in a population with severe medical comorbidities. The authors sought to assess the histopathological consequences of radiosurgery in the subset of patients progressing to operative intervention. METHODS Eighteen patients who underwent radiosurgery for spine tumors between 2008 and 2014 subsequently progressed to surgical treatment. A histopathological examination of these cases was performed. Indications for surgery included symptomatic compression fractures, radiographic instability, and symptoms of cord or cauda equina compression. Biopsy samples were obtained from the tumor within the radiosurgical zone in all cases and were permanently fixated. Viable tumor samples were stained for Ki 67. RESULTS Fifteen patients had metastatic lesions and 3 patients had neurofibromas. The mean patient age was 57 years. The operative indication was symptomatic compression in 10 cases (67%). The most frequent metastatic lesions were breast cancer (4 cases), renal cell carcinoma (3), prostate cancer (2), and endometrial cancer (2). In 9 (60%) of the 15 metastatic cases, histological examination of the lesions showed minimal evidence of inflammation. Viable tumor at the margins of the radiosurgery was seen in 9 (60%) of the metastatic cases. Necrosis in the tumor bed was frequent, as was fibrotic bone marrow. Vascular ectasia was seen in 2 of 15 metastatic cases, but sclerosis with ectasia was frequent. No evidence of malignant conversion was seen in the periphery of the lesions in the 3 neurofibroma cases. In 1 case of neurofibroma, the lesion demonstrated some small areas of remnant tumor in the radiosurgical target zone. CONCLUSIONS This case series demonstrates important histopathological characteristics of spinal lesions treated by SRS. Regions with the highest exposure to radiation appear to be densely necrotic and show little evidence of tumor growth, whereas peripheral regions distant from the radiation dosage are more likely to demonstrate viable tumor in malignant and benign neoplasms. Physiological tissue appears to be similarly affected. With additional investigation, a more homogenized field of hypofractionated radiation exposure may allow for tumor obliteration with relative preservation of critical anatomical structures.",Excluded

3916,"Quantitative impact of small angle forward scatter on whole blood oximetry using a Beer-Lambert absorbance model It is well known that red blood cell scattering has an impact on whole blood oximetry as well as in vivo retinal oxygen saturation measurements. The goal of this study was to quantify the impact of small angle forward scatter on whole blood oximetry for scattering angles found in retinal oximetry light paths. Transmittance spectra of whole blood were measured in two different experimental setups: one that included small angle scatter in the transmitted signal and one that measured the transmitted signal only, at absorbance path lengths of 25, 50, 100, 250 and 500 microm. Oxygen saturation was determined by multiple linear regression in the 520-600 nm wavelength range and compared between path lengths and experimental setups. Mean calculated oxygen saturation differences between setups were greater than 10% at every absorbance path length. The deviations to the Beer-Lambert absorbance model had different spectral dependences between experimental setups, with the highest deviations found in the 520-540 nm range when scatter was added to the transmitted signal. These results are consistent with other models of forward scatter that predict different spectral dependences of the red blood cell scattering cross-section and haemoglobin extinction coefficients in this wavelength range.",Excluded
4926,"Impact of chemical exposure on cancer mortality in a French cohort of uranium processing workers Background: Nuclear workers may be exposed to a variety of chemical hazards, in addition to radiation. We examined the effect of chemical exposures on cancer mortality among French uranium processing workers at the AREVA NC Pierrelatte facility. Method(s): A cohort of 2,897 uranium processing workers employed for at least 6 months was followed from 1968 through 2006. Exposure to uranium and potentially carcinogenic chemicals was assessed with a plant-specific job-exposure matrix. Mortality hazard ratios (HRs) for cancers of the lung, lymphohematopoietic system, kidney and bladder, brain and central nervous system (BCNS), and prostate were estimated for each specific chemical exposure, with Cox regression models stratified for sex and calendar period and adjusted for socioeconomic status. Additional adjustments enabled us to examine the effect of co-exposure to uranium and other chemicals. Result(s): Exposure to aromatic solvents was associated with increased risk of BCNS malignancies after adjustment for other chemicals (HR=6.53, 95% CI=1.14-37.41; n=6) and for other chemicals and uranium (HR=7.26, 95% CI=0.90-58.19) in the annual exposure status model. Selected groups of lymphohematopoietic cancers were found associated with solvent exposure. Inconclusive results were found regarding chromium (VI) exposure, since only 2 workers died from lung cancer among 109 exposed. Conclusion(s): Based on our pilot study, it seemed important to take into account chemical exposures in the analyses of cancer mortality among French uranium processing workers. Am. J. Ind.

4808,"Prevalence of incidental or unexpected findings on low-dose CT performed during routine SPECT/CT nuclear medicine studies INTRODUCTION: In nuclear medicine, single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) is often combined with 'simultaneous' low-dose CT (LDCT) to provide complementary anatomical and functional correlation. As a consequence, numerous incidental and unexpected findings may be detected on LDCT. Recognition of these findings and appropriate determination of their relevance can add to the utility of SPECT/CT. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence and categorise the relevance of incidental and unexpected findings on LDCT scans performed as part of routine SPECT/CT studies., METHODS: All available LDCT scans performed as part of SPECT/CT studies at St. Vincent's Hospital Melbourne in the year 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Two qualified radiologists independently reviewed the studies and any previous available imaging and categorised any detected incidental findings., RESULTS: A total of 2447 LDCT studies were reviewed. The relevance of the findings was classified according to a modified version of a scale used in the Colonography Reporting and Data System: E1 = normal or normal variant (28.0%); E2 = clinically unimportant (63.5%); E3 = likely unimportant or incompletely characterised (6.2%); E4 = potentially important (2.5%)., CONCLUSION: Imaging specialists need to be cognisant of incidental and unexpected findings present on LDCT studies performed as part of SPECT/CT. Appropriate categorisation of findings and communication of potentially important findings to referring clinicians should form part of routine practice. The overall prevalence of potentially significant incidental and unexpected findings in our series was 8.7% (E3, 6.2%; E4, 2.5%) and was comparable to rates in other published imaging series.

However, small or not peripheral nodules can be invisible or impalpable during toracoscopy, so difficult to localized. Many techniques have been developed to solve such problem. Herein we report our 13-years experience with Radio-guided One. Material(s) and Method(s): Patients with pulmonary nodules smaller than 1cm and/or deeper, below the visceral pleura, underwent CT-guided injection, into the nodule a solution composed by 0,2 ml 99Tc- labelled human serum albumin microsphers and 0,1 ml non-ionic contrast. Then, during the toracoscopic procedure, a 11 mm diameter-collimated probe connected to a gamma ray detector is introduced to scan the lung surface. The area of major radioactivity is resected. Result(s): From 1997 to 2009, 450 patients underwent toracoscopic resection of a small pulmonary nodules, 155 with the radio-guided technique. The patients were men and women, with average age of 60,6 (range: 12-83). Mean duration of surgical procedure was 43 min (range: 20 -100). The procedure was successful in 150/155 cases.

Method(s): From 1996 to 2003 45 patients, 32 males and 13 females, underwent isthmic direct repair. Inclusion criteria were: low grade spondilolysthesis, age ranged between 11 and 25 years, low back pain from at least 6 months and resistant to conservative treatment, no degenerative diseases at the involved and adjacent level. Radiographic evaluation was performed with pre-operative lumbar x-ray and MRI and post-operative lumbar x-ray at regular intervals. In all patients the grade of degeneration at the treated and adjacent level was evaluated with the UCLA classification; the presence of an instability and the spinopelvic harmony value were also evaluated. Result(s): Median age was of 15 years (range 11-25). Median follow-up was of 12 years (10-16). Good clinical outcome was observed in the 98 % of the patients, in 2 patients an hardware failure which requested a surgical revision with a traditional fusion was observed, in 1 patient a spondylodiscitis involving the adjacent level was observed at 7 years follow-up. Radiographic analysis showed no worsening of the vertebral slippage, a complete fusion of the lysis in the 94 % of patients, no bone resorption, no statistically significant variation in the spinopelvic harmony value, a one grade worsening of the UCLA classification value only in the 10 % of patients. In these patients a concomitant alteration of the spinopelvic harmony value was observed. Nor the worsening in the UCLA classification grade none the alteration of the spinopelvic harmony influenced the clinical outcome in our series. Conclusion(s): Direct repair is a valid and reliable surgical treatment possibility for lumbar isthmic spondylolysis. Its use allows, in young symptomatic patients, to preserve the motility of the treated level in order to avoid, at over 10 years follow-up, the onset of degenerative changes to the treated and adjacent discs and zygaphofiseal joints, preserving also, a good spinopelvic harmony)over time.",Excluded
3713,"Magnetic navigation in left-sided AV reentrant tachycardias: Preliminary results of a retrograde approach Introduction: A novel magnetic navigation system allows remote guidance of floppy radiofrequency (RF) ablation catheters. We evaluated the feasibility of mapping and ablation of left-sided accessory pathways (APs) using the retrograde transaortic approach with this system. This might open the gate to retrograde ablation of left atrial arrhythmias. Methods and Results: Twenty consecutive patients were included. A Helios II was used in five and in 15 a Celsius RMT RF catheter with higher magnetic mass and different flexibility was used. Mapping and ablation were attempted. The learning curve was analyzed. Ablation was acutely successful in 60% of the patients using the Helios II and in 80% using the Celsius RMT. Median procedure time was 158 minutes, with median patient and physician fluoroscopy times of 26 and 4 minutes. In the last 10 patients, procedure times became significantly shorter (median 122 minutes, only Celsius RMT catheters) and standard catheters had to be used only twice. No complications occurred. Conclusion(s): Remote retrograde transaortic RF ablation of left-sided APs is feasible, safe, and reduces the physician's fluoroscopy exposure. There is a very steep initial learning curve, with the success rate increasing from 50% in the first 10 cases to 80% in the last 10 cases. Different catheter configurations may influence the outcome. © 2007 by Futura Publishing Company, Inc.",Excluded
4740,"DART-bid for loco-regionally advanced NSCLC : Summary of acute and late toxicity with long-term follow-up; experiences with pulmonary dose constraints BACKGROUND: To report acute and late toxicity with long-term follow-up, and to describe our experiences with pulmonary dose constraints., METHODS: Between 2002 and 2009, 150 patients with 155 histologically/cytologically proven non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; tumor stages II, IIIA, IIIB in 6, 55 and 39%, respectively) received the following median doses: primary tumors 79.2 Gy (range 72.0-90.0 Gy), lymph node metastases 59.4 Gy (54.0-73.8 Gy), nodes electively 45 Gy; with fractional doses of 1.8 Gy twice daily (bid). In all, 86% of patients received 2 cycles of chemotherapy previously., RESULTS: Five treatment-related deaths occurred: pneumonitis, n = 1; progressive pulmonary fibrosis in patients with pre-existing pulmonary fibrosis, n = 2; haemorrhage, n = 2. In all, 8% of patients experienced grade 3 and 1.3% grade 4 pneumonitis; 11% showed late fibrotic alterations grade 2 in lung parenchyma. Clinically relevant acute esophagitis (grade 2 and 3) was seen in 33.3% of patients, 2 patients developed late esophageal stenosis (G3). Patients with upper lobe, middle lobe and central lower lobe tumours (n = 130) were treated with V20 (total lung) up to 50% and patients with peripheral lower lobe tumours (n = 14, basal lateral tumours excluded) up to 42%, without observing acute or late pulmonary toxicity >grade 3. Only patients with basal lateral lower lobe tumours (n = 5) experienced grade 4/5 pulmonary toxicity; V20 for this latter group ranged between 30 and 53%. The mean lung dose was below the QUANTEC recommendation of 20-23 Gy in all patients. The median follow-up time of all patients is 26.3 months (range 2.9-149.4) and of patients alive 80.2 months (range 63.9-149.4.). The median overall survival time of all patients is 26.3 months; the 2-, 5- and 8-year survival rates of 54, 21 and 15%, respectively. The local tumour control rate at 2 and 5 years is 70 and 64%, the regional control rate 90 and 88%, respectively., DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Grade 4 or 5 toxicity occurred in 7/150 patients (4.7%), which can be partially avoided in the future (e.g. by excluding patients with pre-existing pulmonary fibrosis). Tolerance and oncologic outcome compare favourably to concomitant chemoradiation also in long-term follow-up.",Excluded
4774,"Phase 1 trial of preoperative, short-course carbon-ion radiotherapy for patients with resectable pancreatic cancer Background: The authors evaluated the tolerance and efficacy of carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT) as a short-course, preoperative treatment and determined the recommended dose needed to reduce the risk of postoperative local recurrence without excess injury to normal tissue. Method(s): Patients radiographically defined with potentially resectable pancreatic cancer were eligible. A preoperative, short-course, dose-escalation study was performed with fixed 8 fractions in 2 weeks. The dose of irradiation was increased by 5% increments from 30 grays equivalents (GyE) to 36.8 GyE. Surgery was to be performed 2 to 4 weeks after the completion of CIRT. Result(s): The study enrolled 26 patients. At the time of restaging after CIRT, disease progression with distant metastasis or refusal ruled out 5 patients from surgery. Twenty-one of 26 patients (81%) patients underwent surgery. The pattern of initial disease progression was distant metastasis in 17 patients (65%) and regional recurrence in 2 patients (8%). No patients experienced local recurrence. The 5-year survival rates for all 26 patients and for those who underwent surgery were 42% and 52%, respectively. Conclusion(s): Preoperative, short-course CIRT followed by surgery is feasible and tolerable without unacceptable morbidity. © 2012 American Cancer Society.",Excluded
4139,"[Intraoperative radiotherapy in abdominal-pelvic cancer surgery] Intraoperative radiotherapy consists in the irradiation of the affected area, exposed using anesthesiological and laparotomic procedures, following the removal of a neoplasia using palliative or macroscopically radical surgical. This increases local tumour control and augments the selectivity of treatment between healthy and neoplastic tissues, thus obtaining a marked improvement in survival or palliation. The authors analyse the data reported in international literature regarding the possible use of intraoperative radiotherapy in patients undergoing abdomino-pelvic oncological surgery. The aim of the study was to evaluate this method for use in selected and combined treatment in which surgery represents an obligatory step. Studies were carried out in a few highly specialised centres given that special technical, logistic and professional skills were required. The populations studied were often very small with a marked prevalence of feasibility studies compared to random studies. In spite of this intraoperative radiotherapy is undoubtedly indicated in locally advanced gastric, rectal and vesical neoplasia, it represents a valid palliative solution in pancreatic neoplasia and in pelvic recidivation, and an effective alternative solution to mutilating surgery in the initial stages of vesical cancer. Positive results are obtained in prostate and uterine cancer, but they are reported by non-conclusive studies. Toxicity is acceptable and non-limiting within a given range of doses and irradiated volume. The ""repercussion"" in terms of knowledge, experience, scientific integration between oncological surgeons and radiotherapists is basic, with a marked improved in the management of cancer treatment.",Excluded
4718,"Radioiodide (131I) therapy for the treatment of canine thyroid carcinoma OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of radioactive iodine treatment (131I) for canine thyroid carcinoma, as both the sole therapeutic modality and as an adjunct to surgery. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of case records from the Gladesville Veterinary Hospital Nuclear Medicine Service, Sydney, between August 1988 and December 2001. CASE DETAILS: The records of 65 dogs with thyroid carcinoma were analysed according to therapy and outcome. Forty-three dogs received radioiodide therapy, either as the sole therapeutic modality (32) or as an adjunct to surgery (11). Radioisotope therapy consisted of one to three doses of 131I with a dose range of 555 to 1850 MBq. For analysis, dogs were divided into groups according to therapy: no treatment, surgery alone, surgery with radioiodide therapy or radioiodide therapy alone. Mode of therapy, dosage of 131I, clinical staging and age were all independently analysed according to survival to compare efficacy or predictive value respectively. RESULT(S): When radioiodide therapy was used as an adjunct to surgery, median survival was 34 months. Censored median survival time for dogs that received radioiodide alone was 30 months. Dogs that did not receive treatment had a median survival of only 3 months. Log rank statistical analysis indicated that mode of therapy was significantly correlated with survival but that clinical stage of disease was not. CONCLUSION(S): The authors conclude that 131I therapy is effective at extending survival time, both as a sole therapeutic modality and as an adjunct to surgery, in dogs with invasive canine thyroid carcinoma. Incomplete surgical resection may not prolong survival in dogs also receiving 131I therapy, however surgical resection with curative intent should be recommended as the first line of therapy for mobile thyroid carcinomas. Radioisotope therapy can be recommended for cases where surgery alone is considered unlikely to be curative because of metastatic disease or local invasion, or for cases where surgery has been attempted but complete surgical removal has not been achieved.",Excluded

4900,"A retrospective study of concurrent chemoradiotherapy plus S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy on curative effect for treatment of patients with N3 stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma Introduction: The purpose of this study was to analyze the efficacy and safety of concurrent chemoradiotherapy plus S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy for N3 stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Method(s): This study included 44 N3 stage NPC patients treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy plus S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy. The intensity-modulated radiation therapy doses were planning target volume (PTV) 70-72 Gy for gross disease in the nasopharynx and 66-70 Gy for positive lymph nodes. The doses for high-risk-and low-risk region PTV were 60-62 and 54-56 Gy in 31-33 fractions. All patients received a concurrent chemotherapy program consisting of cisplatin 100 mg/m2, day 1, and the cycle repetition was every 21 days. The adjuvant chemotherapy program consisted of 4 cycles of S-1. The dose of S-1 was determined according to the body surface area (BSA): 40 mg twice a day for BSA <1.25 m2; 50 mg twice a day for 1.25 m2<=BSA<1.5 m2; and 60 mg twice a day for BSA >=1.5 m2. S-1 was given on days 1-28, given 6 weeks apart. Result(s): All 44 patients completed at least 2 cycles of concurrent chemotherapy and 4 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy. The total efficiency of therapy was 100.0%. The 3-year overall survival (OS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), local-regional control, and progression-free survival rates were 86.4%, 84.1%, 97.7%, and 81.8%, respectively. There were no differences in the OS, DMFS, and efficiency between fast-fading group (reaching partial response before the second cycle of concurrent chemotherapy) and general-fading group (the rest of the group). The incidence of rash in the entire group was low, and there was also no association with prognosis. Conclusion(s): In patients with N3 stage NPC, concurrent chemoradiotherapy plus S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy yielded an excellent survival benefit, and the toxicities were mild and tolerable. Distant metastasis was the main cause of treatment failure.Copyright © 2018 Zhang et al.",Excluded
4264,"Orbital marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of MALT: Radiotherapy results and clinical behavior Purpose: To elucidate the clinical behavior and treatment outcome of low-grade primary orbital lymphoma arising from mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). Methods and Materials: Forty-eight patients with pathologically confirmed marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of MALT were treated with radiotherapy (RT). Thirty-eight patients (79.1%) received thorough staging workup studies including bone marrow biopsy. Radiation doses ranged from 5.4 to 30.6 Gy (median, 30.6 Gy). Median follow-up period was 70 months. Result(s): Only 2 patients revealed extraorbital lymphoma involvement (bone marrow, skin). Forty-six of 52 eye lesions showed complete response to RT. Six lesions demonstrated a partial response and showed gradual regression during the follow-up period of 39-72 months. Three patients experienced local recurrences at 34, 48, and 52 months after RT, which seemed to be related to improper use of the lens shield. Salvage re-RT was successful. The 10-year actuarial relapse-free survival, cause-specific survival, and overall survival rates were 93.1%, 97.9%, and 86.9%, respectively. Conclusion(s): Most of the MALT lymphoma of the orbit was localized at diagnosis and extraorbital relapse rarely occurred. Therefore, extensive staging workup at the time of diagnosis and follow-up studies to detect distant relapse may not be obligatory. Low-dose RT alone with proper lens shielding is the optimum treatment modality for orbital MALT lymphoma. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
3927,"Precise and Automatic Patient Positioning in Computed Tomography: Avatar Modeling of the Patient Surface Using a 3-Dimensional Camera Objectives The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of a 3-dimensional (3D) camera algorithm for automatic and individualized patient positioning based on body surface detection and to compare the results of the 3D camera with manual positioning performed by technologists in routinely obtained chest and abdomen computed tomography (CT) examinations. Materials and Methods This study included data of 120 patients undergoing clinically indicated chest (n = 68) and abdomen (n = 52) CT. Fifty-two of the patients were scanned with CT using a table height manually selected by technologists; 68 patients were automatically positioned with the 3D camera, which is based on patient-specific body surface and contour detection. The ground truth table height (TGT) was defined as the table height that aligns the axial center of the patient's body region in the CT scanner isocenter. Off-centering was defined as the difference between the ground truth table height (TGT) and the actual table position used in all CT examinations. The t test was performed to determine significant differences in the vertical offset between automatic and manual positioning. The chi2 test was used to check whether there was a relationship between patient size and the magnitude of off-centering. Results We found a significant improvement in patient centering (offset 5 +/- 3 mm) when using the automatic positioning algorithm with the 3D camera compared with manual positioning (offset 19 +/- 10 mm) performed by technologists (P < 0.005). Automatic patient positioning based on the 3D camera reduced the average offset in vertical table position from 19 mm to 7 mm for chest and from 18 mm to 4 mm for abdomen CT. The absolute maximal offset was 39 mm and 43 mm for chest and abdomen CT, respectively, when patients were positioned manually, whereas with automatic positioning using the 3D camera the offset never exceeded 15 mm. In chest CT performed with manual patient positioning, we found a significant correlation between vertical offset greater than 20 mm and patient size (body mass index, >26 kg/m2, P < 0.001). In contrast, no such relationship was found for abdomen CT (P = 0.38). Conclusions Automatic individualized patient positioning using a 3D camera allows for accurate patient centering as compared with manual positioning, which improves radiation dose utilization.Copyright © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

4779,"Renal atrophy after stereotactic body radiotherapy for renal cell carcinoma BACKGROUND: Renal atrophy is observed in an irradiated kidney. The aim of this study was to determine dose-volume histogram parameters and other factors that predict renal atrophy after 10-fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for primary renal cell carcinoma (RCC)., METHODS: A total of 14 patients (11 males, 3 females) who received SBRT for RCC at Tohoku University Hospital between April 2010 and February 2014 were analyzed. The median serum creatinine level was 1.1 mg/dl and two patients had a single kidney. Nine patients were implanted with fiducial markers. The median tumor diameter was 30 mm. SBRT was delivered at 70 Gy in 10 fractions for 7 tumors, at 60 Gy in 10 fractions for 2 tumors, and at 50 Gy in 10 fractions for 5 tumors with 6 and/or 15 MV X-ray using 5 to 8 multi-static beams. Renal atrophy was assessed using post-SBRT CT images after 12-24 months intervals. Correlations were examined by Spearman rank correlation analysis. Differences between two groups were evaluated by the Mann-Whitney test, and pairwise comparisons were made by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test., RESULTS: The median tumor volume shrunk from 14.8 cc to 10.6 cc (p = 0.12), and the median irradiated kidney volume changed from 160.4 cc to 137.1 cc (p < .01). The median peak creatinine level was 1.6 mg/dl after treatment (p < .01). Percentage volumes of the irradiated kidney receiving at least 10 Gy (V10, p = 0.03), V20 (p < .01), V30(p < .01), V40 (p = 0.01), mean irradiated kidney dose (p < .01), and magnitude of overlap between PTV and kidney volume (p = 0.03) were significantly correlated with post-treatment irradiated kidney volume in percent, and V20-V30 had strong correlation (r < -0.70, p < .01). Patients with implanted fiducial markers showed a significantly lower ratio of renal atrophy (p = 0.02)., CONCLUSIONS: Significant renal atrophic change was observed. Dose distribution of SBRT at 20-30 Gy had a strong correlation with renal atrophy when irradiation was performed in 10 fractions.",Excluded
