2185,"""A bend in time"": Shaping the sheath facilitates left atrial appendage closure. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to determine feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of the ""shape-the-sheath"" method in left atrial appendage closure., BACKGROUND: LAA occlusion is often a difficult procedure, due to not just the learning curve but also the three-dimensional variable nature of the left atrial appendage. Multiple sheaths have been created for various takeoffs. The purpose of this article is to show the feasibility of the ""shape-the-sheath"" method in left atrial appendage closure., METHODS: Ten consecutive patients undergoing LAA occlusion without the ""shape-the-sheath"" method were compared to 10 consecutive patients undergoing LAA occlusion with the ""shape-the-sheath"" method using the Amplatzer Cardiac Plug (ACP) system and the Amplatzer TorqVue 45x45 sheath., RESULTS: The ""shape-the-sheath"" method resulted in significant decreases in fluoroscopy time (7.2+/-3.0 min vs. 13.7+/-6.7 min, P<0.05), number of partial recaptures (0% vs. 50%, P<0.05), with a trend toward decrease in the number of complete recaptures (0 vs. 40%, P=0.09) compared to conventional sheath use., CONCLUSIONS: Shaping-the-sheath is a simple, elegant way to help conform delivery systems to better access the LAA and ensure stable position. Further experience with this procedure optimization step is warranted. Copyright Â© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
2439,"Risk of isolated nodal failure for stage III NSCLC treated with selective nodal irradiation using IMRT. Purpose/Objective: PET-CT based selective nodal irradiation in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients using 3D conformal radiotherapy (RT) results in less than 5% of isolated nodal failures (INF), possibly due to a significant incidental nodal dose. Intensity modulated RT (IMRT) is increasingly used, but decreases the dose to adjacent lymph nodes significantly. This may lead to a higher incidence of INF. We therefore investigated the INF rate in IMRT-treated patients. Material(s) and Method(s): Patients charts from the prospective MAASTRO database were reviewed. Stage III NSCLC patients treated with radical IMRT based RT alone or in combination with sequential (seqCRT) or concurrent (conCRT) chemotherapy were included. An individualized accelerated isotoxic radiotherapy (INDAR) as previously published (JCO 2010; Eur J Cancer 2012) was applied. The primary tumour and FDG-PETpositive and/or cytologically proven lymph nodes were delineated on a 3D-PET-CT fused with a 4D-CT. Follow up (FU) consisted of regular imaging (X-ray and CT) and if clinically indicated. In case of a recurrence, the diagnostic image was compared with the radiation plan. Local tumour and nodal recurrences were scored as follows: in field: at least a part of the recurrence inside the original CTV and out of field: recurrence completely outside the original CTV. Out of field nodal recurrences were classified as recurrences in adjacent or non-adjacent lymph node stations. Overall Survival (OS) and Progression Free Survival (PFS) were calculated from date of pathological diagnosis (Kaplan- Meier). Result(s): From January 2010 until March 2012, 183 patients were included: 119 males, 64 females, median age 68.0 years (Stage IIIA 51.9%, IIIB 48.1%). Median total tumour dose was 69.0 +/- 5.1 Gy (50.4- 73.8 Gy) in a median overall treatment time of 35.0 days. Most patient received chemo-radiation (n=116 conCRT, n=45 seqCRT), while 22 received RT alone. With a median FU of 17.5 months (26.7 months for patients alive) the median OS was 19.0 months (95% CI 16.6-21.4 months) with a 2-year OS of 40.2% (actuarial 2-year OS 38%) for the entire group, 20.2 months for conCRT and 16.0 months for seqCRT (p=0.45). Median PFS was 15.1 months (95% CI 11.3-18.8 months) with a 2-year PFS of 35.3% (actuarial 2-year PFS 34%) for the entire group, 14.1 months for conCRT and 15.7 months for seqCRT (p=0.84). Ninety-nine patients (54.1%) showed recurrent disease: 9.3% (n=17) local recurrence, 1.6% (n=3) isolated nodal recurrence, 2.2% (n=4) loco-regional recurrence, 26.8% (n=49) distant metastases only and 14.2% (n=26) a combination of local/loco-regional and distant metastases. The distribution of all recurrences is depicted in table 1. (Table presented) Conclusion(s): Selective PET-based mediastinal nodal irradiation using IMRT in patients with stage III NSCLC seems to result in a low percentage of isolated nodal failure (1.6%), although FU is still limited. These results are in line with earlier published 3D conformal RT data.",Excluded
3878,"Mucositis in irradiated cancer patients: effects of an antiseptic mouthrinse. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of an antiseptic, non-alcohol based mouth-rinse containing chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride, in preventing the oral complications associated to radiation therapy in head-and-neck cancer patients., STUDY DESIGN: This was a parallel, double blind, prospective, randomized clinical trial. Cancer patients were randomly assigned to one of the two treatments (test mouth-rinse or a placebo). Three visits were scheduled (baseline, 14 and 28 days). Different outcome variables were evaluated: mucositis, plaque and gingival indices, stimulated saliva and salivary pH., RESULTS: 70 patients were screened and 36 were included. The presence and the degree of mucositis significantly increased in both groups and no significant differences were detected between groups, although the median increase in the placebo group (1.81) at 2 weeks was higher than in the test group (1.20)., CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of the small sample size, this study suggests that the use of the tested mouth-rinse may lead to some improvements in clinical parameters in patients irradiated for head-and-neck cancer.",Excluded
3410,"X-ray induction of chromatid interchanges is somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster: variations through the cell cycle of the pattern of rejoining. The relative frequencies of X-ray-induced symmetrical and asymmetrical chromatid interchanges were analysed as a function of the cell cycle in somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster. In exchanges between autosomes, during the S phase, a clear prevalence of asymmetrical rejoining was observed. Later, this prevalence became reduced as the cell approached mitosis. On the other hand, in the exchanges between X-chromosomes in the females there were no significant variations in the type of rejoining through the cell cycle, there being a slight but consistent preference for symmetrical rejoining. These data are discussed in relation to the hypothesis proposed by Olivieri et al. [12] on the organization of the chromosomal sub-units in the interphase nucleus.",Excluded
4844,"Generation of boundary manikin anthropometry. The purpose of this study was to develop 3D digital 'boundary manikins' that are representative of the anthropometry of a unique population. These digital manikins can be used by designers to verify and validate that the components of the spacesuit design satisfy the requirements specified in the Human Systems Integration Requirements (HSIR) document. Currently, the HSIR requires the next generation space suit to accommodate the 1st percentile American female to the 99th percentile American male. The manikin anthropometry was derived using two methods: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Whole Body Posture Based Analysis (WBPBA). PCA is a statistical method for reducing a multidimensional data set by using eigenvectors and eigenvalues. The goal was to create a reduced data set that encapsulates the majority of the variation in the population. WBPBA is a multivariate analytical approach that was developed by the Anthropometry and Biomechanics Facility (ABF) to identify the extremes of a population for a given body posture. WBPBA is a simulation-based method that finds extremes in a population based upon anthropometry and posture; whereas PCA is based solely on anthropometry. Both methods yielded a list of subjects and their anthropometry from a target population; PCA resulted in 20 female and 22 male subjects' anthropometry and WBPBA resulted in 7 subjects' anthropometry representing the extreme subjects in the target population. The subjects' anthropometry was then used to 'morph' a baseline digital scan of a person with the same body type to create a 3D digital model that can be used as a tool for designers.

2827,"Long-term results in the treatment of vitiligo with oral khellin plus UVA. This study was performed to assess the effectiveness and short-term and long-term safety of oral khellin plus UVA (KUVA) in patients with vitiligo. Twenty-eight patients (13 males and 15 females; mean age, 34 years; [age range, 15-51 years]) most with extensive generalized vitiligo of more than 6 months duration had received KUVA at sometime during a 14-year period. The response to treatment (i.e. repigmentation of depigmented areas) was rated retrospectively comparing photographs taken before and after therapy and correlation analysis revealed that it was statistically significantly linked to the number of KUVA treatments (r = 0.833, P = 0.001) and to total cumulative UVA dose (r = 0.840, P = 0.001). Of 17 patients who had continued therapy for longer than 3 months, 7 (41%) had a good response (i.e., more than 70% repigmentation of lesional skin) after a mean of 194 treatments (range, 69-386 treatments) and a mean cumulative UVA dose of 2,036 J/cm2 (range, 690-4,411 J/cm2), whereas lower response grades were observed in the patients with lower treatment numbers. The most common short-term side effect was mild nausea, occurring in 8 of 28 patients (29%), and mainly in the first week(s) of treatment. Follow-up assessment at a mean of 40 months (range, 4-110 months) after the end of KUVA therapy available in 23 of 28 patients revealed no skin cancers or actinic skin damage in any patient. These data indicate that KUVA seems to be safe as well as effective for vitiligo, provided treatment is administered long enough.",Excluded
4363,"Normal Tissue Complication Probability Modeling of Pulmonary Toxicity After Stereotactic and Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy for Central Lung Tumors. Purpose: To evaluate clinical pulmonary and radiographic bronchial toxicity after stereotactic ablative radiation therapy and hypofractionated radiation therapy for central lung tumors, and perform normal tissue complication probability modeling and multivariable analyses to identify predictors for toxicity. Methods and Materials: A pooled analysis was performed of patients with a central lung tumor treated using <=12 fractions at 2 centers between 2006 and 2015. Airways were manually contoured on planning computed tomography scans, and doses were recalculated to an equivalent dose of 2 Gy per fraction with an alpha/beta ratio of 3. Grade >=3 (>=G3) clinical pulmonary toxicity was evaluated by 2 or more physicians. Radiographic toxicity was defined as a stenosis or an occlusion with or without atelectasis using follow-up computed tomography scans. Logistic regression analyses were used for statistical analyses. Result(s): A total of 585 bronchial structures were studied in 195 patients who were mainly treated using 5 or 8 fractions (60%). Median patient survival was 27.9 months (95% confidence interval 22.3-33.6 months). Clinical >=G3 toxicity was observed in 24 patients (12%) and radiographic bronchial toxicity in 55 patients (28%), both mainly manifesting <=12 months after treatment. All analyzed dosimetric parameters correlated with clinical and lobar bronchial radiographic toxicity, with V130Gy,EQD having the highest odds ratio. Normal tissue complication probability modeling showed a volume dependency for the development of both clinical and radiographic toxicity. On multivariate analyses, significant predictors for >=G3 toxicity were a planning target volume overlapping the trachea or main stem bronchus (P =.005), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P =.034), and the total V130Gy,EQD (P =.012). Radiographic bronchial toxicity did not significantly correlate with clinical toxicity (P =.663). Conclusion(s): We identified patient and dosimetric factors associated with clinical and radiographic toxicity after high-dose radiation therapy for central lung tumors. Additional data from prospective studies are needed to validate these findings.Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1848,"Work history and radioprotection practices in relation to cancer incidence and mortality in US radiologic technologists performing nuclear medicine procedures. Introduction Technologists working in nuclear medicine (NM) are exposed to higher radiation doses than most other occupationally exposed populations. The aim of this study was to estimate the risk of cancer in NM technologists in relation to work history, procedures performed and radioprotection practices. Methods From the US Radiologic Technologists cohort study, 72 755 radiologic technologists who completed a 2003-2005 questionnaire were followed for cancer mortality through 31 December 2012 and for cancer incidence through completion of a questionnaire in 2012-2013. Multivariable-adjusted models were used to estimate HRs for total cancer incidence and mortality by history of ever performing NM procedures and frequency of performing specific diagnostic or therapeutic NM procedures and associated radiation protection measures by decade. Results During follow-up (mean=7.5 years), 960 incident cancers and 425 cancer deaths were reported among the 22 360 technologists who worked with NM procedures. We observed no increased risk of cancer incidence (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.04) or death (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.19) among workers who ever performed NM procedures. HRs for cancer incidence but not mortality were higher for technologists who began performing therapeutic procedures in 1960 and later compared with the 1950s. Frequency of performing diagnostic or therapeutic NM procedures and use of radioprotection measures were not consistently associated with cancer risk. No clear associations were observed for specific cancers, but results were based on small numbers. Conclusion Cancer incidence and mortality were not associated with NM work history practices, including greater frequency of procedures performed.Copyright Â© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

3627,"Synaptic plasticity in the adult spinal dorsal horn: the appearance of new functional connections following peripheral nerve regeneration. Peripherally regenerated fibers were impaled in the dorsal columns. Each impaled fiber's adequate stimulus was determined and the fiber was activated by passing brief (200 ms) current pulses through the microelectrode. Cord dorsum potentials (CDPs) elicited by fiber stimulation were recorded at 8 sites, and then the fiber was injected with Neurobiotin (NB). In the same preparations, dorsal horn cells were impaled and their receptive fields (RFs) mapped; areas of skin from which the most vigorous responses were elicited were noted. Needle electrodes inserted into these cutaneous ""hot spots"" were used to electrically activate minimal numbers of peripherally regenerated fibers while simultaneously recording the resulting CDPs and any intracellular EPSPs. This allowed determination of connectivity between regenerated fibers and dorsal horn cells with overlapping RFs. In agreement with findings in intact animals, NB revealed long-ranging collaterals which were not seen using intraaxonally injected horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Although there was no qualitative difference in their morphology compared to those seen in controls, the correlation between spatial distribution of boutons and amplitudes of the monosynaptic CDPs of peripherally regenerated fibers revealed significant shifts in the functional efficacy of many central connections. Transcutaneous electrical stimulation revealed a significantly higher incidence of connectivity between regenerated fibers and cells with overlapping RFs at 9-12 months (86%) than at 5-6 months (34%). Although there was no obvious anatomical reorganization of afferent projections in the dorsal horn, the observed functional changes with time following transection show the formation of new functional central connections.",Excluded

4276,"Evaluation of a High Concentrated Contrast Media Injection Protocol in Combination with Low Tube Current for Dose Reduction in Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography: A Randomized, Two-center Prospective Study. RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to prospectively evaluate the radiation dose reduction potential and image quality (IQ) of a high-concentration contrast media (HCCM) injection protocol in combination with a low tube current (mAs) in coronary computed tomography angiography., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-one consecutive patients (mean age: 62 years; 34 females; body mass index: 18-31) were included and randomized-assigned into two groups. All computed tomography (CT) examinations were performed in two groups with the same tube voltage (100 kV), flow rate of contrast medium (5.0 mL/s), and iodine dose (22.8 g). An automatic mAs and low concentration contrast medium (300 mgI/mL) were used in group A, whereas effective mAs was reduced by a factor 0.6 along with HCCM (400 mgI/mL) in group B. Radiation dose was assessed (CT dose index [CTDIvol] and dose length product), and vessel-based objective IQ for various regions of interest (enhancement, noise, signal-to-noise ratio, and contrast-to-noise ratio), subjective IQ, noise, and motion artifacts were analyzed overall and vessel-based with a 5-point Likert scale., RESULTS: The CT attenuation of coronary arteries and image noise in group B were significantly higher than those in group A (ranges: 507.5-548.1 Hounsfield units vs 407.5-444.5 Hounsfield units; and 20.3 +/- 8.6 vs 17.7 +/- 8.0) (P <= 0.0166). There was no significant difference between the two groups in signal-to-noise ratio, contrast-to-noise ratio, and subjective IQ of coronary arteries (29.4-31.7, 30.0-37.0, and medium score of 5 in group A vs 29.4-32.4, 27.7-36.3, and medium score of 5 in group B, respectively, P >= 0.1859). Both mean CTDIvol and dose length product in group B were 58% of those of group A., CONCLUSIONS: HCCM combined with low tube current allows dose reduction in coronary computed tomography angiography and does not compromise IQ.

3546,"Feasibility of ultra low-dose thallium stress-redistribution protocol including prone imaging in obese patients using CZT camera. High efficiency cadmium-zinc-telluride (CZT) cameras provide an opportunity to lower the injected activities of radiopharmaceuticals for single photon emission tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). The limits for reducing activities of thallium have not been determined, particularly in obese patients. After an injection of 0.7 megabecquerel (MBq) of thallium/kg, we collected an average 1.5 million counts for the 10-min acquisition in a pilot cohort of ten patients. After extrapolation, we reduced the administered activity to 0.5 MBq/kg to obtain the expected 1 million counts. We studied the image quality in 124 patients (86 men, 43 obese with body mass index over 30 kg/m2) referred for MPI. The quality of images was assessed by a number of recorded counts and visually by a four-grade scale (one-poor quality, four-excellent quality). In non-obese and obese patients, the average number of recorded counts was 1.1 vs. 1.07 million counts for the 10-min stress acquisition, 1.04 vs. 1.06 million counts for the 13-min rest acquisition, and the average quality score was 3.97 vs. 3.90, respectively (p = NS). The mean administered activity was 39.2 +/- 7 MBq for non-obese and 48.7 +/- 6 for obese patients (p < 0.0001), and the calculated effective dose was 4.0 +/- 0.7 and 4.9 +/- 0.6 mSv respectively (p < 0.0001). The ultra-low-dose thallium stress-redistribution protocol, including post-stress prone imaging, provides good quality of images with a low radiation burden, even in obese patients.",Excluded
1982,"Perfusion MRI detects rCBF abnormalities in early stages of HIV- cognitive motor complex. Objective: To evaluate patients with early HIV-cognitive motor complex (HIV-CMC) for possible regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) abnormalities on perfusion MRI (pMRI). Background(s): Nuclear medicine techniques have demonstrated global and focal cerebral perfusion abnormalities in patients with HIV dementia. Ultrafast pMRI enables the measurement of rCBF throughout the brain without the need to apply radioactive tracers or ionizing radiation. Method(s): pMRI was used to measure the rCBF in 19 patients with early stages of HIV-CMC and 15 healthy seronegative control subjects. The rCBF maps were registered to high-resolution anatomic MRI scans and transformed into Talairach space. Statistical analysis of the rCBF maps was performed with SPM96. Result(s): Compared with the control subjects, the patients with HIV had statistically significantly decreased rCBF bilaterally in the inferior lateral frontal cortices (right: -15%, p < 0.002; left: -12%, p < 0.005) and in the inferior medial parietal brain region (-15%, p < 0.0009). In contrast, rCBF was increased bilaterally in the posterior inferior parietal white matter (right: +19%, p < 0.0001; left: +17%, p < 0.001). Furthermore, rCBF abnormalities correlated significantly with clinical disease severity as measured by CD4 count, plasma viral load, Karnofsky score, and HIV dementia scale. Discussion(s): Our results are consistent with previous findings from PET and SPECT studies. Furthermore, pMRI can detect rCBF abnormalities that correlate with disease severity in HIV-CMC. Because pMRI is more cost-effective, faster, and safer than nuclear medicine techniques for monitoring rCBF changes, pMRI may be more feasible for monitoring the effects of therapy for HIV-CMC.",Excluded

Objective: The purpose of this study was to analyze the dosimetric effect of different isocenters with volumetric modulated arc therapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Method(s): A total of 20 NPC patients who had received radiotherapy were re-planned by the volumetric modulated arc therapy plan. Three volumetric modulated arc therapy plans with different isocenters were generated for each patient: the first plan using the center of PGTVnx as the isocenter (AP-V), the second plan using the center of PGTVnd as the isocenter (BP-V), and the third plan using the center of PTV2 as the isocenter (CP-V). The conformity and homogeneity indexes of the target, dose-volume histogram of organs at risk, normal tissue, volume of dose, and monitor units were compared for the three plans. Result(s): AP-V provided a significantly lower maximum dose for the optic nerves and optic chiasm; lower mean dose for the eyeballs; lower absolute volume >10 Gy, absolute volume >20 Gy, and absolute volume >30 Gy; and fewer monitor units than BP-V and CP-V. BP-V and CP-V provided a significantly lower absolute volume >50 Gy than AP-V. In the conformity indexes of PGTVnd and PTV2, BP-V and CP-V were significantly better than in AP-V. In the homogeneity index of PTV2, BP-V and CP-V were significantly better than in AP-V. In general, there is no significant difference between BP-V and CP-V. Conclusion(s): All three plans achieved the clinical demands. AP-V decreased the volumes of absolute volume >10 Gy, absolute volume >20 Gy, and absolute volume >30 Gy, whereas BP-V and CP-V decreased the volume of absolute volume >50 Gy. In terms of organs at risk, AP-V offered better protection of the optic nerves, optic chiasm, and eyeballs for NPC than BP-V and CP-V. Most importantly, AP-V enhanced the utilization of the monitor units. For this reason, we propose that the radiotherapy technician put the location position in the PGTVnx center during simulation of the NPC patients. We further propose that the isocenter be moved to the geometric center of PGTVnx if the NPC patient plan has higher dosimeter requirements for the optic nerves, optic chiasm, or eyeballs.Copyright Â© 2019 The Authors.

1566,"Super-enhancers modulate interleukin-6 expression and function in cancers. Background: It is widely accepted that inflammatory cytokine, interleukin 6 (IL-6), was not only elevated in cancer but also important in carcinogenesis. But how did IL-6 be produced in tumor microenvironment remains to be addressed. Method(s): Both bioinformatics tools and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to examine the expression of IL-6 in cancer cells. To map super-enhancers of IL-6, sgRNAs were constructed. Stable knockout cells were established and subsequently used for cell proliferation and colony formation assay. The correlation between mapped super-enhancers and IL-6 expression was studied by ATAC-seq analysis. Result(s): The expression of IL-6 was high in multiple cancers, including pancreatic cancer (PAAD). The elevated expression of IL-6 in PAAD was further confirmed by transcriptional data and in a panel of pancreatic cancer cell lines (one immortal HPDE6-C7 cell line and four PDAC cell lines: BxPC-3, PANC-1, AsPC-1 and CFPAC-1). When treated with JQ-1 and I-BET-762, two inhibitors of super-enhancers, the expression of IL-6 in multiple cancer cells including CFPAC-1, HeLa and SUM-159 cells was significantly reduced. By analyzing the H3K27Ac profiling, BRD4 binding, Med1 binding and DNA conservation in CFPAC-1, HeLa and SUM-159 cells, we identified a potential super-enhancer (IL6-SE) that might be important for IL-6 expression in cancer. The super-enhancer (IL6-SE) can be further divided into two elements (IL6-SEa and IL6-SEb). Genetic deletion of IL6-SEa in cancer cells greatly reduces the expression of IL-6. IL6-SEa deficient cells also showed low proliferation and colony formation ability. In patients, the epigenetic activation (ATAC signal) of IL6-SEa is correlated with the expression of IL-6. Conclusion(s): In summary, we not only provide convincing experimental evidence to demonstrate that IL-6 expression in cancer is dependent on super-enhancers but also identified IL6-SEa as a critical DNA regulatory element. Our findings provide new insights to understand the epigenetic regulation of IL-6 expression in cancers.Copyright Â© Translational Cancer Research. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1637,"Perception of Egocentric Distance during Gravitational Changes in Parabolic Flight. We explored the effect of gravity on the perceived representation of the absolute distance of objects to the observers within the range from 1.5-6 m. Experiments were performed on board the CNES Airbus Zero-G during parabolic flights eliciting repeated exposures to short periods of microgravity (0 g), hypergravity (1.8 g), and normal gravity (1 g). Two methods for obtaining estimates of perceived egocentric distance were used: verbal reports and visually directed motion toward a memorized visual target. For the latter method, because normal walking is not possible in 0 g, blindfolded subjects translated toward the visual target by pulling on a rope with their arms. The results showed that distance estimates using both verbal reports and blind pulling were significantly different between normal gravity, microgravity, and hypergravity. Compared to the 1 g measurements, the estimates of perceived distance using blind pulling were shorter for all distances in 1.8 g, whereas in 0 g they were longer for distances up to 4 m and shorter for distances beyond. These findings suggest that gravity plays a role in both the sensorimotor system and the perceptual/cognitive system for estimating egocentric distance.",Excluded
3683,"CT urography for the diagnosis of medullary sponge kidney. Background: Medullary sponge kidney (MSK) is characterized by malformation of the terminal collecting ducts and is associated with an increased risk of nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, urinary tract infections, renal acidification defects, and reduced bone density. It has been historically diagnosed with intravenous pyelography (IVP), which is falling out of favor as an imaging modality. CT urography (CTU) performed with multidetector CT (MDCT) has been shown to create images of the renal collecting system with similar detail as IVP; however, its utility in diagnosing MSK has not been defined. Case Report: We present the first 15 patients with recurrent symptomatic nephrolithiasis who were evaluated in our renal stone clinic with CTU. Four patients were diagnosed with MSK after visualization of the characteristic radiologic findings. Discussion(s): CTU effectively demonstrates the characteristic radiologic findings of MSK including collecting tubule dilatation, medullary nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, and medullary cysts. Dose reduction protocols can reduce radiation exposure below that associated with conventional IVP. We propose CTU be considered for the diagnosis of MSK. Â© 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel.",Excluded

3434,"Transfer of perceptual-motor training and the space adaptation syndrome. Perceptual cue conflict may be the basis for the symptoms which are experienced by space travelers in microgravity conditions. Recovery has been suggested to take place after perceptual modification or reinterpretation. To elucidate this process, 10 subjects who repeatedly experienced a visual/vestibular conflict (Purkinje) over trials and days, were then tested in a similar but not identical perceptual situation (pseudo-Coriolis) to determine whether any savings in perceptual adaptation had occurred as compared to an unpracticed control group (N = 10). The practiced subjects experienced lessening dizziness and ataxia within and over sessions. Their response to the new perceptual situation was markedly less than the control group (p less than 0.001). Assessment of ""adaptability,"" in addition to the provocative vestibular tests now in use, may improve prediction of susceptibility to the space adaptation syndrome.

MBC with an unknown primary tumor is rare and is often prone to misdiagnosis, resulting in a delay in correct treatment. Such a case is extremely significant for clinical reference. The current study presents a 58-year-old male who developed a painless mass in the left armpit and received armpit mass biopsy and pathological examination which showed glandular cancer, with a high possibility of mammary primary tumor. The patient was administered four cycles of paclitaxel plus oxaliplatin chemotherapy. However, three months later, the patient identified novel disseminated lymph nodes in the left armpit. The initial pathological section and paraffin blocks were re-examined and the patient was finally diagnosed with breast invasive ductal carcinoma based on the metastases pathology and immunohistochemical examination. No breast mass was found on physical examination of the patient and the tumor markers, including cancer antigen 125 and carcinoembryonic antigen, were normal. No primary tumors were observed in the mammography and PET-CT and the primary tumor was not found following the left breast modified radical mastectomy.",Excluded
1880,"Comparative study of planimetry for patients with 3 brain metastases treated with Cyberknife: Treatment of 3 lesions separately versus 3 simultaneous lesions. Introduction. The aim of this study is to compare the irradiation of three brain lesions treated as consecutive and mono-fractionated to the Cyberknife with simultaneous treatment including the 3 lesions. Methods. We study in this work 12 patients with 3 brain lesions who each have been processed at the dose of 20 Gy in 1 fraction. These small tumors (mean 8 cc: min 0.4 cc, max 3.5 cc) were distant from each other. We realized after the fact a planimetry including the three lesions for a simultaneous treatment. To do this, we create a PTV Global volume on which we apply our dose constraints. We then compare the coverage, dosimetric indices (conformity index, homogeneity index, gradient), the processing time and doses to the brain. This study will allow us on the one hand, to assess the feasibility of the treatment, and on the other hand to propose the planimetry to the doctor according to the patient's case. To improve and secure our study, each patient received a double dosimetry performed by two different operators through the Multiplan planning console, which is dedicated to the Cyberknife. Results. The duration of the sessions for the 3 lesions treated simultaneously is acceptable for the patient with values between 45 min and 63 min (mean 55 min), which corresponds to an average increase of 71% (7-127%). This processing time is still acceptable and the simultaneous treatment is time saving for the machine since we have a discrepancy between these two treatment schemes, with an average gain of 83% (59-147%). We evaluated doses received by the healthy brain in the two schemes: V12 Gy, V10 Gy, V8 Gy, V5 Gy. Conclusions. In the context of the increase of small brain metastases treatment, the current trend is clearly towards hypofractionated treatment of the multi-localizations compared to the treatment of the whole of the brain. The comparison of the two treatment schemes allows us to propose in the future the solution of simultaneous treatment.",Excluded
831,"Computer-Assisted Distal Radius Osteotomy. Purpose: To establish the accuracy, precision, and clinical feasibility of a novel technique of computer-assisted distal radius osteotomy for the correction of symptomatic distal radius malunion. Method(s): Six patients underwent a computer-assisted distal radius osteotomy and were followed-up for an average of 25 months. Objective radiographic measurements and functional outcomes, as measured by clinical examination including grip strength and range of motion, and Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaires, were used. Result(s): The mean radiographic parameters included an increase of radial inclination to 21degree from 12degree (normal, 23degree). Dorsal and volar tilt (malunion) were corrected to 9degree from -30degree and 21degree, respectively (normal, 10degree). Ulnar variance was corrected to 1.9 mm from 7.5 mm (normal, +1.5 mm). Normal is defined as the average of the contralateral limb radiographs. The mean clinical outcome measures at an average of 25 months included a DASH global score of 14, a DASH individual item average score of 1.6, and an average affected side grip strength of 79% when compared with the unaffected side. Conclusion(s): The results of the computer-assisted technique were comparable with published results of traditional non-computer-assisted opening wedge osteotomy techniques. This technique allows a surgeon to accurately and precisely recognize and correct 3-dimensional deformities of the distal radius including axial malalignment (supination). The technique has the added benefit of reducing radiation exposure to the patient and surgical team because fluoroscopy is not used during the procedure. Additional benefits of the computer-assisted technique include the ability to perform multiple surgical simulations to optimize the alignment plan, and it serves as an excellent teaching tool for less-experienced surgeons.

2955,"A propensity-score matching analysis comparing long-term survival of surgery alone and postoperative treatment for patients in node positive or stage III esophageal squamous cell carcinoma after R0 esophagectomy. Background: Surveillance was recommended for patients after R0 esophagectomy by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. However, local failure was high in locally advanced patients (48-78%). The present study aimed to determine whether adjuvant treatment improved survival for stage IIb-III thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (TESCC). Method(s): A retrospective review of patients diagnosed as esophageal carcinoma at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Cancer hospital, between January 2004 and December 2011, was performed. A database compiling 975 patents with node positive or stage III thoracic esophageal carcinoma after R0 surgery with or without postoperative radiation/chemoradiation was created. A 1:1 matched study group was generated by the Greedy method after propensity score matching (PSM) analysis. Survival curves were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate analyses were using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Result(s): 975 patients were enrolled in the study, 510 patients (52.3%) did not receive any postoperative treatment after R0 surgery and 465 patients had either postoperative chemoradiation or radiotherapy. Median follow-up was 69.2 months. After PSM, 222 well-balanced patients in each group demonstrated the same results. The 3-year, 5-year survival rates and median survival in surgery group (33.0%, 26.4%, 24.3 months) were inferior to those in postoperative treatment group (48.3%, 37.1% and 34.3 months), (P = 0.002). Compared with radiotherapy, postoperative chemoradiation did not improve DFS and OS (P = 0.692; P = 0.368). N stage and adjuvant treatment are independent prognostic factors. Conclusion(s): Adjuvant treatment could improve survival for patients with stage IIb-III TESCC.Copyright Â© 2019",Excluded
3143,"The interobserver reliability of the diagnosis and classification of scaphoid fractures using high-resolution peripheral quantitative CT. Aims Besides conventional radiographs, the use of MRI, CT, and bone scintigraphy is frequent in the diagnosis of a fracture of the scaphoid. However, which techniques give the best results remain unknown. The investigation of a new imaging technique initially requires an analysis of its precision. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the interobserver agreement of high-resolution peripheral quantitative CT (HR-pQCT) in the diagnosis of a scaphoid fracture. A secondary aim was to investigate the interobserver agreement for the presence of other fractures and for the classification of scaphoid fracture. Methods Two radiologists and two orthopaedic trauma surgeons evaluated HR-pQCT scans of 31 patients with a clinically-suspected scaphoid fracture. The observers were asked to determine the presence of a scaphoid or other fracture and to classify the scaphoid fracture based on the Herbert classification system. Fleiss kappa statistics were used to calculate the interobserver agreement for the diagnosis of a fracture. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to assess the agreement for the classification of scaphoid fracture. Results A total of nine (29%) scaphoid fractures and 12 (39%) other fractures were diagnosed in 20 patients (65%) using HR-pQCT across the four observers. The interobserver agreement was 91% for the identification of a scaphoid fracture (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.00) and 80% for other fractures (95% CI 0.72 to 0.87). The mean ICC for the classification of a scaphoid fracture in the seven patients diagnosed with scaphoid fracture by all four observers was 73% (95% CI 0.42 to 0.94). Conclusion We conclude that the diagnosis of scaphoid and other fractures is reliable when using HR-pQCT in patients with a clinically-suspected fracture.Copyright Â© 2020 The British Editorial Society of Bone & Joint Surgery.",Excluded
2456,"Assessment of peak skin dose in interventional cardiology: A comparison between Gafchromic film and dosimetric software em.dose. OBJECTIVE: To compare the use of a dose mapping software to Gafchromic film measurement for a simplified peak skin dose (PSD) estimation in interventional cardiology procedure., METHODS: The study was conducted on a total of 40 cardiac procedures (20 complex coronary angioplasty of chronic total occlusion (CTO) and 20 coronary angiography and coronary angioplasty (CA-PTCA)) conducted between January 2014 to December 2015. PSD measurement (PSDFilm) was obtained by placing XR-RV3 Gafchromic under the patient's back for each procedure. PSD (PSDem.dose) was computed with the software em.doseÂ©. The calculation was performed on the dose metrics collected from the private dose report of each procedure. Two calculation methods (method A: fluoroscopic kerma equally spread on cine acquisition and B: fluoroscopic kerma is added to one air Kerma cine acquisition that contributes to the PSD) were used to calculate the fluoroscopic dose contribution as fluoroscopic data were not recorded in our interventional room. Statistical analyses were carried out to compare PSDFilm and PSDem.dose., RESULTS: The PSDFilm median (1st quartile; 3rd quartile) was 0.251(0.190;0.336)Gy for CA-PTCA and 1.453(0.767;2.011)Gy for CTO. For method-A, the PSDem.dose was 0.248(0.182;0.369)Gy for CA-PTCA and 1.601(0.892;2.178)Gy for CTO, and 0.267(0.223;0.446)Gy and 1.75 (0.912;2.584)Gy for method-B, respectively. For the two methods, the correlation between PSDFilm and PSDem.dose was strong. For all cardiology procedures investigated, the mean deviation between PSDFilm and PSDem.dose was 3.4+/-21.1% for method-A and 17.3%+/-23.9% for method-B., CONCLUSION: The dose mapping software is convenient to calculate peak skin dose in interventional cardiology.

4704,"Case report: Asymptomatic ventricular fibrillation and ineffective high energy therapy in a patient with left ventricular non compaction cardiomyopathy and left ventricular assist device. BACKGROUND We present a case of asymptomatic ventricular fibrillation and ineffective defibrillation in a patient with left ventricular non compaction cardiomyopathy after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) Heart Mate III. Non compaction cardiomyopathy is a rare, congenital cardiomyopathy resulting from abnormal embryogenesis of myocardium with characteristic multiple trabeculations in ventricular apex. Its lethal character comes from frequent ventricular arrhythmias, often also with atrio ventricular conduction block. The main role of treatment is to improve cardiac efficiency, reduce the risk of arrhythmias, implant of an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator for prevention of sudden cardiac death, ventricular assist device and heart transplant in cases of serious heart failure. CASE REPORT 61 year old patient with severe heart failure (LVEF 16%), diagnosed in 2012. In the course of non compaction cardiomyopathy after cardiac resynchronization therapy with defibrillation function in February 2018 and implantation left ventricular mechanical cardiac assistant LVAD with Heart Mate III system on 27.06.2019. The patient had 5 discharges of the device in a church without loss of consciousness and symptoms of apparent circulatory failure on 27.10.2019. The patient was admitted to the Emergency Department in fair general condition, with basal crepitations over the lungs audible, slight dyspnea at rest, with ongoing Torsade de pointes in electrocardiographic examination, with ventricular rate 300/min, and blood pressure 100/60 Hg mm. Ventricular fibrillation was interrupted by external defibrillator, achieving sinus rhythm return. Basic examination results showed elevated proBNP values (4362 ng/l), features of pulmonary stasis on X ray. CRT D device memory showed 5 unsuccessful discharges of the device, followed by external effective defibrillation after exhausting all available high energy therapies, which restored sinus rhythm and synchronous biventricular stimulation. The patient was discharged home in good condition. CONCLUSIONS Ineffective high energy therapy in many cases ends in death. In this case, despite the abnormal electrical heart rate, LVAD was working correctly and ensured proper cardiovascular function.",Excluded
1470,"Scanning beyond anatomic limits of the thorax in chest CT: findings, radiation dose, and automatic tube current modulation. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine additional radiation dose associated with scanning beyond the anatomic limits of the thorax in chest CT protocol and to assess the effect of z-axis modulation on the additional radiation dose associated with the scanning protocol. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ""Extra"" images for routine chest CT were defined as those above lung apices (supraapical) and those caudal to the lowermost portion of lung parenchyma (infrapulmonary), including images obtained beyond the adrenal glands (infraadrenal). One hundred and forty-eight consecutive chest CT examinations (70 men, 78 women; age range, 15-90 years) performed September 13-25, 2003, were reviewed to determine the number of supraapical, infrapulmonary, and infraadrenal extra images. All examinations were performed using z-axis modulation (n = 70) or fixed tube current (n = 78). The CT dose index volume and dose-length product (DLP) values for the extra images were calculated. Two radiologists reviewed these extra images for pathologic findings. Student's t test was used to perform the statistical analysis. RESULT(S): One hundred forty-four (97%) examinations had supraapical extra images and 145 (98%) had infrapulmonary extra images. A total of 31 additional findings were observed in extra images. Most clinically important findings were identified in patients with a history of malignancy. With z-axis modulation, the mean DLP for supraapical and infrapulmonary extra images was 39.98 mGy x cm and 132.59 mGy x cm, respectively. With fixed tube current, the mean DLP for supraapical and infrapulmonary extra images was 30.31 mGy x cm and 95.91 mGy x cm, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): A substantial number of extra images are acquired during chest CT that do not add clinically important information in patients with nonmalignant indications. The use of z-axis modulation increased radiation dose for the extra images.",Excluded
3706,"Radiotherapy in patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices: clinical and dosimetric aspects. As a result of aging, the number of patients with cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) requiring radiotherapy (RT) continues to rise. The aim of this work was to evaluate RT-related malfunctions of CIED in a cohort of patients who underwent RT in our clinic from June 2010 to December 2016. We retrospectively analyzed 93 RT treatments in 63 patients with CIEDs. Patients were treated with 3D conformal RT, intensity-modulated RT and stereotactic RT. We collected clinical characteristics of cancer, models of CIEDs, total RT dose to tumor and radiation energy. Radiation dose delivered to CIED and its dysfunctions after RT was evaluated. Subgroup analysis of 48 RT treatments (32 patients) on chest and neck plus on 13 RT treatments (12 patients) with 18 MV neutron-producing photon energy considered as high risk was performed. The number of treatments of patients with CIEDs increased from 0.3% in 2011 to 1.2% in 2016. Two patients, treated with 18 MV photon beam, with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) that received a maximum dose of around 2.1 Gy, experienced adverse events: a reprogramming of ICD when the patient reached a delivered dose to the tumor of 32 Gy, and an altered sensing function requiring replacement after 11 months from the end of RT. Nearly 2% of patients with CIEDs from high-risk patients subgroup had experienced a damage of the device. Close cooperation between radiation oncologists, cardiologists, medical physicists and radiation technologists is needed to achieve the best practice management in these patients.Copyright Â© 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
4242,"Impact of Radiation Dose Reduction in Abdominal Computed Tomography on Diagnostic Accuracy and Diagnostic Performance in Patients with Suspected Appendicitis: An Intraindividual Comparison. RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To determine the intraindividual impact of radiation dose reduction in abdominal computed tomography (CT) on diagnostic performance in patients with suspected appendicitis., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was approved by the institutional review board. Seventy-five patients who underwent standard contrast-enhanced abdominal CT for suspected appendicitis between 2004 and 2009 were retrospectively included. Low-dose CT reconstructions with 75%, 50%, and 25% of the original radiation dose level were generated by applying realistic reduced-dose simulation. Two blinded, independent readers assessed image quality, signal-to-noise ratio, and diagnostic confidence on each dataset. Diagnostic accuracy for detection of appendicitis and complications were calculated for each reader. Paired univariate tests were used to determine intraindividual differences., RESULTS: Among 75 subjects included in the analysis (57% female, mean age: 41 +/- 18 years), the prevalence of histopathologically confirmed appendicitis was 59%. Signal-to-noise ratio and subjective image quality of 50% and 25% reduced-dose CTs were significantly lower than the reference datasets (all P < .005). Appendicitis was correctly identified in all reference and low-dose datasets (sensitivity: 100%, negative predictive value: 100%). Presence of complications was correctly detected in all reference, 75%, and 50% datasets, but was decreased in 25% datasets (sensitivity: 77.8% and negative predictive value: 97.4%). Diagnostic confidence was high for original and 75% datasets, but significantly lower for 50% and 25% datasets (P < .001)., CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that diagnostic accuracy in abdominal CT acquisitions acquired at 75% and 50% of radiation dose is maintained in patients with suspected appendicitis, whereas further reduction of radiation exposition is associated with decreased diagnostic performance.

3471,"Fluoroscopic Sacroiliac Joint Injection: Is Oblique Angulation Really Necessary?. BACKGROUND: The conventional technique for sacroiliac (SI) joint injection involves aligning the anterior and posterior aspects of the SI joint under fluoroscopic guidance and then entering the SI joint in the most caudal aspect., OBJECTIVE: We wish to highlight that there is no added advantage to aligning both the anterior and posterior joint lines of the SI joint as it is time consuming, associated with additional radiation exposure, and may make the entry into the posterior SI joint technically more difficult., STUDY DESIGN: Observational study., SETTING: Pain Clinic, Department of Anesthesiology., METHODS: With the patient lying prone on fluoroscopy table, SI joint injection is performed with a 22 G, 10 cm spinal needle in a true anteroposterior (AP) view, where anterior and posterior SI joint spaces are seen as separate entities, where the medial joint space represents the posterior SI joint and the lateral joint space represents the anterior SI joint. The distal 1 cm of the medial joint space is entered under AP view. If the SI joint is seen as a straight line rather than 2 joint spaces in the AP view then the image intensifier of the fluoroscope was tilted cranially to elongate the image of the lower part of the posterior SI joint, thus facilitating entry into this part of the joint which was confirmed by administering 0.3 to 0.5 mL of radiopaque contrast medium., RESULT: Sixty SI joints of 58 patients were injected under an AP fluoroscopic view. Forty-two (70%) SI joints were seen as 2 separate medial and lateral joint spaces and were entered in distal 1 cm of the medial joint space. In 18 (30%) joints seen as a straight line rather than 2 separate spaces, the image intensifier of the fluoroscope was tilted cranially to elongate the image of the lower part of the posterior SI joint and then the SI joint was entered in its distal 1 cm. Confirmation of entry into the SI joint was confirmed by with 0.3 to 0.5 mL of radiopaque contrast medium. In 4 cases the joints did not show the correct radiopaque contrast spread (3/42 and 1/18) although the needle seemed to be in the joint space., LIMITATIONS: Small sample size., CONCLUSION: Aligning the anterior and posterior aspects of SI joint for fluoroscopic guided SI joint injection is not necessary for the success of the block.Key words: Sacroiliac joint, injection, anteroposterior view, oblique angulation, fluoroscopic technique.",Excluded
4210,"Changes in tumor oxygenation during combined treatment with split- course radiotherapy and chemotherapy in patients with head and neck cancer. Purpose: To evaluate the changes in tumor oxygenation during definitive split-course radiochemotherapy in locally advanced head and neck cancer (lymph nodes and primaries). Material(s) and Method(s): Twenty-four patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer were investigated pretherapeutically and during a defined course of radiochemotherapy (RCTh) with a total dose of 70 Gy given in 35 fractions over 9 weeks (2-week break after 30 Gy). In weeks 1 and 6, the patients received chemotherapy (5 FU and mitomycin C) concomitant with irradiation. The oxygen partial pressure measurements were carried out using polarographic needle probes in combination with a microprocessor-controlled device (pO2 histograph/KIMOC). Times of measurements were before therapy, at the end of week 3 (30 Gy), after a 2- week break (30 Gy) and at the end of therapy if measurable lesion was found (70 Gy). Result(s): There was a significant reduction in the median pO2 (P < 0.005, n = 18) and an increase in the hypoxic fraction (defined as the percentage of pO2 values of <5 mm Hg) after application of 30 Gy (P < 0.05, n = 18). This effect was partially reversed at the end of the 2-week break. During the break an increase in the median pO2 (P = 0.05, n = 12) and a decrease in the hypoxic fraction could be observed. Towards the end of therapy (70 Gy) a significant decrease (P = 0.02, n = 13) in the median pO2 occurred. Corresponding to this, the hypoxic fraction increased during the last 4 weeks of therapy (P = 0.06, n = 13). Conclusion(s): Statistically significant changes in oxygenation in locally advanced head and neck cancer were found during a split-course radiochemotherapy. This information was obtained in a homogenous group of patients under well-defined therapeutic conditions. The decrease in the tumor oxygenation status at doses of 30 and 70 Gy are important findings because they are in contrast to the concept of continuous improvement of the oxygenation status during fractionated radiotherapy.",Excluded
4605,"Fluoroscopic Exposure With Use of Mini-C-Arm During Routine Hand Surgery: A Prospective Comparison of Hand Versus Eye Radiation Dosage. Radiation exposure with use of intraoperative fluoroscopy is a potential orthopedic occupational risk factor. The purpose of this study was to perform a prospective comparison of hand versus eye radiation exposure associated with mini-C-arm utilization and to test the hypothesis that routine mini-C-arm does not yield hand or eye dosages exceeding current recommended levels. Over a 12-month period, hand and eye radiation exposure was prospectively measured in a single board-certified hand surgeon using mini-C-arm fluoroscopy. Twenty-five cases were performed utilizing mini-C-arm fluoroscopy. Average monthly hand radiation dosage (45.81+/-14.49 mrem) was significantly higher (p = .01) than eye radiation dosage (<30 mrem). Both recorded values were below their respective critical exposure limits, as reported by the International Commission on Radiological Protection.

2830,"Ultrasonic backscatter difference measurements of cancellous bone from the human femur: Relation to bone mineral density and microstructure. Ultrasonic backscatter techniques are being developed to detect changes in cancellous bone caused by osteoporosis. One technique, called the backscatter difference technique, measures the power difference between two portions of a backscatter signal. The goal of the present study is to investigate how bone mineral density (BMD) and the microstructure of human cancellous bone influence four backscatter difference parameters: the normalized mean of the backscatter difference (nMBD) spectrum, the normalized slope of the backscatter difference spectrum, the normalized intercept of the backscatter difference spectrum, and the normalized backscatter amplitude ratio (nBAR). Ultrasonic measurements were performed with a 3.5MHz broadband transducer on 54 specimens of human cancellous bone from the proximal femur. Volumetric BMD and the microstructural characteristics of the specimens were measured using x-ray micro-computed tomography. Of the four ultrasonic parameters studied, nMBD and nBAR demonstrated the strongest univariate correlations with density and microstructure. Multivariate analyses indicated that nMBD and nBAR depended on trabecular separation and possibly other microstructural characteristics of the specimens independently of BMD. These findings suggest that nMBD and nBAR may be sensitive to changes in the density and microstructure of bone caused by osteoporosis.",Excluded
1964,"Comparison of normal tissue pharmacokinetics with 111In/90Y monoclonal antibody m170 for breast and prostate cancer. Purpose: Radioactivity deposition in normal tissues limits the dose deliverable by radiopharmaceuticals (RP) in radioimmunotherapy (RIT). This study investigated the absorbed radiation dose in normal tissues for prostate cancer patients in comparison to breast cancer patients for 2 RPs using the monoclonal antibody (MAb) m170. Methods and Materials: 111In-DOTA-glycylglycylglycyl-l-p-isothiocyanatophenylalanine amide (GGGF)-m170 and 111In-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N,N'-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) 2-iminothiolane (2IT)-m170, representing the same MAb and chelate with and without a cleavable linkage, were studied in 13 breast cancer and 26 prostate cancer patients. Dosimetry for 90Y was calculated using 111In MAb pharmacokinetics from the initial imaging study for each patient, using reference man- and patient-specific masses. Result(s): The reference man-specific radiation doses (cGy/MBq) were not significantly different for the breast and the prostate cancer patients for both RPs in all but one tissue-RP combination (liver, DOTA-2IT). The patient-specific doses had differences between the groups most of which can be related to weight differences. Conclusion(s): Similar normal tissue doses were calculated for two groups of patients having different cancers and genders. This similarity combined with continued careful analysis of the imaging data might allow the use of higher starting doses in early phase RIT studies. Â© 2006 Elsevier Inc.

1956,"Electrical isolation of pulmonary veins in patients with atrial fibrillation: Reduction of fluoroscopy exposure and procedure duration by the use of a non-fluoroscopic navigation system (NavX). Aims: The aim of the study was to investigate the feasibility of performing segmental pulmonary vein (PV) isolation guided by the NavX (Endocardial Solutions, St Jude Medical, Inc., St Paul, MN, USA) system without the three-dimensional (3D) geometric reconstruction option and whether the use of NavX system will reduce the radiation exposure and procedure duration. Methods and Results: The study included 64 patients with symptomatic paroxysmal or permanent atrial fibrillation, in whom PV isolation was performed using fluoroscopic guidance (n=32) or the NavX system (n=32). Pulmonary vein mapping with a circular mapping catheter allowed the identification and localization of myocardial connections between the PV and the left atrium. PV isolation was performed by radiofrequency ablation of these connections at the atrial aspect of the PV ostium. Primary success rate for isolated PVs did not differ significantly in patients ablated under fluoroscopic guidance vs. those ablated under guidance of NavX system [100/107 PVs (93.5%) vs. 120/124 PV (96.8%; P=n.s.)]. Compared with fluoroscopy guided procedures, NavX-guided procedures showed a significant reduction in the fluoroscopy time (75.8+/-24.5 vs. 38.9+/-19.3 min, P<0.05), total X-ray exposure (93.2+/-51.6 vs. 56.6+/-37.9 Gy cm2, P=0.03), and total procedural time (237.7+/-65.4 vs. 188.6+/-62.7, P=0.01). The mean follow-up was 9.5+/-3.0 months. One patient in each group was lost to follow-up. Seven-day Holter monitoring showed that 23 of 31 patients (74.2%) in the NavX-guided group and 21 of 31 patients (67.7%) in the fluoroscopy-guided group were in sinus rhythm (P=0.57). Conclusion(s): The 3D visualization of the catheters by NavX system allows a rapid and precise visualization of the mapping and ablation catheters at the PV ostia and markedly reduces fluoroscopy time, total X-ray exposure, and procedural duration during PV isolation compared with ablation performed under fluoroscopy guidance.

1670,"Treatment of bifurcation in-stent restenotic lesions with beta radiation using strontium 90 and sequential positioning pullback technique: procedural details and clinical outcomes. BACKGROUND: In-stent restenotic lesions have been problematic for many patients with the need for multiple repeat percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). The need for repeat PCI has been significantly reduced in patients since the advent of vascular brachytherapy. In-stent restenosis resulting in bifurcation presents even more of a challenge. The use of radiation therapy for the treatment of this kind of lesion has not yet been reported. The purpose of this paper is to present five cases of radiation therapy in bifurcation in-stent restenotic lesions using the intraluminal beta radiation catheter delivery system (Beta-Cath System, Novoste Corporation, Norcross, Georgia)., METHODS: We reviewed the database of patients enrolled in our Compassionate Use Registry between August 1999 and April 2002. The data is reported for 5 patients who received radiation in both branches of bifurcation lesions with the Beta-Cath catheter system., RESULTS: The mean diameter of the vessels was 3.1 mm 0.5 mm. The dose administered was from 18.3 to 23 Gy, with an overlap of 3.3 to 10.3 mm; the hinge angle between the branches went from 43.3 to 65.4 . Angiographic follow-up was obtained at 6 months in 4 patients, with a single patient showing a focal (< 5 mm) edge lesion treated by balloon angioplasty (TVR no TLR). No aneurysms or zones of ectasia were noted., CONCLUSION: Beta radiation with the Beta-Cath catheter system appears to be safe, secure and clinically useful in in-stent restenotic bifurcation lesions.",Excluded
1755,"""Beach Lifeguards' Sun Exposure and Sun Protection in Spain"". Background: Sunburn is the main avoidable cause of skin cancer. Beach lifeguards spend many hours exposed to the effects of solar radiation during their work day, precisely at times of the year when levels of solar irradiation are highest. The aim of this study is to quantify the risk to beach lifeguards of sun exposure. Method(s): A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out in the Western Costa del Sol, southern Spain, during the summer of 2018. The research subjects were recruited during a skin cancer prevention course for beach lifeguards. All participants were invited to complete a questionnaire on their habits, attitudes, and knowledge related to sun exposure. In addition, ten were specially monitored using personal dosimeters for three consecutive days, and the results were recorded in a photoprotection diary. A descriptive analysis (mean and standard deviation for the quantitative variables) was performed, and inter-group differences were evaluated using the Mann-Whitney U test. Result(s): Two hundred fifteen lifeguards completed the questionnaire, and 109 met the criteria for inclusion in this analysis. The mean age was 23.8 years (SD: 5.1), 78.0% were male, 71.5% were phototype III or IV (Fitzpatrick's phototype), and 77.1% had experienced at least one painful sunburn during the previous summer. The mean daily personal ultraviolet exposure per day, the minimal erythema dose, and the standard erythema dose, in J/m2, were 634.7 [standard deviation (SD): 356.2], 2.5 (SD: 1.4) and 6.35 (SD: 3.6), respectively. Conclusion(s): Beach lifeguards receive very high doses of solar radiation during the work day and experience correspondingly high rates of sunburn. Intervention strategies to modify their sun exposure behavior and working environment are necessary to reduce the risk of skin cancer for these workers and to promote early diagnosis of the disease.Copyright Â© 2020 The Authors",Excluded

4906,"Reducing contrast medium dose with low photon energy images in renal dual-energy spectral CT angiography and adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the value of using low energy (keV) images in renal dual-energy spectral CT angiography (CTA) and adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) to reduce contrast medium dose. METHOD(S): 40 patients with renal CTA on a Discovery CT750HD were randomly divided into two groups: 20 cases (Group A) with 600mgI kg-1 and 20 cases (Group B) with 300mgI kg-1. The scan protocol for both groups was: dual-energy mode with mA selection for noise index of 10 HU, pitch 1.375:1, rotating speed 0.6s/r. Images were reconstructed at 0.625mm thickness with 40%ASIR, Group A used the conventional 70keV monochromatic images, and Group B used monochromatic images from 40 to 70 keV at 5 keV interval for analysis. The CT values and standard deviation (SD) values of the renal artery and erector spine in the plain and arterial phases were measured with the erector spine SD value representing image noise. The enhancement degree of the renal artery (DELTACT = CT(arterial) -CT(plain)), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR=CTrenal-artery/SDrenal-artery) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR=(CTrenal-artery-CTerector spine)/SDerector-spine) were calculated. The single factor analysis of variance was used to analyze the difference of DELTACT, SNR and CNR among image groups with p < 0.05 being statistically significant. The subjective image scores of the groups were assessed blindly by two experienced physicians using a 5-point system and the score consistency was compared by the kappa test. RESULT(S): Contrast medium dose in the 300mgI kg-1 group was reduced by 50% compared with the 600mgI kg-1 group, while radiation dose was similar between the two groups. The subjective scores were 4.00 +/- 0.65, 4.50 +/- 0.60and 3.70 +/- 0.80 for images at 70 keV (600mgI kg-1 group), 40 keV (300mgI kg-1 group) and 45 keV (300mgI kg-1 group), respectively with good consistency between the two reviewers (p > 0.05). The 40 keV images in the 300mgI kg-1 group had similar DELTACT (469.77 +/- 86.95HU vs 398.54 +/- 73.68HU) and CNR (15.52 +/- 3.32 vs 18.78 +/- 6.71) values as the 70 keV images in the 600mgI kg-1) group but higher SNR values (30.19 +/- 4.41 vs 16.91 +/- 11.12, p < 0,05). CONCLUSION(S): Contrast dose may be reduced by 50% while maintaining image quality by using lower energy images combined with ASIR in renal dual-energy CTA. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Combined with ASIR and energy spectrum, can reduce the amount of contrast dose in renal CTA.",Excluded
1463,"Use of digital auscultation in patients with ARDS: a correlation study with CT imaging. Despite being the gold standard for evaluation of lung parenchyma in ARDS patients, chest CT scan may be complicated by requiring patient transportation out of the ICU and is burdened by high costs and significant radiation exposure. We aimed to correlate acoustic features from digital chest auscultation with CT findings to explore the potential role of quantitative lung sound analysis as surrogate of imaging in these patients. We enrolled 4 male and 2 female patients (age: 63y+/-21 ; BMI: 25,7+/-4,4) admitted to ICU for ARDS-related severe respiratory failure (SRF) who underwent chest CT scan while receiving controlled invasive mechanical ventilation. A thoracic radiologist scored twelve lung regions for the prevalent CT pattern - normal, interstitial thickening, ground glass opacity or consolidation - and for the presence of pleural effusion. Digital auscultation was performed within 24 hours from CT scan at corresponding regions. Average frequency of the acoustic signal was higher in lung regions with consolidation (n=32) as compared to those with other patterns (n=38) (difference -2.25 Htz, 95%CI -4-42; -0.7, p=0.043). Increasing signal frequency was significantly associated with evidence of consolidation on CT (OR 1.117, 95%CI 1.00-1.247, p=0.048). Digital auscultation and quantitative lung sound analysis may help assess alveolar ventilation in patients with SRF in a simple, non-invasive way. Further investigation in larger populations is warranted to assess the validity of acoustic features against quantitative CT imaging.",Excluded

Two hundred and eighty-six patients over the age of 65 (age range 65-102, mean age 82 years), who were hospitalized in geriatric wards, were examined clinically for the presence of sebaceous gland hyperplasia and senile comedones. The degree of solar elastotic change present was scored on a visual analogue scale. The prevalence rate of sebaceous gland hyperplasia and of senile comedones was found to be 26% in each case. Approximately one third of patients had both lesions. Neither of these lesions was related to either the degree of solar elastotic change or the skin type with regard to tanning ability. It was concluded that chronic solar exposure was not a likely cause of these common conditions.",Excluded

This article describes procedures and some results of the first study of females undergoing 3-day Dry Immersion. The experiment ""NAIAD-2020"" was carried out at the Institute of Biomedical Problems (Moscow, Russia) with the participation of six healthy women volunteers (age 30.17 +/- 5.5 years, height 1.66 +/- 0.1 m, weight 62.05 +/- 8.4 kg, BMI 22.39 +/- 2.2 kg/m2) with a natural menstrual cycle. During the study, a standard protocol was used, the same as for men, with a minimum period of time spent outside the immersion bath. Before, during and after Immersion, 22 experiments were carried out aimed at studying the neurophysiological, functional, metabolic and psychophysiological functions of the body, the results of which will be presented in future publications. The total time outside the bath for women did not exceed that for men. Systolic and diastolic pressure did not significantly change during the immersion. In the first 24 h after the end of the immersion, heart rate was significantly higher than the background values [F(4,20) = 14.67; P < 0.0001]. Changes in body temperature and water balance were consistent with the patterns found in men. No significant changes in height and weight were found during immersion. All women reported general discomfort and pain in the abdomen and back.

1781,"Eos, o-arm and standard spine radiographs; What is the cumulative radiation exposure during current scoliosis management?. Background/introduction: During the course of assessment and treatment for AIS, patients are subjected to repeated radiological exposure. Only a few studies have evaluated the total absorbed radiation dose from standard radiography and EOS during follow-up for scoliosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate and compare total radiation dose exposure from all modalities for a cohort of AIS patients. Purpose of the study: The primary aim of this study was to determine the radiation exposure of AIS patients during scoliosis management. Moreover, this study aimed to compare follow-up algorithms among international spine centers. Material(s) and Method(s): A retrospective review on radiation exposure of patients treated for AIS. Inclusions: patients followed for AIS from 2013 to 2016 without neuromuscular diseases. The O-arm conebeam CT scanner was used for 3D navigation in all surgically managed patients, low dose protocols were used (70 kVp, 80 mAs). A survey asking for information on radiological algorithms and imaging frequencies was sent to a number of international spine centers for comparison with in-house algorithm. Result(s): 61 patients were included, 19 were treated conservatively (M/F: 6/13) and 42 surgically (M/F: 11/31). Median follow up time for the conservative group was 8 (range 0-51) months and 37 (range 13-163) months for the surgical group. Median number of X-rays/EOS were; 2 (range 0-20)/2 (range 0-17) for the conservative group and 15 (range 2-57)/11(range 0-26) for the surgery group. Patients undergoing surgery received a median cumulative radiation dose of 10.31 mSv (range 3.79-20.43) vs. a median dose of 1.09 mSv (range 0.22-7.17) for those treated conservatively. Approximately 25% (39.04/161.82 mSv) of total intraoperative radiation dose for all patients was a result of O-arm 2D fluoroscopy. A mean of 11 levels of the spine were fused during correction surgeries. Median Cobb angle at the beginning/end of follow up were 19-(range 10--50-)/23- (range 12--65-) for the conservative group and 44- (range 10--80-)/15- (range 4--30-) for the surgery group. Median Cobb angle before the surgery was 52- (range 36--82-). The results of the questionnaire showed great variety of radiological follow-up algorithms among 8 spine centers without adherence to any of the published consensus statements. Conclusion(s): Surgically treated patients were, as anticipated, exposed to more, radiation dose than those treated conservatively, almost 10-fold more, owing mainly to intraoperative 3D scans and a larger numbers of radiological follow-up examinations. The use of conebeam CT-based 3D navigation elevates patient safety during deformity surgery. However, patients are potentially exposed to a significant amount of radiation depending on protocol and use of 2D fluoroscopy. Further awareness of ways to reduce radiation dose and optimize radiological protocols is warranted in order to decrease radiation-induced malignancy.",Excluded
2150,"Vascular enhancement and image quality of CT venography: comparison of standard and low kilovoltage settings. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to investigate the vascular enhancement and image quality of CT venography (CTV) with a lower peak kilovoltage (kVp) setting than the standard setting., MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, the clinical records of 100 consecutive patients with suspected pulmonary embolism were analyzed. All patients underwent pulmonary CT angiography and CTV of the abdomen, pelvis, and lower extremities using 64-MDCT with automatic tube current modulation: 50 patients underwent CT at 120 kVp, the standard kVp setting, and 50 patients were scanned at 100 kVp; we refer to these groups as the ""standard-kVp group"" and the ""low-kVp group,"" respectively. Vessel enhancement and image noise were assessed in the inferior vena cava (IVC), femoral vein, and popliteal vein. Two radiologists who were blinded to the kVp setting placed the regions of interest on vessels by consensus and assessed image quality using a 5-point visual scale. Effective dose was estimated using the dose-length product. The Wilcoxon rank test was used to evaluate differences between the two groups using statistics software (JMP, version 5.1). A p value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance., RESULTS: Mean vascular enhancement was significantly higher in the low-kVp group than in the standard-kVp group: IVC, 138.4 +/- 12.2 (SD) HU versus 164.5 +/- 17.4 HU, respectively; femoral vein, 130.2 +/- 18.0 HU versus 152.0 +/- 24.5 HU; and popliteal vein, 136.7 +/- 17.5 HU versus 158.3 +/- 26.0 HU. Although the images of the low-kVp group had significantly higher image noise, there were no significant differences in image quality in the IVC and popliteal vein. The mean effective dose for the low-kVp protocol was significantly lower than that for the standard-kVp protocol., CONCLUSION: Lowering the kVp setting for CTV examinations improved vascular enhancement while providing sufficient image quality.",Excluded
3680,"Myeloablative unrelated cord blood transplantation for acute leukemia patients between 50 and 55 years of age: Single institutional retrospective comparison with patients younger than 50 years of age. Increasing recipient age is a well-known risk factor for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and treatment-related mortality (TRM) and has a negative impact on allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Since the incidence of severe GVHD after cord blood transplantation (CBT) is lower than that after transplants using bone marrow or mobilized peripheral blood grafts from adult cells, we should expect better outcomes from CBT in older patients. To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of myeloablative unrelated CBT in patients aged between 50 and 55 years, we performed a retrospective comparison of 100 patients with acute leukemia who received cord blood grafts at our institution. Nineteen older patients (median age, 52; range, 50-55) and 81 younger patients (median, 36; range, 16-49) received a myeloablative conditioning regimen including 12 Gy of total body irradiation and chemotherapy. GVHD prophylaxis included cyclosporine with (n = 96) or without (n = 4) methotrexate. There were no significant differences in the incidences of grades II to IV acute GVHD, extensive-type chronic GVHD, TRM, and the probability of overall and disease-free survival between these groups. These results suggest that, in patients with acute leukemia, myeloablative CBT might be as safe and effective in patients aged between 50 and 55 years as in younger patients.

BACKGROUND: This study evaluates a novel method of intraoperative localization of endocrine gastroenteropancreatic tumors with a hand-held gamma-detecting probe to detect in situ tumor binding of the radioiodinated somatostatin analog 125I-TYR(3)-octreotide., METHODS: Seven patients with biochemical and radiologic evidence of a specific endocrine tumor, one patient with biochemical evidence of gastrinoma but no tumor localized by conventional imaging techniques, and four patients with equivocal preoperative biochemical or radiologic study results but suspected of harboring a neuroendocrine tumor underwent abdominal exploration with intraoperative injection of 125I-TYR(3)-octreotide. 298 +/- 63 microCi. A hand-held gamma-detecting probe was used during operation to determine whether gross tumor accumulated the radiolabeled analog and occult tumor could be detected. Positive uptake was defined as tumor/background ratios exceeding 2:1., RESULTS: The tumor in all seven patients with gross disease accumulated 125I-TYR(3)-octreotide. Occult tumor beyond that appreciated with preoperative imaging or by routine operative exploration was detected in a patient with carcinoid tumor. In the patient with the occult gastrinoma the probe detected the lesion within the duodenal bulb before duodenotomy and also predicted what proved histologically to be positive peripancreatic adenopathy. There was a single false-positive reading from the stomach in a patient with suspected carcinoid tumor in whom no tumor could be found grossly or histologically. A pancreatic mass that probed negative proved to be an adenocarcinoma of ductal origin., CONCLUSIONS: Tumor-specific peptide-receptor binding can be detected in situ with 125J-TYR(3)-octreotide and a hand-held gamma-detecting probe. This technique may facilitate neuroendocrine tumor localization and operative cytoreduction.",Excluded
3074,"Effectiveness of Nd: YAG laser therapy on Japanese cedar pollinosis. Many have reported on the effectiveness of laser surgery therapy for perennial allergic rhinitis. However, the suppressive effects of laser irradiation on allergic rhinitis and its symptoms have not been reported in patients with pollinosis. This is because therapeutic effects on pollinosis are difficult to evaluate. The amount of pollen in the air varies during the year, and from year to year. Also, allergic symptoms develop due to exposure to the amount of pollen which is markedly influenced by the weather. In this study, the severity of allergic symptoms in the pollen season was compared between patients treated with early medication, non-treated patients and patients treated with preseasonal contact Nd: YAG laser surgery. Results suggests that laser surgery was effective in reducing the severity of symptoms in patients with cedar pollinosis. Symptoms were milder in the laser group than in the medication group and non-treated group for 3-4 weeks after the start of seasonal pollinosis, although no differences were noted in the early weeks. This may be explained by the fact that laser irradiation reduces the lamina propria of the nasal mucosa, the site of allergic reactions. This also suggests that allergic pollen can't penetrate the mucosal surface which shows squamous epithelization after laser irradiation.",Excluded
1069,"Effects of X-rays and cigarette smoking on leukocyte, lymphocyte and mitotic index values and SCE rates: the relationship between mitotic index and lymphocyte count. Many previous studies revealed that smoking increases leukocyte and lymphocyte counts while exposure to X-rays decreases these counts. However the relationships between lymphocyte life span and smoking as well as X-rays were not well documented. The primary aim of this study was to determine relationships between smoking X-rays (in combination and individually) and life span of lymphocytes. Blood samples from 200 healthy individuals, half of which were X-ray exposed individuals, were collected. Half of X-ray exposed and of non-X-ray exposed individuals were smokers. There were equal numbers of male and female participants. Two lymphocyte cultures, one for the sister chromatid exchange (SCE) analysis and the other for the determination of mitotic index values were prepared using one part of the blood samples collected from the individuals. From the other part of the blood sample leukocyte and lymphocyte counts were determined with a haemogram device. Evaluation of the findings suggested that leukocyte count, lymphocyte count, mitotic index were relatively lower for the X-ray exposed individuals. In addition these values were higher for smokers than nonsmokers in general. The highest SCE rates were recorded for smoking radiology technicians. The most important finding is that lymphocyte life span is relatively low in smokers and in X-ray exposed males.",Included

Ageing, melatonin, epithalon (tetrapeptide Ala-Glu-Asp-Gly) and different light conditions effects on protein content and cathepsins B and D activities in rat liver and kidneys lysosomal fractions were studied. Ageing leads to decrease of cathepsins activity in rat liver lysosomal fractions. Constant light and darkness conditions result in earlier age decline of cathepsins activity. Absence of day and night succession in comparison with alternating light conditions causes decline of both general and specific cathepsin D activity. Melatonin and epithalon administration resulted in decrease of cathepsin D activity in liver only under control interchangeable light conditions. Cathepsin B activity in liver and kidneys lysosomal fractions declined in all experimental light conditions. Cathepsins activity decrease under the influence of epiphysial factors is evidently connected with their inhibitory effect on protein and general metabolism.",Excluded

Implantation of estrogen in female chicks induces masculine differentiation of neurons in their song nuclei. The effects of estrogen on neuron size decline steeply after posthatching day 35 when neuronal atrophy begins. Estrogen loses its masculinizing effects completely after day 45 when the adult level of neuronal atrophy is reached. Thus, the end and the intensity of hormone action appear to be correlated with the timing of neuronal atrophy.",Excluded

PURPOSE: This study analyzed the outcomes of nonrandomized consolidation radiotherapy (RT) given after chemotherapy in the initial treatment of advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). The results were collected prospectively within a randomized controlled trial of induction chemotherapy., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned between doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine and one of two prespecified multidrug regimens. At least six cycles of chemotherapy were planned, with up to eight for patients showing slower response. Involved-field RT was recommended for incomplete response to chemotherapy or bulk disease at presentation. The primary outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS), landmarked from the end of chemotherapy., RESULTS: Among 807 patients randomly assigned, 702 achieved objective response. Postchemotherapy RT for consolidation was reported in 300 (43%). With median follow-up of 6.9 years, 161 PFS events and 83 deaths were reported. Baseline characteristics showed more patients with bulk disease having RT (190 [63%] v 111 [28%]) and only partial response after chemotherapy (150 [50%] v 36 [9%]). Other baseline characteristics were similar. PFS was superior for patients having RT (hazard ratio [HR], 0.43; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.60) with 5-year PFS 71% without RT, 86% with RT. A similar advantage was seen for overall survival (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.77). There was no evidence of heterogeneity of treatment effect across subgroups., CONCLUSION: Patients who received consolidation RT apparently had better outcomes, consistently across all prognostic groups which persisted in multivariate analysis. This suggests that RT contributes significantly to the cure rate for advanced HL, although patient selection for combined modality treatment requires better definition in prospective trials.",Excluded

Purpose: To assess the usefulness of simple axial bi-dimensional diameters of pericardial fat tissues at low-dose chest CT, in correlation with metabolic parameters in predicting metabolic syndrome. Material(s) and Method(s): Subjects were 373 asymptomatic individuals who performed both low-dose chest CT and abdominal fat CT for medical check-up. Maximum bi-dimensional axial diameters of paracardial fats at right (RPF) and left (LPF) cardiophrenic angle portions, and epicardial fats around right (REF) and left (LEF) coronary arteries, and coronary sinus (SEF) were measured. Correlation between pericardial fat diameters and metabolic parameters were statistically analyzed. Result(s): RPF, LPF, REF, LEF, and SEF diameters were moderately correlated with abdominal visceral fat (AVF) area (R = 0.74, 0.70, 0.48, 0.41, and 0.53, respectively, p < 0.01) in Pearson's correlation analysis. In multiple linear regression analysis, coefficient of RPF for AVF showed highest value.

All patients had tissue loss. The choice of the first artery to treat was based on an analysis of two factors: the ease of the required endovascular technique and the presence of adequate distal outflow. The randomisation point was after the first successful distal artery angioplasty. The primary endpoints were the wound healing rate and limb salvage. Result(s): The mean age of the patients was 69.1 +/- 4.3 years, and 56% were male. Concomitant treatment of the femoral and popliteal arteries was performed in 38.8% of patients. All demographic characteristics and technical aspects were statistically comparable for both groups. Successful recanalisation was achieved in 95.8%, 86.2%, 86.9%, and 92.5% for the tibio-fibular trunk, anterior tibial, posterior tibial, and fibular artery, respectively. In the MV group, a higher contrast volume (29 mL more; p =.049), longer procedure time (p =.01), and higher radiation exposure (p =.04) were noted. There was no difference in renal function between the groups either before or 30 days after the procedure (p =.165).

Background: Individual exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is challenging to measure, particularly for diseases with substantial latency periods between first exposure and diagnosis of outcome, such as cancer. To guide the choice of surrogates for long-term UVR exposure in epidemiologic studies, we assessed how well stable sun-related individual characteristics and environmental/meteorological factors predicted daily personal UVR exposure measurements. Method(s): We evaluated 123 United States Radiologic Technologists subjects who wore personal UVR dosimeters for 8 hours daily for up to 7 days (N = 837 days). Potential predictors of personal UVR derived from a self-administered questionnaire, and public databases that provided daily estimates of ambient UVR and weather conditions. Factors potentially related to personal UVR exposure were tested individually and in a model including all significant variables. Result(s): The strongest predictors of daily personal UVR exposure in the full model were ambient UVR, latitude, daily rainfall, and skin reaction to prolonged sunlight (R2 = 0.30). In a model containing only environmental and meteorological variables, ambient UVR, latitude, and daily rainfall were the strongest predictors of daily personal UVR exposure (R2 = 0.25). Conclusion(s): In the absence of feasible measures of individual longitudinal sun exposure history, stable personal characteristics, ambient UVR, and weather parameters may help estimate long-term personal UVR exposure.",Excluded

On the low-dose CT images, detectability ranged from 2.42 (better than poor) for cribriform plate among anosmic cases to 4.11 (better than good) for lamina papyracea in cases without nasal polyps. Identification of lamina papyracea on low-dose scans was significantly worse in each group and the same was the case with cribriform plates in patients with advanced polyposis and anosmia. Cribriform plates were the most poorly identified (between poor and average) among all the structures on low-dose images. Identification of anterior ethmoid artery (AEA) with reduced dose was insignificantly worse than with standard-dose examination. The AEA was scored as an average-defined structure and was the second weakest visualised. In conclusion, preoperatively, low-dose protocols may not sufficiently visualise the surgically relevant anatomical structures in patients with CRS and bronchial asthma, advanced nasal polyps (LS > 2) and history of sinus surgery. Low mAs value enables comparable detectability of sinonasal landmarks with standard-dose protocols in patients without analysed risk factors. In the context of planned surgery, the current preferences of the tube should be carefully evaluated for different patient constitutions to minimise the risk of complications.",Excluded
2741,"The value of enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation of endocochlear disease. BACKGROUND: Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (GdMRI) is routinely used in the evaluation and management of suspected retrocochlear pathology such as vestibular schwannoma. However, its value in the evaluation and diagnosis of cochlear pathology associated with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) has been less clear., STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of case histories and imaging studies of patients with SNHL and cochlear enhancement on GdMRI diagnosed between 1998 and 2000., RESULTS: Five patients with SNHL who required gadolinium administration to establish the diagnosis of endocochlear disease were identified. Diagnosed lesions included an intralabyrinthine schwannoma, intracochlear hemorrhage, radiation-induced ischemic change, autoimmune labyrinthitis, and meningogenic labyrinthitis. In these illustrative cases, the GdMRI demonstrated intrinsic high signal or contrast enhancement within the cochlea and labyrinth in the absence of a retrocochlear mass. In one patient with meningogenic labyrinthitis, cochlear enhancement on MRI led to prompt cochlear implantation before the potential development of cochlear ossification., CONCLUSION: Our experience suggests that GdMRI plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of cochlear pathology associated with sensorineural hearing loss and may directly impact patient management.",Excluded

4916,"Effectiveness of salvage radiation therapy following subtotal and gross total resection of atypical meningiomas. Purpose/Objective(s): Postoperative management of WHO Grade II (atypical) meningioma remains controversial. Radiation therapy (RT) has been shown to improve local control in several retrospective studies, but outcomes of adjuvant versus salvage RT after a gross total resection (GTR) are not well understood.We reviewed the outcomes of patients treated with RT after GTR and subtotal resection (STR) at our institution, where radiation therapy (RT) has typically been reserved for salvage. Materials/Methods: Between 1997 and 2014, 76 patients with WHO Grade II meningiomas were treated at our institution. One patient with NF2 was excluded from this analysis. Of the 75 remaining patients, 62 underwent GTR (Simpson grade I e III) and 13 STR (Simpson IV-V). No patient with GTR received adjuvant RT. A total of 22 patients received RT: 10 as salvage of recurrence following GTR, 10 as salvage following STR, and 2 adjuvantly, each after biopsy only. Fractionated RT was employed in 18 patients, with doses ranging from 50.4-60 Gy (median 59.4 Gy) in 28-33 fractions, and stereotactic radiosurgery in 4 patients, with a single fraction of 15-18 Gy (median 17 Gy). Result(s): Extent of surgery was significantly predictive of progression-free survival (PFS). Following GTR and STR respectively, 2-year PFS was 75% versus 33%, and 4-year PFS 68% versus 17% (P = 0.0008). Despite a significant improvement in PFS after GTR, patients who recurred following GTR had a poor response to salvage RT, with 6 of the 10 patients continuing to progress despite RT. Conversely, none of the 12 patients who had undergone STR or biopsy experienced progression following RT. Respectively for GTR and STR, PFS following RT was 77% and 100% at 1 year, and 39% and 100% after 2 years (P = 0.04). Radiation dose was not significantly different between patients who progressed (median 56.7 Gy) and those who did not (median 60 Gy) following RT (P = 0.42). Likewise there was no difference in RT dose for those with GTR versus STR (median 60 Gy versus 59.4 Gy respectively, P = 0.94). Conclusion(s): In our patient cohort, salvage RT for recurrence following GTR was associated with a high rate of failure (61% at 2 years), whereas salvage or adjuvant RT following STR was effective, with no failures at 2 years. This data suggests that tumors recurring after GTR are biologically distinct from tumors that progress following STR. While extent of resection is predictive of PFS, the 4-year local failure following GTR alone was still 32%; therefore, adjuvant RT should be considered in this setting. Whether routine adjuvant RT following GTR of Grade II meningioma will significantly reduce subsequent failures remains to be determined. A randomized, prospective comparison of adjuvant RT after GTR is needed to resolve this question.",Excluded
1421,"Brain metastases resection cavity radio-surgery based on T2-weighted MRI: technique assessment. Purpose: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is commonly performed after surgical resection of brain metastases to reduce the chance of local tumor recurrence while maintaining cognitive function. Target delineation in these cases is typically based off T1-weighted post-gadolinium MRI (T1Gd). In this study, we report outcomes for patients having postoperative SRS in which the planning target volume (PTV) was based on T2-weighted MRI (T2W). Method(s): Sixty-two consecutive patients having single-fraction SRS after brain metastases resection were retrospectively reviewed. Excluded were patients with prior whole brain radiation therapy, multiple resection cavities, and small cell pathologies. Result(s): The median time from surgery to SRS was 11 days; 26 patients (42%) had SRS <= 7 days. The median PTV was 8.0 cm3; the median margin dose was 18 Gy. The crude rates of local tumor control (LC), leptomeningeal disease (LMD), distant brain recurrence (DBR), and radiation necrosis (RN) were 85%, 19%, 37%, and 2%, respectively. The 1-year LC, LMD, DBR, and RN rates were 88%, 25%, 36%, and 0%, respectively. No tumor or dosimetric factor was associated with LC. Sub-total tumor resection was a risk factor for LMD (HR 5.11, P = 0.003), whereas patients with multiple brain metastases had a greater risk of DBR (HR 2.88, P = 0.01). The median PTV was smaller compared to the median PTV based off the consensus guidelines utilizing T1Gd MRI (8.0 cm3 vs. 9.1 cm3, P = 0.004). Conclusion(s): T2W MRI provided accurate resection cavity delineation even in the early postoperative period and was associated with decreased PTV compared to T1Gd MRI in the majority of cases.Copyright Â© 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
4271,"Safety and efficacy of minimally invasive percutaneous nephrolithotomy in the treatment of patients with medullary sponge kidney. The purpose of this study was to review the safety and efficacy of the minimally invasive percutaneous nephrolithotomy in the treatment of medullary sponge kidney patients with complex renal calculi. Sixteen medullary sponge kidney patients with complex renal calculi underwent minimally invasive percutaneous nephrolithotomy procedures in our center were entered into this retrospective study. The data analyzed included patients' demographics, stone burden, operative time, operative blood loss, length of hospital stay, complications according to the modified Clavien system, and stone-free rate. All the patients in this study had complex renal stones that included 14 multiple stones and 3 partial staghorn calculi. The mean stone surface area was 779.5 +/- 421.1 mm2. Preoperative urinary tract infection was noted in 5 (31.2 %) patients. Minimally invasive percutaneous nephrolithotomy was successfully completed in 15 renal units in 14 patients. Two patients failed the procedure. The mean operative time was 87.3 +/- 32.3 min. Mean hemoglobin drop was 25.3 +/- 16.5 g/L. An initial stone-free rate of 60 % was achieved after the procedure, and the final stone-free rate was 86.6 % after auxiliary second look and/or shock-wave lithotripsy. Clavien grade I and II complications occurred in 3 (21.4 %) patients including the one (7.1 %) patient who required transfusion. All the complications were managed conservatively. No major complications occurred. This retrospective analysis confirmed that minimally invasive percutaneous nephrolithotomy was a safe alternative treatment for the medullary sponge kidney patients with complex renal calculi. This procedure provided an acceptable stone-free rate and low incidence of high-grade complications. Stone-free rate further could be further improved with auxiliary procedures.Copyright Â© 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
3411,"Cerebral embolism in cancer patients. Sudden neurological deterioration suggesting embolism in a patient with a history of cancer should alert the physician to the possibility of a non-metastatic, and therefore potentially reversible, cause of cerebral embolism before cerebral metastasis is implicated.

Five patients had features post mortem of non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis, and in one, the diagnosis had been made antemortem, but treatment with heparin did not prevent further emboli. Two patients had radiation related carotid vascular disease, and one patient post lymphangiographic embolism. The literature reporting these uncommon causes of cerebral embolism is reviewed. Post-lymphangiographic embolism carries a uniformly good prognosis. In selected cases of post-irradiation cerebral embolism, surgical intervention may prevent a neurological catastrophe. Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis and mucin embolism are of uncertain aetiology and natural history; long-term survival is uncommon, and treatment does not appear to influence the clinical course or outcome.",Excluded
2254,Increased risk of ischemic bowel complications during treatment with bevacizumab after pelvic irradiation: Report of three cases. Purpose: To assess the rate of severe bowel complications during treatment with the antivascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibody bevacizumab. Methods and Materials: We performed a retrospective evaluation of bevacizumab-associated severe intestinal adverse events from our institutional database. Result(s): A total of 33 patients started treatment with bevacizumab at our institution during the first 6 months after its approval in Germany. Three patients (9%) presented with severe bowel complications: two with acute ischemic colitis and one with gastrointestinal perforation with a fatal outcome. All 3 patients had undergone radiotherapy directed to the pelvis before treatment with bevacizumab. None of the 30 patients without bowel complications had been pretreated with infradiaphragmatic irradiation. Histologic evaluation of bowel biopsies and resection specimens revealed severe ischemic bowel damage as the pathophysiologic background of the clinical findings. Conclusion(s): This report contributes to the pathophysiologic clarification of bevacizumab-induced bowel complications and points to a potentially increased risk of severe ischemic damage during treatment with bevacizumab in patients who have undergone previous radiotherapy.

1438,"Investigating the role of FDG-PET/CT for preoperative lymph-node staging of bladder cancer: Our preliminary experience. Introduction: In patients with nonmetastatic invasive bladder cancer (T2 or higher, M0) or recurrent high-risk non-muscle invasive disease (T1G3 with or without Tis, M0), locoregional lymph node metastasis is an important prognostic factor. The standard imaging modalities for staging (computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) have an accuracy range of 70-90% for lymph-node staging. Fluorine-18 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) has been approved for imaging in many malignancies but not for bladder cancer. This study investigated the value of FDGPET/ CT for preoperative lymph-node staging of patients with MIBC. We present our preliminary results. Patients and Methods: Between September 2012 and February 2013, 10 patients (8 male, 2 female) with bladder cancer underwent FDG-PET/CT and a thoraco-abdominal CT scan. Four patients were found to be recurrent T1G3 at TUR-B, five T2G3 and one T2G2. Independently from the results for lymphnode status at FDG-PET/CT or at abdominal CT scan, all patients underwent radical cystectomy and lymphadenectomy. Results of FDG-PET/CT and CT for N-staging were compared to histopathology findings. Complete data are available for 8 patients. Result(s): Among the 8 patients, 3 patients had metastatically involved locoregional lymph nodes, diagnosed on histopathology. In all these patients, the lymph-nodes demonstrated increased FDG uptake on PET/CT; the same nodes were not considered as metastatic at abdominal CT scan. Five patients had lymph-nodes with a normal FDG uptake on PET/CT: these nodes were found nonmetastatic at histopathology. Only 1 patient had nodes suspected for metastases at CT scan but not at FDGPET/CT: these lymphnodes were found nonmetastatic at histopathology. The accordance between histopathology and FDG-PET/CT findings was 100%. Discussion and Conclusion(s): Our preliminary data show that FDG-PET/CT may provide better accuracy in N-staging of bladder cancer; our study is still ongoing because a larger sample (at least 50-75 patients) is needed. According to our results and to data in the Literature, larger prospective studies are needed to elucidate the effective role of FDG-PET/CT in N-staging of bladder cancer.",Excluded
3302,"Role of Low-Dose Computerized Tomography in Lung Cancer Screening among Never-Smokers. INTRODUCTION: The incidence of lung cancer among never-smokers has been increasing rapidly. The U. S. National Lung Screening Trial and the NELSON trial showed that screening using low-dose computerized tomography (LDCT) effectively reduced lung cancer mortality among heavy smokers. However, its effectiveness in never-smokers has not been well investigated. This study investigated the role of LDCT in lung cancer screening among never-smokers., METHODS: The study was designed as a single-center, retrospective cohort study. We analyzed the data on patients who underwent LDCT screening between May 2003 and June 2016. Nodules detected by computerized tomography were classified according to the Lung Imaging Reporting and Data System criteria. The detection rate and lung cancer outcomes (type of cancer, staging of lung cancer, and mortality) according to smoking history were determined., RESULTS: Of the 28,807 enrolled patients, 12,176 were never-smokers; of these patients, 7744 (63.6%) were women and 1218 (10.0%) were found to have lung nodules. Overall, lung cancer was diagnosed in 55 never-smokers (0.45%). In contrast, lung cancer was diagnosed in 143 (0.86%) of the 16,631 ever-smokers. Of the never-smokers with lung cancer, 51 (92.7%) presented with stage I disease, and all patients had adenocarcinomas., CONCLUSIONS: In the never-smoker population, LDCT screening helped to detect a significant number of lung cancers. Most of these lung cancers were detected at a very early stage. The positive results of the National Lung Screening Trial in the United States and the NELSON trial may have established the value of LDCT screening for heavy smokers, but future research should consider the value of using LDCT screening in the never-smoker population.

3782,"Dynamic magnetic resonance of pelvic floor in the diagnosis of pelvic floor dysfunctions. Aim: Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvic floor (DMRPF) is a complementary diagnostic tool allowing dynamic and/or static assessment of all compartments of the pelvis (anterior, middle and posterior) in a single study. Method(s): We present a prospective and consecutive series of 288 patients evaluated between April 2005 and November 2013 undergoing DMRPF. Of the total patient number, 10 (3.47%) were male. Result(s): Due to the coexistence of pathology in different parts of the pelvic floor - more often in women - diagnostic confirmation is necessary so that the appropriate treatments can be accomplished in one single surgical approach. Outlet obstruction syndrome (OOS) was present in 262 patients. In 239 (82.4%) patients, an anterior rectocele was confirmed. In 55 (23%) of these cases, an anterior retrocele was the only finding. In 207 patients, other abdomino-pelvic anatomical dislocations were found that had not been clinically suspected or detected during physical examination. Conclusion(s): DMRPF is a study that does not expose patients to ionizing radiation providing dynamic interactive anatomical and functional data at rest and during provocative manoeuvers. Multi-plane imaging provides a clear view of the organs in the pelvis and the pelvic floor muscles which is not always accurately detected on physical examination. Currently, DMRPF is the recommended study designed to evaluate pelvic floor dysfunction as it can be used to confirm presumptive diagnoses and to quantify the impact of the dislocation of pelvic floor viscera, to define intestinal emptying dynamics, and to outline inadequate relaxation of the puborectalis during straining and simulated evacuation.",Excluded

This may be due to accelerated atherosclerotic changes within the RT-field; however, the real impact of local RT on the carotid artery remains debatable. The aim of the present study was to assess the difference in carotid wall thickness (intima-media thickness) in 42 unilaterally irradiated parotid tumour patients by performing B-mode ultrasonography. A mean difference in intima-media thickness (IMT) of the irradiated compared with the non-irradiated carotid artery of 0.30 mm (P=0.031) was found. A significant correlation was established with a longer post-RT interval (P=0.008). RT on the neck is associated with increased thickening of carotid IMT.

954,"Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for operable Stage i non-small-cell lung cancer: Can SBRT be comparable to surgery?. Purpose: To review treatment outcomes for stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in medically operable patients with Stage I non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), using a Japanese multi-institutional database. Patients and Methods: Between 1995 and 2004, a total of 87 patients with Stage I NSCLC (median age, 74 years; T1N0M0, n = 65; T2N0M0, n = 22) who were medically operable but refused surgery were treated using SBRT alone in 14 institutions. Stereotactic three-dimensional treatment was performed using noncoplanar dynamic arcs or multiple static ports. Total dose was 45-72.5 Gy at the isocenter, administered in 3-10 fractions. Median calculated biological effective dose was 116 Gy (range, 100-141 Gy). Data were collected and analyzed retrospectively. Result(s): During follow-up (median, 55 months), cumulative local control rates for T1 and T2 tumors at 5 years after SBRT were 92% and 73%, respectively. Pulmonary complications above Grade 2 arose in 1 patient (1.1%). Five-year overall survival rates for Stage IA and IB subgroups were 72% and 62%, respectively. One patient who developed local recurrences safely underwent salvage surgery. Conclusion(s): Stereotactic body radiotherapy is safe and promising as a radical treatment for operable Stage I NSCLC. The survival rate for SBRT is potentially comparable to that for surgery. Â© 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
2734,"Effects of psychotherapy on DNA strand break accumulation originating from traumatic stress. Background: Previous research reveals an association between traumatic stress and an increased risk for numerous diseases, including cancer. At the molecular level, stress may increase carcinogenesis via increased DNA damage and impaired DNA repair mechanisms. We assessed DNA breakage in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and measured the cellular capacity to repair single-strand breaks after exposure to ionizing X-radiation. We also investigated the effect of psychotherapy on both DNA breakage and DNA repair. Method(s): In a first study we investigated DNA breakage and repair in 34 individuals with PTSD and 31 controls. Controls were subdivided into 11 trauma-exposed subjects and 20 individuals without trauma exposure. In a second study, we analysed the effect of psychotherapy (Narrative Exposure Therapy) on DNA breakage and repair. Thirty-eight individuals with PTSD were randomly assigned to either a treatment or a waitlist control condition. Follow-up was performed 4 months and 1 year after therapy. Result(s): In study 1 we found higher levels of basal DNA breakage in individuals with PTSD and trauma-exposed subjects than in controls, indicating that traumatic stress is associated with DNA breakage. However, single-strand break repair was unimpaired in individuals with PTSD. In study 2, we found that psychotherapy reversed not only PTSD symptoms, but also DNA strand break accumulation. Conclusion(s): Our results show-for the first time in vivo-an association between traumatic stress and DNA breakage; they also demonstrate changes at the molecular level, i.e., the integrity of DNA, after psychotherapeutic interventions.

Background: Resent studies indicate that biological treatment (anti TNF alpha treatment) reduces surgery rates. We aim in this seven-year follow-up study of unselected, incident patients diagnosed with Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis to assess surgery rates in the era of biological treatment. Method(s): From Jan. 1st 2003 to Dec. 31st 2004 all incident cases of patients diagnosed with CD (n = 208), UC (n = 328) or indeterminate colitis (IC, n = 27) were registered in a well defined Copenhagen area. All medical journals applicable for follow-up were reviewed and data on disease localization and behaviour according to the Montreal classifications, medications, endoscopies, X-ray-/CT-/MR-procedures, admissions, surgical events, cancers and deaths were registered. Result(s): The present follow-up study cohort consists of 186 CD and 265 UC. Of the 563 patients originally included in the study, 42 patients were excluded at follow-up. Twenty-eight patients did not have inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), 14 were not incident and 5 had IC. Eighteen (10 UC, 8 CD) were lost to follow-up and 47 (28 UC, 19 CD) deceased and were also excluded. The mean age in the present study was 38.7 years (median 35.0 range 1-93) and included 265 females and 251 males. All patients were followed for 7 years from diagnosis. For UC, 32 patients (12.1%) had a colectomy during the 7 years follow-up. Incidence of colectomy at 5 years was 9.8% (26 patients) and 8.7% (23) at 2 years. Fifty-two CD patients (28%) had their first intestinal resection (excluding fistula- and/or abscess's surgery) within 7 years follow-up. Forty-five (24.2%) had a resection within 5 years and 35 (18.8%) within 2 years follow-up.

971,"Effects of Light Scatter and Blur on Low-Contrast Vision and Disk Halo Size. PURPOSE: To investigate the individual effects of forward light scatter (FLS) and refractive blur on low-contrast vision and the size of the disk halo produced in response to an external glare source., METHODS: Monocular disk halo radius, high- and low-contrast distance visual acuity (HCVA, LCVA), and contrast sensitivity (CS) were determined in 25 eyes of 25 healthy subjects under normal, FLS, and blur conditions. FLS was induced using the filter Black ProMist 2 to simulate an early cataract. Blur was induced using a +1.00 diopter lens to simulate an uncorrected refractive error., RESULTS: Similar significant mean increases in halo radius were observed for the FLS (0.32 +/- 0.10 log arc min; P < .0001) and refractive blur (0.40 +/- 0.18 log arc min; P < .0001). Under induced blur, 3 lines of HCVA (0.32 +/- 0.15 logMAR; P < .0001) and 4 lines of LCVA (0.39 +/- 0.16 logMAR; P < .0001) were lost. FLS had a minimal (but significant) effect on HCVA, but worsened mean LCVA by more than 1 line (0.13 +/- 0.10 logMAR; P < .0001). Similar significant mean CS reductions of 0.17 +/- 0.12 (P < .0001) and 0.14 +/- 0.12 log units (P < .0001) were produced in response to FLS and refractive blur, respectively (approximately 1 triplet)., CONCLUSIONS: Forward light scatter and refractive blur contributed to an increased size of the disk halo produced by a glare source in similar proportion. Although defocus blur has a substantial effect on LCVA, a loss of more than 1 line of LCVA after best refractive correction would be indicative of FLS.",Excluded
2608,"Cognitive impairment following radiation to hippocampus and other brain structures in adults with primary brain tumours. Background: Radiation therapy (RT) to the brain may result in cognitive impairment. The primary objective of the present study was to examine the relationship between RT dose to the hippocampus and learning and memory functions. Secondary objective was to examine relationships between doses to other brain structures and specific cognitive functions. Method(s): A cross-sectional analysis was undertaken in 78 primary brain tumour patients after RT. Cognitive function was assessed by neuropsychological tests. Test scores were standardized using normative data adjusted for age and level of education. Test-specific cognitive impairment was determined as a z-score <=-1.5. Radiation dose to brain structures and test-specific cognitive impairment outcomes were fitted to a logistic regression model. Result(s): High RT dose to the left hippocampus was associated with impaired verbal learning and memory (p = 0.04). RT dose to the left hippocampus, left temporal lobe, left frontal lobe and total frontal lobe were associated with verbal fluency impairment (p < 0.05) and doses to the thalamus and the left frontal lobe with impaired executive functioning (p <= 0.03). Finally, RT dose to the brain and thalamus were associated with impaired processing speed (p <= 0.05). Conclusion(s): The present study indicates that the hippocampus may be vulnerable to radiation and that high radiation doses to the left hippocampus may lead to significant verbal learning and memory impairment. High RT doses to the left hippocampus and other left side structures may result in impairments in verbal fluency, executive function, and processing speed. Validation of these findings are being undertaken in a prospective study.Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded

2935,"Re-evaluation of Ipsilateral Radiation for T1-T2N0-N2b Tonsil Carcinoma at the Princess Margaret Hospital in the Human Papillomavirus Era, 25 Years Later. PURPOSE: To report the outcome of ipsilateral radiation therapy (RT) in human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive (HPV+) patients and HPV-negative (HPV-) patients with T1-T2N0-N2b tonsillar cancer treated 25 years after our initial historical cohort., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with T1-T2N0-N2b tonsillar cancer who received ipsilateral RT or bilateral RT between 1999 and 2014 were reviewed. Overall survival (OS), local control (LC), regional control (RC), and grade 3 to 4 late toxicity (LT) were compared between ipsilateral RT and bilateral RT within HPV+ and HPV- patients, separately., RESULTS: HPV status was ascertained in 379/427 (88%) consecutive patients (ipsilateral RT: 62 HPV+, 34 HPV-; bilateral RT: 240 HPV+ 240, 41 HPV-). The proportion of ipsilateral RT by N category for HPV+ and HPV- patients were as follows: N0: 24/37 (65%) versus 28/48 (74%); N1: 21/49 (43%) versus 4/9 (44%); N2a: 10/39 (26%) versus 1/4 (25%); and N2b: 7/177 (4%) versus 1/24 (4%), respectively. Of the patients receiving ipsilateral RT, 94/96 (98%) were treated with RT alone. The median follow-up time was 5.03 years. The respective 5-year rates of OS, LC, RC, and LT were similar between ipsilateral RT and bilateral RT for the HPV+ patients (OS: 89% vs 87%, P=.55; LC: 97% vs 98%, P=.65; RC: 98% vs 97%, P=.27; LT: 17% vs 12%, P=.83) and HPV- patients (OS: 63% vs 48%, P=.27; LC: 90% vs 80%, P=.19; RC: 94% vs 83%, P=.14; LT: 15% vs 22%, P=.36). Of the 96 patients receiving ipsilateral RT, contralateral neck failure (CNF) occurred in 1/52 HPV+ patients and 1/34 HPV- patients. The 5-year CNF rates were 2% (95% CI: 1-9) (HPV+: 2% [0-14]; HPV-: 3% [0-21], P=.66). Five local failures (2 HPV+; 3 HPV-) and no distant failures were seen. The 5-year rates of LC, RC, and LT were 97% versus 90% (P=.24), 98% versus 94% (P=.25), and 18% versus 15% (P=.75) for the HPV+ and HPV- cohorts, respectively. Osteoradionecrosis occurred in 9 patients: 6/47 (13%) treated with conventional RT and 3/49 (6%) with intensity modulated RT (P=.32)., CONCLUSION: Ipsilateral radiation to selected patients with T1-T2N0-N2b tonsillar cancer results in equally excellent outcomes regardless of tumor HPV status.

4684,"Heterogeneity in the clastogenic response to X-rays in lymphocytes from ataxia-telangiectasia heterozygotes and controls. A coded analysis of X-ray-induced chromatid aberrations in lymphocyte cultures from 45 control individuals and 19 ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) heterozygotes was performed. The distribution of chromatid breaks induced in the late G2 portion of the cell cycle by 60 cGy of X-rays appeared bimodal in the study population. In six controls (13 percent) and in 12 of 19 (63 percent) A-T heterozygotes, the yields of X-ray-induced breaks observed were within the higher mode of the distribution. However, lymphocytes from A-T heterozygotes sensitive to the induction of chromatid breaks by 60 cGy did not contain increased numbers of aberrations following exposure to 20 cGy. The radio-resistant inhibition of DNA synthesis that occurs in A-T homozygotes was not observed in heterozygotes. Co-cultivation experiments showed an increased G2 delay in lymphocytes from an A-T heterozygote whose lymphocytes contained increased X-ray-induced chromatid breaks. The results show a significant association of A-T heterozygosity with G2 chromosomal sensitivity (P less than 0.001; Wilcoxon rank sum test). The measurement of X-ray-induced breaks, however, failed to identify 37 percent of A-T heterozygotes tested. The predicted prevalence of increased sensitivity to X-rays in controls is approximately three- to 30-fold greater than the estimated frequency of A-T heterozygotes in the general population. Therefore, although the increased sensitivity to X-ray-induced chromatid breaks appears to be associated with the A-T-gene, it is not a reliable indicator of A-T heterozygosity. Genetic or environmental factors other than the A-T gene also must be involved in the increased clastogenic response.",Included
3251,"Narrow-band ultraviolet B radiation induces the expression of beta-endorphin in human skin in vivo. BACKGROUND: Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) from the sun and solaria has addictive properties that may develop into dependence. In mice, UVR addiction was connected to beta-endorphin (beta-END) formed in the skin after UVR exposure. In humans, the formation of beta-END in skin keratinocytes has not been confirmed in vivo., OBJECTIVE: To determine with immunohistochemistry if sub-erythematous narrow-band UV-B (NB-UV-B) exposures stimulate p53 mediated expression of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), beta-END and alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) in human skin keratinocytes in vivo., METHODS: Within 12 healthy volunteers, 7 received a single 1 standard erythema dose (SED) of NB-UV-B on their whole body, and 5 volunteers received a cumulative dose of 3 SED delivered on two subsequent days i.e., 1+2 SED. Skin biopsies were taken immediately before the first exposure and at 24h from the last UV-B exposure to assess p53, beta-END, POMC, and alpha-MSH expression., RESULTS: Nuclear p53 expression increased in all samples taken at 24h after NB-UV-B exposure. UV-B irradiation also increased epidermal beta-END expression in 11 out of 12 samples taken at 24h after UV-B exposure. The brownish staining was localized in the cytoplasm of keratinocytes and around the nuclei, being more pronounced in the basal cell layers. POMC and alpha-MSH staining showed no obvious meaningful increase since only one section of each showed any change compared with basal levels., CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to show that UV-B exposures increase beta-END expression in epidermal keratinocytes of human skin in vivo, which could be the link to proposed UVR addiction.

3071,"Utility of new bioabsorptive screws in cervical anterior fusion. Background: The aim of this study is to report our use of new bioabsorbable screws in cervical anterior fusion. These screws need not be removed because they are completely absorbed by resolution in vivo. We describe our method and the new bioabsorbable screws. Method(s): We used PLLA screws until September 2004 and uncalcined uHA-PLLA screws thereafter. They are completely absorbed by resolution to water and carbon dioxide upon in vivo hydrolysis. The uHA-PLLA screws are x-ray impenetrable, and their uHA content renders them osteoconductive. In cervical anterior fusion, the graft is inserted in the area of deletion resulting from decompression. The screws are inserted in the 4 corners of the vertebral body and graft. In long fusion, they are introduced in the 2 lateral wings of the bone graft on each vertebral body and in the 4 corners. Our method eliminates the need for plates or mesh. Result(s): We have used this method in 62 patients and encountered no complications. There were no screw or graft extrusions and no surgery-related infections. The patients were able to walk a few hours after the operation and wore a simple neck collar for a few days. Conclusion(s): This safe and easy method shortens the hospital stay and reduces the risk of graft extrusion and complications associated with the use of nonabsorbable devices. Â© 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Background:The palliative role of chemoradiation in the treatment of patients with locally advanced, inoperable non-small-cell lung cancer stage III and negative prognostic factors remains unresolved. Method(s):Patients not eligible for curative radiotherapy were randomised to receive either chemoradiation or chemotherapy alone. Four courses of intravenous carboplatin on day 1 and oral vinorelbin on days 1 and 8 were given with 3-week intervals. Patients in the chemoradiation arm also received radiotherapy with fractionation 42 Gy/15, starting at the second chemotherapy course. The primary end point was overall survival; secondary end points were health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and toxicity. Result(s):Enrolment was terminated due to slow accrual after 191 patients from 25 Norwegian hospitals were randomised. Median age was 67 years and 21% had PS 2. In the chemotherapy versus the chemoradiation arm, the median overall survival was 9.7 and 12.6 months, respectively (P<0.01). One-year survival was 34.0% and 53.2% (P<0.01). Following a minor decline during treatment, HRQOL remained unchanged in the chemoradiation arm. The patients in the chemotherapy arm reported gradual deterioration during the subsequent months. In the chemoradiation arm, there were more hospital admissions related to side effects (P<0.05). Conclusion(s):Chemoradiation was superior to chemotherapy alone with respect to survival and HRQoL at the expense of more hospital admissions due to toxicity. Â© 2013 Cancer Research UK.",Excluded

Whole-body and plasma clearance, normal-organ and lesion uptake, and radiation absorbed dose were estimated. We also preliminarily tested the performance of 89Zr-immuno-PET imaging for 13 patients with prostate cancer and 4 patients with other urological cancer., RESULTS: The administration of 89Zr-Df-IAB2M was well-tolerated, and no infusion-related reactions were observed in any patient. No adverse events were noted in the laboratory parameters, vital signs, or other parameters. The plasma clearance was biphasic, with an initial rapid phase (t 1/2 fast: 10.1 +/- 3.4 h) followed by a slow phase (t 1/2 slow: 49.0 +/- 22.7 h). The half-life of radioactivity in the whole body (WB t1/2) was 237 +/- 9 h. The highest absorbed radiation dose was 1.67 mGy/MBq, observed in the liver and kidney. The effective dose was 0.68 +/- 0.08 mSv/MBq. The radiation dose rate at 0.5 m distance from the patient was 8.67 microSv/h on day 1, and decreased to 2.26 microSv/h at 5 days after injection. Both bone and lymph node metastases were detected with 89Zr-Df-IAB2M by 24 or 48 h imaging., CONCLUSIONS: Administration of 89Zr-Df-IAB2M was well-tolerated and safe in terms of adverse events and radiation exposure and protection. 89Zr-Df-IAB2M is feasible for usage by long-distance transportation.

We report a study on changes of mental function in twenty five adult patients with cerebral low-grade gliomas after radiotherapy. None of them had shown mental deterioration before radiotherapy nor tumor recurrence after radiotherapy. Radiation was given at a dose of 48 to 78 Gy (mean: 54.2 Gy). Patients were assigned for mental functional levels according to Karnofsky performance scale (KPS) after radiotherapy. Ten patients (40%) were normal. Seven patients (28%) showed moderate disabilities and 8 (32%) severe disabilities. The median interval time from radiotherapy to the onset of mental deterioration was 2.5 years in the moderate group and 1.6 years in the severe group. CT findings in severe group demonstrated severe brain atrophy and diffuse low density in the white matter after radiotherapy. The risk factors responsible for progressive mental deterioration after radiotherapy may be radiation site and size (whole frontal lobe), total dose (over 60 Gy) and patients age at the time of radiotherapy (over 60 yrs).",Excluded
2085,"Changes in performance and bio-mathematical model performance predictions during 45 days of sleep restriction in a simulated space mission. Lunar habitation and exploration of space beyond low-Earth orbit will require small crews to live in isolation and confinement while maintaining a high level of performance with limited support from mission control. Astronauts only achieve approximately 6 h of sleep per night, but few studies have linked sleep deficiency in space to performance impairment. We studied crewmembers over 45 days during a simulated space mission that included 5 h of sleep opportunity on weekdays and 8 h of sleep on weekends to characterize changes in performance on the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) and subjective fatigue ratings. We further evaluated how well bio-mathematical models designed to predict performance changes due to sleep loss compared to objective performance. We studied 20 individuals during five missions and found that objective performance, but not subjective fatigue, declined from the beginning to the end of the mission. We found that bio-mathematical models were able to predict average changes across the mission but were less sensitive at predicting individual-level performance. Our findings suggest that sleep should be prioritized in lunar crews to minimize the potential for performance errors. Bio-mathematical models may be useful for aiding crews in schedule design but not for individual-level fitness-for-duty decisions.",Excluded

PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the number of brain lesions for which stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) was performed on the dose volume relationships in normal brain., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Brain tissue was segmented using the patient's pre-SRS MRI. For each plan, the following data points were recorded: total brain volume, number of lesions treated, volume of brain receiving 8 Gy (V8), V10, V12, and V15., RESULTS: A total of 225 Gamma Knife R treatments were included in this retrospective analysis. The number of lesions treated ranged from 1 to 29. The isodose for prescription ranged from 40 to 95% (mean 55%). The mean prescription dose to tumor edge was 18 Gy. The mean coverage, selectivity, conformity, and gradient index were 97.5%, 0.63, 0.56, and 3.5, respectively. The mean V12 was 9.5 cm3 (ranging from 0.5 to 59.29). There was no correlation between the number of lesions and brain V8, V12, V10, or V15. There was a direct and statistically significant relationship between the brain volume treated (V8, V10, V12, and V15) and total volume of tumors treated (p < 0.001). In our study, the integral dose to the brain exceeded 3 J when the total tumor volume exceeded 25 cm3., CONCLUSIONS: The number of metastatic brain lesions treated bears no significant relationship to total brain tissue volume treated when using SRS. The fact that the integral dose to the brain exceeded 3 J when the total tumor volume exceeded 25 cm3 is useful for establishing guidelines. Although standard practice has favored using whole brain radiation therapy in patients with more than 4 lesions, a significant amount of normal brain tissue may be spared by treating these patients with SRS. SRS should be carefully considered in patients with multiple brain lesions, with the emphasis on total brain volume involved rather than the number of lesions to be treated. Copyright Â© 2017 S.

The purpose of this study is to assess the successful incorporation of cages in patients after cervical or lumbar intercorporal fusion with positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). Twenty patients (14 female and 6 male; mean age 58 years, age range 38-73 years) with 30 cervical (n = 13) or lumbar (n = 17) intercorporal fusions were prospectively enrolled in this study. Time interval between last intercorporal intervention and PET/CT ranged from 2 to 116 months (mean 63; median 77 months). IRB approval was obtained for all patients, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. About 30 min prior to PET/CT scanning, 97-217 MBq (mean 161 MBq) 18F-fluoride were administered intravenously. Patients were imaged in supine position on a combined PET/CT system (Discovery RX/STE, 16/64 slice CT, GE Healthcare). 3D-PET emission data were acquired for 1.5 and 2 min/bed position, respectively, and reconstructed by a fully 3D iterative algorithm (VUE Point HD) using low-dose CT data for attenuation correction. A dedicated diagnostic thin-slice CT was optionally acquired covering the fused region. Areas of increased 18F-fluoride uptake around cages were determined by one double-board certified radiologist/nuclear physician and one board certified radiologist in consensus. In 12/20 (60%) patients, increased 18F-fluoride uptake around cages was observed. Of the 30 intercorporal fusions, 15 (50%) showed increased 18F-fluoride uptake. Median time between intervention and PET/CT examination in cages with increased uptake was 37 months (2-116 months), median time between intervention and PET/CT examination in those cages without increased uptake was 91 months (19-112 months), p (Wilcoxon) = 0.01 (one-sided). 14/29 (48%) cages with a time interval > 1 year between intervention and PET/CT scan showed an increased uptake. In conclusion, PET/CT frequently shows increased 18F-fluoride uptake in cervical and lumbar cages older than 1 year (up to almost 8 years in cervical cages and 10 years in lumbar cages) possibly indicating unsuccessful fusion due to increased stress/microinstability.

Introduction: To investigate the impact of pre-existing radiological interstitial lung disease (ILD) findings on the incidence of radiation pneumonitis (RP) and clinical outcomes after stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for stage I non-small-cell lung cancer. Method(s): We included 157 consecutive patients who underwent SBRT alone for stage I non-small-cell lung cancer and whose pretreatment lung computed tomography images were available for retrospective review. The pretreatment computed tomography images were evaluated retrospectively for the presence of ILD. The incidence of RP, overall survival (OS) rate, and the incidence of disease progression and local progression were evaluated between patients with ILD (ILD[+]) and without ILD (ILD[-]). Result(s): Pre-existing ILD was identified in 20 patients. The median follow-up period was 39.5 months. The incidences of RP worse than grade 2 (>= Gr2 RP) and worse than grade 3 (>= Gr3 RP) were significantly higher in ILD(+) than ILD(-) (1 year >= Gr2 RP rate, 55.0% versus 13.3%; p < 0.001 and 1year >= Gr3 RP rate 10.0% versus 1.5%; p = 0.020). Multivariate analysis also indicated that ILD(+) was a risk factor for >= Gr2 and >= Gr3 RP, and the volume of the irradiated lung. The OS rate tended to be worse in ILD(+) than ILD(-) (3-year OS, 53.8% versus 70.8%; p = 0.28). No difference was observed in the disease progression or local progression rates. Conclusion(s): Pre-existing ILD was a significant risk factor for symptomatic and severe RP. Prescreening for ILD findings is important for determining the radiation pneumonitis risk when planning SBRT.Copyright Â© 2014 by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.",Excluded

PURPOSE: We analyzed toxicity and the local control rates for advanced laryngeal cancer, treated with two accelerated fractionation schedules. The main difference between the schedules was the onset of the concomitant boost, in Week 3 or Week 4. Overall treatment time and total dose were equivalent., METHODS AND MATERIALS: In a prospective, nonrandomized study of T3, T4, and advanced T2 laryngeal cancer, concomitant boost schedules were used in 100 patients. Thirty patients received a schedule of twice daily 1.2 Gy in Weeks 1-3, followed by twice daily 1.7 Gy in Weeks 4 and 5; total dose was 70 Gy (the hyperfractionated accelerated schedule [HAS] regimen). Seventy patients were treated with 5 times 2 Gy in Weeks 1 and 2, followed by daily 1.8 Gy and 1.5 Gy (boost) in Weeks 3-5; total dose 69.5 Gy (the accelerated schedule only [ASO] regimen). Distribution of T stage was 47%, 40%, and 12% for T2, T3, and T4, respectively. In 24% of the patients, lymph nodes were positive. Pretreatment tracheotomy or stridor or both occurred in 8 patients. The distribution of prognostic factors was not significantly different between the two fractionation schedules. Acute and late toxicity was assessed. Results were estimated by the use of actuarial methods. For late toxicity and local control univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Tumor control probability analysis was used to model cure rate differences., RESULTS: Overall acute mucositis score was equal for both schedules. Acute mucositis started and decreased significantly earlier in the HAS regimen. In all patients acute mucositis healed completely. The treatment was completed within 38 days in all patients. The regional control rate was 100% for clinical N0, and 75% for the clinical N+ patients. The 3-year local control rate was 59% and 78% for the HAS and ASO regimens, respectively (p = 0.05); the ultimate local control was 80% and 94%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, besides the fractionation schedule (relative risk [RR], 2.6 for HAS vs. ASO), pretreatment tracheotomy/stridor (RR 4.3, yes vs. no), and local tumor response 3-6 weeks after radiotherapy (RR 5.1, no vs. yes) were independent factors for local control. Tumor control probability analysis indicated that the onset of repopulation may be about 4-6 days earlier for the HAS regimen. The onset of repopulation in the HAS regimen is probably at the end of the second week or at the beginning of the third week. Severe late toxicity was observed in the HAS group and ASO group in, respectively, 11% and 16%. In multivariate analysis this toxicity related significantly to the field size and pretreatment tracheotomy/stridor., CONCLUSIONS: In our study the timing of the boost in accelerated radiotherapy for advanced laryngeal cancer was an independent factor for local control, favoring the use of a concomitant boost in Week 3.

AIMS: To determine the long term visual outcome of patients who were eligible for randomisation to enucleation versus brachytherapy in a US collaborative ocular melanoma study (COMS) but were treated with either helium ion or 125I radioactive plaque therapy., METHOD: A retrospective analysis was performed of 426 ciliochoroidal melanomas that met COMS inclusion criteria for randomisation to enucleation versus radioactive plaque but were treated with either helium ions or 125I brachytherapy., RESULTS: At 3 years 36.0% of eyes had 6/12 or better visual acuity. The length of visual retention was most dependent on tumour thickness, tumour location with respect to the optic nerve, fovea, or ciliary body, and patient age. In addition to these factors, the retention of 6/12 visual acuity and the time to 6/120 visual acuity were dependent on the preoperative visual acuity. The risk of visual loss was greatest immediately after treatment and decreased with time. The 5 year actuarial metastatic rate was approximately 13%. Patients at the greatest risk of post-radiation visual loss had significantly greater risk of tumour related mortality., CONCLUSIONS: Some patients who would have been eligible for randomisation to either enucleation or radioactive plaque therapy can be irradiated with retention of excellent vision.",Excluded
3195,"Flow cytometry-based assay for determination of teleost cytotoxic cell lysis of target cells. BACKGROUND: The nonradiometric assays previously developed to detect cellular cytotoxic activity have been hindered by many difficulties. Among the problems are the requirement for expensive commercial kits and the use of techniques that produce high background noise and decreased sensitivity. In addition, these assays did not account for bidirectional apoptosis (activation-induced cell death [AICD]). Most attempts to derive cytometry-based cytotoxicity assays have been unsuccessful because individual effectors and targets could not be identified (i.e., ""separated"") using gating techniques., METHODS: In the present study, teleost nonspecific cytotoxic (NCC) and mammalian target cells were each sufficiently different in size to identify them by flow cytometry (FCM). Using appropriate gating and discriminator techniques, these two cell populations were differentiated based on scatter properties and propidium iodide (PI) binding. Total capacity for PI binding was obtained by permeabilization of the targets with ice-cold acetone. Spontaneous PI binding was relatively low. This technique detected cytotoxicity at effector-to-target ratios (E:T) of 1:1 and after only 30 min cocultivation., RESULTS: Tilapia NCC from peripheral blood kill human transformed target cells by necrosis and apoptosis as identified by PI binding. Maximum killing of HL-60 targets (approximately 100%) occurred by 180 min cocultivation. For the same time, the killing of IM-9 did not exceed 60%. Almost 90% of IM-9 targets are lysed following 14 h of cocultivation. The maximum killing of both HL-60 and IM-9 targets was observed at a 25:1 E:T ratio after 14 h. Comparisons of the chromium(>51) release assay with flow detection of cytotoxicity revealed that FCM detected 55% lysis of the target cells compared with 2% cytotoxicity by chromium release, after a cocultivation time of 240 min., DISCUSSION: FCM detection of (teleost) NCC lysis of target cells using PI uptake is more sensitive than standard chromium release assays. This level of sensitivity was observed because NCC and targets were sufficiently different in size such that they could be resolved by scatter plots. Using FCM, cytotoxicity was detected earlier and at lower E:T ratios than previously reported for chromium release assays. Although tilapia were reported previously to be not capable of lysing IM-9 targets by chromium release detection, the more sensitive method of FCM detected cytotoxicity using PI uptake. HL-60 lysis by tilapia NCC exhibited saturable kinetics but occurred at different times post-cocultivation. Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Excluded
978,"Management of mandibular osteoradionecrosis corresponding to the severity of osteoradionecrosis and the method of radiotherapy. PURPOSE: : To demonstrate appropriate treatment methods for mandibular osteoradionecrosis (ORN) by evaluating previous results., METHODS: : The relationship between the time interval after radiation therapy (RT) and the severity of ORN was examined. Eighty-seven patients were classified according to the extent of the lesion (grades), and the cure rates were calculated according to the RT modality, the grade, and the treatment method for ORN., RESULTS: : The later ORN developed and the higher the dose of irradiation, particularly among the patients who received external RT, the more it progressed. The initial cure rates for conservative management, marginal, and segmental mandibulectomy were 39.7%, 50%, and 86.7%, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: : Conservative management should be limited to early-onset ORN after brachytherapy with or without a low dose of external irradiation. Marginal mandibulectomy is appropriate for the late-onset ORN after brachytherapy with or without low-dose external irradiation. Segmental mandibulectomy is required for late-onset ORN after a high dose of external irradiation. Copyright 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 25: 181-186, 2003",Excluded
3904,"Lack of high-dose radiation mediated prostate cancer promotion and low-dose radiation adaptive response in the TRAMP mouse model. Cancer of the prostate is a highly prevalent disease with a heterogeneous aetiology and prognosis. Current understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying the responses of prostate tissue to ionizing radiation exposure, including cancer induction, is surprisingly limited for both high- and low-dose exposures. As population exposure to radiation increases, largely through medical imaging, a better understanding of the response of the prostate to radiation exposure is required. Low-dose radiation-induced adaptive responses for increased cancer latency and decreased cancer frequency have been demonstrated in mouse models, largely for hematological cancers. This study examines the effects of high- and low-dose whole-body radiation exposure on prostate cancer development using an autochthonous mouse model of prostate cancer: TRansgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate (TRAMP). TRAMP mice were exposed to single acute high (2 Gy), low (50 mGy) and repeated low (5 x 50 mGy) doses of X rays to evaluate both the potential prostate cancer promoting effects of high-dose radiation and low-dose adaptive response phenomena in this prostate cancer model. Prostate weights and histopathology were examined to evaluate gross changes in cancer development and, in mice exposed to a single 2 Gy dose, time to palpable tumor was examined. Proliferation (Ki-67), apoptosis, DNA damage (gamma-H2AX) and transgene expression (large T-antigen) were examined within TRAMP prostate sections. Neither high- nor low-dose radiation-induced effects on prostate cancer progression were observed for any of the endpoints studied. Lack of observable effects of high- or low-dose radiation exposure suggests that modulation of tumorigenesis in the TRAMP model is largely resistant to such exposures. However, further study is required to better assess the effects of radiation exposure using alternative prostate cancer models that incorporate normal prostate and in those that are not driven by SV40 large T antigen.

4922,"Predictors of the therapeutic effect of corticosteroids on radiation-induced optic neuropathy following nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Radiation-induced optic neuropathy (RION) is a severe visual complication resulting from radiotherapy of the head and neck, which mostly occurs in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in the southern part of China. The mechanism of RION is unclear. Therefore, identifying risk factors for RION is an important step towards enhancing our understanding. In the current study, we retrospectively reviewed patients with NPC who were admitted to Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital for visual loss between 2006 and 2017. The study included 38 participants (68 eyes) in the corticosteroid-effective group and 35 participants (64 eyes) in the corticosteroids-ineffective group. We analyzed potential risk factors for RION and developed a prediction model for the therapeutic effect of corticosteroid effect based on a random forests method. The prediction model showed a high accuracy with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.932 (95% confidence interval = 0.889-0.975). Our results revealed that blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was significantly associated with RION and that RION patients with higher BUN levels responded better to corticosteroid treatment. Altogether, these results suggest that a prediction model, based on clinical factors, could be applied to estimate the therapeutic effect of corticosteroids on RION. Further investigation, however, is needed to confirm the study conclusion.Copyright Â© 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
3818,"Multidetector row computed tomography of acute pancreatitis: Utility of single portal phase CT scan in short-term follow up. Objective: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the question of whether nonenhanced CT or contrast enhanced portal phase CT can replace multiphasic pancreas protocol CT in short term monitoring in patients with acute pancreatitis. Material(s) and Method(s): This retrospective study was approved by the Institutional Review Board. From April 2006 to May 2010, a total of 52 patients having acute pancreatitis who underwent initial dual phase multidetector row CT (unenhanced, arterial, and portal phase) at admission and a short term (within 30 days) follow up dual phase CT (mean interval 10.3 days, range 3-28 days) were included. Two abdominal radiologists performed an independent review of three sets of follow up CT images (nonenhanced scan, single portal phase scan, and dual phase scan). Interpretation of each image set was done with at least 2-week interval. Radiologists evaluated severity of acute pancreatitis with regard to pancreatic inflammation, pancreatic necrosis, and extrapancreatic complication, based on the modified CT severity index. Scores of each image set were compared using a paired t-test and interobserver agreement was evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficient statistics. Result(s): Mean scores of sum of CT severity index on nonenhanced scan, portal phase scan, and dual phase scan were 5.7, 6.6, and 6.5 for radiologist 1, and 5.0, 5.6, and 5.8 for radiologist 2, respectively. In both radiologists, contrast enhanced scan (portal phase scan and dual phase scan) showed significantly higher severity score compared with that of unenhanced scan (P < 0.05), while portal phase and dual phase scan showed no significant difference each other. The trend was similar regarding pancreatic inflammation and extrapancreatic complications, in which contrast enhanced scans showed significantly higher score compared with those of unenhanced scan, while no significant difference was observed between portal phase scan and dual phase scan. In pancreatic necrosis analysis, there was no significant difference between the three image sets for both radiologists. However, when only the patients having pancreatic necrosis (n = 13) was separately analyzed, significant differences were observed between the unenhanced and portal phase scan (P = 0.04, for radiologist 1), or unenhanced and dual phase scan (P = 0.013, for radiologist 2). Conclusion(s): For short-term follow up imaging in assessment of patients with acute pancreatitis, single portal phase CT images without adding unenhanced or arterial phase images provide sufficient information, and thereby reduce radiation exposure.

4339,"Predicting severe acute radiation pneumonitis in patients with non-small cell lung cancer receiving postoperative radiotherapy: Development and internal validation of a nomogram based on the clinical and dose-volume histogram parameters. Background and purpose: Postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) can potentially lead to radiation pneumonitis. We aim to develop a nomogram predicting the severe acute radiation pneumonitis (SARP, grade >=3) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving PORT. Material(s) and Method(s): Clinical and dose-volume histogram (DVH) factors were collected from 109 patients between 2006 and 2017. The endpoint was the development of SARP within 3 months after PORT. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the prognostic value of each factor in predicting SARP. Nomogram was generated based on multivariate regression coefficients. Area under the ROC curve (AUC), calibration curves, and decision curve analyses (DCA) were conducted to validate the model. Result(s): Univariate and multivariate analysis indicated that total lung mean dose (tlMD) (OR: 1.003, 95%CI: 1.001-1.006, p = 0.013), percentage of ipsilateral lung volume receiving >=5 Gy (ilV5) (OR: 1.084, 95%CI: 1.020-1.151, p = 0.009), and concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) (OR: 4.091, 95%CI: 1.331-12.572, p = 0.014) were independent prognosticators of SARP and were included in the nomogram. ROC curves revealed the AUC of the nomogram was 0.842, which was much higher than any factor alone (tlMD: 0.769; ilV5: 0.744; CCRT: 0.661). Calibration curves showed favorable consistency between the predicted SARP and the actual observation. DCA showed satisfactory positive net benefits of the model among most of the threshold probabilities, indicating great clinical effect. Conclusion(s): We identified that the tlMD (>10.8 Gy), ilV5 (>64.9%), and CCRT could predict SARP among patients with NSCLC receiving PORT. Combining clinical and DVH parameters, a nomogram was first built and validated, showing its potential value in practice.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
4763,"Stereotactic body radiation therapy for post-pulmonary lobectomy isolated lung metastasis of thoracic tumor: Survival and side effects. Background: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has emerged as an alternative treatment for patients with early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or metastatic pulmonary tumors. However, for isolated lung metastasis (ILM) of thoracic malignances after pulmonary lobectomy, reported outcomes of SBRT have been limited. This study evaluates the role of SBRT in the treatment of such patients. Method(s): A retrospective search of the SBRT database was conducted in three hospitals. The parameters analyzed in the treated patients were local control, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and the treatment-related side-effects. Result(s): In total, 23 patients with single ILM after pulmonary lobectomy treated with SBRT were identified and the median follow-up time was 14 months (range: 6.0-47.0 months). Local recurrences were observed in two patients during follow-up and the 1-year local control rate was 91.3%. Median PFS and OS for the studied cohort were 10.0 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 5.1-14.9 months] and 21.0 months (95% CI 11.4-30.6 months), respectively. Acute radiation pneumonitis (RP) of grade 2 or worse was observed in five (21.7%) and three (13.0%) patients, respectively. Other treatment-related toxicities included chest wall pain in one patient (4.3%) and acute esophagitis in two patients (8.7%). By Pearson correlation analysis, the planning target volume (PTV) volume and the volume of the ipsilateral lung exposed to a minimum dose of 5 Gy (IpV5) were significantly related to the acute RP of grade 2 or worse in present study (p < 0.05). The optimal thresholds of the PTV and IpV5 to predict RP of acute grade 2 or worse RP were 59 cm3 and 51% respectively, according to the receiver-operating characteristics curve analysis, with sensitivity/specificity of 75.0%/80.0% and 62.5%/80.0%. Conclusion(s): SBRT for post-lobectomy ILM was effective and well tolerated. The major reason for disease progression was distant failure but not local recurrence. The PTV and IpV5 are potential predictors of acute RP of grade 2 or higher and should be considered in treatment planning for such patients.Copyright Â© 2014 Xiong et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
2988,"Esophagectomy for locally advanced esophageal cancer, followed by chemoradiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy. Aim: To compare the efficacy and toxicity of a three-step combination therapy with post-operative radiation alone for locally advanced esophageal cancer. Method(s): Patients with T3-4 and N0-1 esophageal carcinoma from a number of institutions were non-randomly, prospectively enrolled in the study. All patients underwent single-stage curative en bloc esophagectomy. The patients were then assigned into one of two treatment groups based on treatment consisting of either post-operative concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with weekly cisplatin 30 mg/m2 followed by systemic adjuvant chemotherapy (four monthly cycles of cisplatin 20 mg/m2 and 5-fluorouracil 1 000 mg/m2 for five consecutive days), or, post-operative radiation alone. The radiotherapy dose was 55-60 Gy for all patients. Primary end-point of this study was to assess the per-protocol patients' improvement of overall survival benefit. Secondary end-point was designed to evaluate both the per-protocol and intent-to-treat patients' outcome of survival. Result(s): A total of 60 patients (n = 30 per group) were enrolled in this study. The two groups were generally comparable for demographic characteristics and hematological and non-hematological toxicities. The CCRT with weekly cisplatin was well tolerated, with significantly better overall survival (30.9 mo vs 20.7 mo; 95% CI, 27.5-36.4 vs 15.2-26.1) and 3-year survival (70.0% vs 33.7%; P = 0.003). Low histological grade of tumor (P<0.001) was associated with favorable survival in these locally advanced patients. Conclusion(s): For locally advanced esophageal cancer, the combination of esophagectomy, post-operative CCRT with weekly cisplatin and systemic adjuvant chemotherapy is well tolerated and effective. A large-scale, prospective randomized trial of this regimen is in progress. Â© 2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
3806,"Comparison of cone-beam CT-guided and CT fluoroscopy-guided transthoracic needle biopsy of lung nodules. PURPOSE: To compare the diagnostic performance of cone-beam CT (CBCT)-guided and CT fluoroscopy (fluoro-CT)-guided technique for transthoracic needle biopsy (TNB) of lung nodules., METHODS: The hospital records of 319 consecutive patients undergoing 324 TNBs of lung nodules in a single radiology unit in 2009-2013 were retrospectively evaluated. The newly introduced CBCT technology was used to biopsy 123 nodules; 201 nodules were biopsied by conventional fluoro-CT-guided technique. We assessed the performance of the two biopsy systems for diagnosis of malignancy and the radiation exposure., RESULTS: Nodules biopsied by CBCT-guided and by fluoro-CT-guided technique had similar characteristics: size, 20 +/- 6.5 mm (mean +/- standard deviation) vs. 20 +/- 6.8 mm (p = 0.845); depth from pleura, 15 +/- 15 mm vs. 15 +/- 16 mm (p = 0.595); malignant, 60% vs. 66% (p = 0.378).

BACKGROUND: Stereotactic irradiation (SBRT) is a standard of care for inoperable stage I lung cancer and brain oligometastases from lung cancer but is controversial for extracranial oligometastases. We assessed outcomes of lung cancer patients with extracranial metastases in oligometastatic, oligorecurrent, oligopersistent and oligoprogressive settings (""oligometastatic spectrum"") under strategies using SBRT +/- systemic treatments., METHODS: A retrospective multicentric study of consecutive lung cancer adult patients with 1-5 extracranial metastases treated with SBRT was conducted., RESULTS: Of 91 patients (99 metastases, median age 63, 64.8% adenocarcinomas, 19.8% molecular alterations), 11% had oligometastases, 49.5% oligorecurrence, 19.8% oligopersistence and 19.8% oligoprogression. Of 36% of patients under systemic treatments at initiation of SBRT, systemic treatment interruption was performed in 58% of them. With median follow up of 15.3 months, crude local control at irradiated metastases was 91%, while median distant progression-free survival (dPFS) and overall survival were 6.3 and 28.4 months (2-year survival 54%). Initial nodal stage and oligometastatic spectrum were prognostic factors for dPFS; age, initial primary stage and oligometastatic spectrum were prognostic factors for survival on multivariate analysis. Patients with oncogene-addicted tumors more frequently had oligoprogressive disease. Repeat ablative irradiations were preformed in 80% of patients who had oligorelapses. Worst acute toxicities consisted of 5.5% and one late toxic death occurred., CONCLUSION: The oligometastatic spectrum is a strong prognosticator in patients undergoing SBRT for extracranial metastases. Median survival was over two years but dPFS was about 6 months. Continuation of systemic therapy in oligoprogressive patients should be investigated.",Excluded
970,"Dietary carotenoids contribute to normal human skin color and UV photosensitivity. The aim of the current study was to determine whether dietary carotenoids influence skin pigmentation and UV photosensitivity in a healthy unsupplemented panel (n = 22) of Caucasian (skin Type II) subjects. Skin spectrophotometric and tristimulus (L*a*b*) CR200 chromameter readings were made at various body sites to objectively measure skin carotenoid levels and skin color, respectively. The minimal erythemal dose (MED) was also measured to determine the intrinsic UV photosensitivity of the skin. We found that tristimulus b* values (but not L* and a* values) were consistently and closely correlated with skin carotenoid levels at a number of body sites including the back (r = 0.85, P < 0.00001), forehead (r = 0.85, P < 0.00001), inner forearm (r = 0.75, P < 0.0001) and palm of the hand (r = 0.78, P < 0.0001). Skin carotenoid levels and MED were also correlated in these subjects (r = 0.66, P < 0.001), as were tristimulus b* values and MED (r = 0.71, P < 0.0002). From these observations, we conclude that carotenoids from a normal, unsupplemented diet accumulate in the skin and confer a measurable photoprotective benefit (at least in lightly pigmented Caucasian skin), that is directly linked to their concentration in the tissue. Carotenoids also appear to contribute measurably and significantly to normal human skin color, in particular the appearance of yellowness"" as defined objectively by CR200 tristimulus b* values. On the basis of these findings we believe that objective measurements of skin color, in particular tristimulus b* values, may be a potentially useful means of monitoring dietary carotenoid status and assessing UV photosensitivity in Caucasian populations.""",Excluded

3140,"Radiotherapy plus concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide for glioblastoma. BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma, the most common primary brain tumor in adults, is usually rapidly fatal. The current standard of care for newly diagnosed glioblastoma is surgical resection to the extent feasible, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy. In this trial we compared radiotherapy alone with radiotherapy plus temozolomide, given concomitantly with and after radiotherapy, in terms of efficacy and safety. METHOD(S): Patients with newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed glioblastoma were randomly assigned to receive radiotherapy alone (fractionated focal irradiation in daily fractions of 2 Gy given 5 days per week for 6 weeks, for a total of 60 Gy) or radiotherapy plus continuous daily temozolomide (75 mg per square meter of body-surface area per day, 7 days per week from the first to the last day of radiotherapy), followed by six cycles of adjuvant temozolomide (150 to 200 mg per square meter for 5 days during each 28-day cycle). The primary end point was overall survival. RESULT(S): A total of 573 patients from 85 centers underwent randomization. The median age was 56 years, and 84 percent of patients had undergone debulking surgery. At a median follow-up of 28 months, the median survival was 14.6 months with radiotherapy plus temozolomide and 12.1 months with radiotherapy alone. The unadjusted hazard ratio for death in the radiotherapy-plus-temozolomide group was 0.63 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.75; P<0.001 by the log-rank test).

2095,"Comparative evaluation of radiation therapy techniques for mediastinum irradiation in lymphoma patients using IMRT, B-VMAT, 3DCRT. Introduction: Radiation therapy is effective in treating mediastinal lymphomas, but the question of its long-term radiation effects, such as induced breast cancer, lung cancer, and heart disease, has been increasingly raised in recent years. The aim of our work was to compare the radiation doses that receive heart, lungs, and mammary glands (MG) during irradiation of mediastinal lymphomas by 3 different techniques: IMRT, B-VMAT, 3DCRT. Method(s): A radiation therapy plan was calculated for each of the indicated techniques for 7 mediastinal lymphoma patients. Photon energy: 6 MV, target dose: 30 Gy/15 fractions, planned target volume (PTV) coverage: 98% PTV covered by at least 95% isodose. IMRT and B-VMAT plans were calculated by inverse planning, and 3DCRT by direct planning using the Monte Carlo algorithm. Each IMRT plan consists of 7 coplanar fields almost equally spaced around a patient, using the ability not to pass through MG. B-VMAT plan is a composition of 3 non-coplanar VMAT arcs, couch 0degree G330degree/G30degree, couch 0degree G150degree/G180degree+G181degree/G210degree and couch 270degree G330degree/G30degree. 3DCRT plan is a couple of AP-PA fields with an addition of small portion of posterior oblique fields that lead to maximum dose outside PTV avoidance without adding any significant dose to lungs. An extra sub-volume ""heart inside PTV"" was created for inverse optimization in order to keep its dose theraputical and avoid any possible maximum inside the heart. Result(s): With a probability of p < 0.05, the following parameters were estimated. Average volumes of PTV (620 +/- 170) cc, MG (710 +/- 660) cc, total lung (2950+/-420) cc and heart (590 +/- 90) cc. Dose-Volume relations are given in following table Conclusion(s): With the stated above PTV coverage, the IMRT technique can significantly increase the conformity index of the plan and lead to the lowest dose to the heart in all studied parameters, but showed the highest dose to the lungs-both mean dose and V20. The B-VMAT technique can significantly reduce V4 MG while maintaining minimum V25 heart and V20 lungs. At the same time, despite the low mean dose to the heart-inside-PTV, the mean dose to the whole heart with this technique is higher compared to the IMRT technique due to the increase in V5 heart. The standard 3DCRT technique achieves the lowest average dose to the lungs, but has not shown any advantages in the rest of considered critical organs. The scatter of the data is due to the large variability of the physiological parameters of the patients, in order to specify the obtained data the study is proceeded. .",Excluded

PURPOSE: To describe the use of postoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy, with either weekly cisplatin or carboplatin, for high-risk head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) in a single institutional setting., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between July 1999 and January 2003, 47 patients were treated with postoperative chemoradiotherapy., RESULTS: Of the 47 patients, 41 (87%) had Stage III-IV disease. The predominant primary site was the oral cavity in 24 patients (51%), 27 had nodal disease with extracapsular extension, and 26 had positive or close mucosal margins (<5 mm). Ten patients had undergone resection of recurrent disease after previous surgery. Twenty-seven (57%) were treated with cisplatin, and the remaining patients received carboplatin because of contraindications to cisplatin. The median radiotherapy dose was 60 Gy (range, 50-66 Gy). Of the 47 patients, 45 (96%) completed at least four of the six planned doses of chemotherapy and 45 (96%) completed the planned course of radiotherapy. Nineteen patients (40%) had confluent mucositis, eight (17%) had Grade 3-4 hematologic toxicity, and four (9%) had febrile neutropenia. No treatment-related deaths occurred. The estimated 2-year locoregional control, progression-free survival, and overall survival rate was 73%, 56%, and 62%, respectively.

Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores before operation, operation time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative drainage volume, blood transfusion rates, postoperative bedridden time, postoperative hospital stays, intraoperative fluoroscopic time, levels of serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) before operation, 3 days and 1 week after operation, VAS scores before operation, 3 days and 1 week after operation, and ODI and VAS scores in the last follow-up between the two groups were compared., RESULTS: There were significant differences between the two groups in the operation time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative drainage, blood transfusion rates, postoperative bedridden time, postoperative hospital stays and intraoperative fluoroscopic time; all indicators in MOTLIF group were superior to those in COTLIF group (p<0.05). There were no significant differences between the two groups in levels of serum CPK before operation and 1 week after operation (p>0.05). However, 3 days after operation, the level of serum CPK in COTLIF group was increased more significantly than that in MOTLIF group (647.4+/-178.6 vs. 467.4+/-189.4). There were no differences between the two groups in ODI and VAS scores before operation; ODI score in MOTLIF group in the last follow-up was significantly superior to that in COTLIF group (p>0.05). And VAS scores at 3 days and 1 week after operation and the last follow-up in MOTLIF group were superior to those in COTLIF group (p<0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the conventional open TLIF, mini-open TLIF via Wiltse's approach using the self-designed operating apparatus is characterized by the convenient operation, small trauma and quick recovery after operation. At the same time, the radiation exposure is lower and long-term follow-up effect is superior. Its short-term and long-term effects in the treatment of lower lumbar degenerative disease are also superior.",Excluded
4821,"Damage of nasal mucociliary movement after intensity-modulated radiation therapy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Radiation usually results in paranasal sinusitis in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), which influences patients' quality of life. This study aimed to determine the relationships between dose distribution in the nasal cavity and nasal mucous injury in patients with NPC treated by intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and to find the tolerable radiation dose for the nasal mucous., METHODS: Sixty-six patients with NPC treated by IMRT between October 2006 and November 2008 were enrolled. The irradiation dose in the nasal cavity was determined by the computer with the IMRT work platform. Mucociliary transport rate (MTR) was detected by modified saccharine test before IMRT, at the end of IMRT, and at 3, 6, and 12 months after IMRT., RESULTS: The data were available for 129 nasal cavities. The cavities receiving a mean dose below or equal to 37 Gy showed substantial preservation of nasal mucous after IMRT. The MRT decreased to (62.82 +/- 38.59)%, (56.78 +/- 37.79)%, (64.05 +/- 39.37)%, and (71.13 +/- 39.55)% of pre-IMRT value at 4 time points after IMRT, with significant differences among the data (P < 0.05). In contrast, when the cavities received a mean dose higher than 37 Gy, no significant differences in MTR among the time points were observed. At 3 months after IMRT, the MTR was the lowest (38.27% of pre-RT value)., CONCLUSIONS: A mean radiation dose of <= 37 Gy for the nasal cavity is an optimal dose to protect the nasal cavity function.",Excluded

Objective To determine the efficacy of palliative radiotherapy in treating tumor-stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma/mycosis fungoides (MF). Methods From January 2008 to January 2013, a total of 11 patients with tumor-stage MF were treated with local radiation therapy in Peking Union Medical College Hospital. The median age of these patients was 53.36+/-14.45 years. Female-male ratio was 1:1.2. The average course of disease was 10.82+/-3.37 years. All the patients were treated with local electronic beam irradiation with a total median dosage of 48.55+/-9.51 (40-74) Gy in an average of 24.55+/-5.57 (20-40) fractions, 5 fractions per week. Results The median follow-up time was 55.27+/-29.3 (13-103) months. No severe acute or chronic side effects of irradiation were observed. Complete clinical response (CR) rate of the radiated sites was 54.5% (6/11), partial response (PR) rate was 36.4% (4/11), and the overall response rate (CR+PR) was 90.9%. One patient showed no response.

4891,"Efficacy and safety of primary surgery with postoperative radiotherapy in head and neck mucosal melanoma: A single-arm phase II study. Background: There still remains no well-established treatment strategy for head and neck mucosal melanoma (HNMM). We aim to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of primary surgery with postoperative radiotherapy for this disease. Patients and Methods: A single-arm, Phase II clinical trial was conducted at Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center. Patients with nonmetastatic, histologically proven HNMM were prospectively enrolled. Patients received primary surgery followed by intensity-modulated radiotherapy with an equivalent dose at 2 Gy per fraction of 65-70 Gy to CTV1 (high-risk regions including tumor bed) and 50-55 Gy to CTV2 (low-risk regions). Additional use of adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) depended on consultation from a multidisciplinary team. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03138642. Result(s): A total of 33 patients were enrolled and analyzed between July 2010 and November 2016. There were 18 (54.5%) patients with T3 disease and 15 (45.5%) patients with T4a disease. The median age at diagnosis was 58 years (range 27-83 years), and 61% of the cohort were males. The overall median follow-up duration was 25.3 months (range 5.3-67.1 months). The 3-year overall survival (OS), local relapse-free survival (LRFS), regional relapse-free survival (RRFS), and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) rates were 44.4, 91.7, 78.1, and 41.7%, respectively. Patients with T4a disease showed significantly inferior OS (P=0.049) and DMFS (P=0.040) than those with T3 disease. Prophylactic neck radiation (PNR) was nearly associated with superior RRFS (P=0.078). However, there was no significant difference in OS, LRFS, RRFS, and DMFS for patients treated with or without AC (P>0.05 for all). Toxicities were generally mild to moderate. Conclusion(s): Primary surgery with postoperative radiotherapy yielded excellent local control and acceptable toxicity profile for HNMM. Nevertheless, high rates of distant metastases resulted in limited survival.Copyright Â© 2018 Yao et al.",Excluded
935,"Effect of Hypercapnia, an Element of Obstructive Respiratory Disorders, on Pancreatic Cancer Chemoresistance and Progression. BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive respiratory disorders (ORD) are linked to increased rates of cancer related deaths. Little is known about the effects of hypercapnia (elevated CO2) on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) development and drug-resistance.
STUDY DESIGN: Two PDAC cell-lines were exposed to normocapnic (5% CO2) and hypercapnic (continuous/intermittent 10% CO2) conditions, physiologically similar to patients with active ORD. Cells were assessed for proliferation rate, colony formation, and chemo/radiotherapeutic efficacy. In a retrospective clinical study design, patients with PDAC who have undergone pancreatic resection between the years of 2002-2014 were reviewed. Active smokers were excluded in order to remove possible smoking-related pro-tumorigenic influences. Clinical data, pathological findings, and survival endpoints were recorded. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Exposure to hypercapnia resulted in an increased colony formation and proliferation rate, in-vitro in both cell lines (MIA-PaCa-2:111% increase and Panc-1:114% increase, P<0.05). Hypercapnia exposure induced a 2.5-fold increase in oxaliplatin resistance (P<0.05) in both cell lines and increased resistance to ionizing radiation in MIA-PaCa-2 cells (P<0.05). Five hundred and seventy-eight patients were included [52% males, median age was 68.7 years (IQR 60.6-76.8 years)]. Cox regression analysis, assessing TNM-staging, age, gender and ORD status, identified ORD as an independent risk factor for both overall survival (HR 1.64, 95%CI 1.2-2.3, P<0.05) and disease-free survival (HR 1.68, 95%CI 1.06-2.67).
CONCLUSIONS: PDAC cells exposed to hypercapnic environments, common to patients with ORD, showed tumor proliferation, radioresistance and chemoresistance. Patients with a history of ORD had a worse overall prognosis, suggesting that hypercapnic conditions play a role in the development and progression of PDAC and stressing the need for patient-tailored care.",Excluded

2832,"Hippocampal sparing radiotherapy for glioblastoma patients: A planning study using volumetric modulated arc therapy. Background: The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential to reduce exposure of the contralateral hippocampus in radiotherapy for glioblastoma using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Method(s): Datasets of 27 patients who had received 3D conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) for glioblastoma with a prescribed dose of 60Gy in fractions of 2Gy were included in this planning study. VMAT plans were optimized with the aim to reduce the dose to the contralateral hippocampus as much as possible without compromising other parameters. Hippocampal dose and treatment parameters were compared to the 3D-CRT plans using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The influence of tumour location and PTV size on the hippocampal dose was investigated with the Mann-Whitney-U-test and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Result(s): The median reduction of the contralateral hippocampus generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD) with VMAT was 36 % compared to the original 3D-CRT plans (p<0.05). Other dose parameters were maintained or improved. The median V30Gy brain could be reduced by 17.9 % (p<0.05). For VMAT, a parietal and a non-temporal tumour localisation as well as a larger PTV size were predictors for a higher hippocampal dose (p<0.05). Conclusion(s): Using VMAT, a substantial reduction of the radiotherapy dose to the contralateral hippocampus for patients with glioblastoma is feasible without compromising other treatment parameters. For larger PTV sizes, less sparing can be achieved. Whether this approach is able to preserve the neurocognitive status without compromising the oncological outcome needs to be investigated in the setting of prospective clinical trials.Copyright Â© 2016 The Author(s).",Excluded
3979,"Characteristics of induced mutations in offspring derived from irradiated mouse spermatogonia and mature oocytes. The exposure of germ cells to radiation introduces mutations in the genomes of offspring, and a previous whole-genome sequencing study indicated that the irradiation of mouse sperm induces insertions/deletions (indels) and multisite mutations (clustered single nucleotide variants and indels). However, the current knowledge on the mutation spectra is limited, and the effects of radiation exposure on germ cells at stages other than the sperm stage remain unknown. Here, we performed whole-genome sequencing experiments to investigate the exposure of spermatogonia and mature oocytes. We compared de novo mutations in a total of 24 F1 mice conceived before and after the irradiation of their parents. The results indicated that radiation exposure, 4 Gy of gamma rays, induced 9.6 indels and 2.5 multisite mutations in spermatogonia and 4.7 indels and 3.1 multisite mutations in mature oocytes in the autosomal regions of each F1 individual. Notably, we found two types of deletions, namely, small deletions (mainly 1~12 nucleotides) in non-repeat sequences, many of which showed microhomology at the breakpoint junction, and single-nucleotide deletions in mononucleotide repeat sequences. The results suggest that these deletions and multisite mutations could be a typical signature of mutations induced by parental irradiation in mammals.",Excluded

OBJECTIVES: To provide direct estimates of risk of cancer after protracted low doses of ionising radiation and to strengthen the scientific basis of radiation protection standards for environmental, occupational, and medical diagnostic exposures., DESIGN: Multinational retrospective cohort study of cancer mortality., SETTING: Cohorts of workers in the nuclear industry in 15 countries., PARTICIPANTS: 407 391 workers individually monitored for external radiation with a total follow-up of 5.2 million person years., MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Estimates of excess relative risks per sievert (Sv) of radiation dose for mortality from cancers other than leukaemia and from leukaemia excluding chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, the main causes of death considered by radiation protection authorities., RESULTS: The excess relative risk for cancers other than leukaemia was 0.97 per Sv, 95% confidence interval 0.14 to 1.97. Analyses of causes of death related or unrelated to smoking indicate that, although confounding by smoking may be present, it is unlikely to explain all of this increased risk. The excess relative risk for leukaemia excluding chronic lymphocytic leukaemia was 1.93 per Sv (< 0 to 8.47). On the basis of these estimates, 1-2% of deaths from cancer among workers in this cohort may be attributable to radiation., CONCLUSIONS: These estimates, from the largest study of nuclear workers ever conducted, are higher than, but statistically compatible with, the risk estimates used for current radiation protection standards. The results suggest that there is a small excess risk of cancer, even at the low doses and dose rates typically received by nuclear workers in this study.",Included

1723,"The effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on cortical inhibition in healthy human subjects. It has been suggested that the therapeutic effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) are mediated through changes in cortical inhibition (CI). However, in healthy human subjects the effects of rTMS on CI have been inconsistent. Therefore, this study sought to improve on the methodological limitations of previous studies by exploring several different rTMS-stimulus conditions on inhibition in the human motor cortex. In the first experiment, 12 healthy control subjects were randomly assigned to receive regular 1, 10 or 20 Hz rTMS in a counterbalanced order with sessions separated by at least 1 week. In the second experiment, 10 of these 12 subjects received priming rTMS (600 stimuli at 6 Hz followed by 600 stimuli at 1 Hz). Cortical inhibition was indexed using short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and cortical silent period (CSP). Corticospinal excitability was indexed using motor threshold and MEP amplitude. We found no significant overall change in SICI, although there was a significant correlation between changes in SICI with baseline SICI. Subjects with greater SICI at baseline tended to have reduction in SICI post-rTMS, whereas subjects with less SICI tended to have increase in SICI post-rTMS. There was also a significant lengthening of the CSP with higher stimulation frequencies compared to lower stimulation frequencies. These findings suggest that rTMS increases CI, particularly in subjects with reduced baseline inhibition, a finding consistent with the concept of homeostatic plasticity. Baseline physiological characteristics may be further explored as a method to select patients who may benefit from rTMS treatment.",Excluded
3380,"4DMRI-based investigation on the interplay effect for pencil beam scanning proton therapy of pancreatic cancer patients. Background: Time-resolved volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (4DMRI) offers the potential to analyze 3D motion with high soft-tissue contrast without additional imaging dose. We use 4DMRI to investigate the interplay effect for pencil beam scanning (PBS) proton therapy of pancreatic cancer and to quantify the dependency of residual interplay effects on the number of treatment fractions. Method(s): Based on repeated 4DMRI datasets for nine pancreatic cancer patients, synthetic 4DCTs were generated by warping static 3DCTs with 4DMRI deformation vector fields. 4D dose calculations for scanned proton therapy were performed to quantify the interplay effect by CTV coverage (v95) and dose homogeneity (d5/d95) for incrementally up to 28 fractions. The interplay effect was further correlated to CTV motion characteristics. For quality assurance, volume and mass conservation were evaluated by Jacobian determinants and volume-density comparisons. Result(s): For the underlying patient cohort with CTV motion amplitudes < 15 mm, we observed significant correlations between CTV motion amplitudes and both the length of breathing cycles and the interplay effect. For individual fractions, tumor underdosage down to v95 = 70% was observed with pronounced dose heterogeneity (d5/d95 = 1.3). For full x 28 fractionated treatments, we observed a mitigation of the interplay effect with increasing fraction numbers. On average, after seven fractions, a CTV coverage with 95-107% of the prescribed dose was reached with sufficient dose homogeneity. For organs at risk, no significant differences were found between the static and accumulated dose plans for 28 fractions. Conclusion(s): Intrafractional organ motion exhibits a large interplay effect for PBS proton therapy of pancreatic cancer. The interplay effect correlates with CTV motion, but can be mitigated efficiently by fractionation, mainly due to different breathing starting phases in fractionated treatments. For hypofractionated treatments, a further restriction of motion may be required. Repeated 4DMRI measurements are a viable tool for pre- and post-treatment evaluations of the interplay effect.Copyright Â© 2019 The Author(s).",Excluded

Proceeding from the concept of individual radiosensitivity as a sign of total reactivity 3 directions in a study of its possible prediction were considered: establishing correlation between separate indices characterizing the initial state and total radiosensitivity; correlation between body reactions to non-radiation exposures and subsequent irradiation; comparison of total radiosensitivity to irradiation at a small dose and subsequent irradiation at LD50. The following indices were used for the evaluation of the basal status of the body: oxygen consumption level, body mass increase rate, the level of water and basal metabolism, peripheral blood indices, body temperature, basal indices of the functional adrenocortical activity, the state of the cardiovascular system. The following non-radiation stress-exposures were used: physical exercise, constant magnetic field, starvation, hypoxia, and adrenaline administration. A V-type dependency was established for most investigated indices of the basal status and reaction of the body to non-radiation exposures. The utmost radioresistance was shown by animals in whom the basal indices or their reaction to non-radiation exposure approximated the average group level. The third direction: comparison of radiosensitivity and radiation damage--was analyzed by comparing the reaction of cerebral biocurrents to radiation exposure at a small dose with subsequent damage of the body following irradiation at a lethal dose. The accuracy of predicting the outcome of radiation injury by some of the indices varied from 65 to 80%. In some indices of the basal status and reactivity evaluation it reached 85-90%.",Excluded
939,"Construction of a radiation hybrid panel and the first yellowtail (Seriola quinqueradiata) radiation hybrid map using a nanofluidic dynamic array. BACKGROUND: Yellowtail (Seriola quinqueradiata) are an economically important species in Japan. However, there are currently no methods for captive breeding and early rearing for yellowtail. Thus, the commercial cultivation of this species is reliant upon the capture of wild immature fish. Given this, there is a need to develop captive breeding techniques to reduce pressure on wild stocks and facilitate the sustainable development of yellowtail aquaculture. We constructed a whole genome radiation hybrid (RH) panel for yellowtail gene mapping and developed a framework physical map using a nanofluidic dynamic array to use SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) in ESTs (expressed sequence tags) for the DNA-assisted breeding of yellowtail., RESULTS: Clonal RH cell lines were obtained after ionizing radiation; specifically, 78, 64, 129, 55, 42, and 53 clones were isolated after treatment with 3,000, 4,000, 5,000, 6,000, 8,000, or 10,000 rads, respectively. A total of 421 hybrid cell lines were obtained by fusion with mouse B78 cells. Ninety-four microsatellite markers used in the genetic linkage map were genotyped using the 421 hybrid cell lines. Based upon marker retention and genome coverage, we selected 93 hybrid cell lines to form an RH panel. Importantly, we performed the first genotyping of yellowtail markers in an RH panel using a nanofluidic dynamic array (Fluidigm, CA, USA). Then, 580 markers containing ESTs and SNPs were mapped in the first yellowtail RH map., CONCLUSIONS: We successfully developed a yellowtail RH panel to facilitate the localization of markers. Using this, a framework RH map was constructed with 580 markers. This high-density physical map will serve as a useful tool for the identification of genes related to important breeding traits using genetic structural information, such as conserved synteny. Moreover, in a comparison of 30 sequences in the RH group 1 (SQ1), yellowtail appeared to be evolutionarily closer to medaka and the green-spotted pufferfish than to zebrafish. We suggest that synteny analysis may be potentially useful as a tool to investigate chromosomal evolution by comparison with model fish.",Excluded
3323,"Proctitis 1 week after stereotactic body radiation therapy for prostate cancer: Implications for clinical trial design. Background: Proctitis following prostate cancer radiation therapy is a primary determinant of quality of life (QOL). While previous studies have assessed acute rectal morbidity at 1 month after stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), little data exist on the prevalence and severity of rectal morbidity within the first week following treatment. This study reports the acute bowel morbidity 1 week following prostate SBRT. Material(s) and Method(s): Between May 2013 and August 2014, 103 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer were treated with 35-36.25 Gy in five fractions using robotic SBRT delivered on a prospective clinical trial. Bowel toxicity was graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAEv.4). Bowel QOL was assessed using the EPIC-26 questionnaire bowel domain at baseline, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months. Time-dependent changes in bowel symptoms were statistically compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Clinically significant change was assessed by the minimally important difference (MID) in EPIC score. This was defined as a change of 1/2 standard deviation (SD) from the baseline score. Result(s): One-hundred and three patients with a minimum of 3 months of follow-up were analyzed. The cumulative incidence of acute grade 2 gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity was 23%. There were no acute >= grade 3 bowel toxicities. EPIC bowel summary scores maximally declined at 1 week after SBRT (-13.9, p < 0.0001) before returning to baseline at 3 months after SBRT (+0.03, p = 0.94). Prior to treatment, 4.9% of men reported that their bowel bother was a moderate to big problem. This increased to 28.4% (p < 0.0001) 1 week after SBRT and returned to baseline at 3 months after SBRT (0.0%, p = 0.66). Only the bowel summary and bowel bother score declines at 1 week met the MID threshold for clinically significant change. Conclusion(s): The rate and severity of acute proctitis following prostate SBRT peaked at 1 week after treatment and returned to baseline by 3 months. Toxicity assessment at 1 week can therefore minimize recall bias and should aid in the design of future clinical trials focused on accurately capturing and minimizing acute morbidity following SBRT.Copyright Â© 2016 Paydar, Cyr, Yung, Lei, Collins, Chen, Suy, Dritschilo, Lynch and Collins.",Excluded

Purpose: To evaluate the role of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) in the assessment of therapeutic response in patients with choroidal melanoma treated with brachytherapy. Material(s) and Method(s): We performed a prospective, unicentric study which included patients with choroidal melanoma and indication for brachytherapy. Three DW-MRI examinations were proposed for each patient, one before and two after treatment. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value was calculated on DW-MRI and compared with local tumor control assessed by ophthalmologic follow-up. Result(s): From 07/2018 to 06/2019, 19 patients were recruited, 13 of whom underwent follow-up examinations. Patients' ages ranged from 24 to 78 years and 52.9% were male. At the ocular ultrasound, the mean tumor thickness and diameter were 6.3 and 11.5 mm, respectively. Two patients (15.4%) showed signs of tumor progression during follow-up (7 and 9 months after treatment). There was no statistically significant difference in tumor size between MR before and after treatment, however, there was a significant reduction in mean ADC in patients with progression (p = 0.02). Conclusion(s): DW-MRI is a promising method for monitoring patients with choroidal melanoma; reduction in the mean ADC values between pre-treatment MRI and the first post-treatment MRI may be related to the lack of response to brachytherapy and increased risk of disease progression.Â© Copyright Â© 2020 Bitencourt, Bitencourt, Chojniak, Souza, Castro, Pellizzon and Chojniak.",Excluded

When sperm of the fish Oryzias latipes were irradiated with ultraviolet light and allowed to fertilize normal eggs, the so-called ""Hertwig effect"" was observed, with a dose-dependent decrease in survival rate at low doses (0-27 J . m-2) but a better survival rate at higher dose ranges. Illumination with visible light after fertilization (10-70 min after insemination) showed the existence of photoreactivation (PR), demonstrating that pyrimidine dimers are a lesion in sperm DNA that is mainly responsible for the UV-caused Hertwig effect. Genetic analysis, in which sperm from a wild-type of this fish was used, showed that, after UV-irradiation at the high dose range, male nuclei did not participate in embryonic development (a gynogenetic haploid condition). Embryos having only a maternal set of chromosomes could develop no further than stage 27.

Purpose: To validate a new 2D-3D registration method of fusion imaging during aortic repair in a system prepared only for 3D-3D registration and to compare radiation doses and accuracy. Material(s) and Method(s): The study involved 189 patients, including 94 patients (median age 70 years; 85 men) who underwent abdominal endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) with 2D-3D fusion on an Artis zee imaging system and 95 EVAR patients (median age 70 years; 81 men) from a prior study who had 3D-3D registration done using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT). For the 2D-3D registration, an offline CBCT of the empty operating table was imported into the intraoperative dataset and superimposed on the preoperative computed tomography angiogram (CTA). Then 2 intraoperative single-frame 2D images of the skeleton were aligned with the patient's skeleton on the preoperative CTA to complete the registration process. A digital subtraction angiogram was done to correct any misalignment of the aortic CTA volume. Values are given as the median [interquartile range (IQR) Q1, Q3]. Result(s): The 2D-3D registration had an accuracy of 4.0 mm (IQR 3.0, 5.0) after bone matching compared with the final correction with DSA (78% within 5 mm). By applying the 2D-3D protocol the radiation exposure (dose area product) from the registration of the fusion image was significantly reduced compared with the 3D-3D registration [1.12 Gy.cm2 (IQR 0.41, 2.14) vs 43.4 Gy.cm2 (IQR 37.1, 49.0), respectively; p<0.001). Conclusion(s): The new 2D-3D registration protocol based on 2 single-frame images avoids an intraoperative CBCT and can be used for fusion imaging registration in a system originally designed for 3D-3D only. This 2D-3D registration protocol is accurate and leads to a significant reduction in radiation exposure.Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2020.",Excluded

Patients and Methods: We evaluated radiation exposure from initial and downstream testing in a prospectively collected, matched cohort evaluated for CP in the emergency department (ED) with either CCTA compared with usual care over a median follow-up of 19.6 months. Effective radiation dose was calculated using published conversion factors. Result(s): Prospective, ECG-triggered acquisition using a 128-slice dual-source multidetector computed tomography (DSCT) scanner was performed in 92.9% of scans with a median effective dose from CCTA of 6.8 mSv (IQR 5.2, 9.1 mSv). CCTA cohort patients were more likely to undergo cardiac testing with exposure to radiation (P < 0.001); however, the median effective dose in patients exposed to radiation from cardiac testing was significantly lower in the CCTA cohort (7.1 mSv vs. 11.8 mSv, P < 0.001). Fewer patients in the CCTA cohort had additional non-cardiac thoracic imaging radiation exposure (40.8%) compared with usual care (92.8%). Total radiation exposure from any source was similar between the CCTA and usual care groups (100% vs 98.4%, P = 0.087), as was median total effective radiation dose (P = 0.105). Upfront CCTA was not associated with higher rates of incidental non-cardiac findings. Conclusion(s): Initial evaluation of acute chest pain in the ED with CCTA was not associated with an increase in total radiation exposure over a follow-up period of 19 months. CCTA offers a more comprehensive evaluation of multiple thoracic organ systems leading to reduced radiation exposure from non-cardiac thoracic testing and no increase in incidental imaging findings. This may represent an added benefit in this population of patients presenting acutely.Copyright Â© 2015, Iranian Society of Echocardiography.",Excluded
1653,"CyberKnife radiosurgery for breast cancer spine metastases: A matched-pair analysis. BACKGROUND. There are few options for breast cancer patients with spinal metastases recurrent within a previous radiation treatment field. CyberKnife radiosurgery has been used in our institution to treat such patients. To evaluate their outcomes, as there are no comparable radiation treatment options, the outcomes were compared between 18 patients with spinal metastases from breast cancer treated with CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery, 17 of which had prior radiotherapy to the involved spinal region and were progressing, and 18 matched patients who received conventional external beam radiotherapy (CRT) up-front for spinal metastases. METHODS. Radiosurgery was delivered in 3 to 5 fractions to doses ranging from 2100 to 2800 cGy. Women were matched to patients in a CRT group with respect to time from original diagnosis to diagnosis of metastases, estrogen receptor / progesterone receptor (ER/PR) status, presence or absence of visceral metastases, prior radiotherapy, and prior chemotherapy. Survival and complications were compared between treatment groups. Surviving patients were followed out to 24 months. RESULTS. The CyberKnife and CRT groups were comparable along all matching dimensions and in performance status before treatment. Outcomes of treatment were similar for patients in both groups; ambulation, performance status, and pain worsened similarly across groups posttreatment. Survival and the number of complications appeared to favor the CyberKnife group, but the differences did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS. The statistical comparability of the CyberKnife and CRT groups reflects the small sample size and stringent requirements for significance of the matched-pair analysis. Nevertheless, comparability in these difficult cases shows that salvage CyberKnife treatment is as efficacious as initial CRT without added toxicity. Â© 2007 American Cancer Society.",Excluded
3688,"Radiotherapy Practice for Treatment of Bone Metastasis in Ethiopia. PUROSE Ethiopia has one cobalt radiotherapy (RT) machine to serve a population of more than 100 million. The purpose of this study was to report on patterns of palliative RT of bone metastasis in a severely low-capacity setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patient and treatment characteristics of patients irradiated for palliation of symptomatic bone metastasis were extracted from a retrospective database of patients treated between May 2015 and January 2018. This database included a random sample of 1,823 of the estimated 4,000 patients who were treated with RT within in the study period. Associations between the applied RT schedule and patient and tumor characteristics were evaluated with the chi2 test. Hypothetical savings of RT sessions and time were compared in the case of a single-fraction policy. RESULTS From the database, 234 patients (13%) were treated for bone metastasis. Most patients were <= 65 years of age (n = 189; 80%) and female (n = 125; 53%). The most common primary sites were breast (n = 82; 35%) and prostate (n = 36; 15%). Fractionated regimens were preferred over single fraction: 20 Gy in 5 fractions (n = 192; 82.1%), 30 Gy in 10 fractions (n = 7; 3%), and 8 Gy in 1 fraction (n = 28; 12%). Factors associated with single-fraction RT included nonaxial sites of bone metastasis (P, .01) and an address outside Addis Ababa (P <= .01). If single-fraction RT would have been given uniformly for bone metastasis, this would have resulted in a 78% reduction in the number of RT sessions and 76% reduction in total RT time. CONCLUSION The pattern of palliative RT for bone metastasis in Ethiopia favors fractionated regimens over single fraction. Efforts should be made to adopt evidence-based and cost-effective guidelines.Copyright Â© 2020 by American Society of Clinical Oncology",Excluded

4772,"Effects of a closed space environment on gene expression in hair follicles of astronauts in the International Space Station. Adaptation to the space environment can sometimes pose physiological problems to International Space Station (ISS) astronauts after their return to earth. Therefore, it is important to develop healthcare technologies for astronauts. In this study, we examined the feasibility of using hair follicles, a readily obtained sample, to assess gene expression changes in response to spaceflight adaptation. In order to investigate the gene expression changes in human hair follicles during spaceflight, hair follicles of 10 astronauts were analyzed by microarray and real time qPCR analyses. We found that spaceflight alters human hair follicle gene expression. The degree of changes in gene expression was found to vary among individuals. In some astronauts, genes related to hair growth such as FGF18, ANGPTL7 and COMP were upregulated during flight, suggesting that spaceflight inhibits cell proliferation in hair follicles.Copyright Â© 2016 Terada et al.

4088,"Noonan syndrome and glioneuronal tumors: A central nervous system cancer predisposition association?. BACKGROUND: Noonan syndrome (NS) is associated with germline Ras signaling pathway mutations, RAS overactivation and increased tumorigenesis risk. Rosette-forming glioneuronal tumors (RFGT) are rare indolent tumors. We report the molecular profiling of two patients with NS and RFGT. PATIENT 1: A 22-year-old male with NS was diagnosed with RFGT after partial tumor resection followed by focal irradiation. He was enrolled on a comprehensive genomic profiling study involving paired tumor-normal whole exome sequencing and RNA sequencing of the disease-involved tissue, revealing a germline PTPN11 alteration (p.Gly60Ala) consistent with NS, and a somatic deletion (p.Ile442-Thr454del) in PIK3R1 and a somatic variant (p.Lys656Glu) in FGFR1 with concomitant increased expression of PIK3R1 and FGFR1 by RNA-sequencing. The patient remains without tumor progression now nine months since irradiation. PATIENT 2: A 19-year-old male with persistent headaches, underwent a brain MRI demonstrated multiple abnormal signals in the pineal region and midbrain. He had a stereotactic biopsy revealing RFGT. He was enrolled on the genomic study revealing a germline PTPN11 alteration (p.Asn308Asp) resulting in a new diagnosis of NS. Several family members were subsequently identified with clinical features of NS, including his mother and two siblings, enabling appropriate counseling. Two somatic variants were found in trans in PIK3R1 (p.Thr454-Phe456del and p.Glu451-Asn453delinsAsp), and a somatic variant (p.Val695Met) in FGFR1, with resultant overexpression of PIK3R1. The patient is monitored with surveillance imaging. CONCLUSION(S): We report the molecular profiling of two patients with NS and RFGT; strongly suggesting their connection to RASopathies through the overactivation of the MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways.",Excluded
4646,"Predicting late effects of pelvic radiotherapy: is there a better approach?. PURPOSE: Significant chronic symptoms following pelvic radiotherapy occur more frequently than commonly realized. Predictive factors for the development of late symptoms are poorly defined. Moderate sustained acute (cumulative) toxicity might predict severe late effects better than peak reaction., METHODS AND MATERIALS: To determine prospectively whether peak or cumulative gastrointestinal (GI) acute symptoms better predict late symptoms in patients receiving pelvic radiotherapy. Symptom scores were measured weekly from the start of radiotherapy, and at 1 year using the Modified Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire-Bowel subset. The possible prognostic impact of patient-related factors was explored., RESULTS: Three hundred and eight patients were recruited. 100 were excluded due to lack of follow-up data at one year resulting from death, too ill, stoma, relapsed, non-response or withdrawal. A further 15 were excluded for incomplete data, leaving 193 patients with evaluable data. Of these, 28 had GI, 101 urological, and 64 gynecological cancers. Patients' median age was 65 years (range, 23-82), and they were treated with median 60 Gy dose for a median of 6 weeks. Univariate analysis revealed a significant association between cumulative acute symptom scores and scores at 1 year (p < 0.001), which was dose-independent (p < 0.001). Acute peak and 1-year scores were not associated (p = 0.431). The correlation coefficient between cumulative acute symptoms and symptoms at 1 year was 0.367 and for peak acute symptoms was weaker at 0.057. Patients with an abnormal body mass index and current smokers were more likely to experience worse symptoms at 1 year., CONCLUSION: Cumulative acute symptoms are more predictive of late symptoms than peak acute changes in score. This association is independent of the radiotherapy dose delivered and is suggestive of a consequential late effect. Copyright Â© 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Background/Aim: Tumoral calcification after chemotherapy or radiation therapy has been reported in various cancer patients, but not after radioembolization. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of radioembolization-induced tumor calcification of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated by radioembolization. Patients and Methods: This retrospective study comprised patients with single nodular HCC who underwent yttrium-90 radioembolization between November 2015 and April 2019. The presence of tumoral calcification was visually assessed on a follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan. Result(s): Fiftyfive patients (64.8+/-11.8 years, 43 men) were evaluated. Tumoral calcification was present in 21 (38.2%) of 55 patients in the one-month CT scan (calcification group). The complete response rate for the primary index tumor was 72.7% (40 of 55) in the total study population, and 100% (21 of 21) in the calcification group, respectively. The calcification group had a longer local progression-free survival rate than the noncalcification group (p=0.017).

2813,"Outcomes of surgical management of peptic ulcer perforation using the falciform ligament: A cross-sectional study at a single centre in Vietnam. Introduction: Peptic ulcer perforation (PUP) is one of the most common critical surgical emergencies. The omentum flap is commonly used to cover a PUP. However, the omentum cannot be used in cases of severe peritonitis or previous surgical removal. This is the first study conducted in Vietnam that was designed to analyse the outcomes of patients with PUPs who were treated using the falciform ligament. Method(s): In this study, we retrospectively identified 40 consecutive patients who were treated for PUP at a single high-volume centre in Vietnam from February 2018 to February 2021. Peptic ulcer perforation was measured during diagnostic evaluation based on preoperative imaging, such as X-ray, and CT scan. Patients who had malignancy, laparoscopic surgery, omentopexy and nonoperative treatment were excluded from this research. Result(s): Forty patients were included; the mean age of the patients was 66.3 years (range 33-99 years), and some patients had comorbid disease (57.5%), hypertension (30%), diabetes (10%), cirrhosis (7.5%), and chronic renal failure (7.5%). The PUPs were located in the duodenum (80%), or the pyloric (15%) and prepyloric (5%) regions. The procedures used to treat the patients included duodenostomy (32.5%), gastrojejunostomy (37.5%), and antrum resection (2.5%). The average operative time was 88.6 min (45-180 min), hospital stay was 9.6 days (2-35 days), and oral intake was started at 4.1 days (3-8 days); additionally, the 30-day mortality (17.5%) and incidences of pneumonia (25%), multiorgan failure (15%), acute liver failure (5%), wound infection (7.5%), and ulcer peptic fistula (0%) were assessed. Univariate tests showed that an ASA >= III and comorbidities, such as pulmonary complications, liver failure and multiorgan failure, were associated with mortality. The multivariate test showed that multiorgan failure was the only factor related to mortality. Conclusion(s): The falciform ligament can be efficiently used for the closure of a PUP. Although there were no instances of complication with a reperforated peptic ulcer, the mortality rate was slightly highly related to severe comorbidities and postoperative multiorgan failure.Copyright Â© 2021",Excluded

2585,"Solid cancer mortality associated with chronic external radiation exposure at the french atomic energy commission and nuclear fuel company. Studies of nuclear workers make it possible to directly quantify the risks associated with ionizing radiation exposure at low doses and low dose rates. Studies of the CEA (Commissariat l'Energie Atomique) and AREVA Nuclear Cycle (AREVA NC) cohort, currently the most informative such group in France, describe the long-term risk to nuclear workers associated with external exposure. Our aim is to assess the risk of mortality from solid cancers among CEA and AREVA NC nuclear workers and its association with external radiation exposure. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated and internal Poisson regressions were conducted, controlling for the main confounding factors sex, attained age, calendar period, company and socioeconomic status (SES). During the period 19682004, there were 2,035 solid cancers among the 36,769 CEA-AREVA NC workers. Cumulative external radiation exposure was assessed for the period 19502004, and the mean cumulative dose was 12.1 mSv. Mortality rates for all causes and all solid cancers were both significantly lower in this cohort than in the general population. A significant excess of deaths from pleural cancer, not associated with cumulative external dose, was observed, probably due to past asbestos exposure. We observed a significant excess of melanoma, also unassociated with dose. Although cumulative external dose was not associated with mortality from all solid cancers, the central estimated excess relative risk (ERR) per Sv of 0.46 for solid cancer mortality was higher than the 0.26 calculated for male Hiroshima and Nagasaki A-bomb survivors 50 years or older and exposed at the age of 30 years or older. The modification of our results after stratification for SES demonstrates the importance of this characteristic in occupational studies, because it makes it possible to take class-based lifestyle differences into account, at least partly. These results show the great potential of a further joint international study of nuclear workers, which should improve knowledge about the risks associated with chronic low doses and provide useful risk estimates for radiation protection.

PURPOSE: Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) improves long-term survival for patients with esophageal cancer. On the other hand, there are indications that nCRT may increase the risk for postoperative morbidity. The aims of this study were to estimate the radiation exposure to the site of anastomosis on the gastric fundus and to assess whether nCRT affected the incidence or severity of cervical anastomotic complications., METHODS: A retrospective cohort of patients with cancer of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction, who were reconstructed with cervical anastomosis. The planned radiation dose to the site of the cervical anastomosis on the gastric fundus was estimated for each patient., RESULTS: The analysis of the dose plans showed that 20 out of 22 (93 %) available patients received radiotherapy toward the planned site of the anastomosis in the region of the gastric fundus with doses ranging from 6 to 40 Gy. In the nCRT group, 12 out of 28 patients (43 %) had anastomotic complications compared to 16 out of 42 (38 %) in the non-RT group (p = 0.69). In the nCRT group, 39 % had anastomotic complications that led to a Clavien-Dindo grade of IVa or higher compared to 17 % in the non-RT group (p = 0.03). The OR for Clavien-Dindo grade IVa or worse was 6.0 (95 % CI 1.52-23.50)., CONCLUSION: This small retrospective study suggests that nCRT exposes the future anastomotic site to doses of radiation that may impair healing of the subsequent cervical anastomosis. Our data further suggest that nCRT may increase the severity of cervical anastomotic complications, and this hypothesis needs to be tested in a large prospective study.",Excluded

In the present study, the efficacy and clinical outcomes of stereotactic aspiration combined with the Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) method were evaluated retrospectively for patients with large cystic brain metastases. This combined method aims to decrease the tumor weight (volume) and increase the possible radiation dose. The present study involved 48 patients who were diagnosed with cystic metastatic brain tumors between January 2008 and December 2012 in the Department of Neurosurgery of Nanfang Hospital Southern Medical University (Guangzhou, China). Every patient underwent Leksell stereotactic frame, 1.5T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided stereotactic cyst aspiration and Leksell GKRS. Subsequent to the therapy, MRI was performed every 3 months. The results indicated that 48 cases were followed up for 24-72 months, with a mean follow-up duration of 36.2 months. Following treatment, 44 patients (91.7%) exhibited tumor control and 4 patients (8.3%) experienced progression of the local tumor. During this period, 35 patients (72.9%) succumbed, but only 2 (4.2%) of these succumbed to the brain metastases. The total local control rate was 91.7% and the median overall survival time of all patients was 19.5 months. The 1-year overall survival rate was 70.8% and the 2-year overall survival rate was 26.2%. In conclusion, these results indicated that the method of stereotactic cyst aspiration combined with GKRS was safe and effective for patients with large cystic brain metastases. This method is effective for patients whose condition is too weak for general anesthesia and in whom the tumors are positioned at eloquent areas. This method enables patients to avoid a craniotomy, and provides a good tumor control rate, survival time and quality of life.Copyright Â© 2016, Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Forty patients were examined at 120 kVp and 120 effective mAs (supine) and 40 effective mAs (prone) using online x- and y-axis tube current modulation. Another 40 patients were scanned using combined x-, y-, and z-axis tube current modulation. Individual patient radiation exposure was determined using the dose-length product. Image noise was determined by Hounsfield unit measurements in the colonic lumen at four anatomic levels. Image quality was rated on a 5-point confidence scale by two independent reviewers. The unpaired Student's t test (for radiation dose, image noise) and Wilcoxon's test (for image quality) were used to test for statistically significant differences between these values., RESULTS: Radiation dose was significantly lower in the patient group scanned with x-, y-, and z-axis tube current modulation than in the group scanned with x- and y-axis tube current modulation (supine: 4.24 vs 6.50 mSv, p < 0.0001; prone: 1.61 vs 2.38 mSv, p < 0.0001).

2154,"Utility of positron emission tomography/computed tomography in extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma. Background: Natural killer (NK/) T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, is an aggressive form of extranodal lymphoma that is common in Asia, but rare in Europe and North America. Although NK/T-cell lymphoma involves upper aerodigestive sites such as the nasal cavity and nasopharynx, it frequently involves other extranodal sites, including the gastrointestinal tract, bone marrow, adrenal gland, and skin. Because of the frequency of extranodal site involvement, pretreatment evaluation of disease extension is important for staging and treatment. Recently, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) was evaluated for its usefulness in the prognosis and treatment response of aggressive B-cell lymphoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma, and relevant results were obtained. Many studies have evaluated the value of PET/CT for various types of B-cell lymphomas, but other similar studies involving T-cell and NK-cell lymphomas are rare. In the present study, we compared the utility of PET/CT and conventional modalities, particularly CT, in extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma. Patients and Method: From January 2006 to April 2010, 19 untreated patients with extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (11 males and 8 females; median age 61 years; range 13-90 years) were included in the study. PET/CT and conventional procedures (e.g., CTs and biopsies) were compared and evaluated for their abilities to detect tumor lesions and their influence in staging and treatment strategies. PET/CT was performed as an initial staging procedure. In addition to PET/CT, all patients underwent initial staging workups, including whole-body CT with contrast media, biopsies from the bone marrow and other sites, and panendoscopies of the upper aerodigestive tract. Patients were evaluated for clinical stage by both evaluation modalities (PET/CT and conventional modalities) according to the Ann Arbor Staging System, and treatment strategies were first planned based on staging results. Following PET/CT, the clinical stage was reevaluated in each patient, and treatment strategies were decided based on the re-staging results. Result(s): Seven patients (37%) had bone marrow involvement, eight (42%) were in Ann Arbor stage I-II, and 11 (58%) had a systemic dissemination. Most patients with systemic dissemination (9/11, 82%) had cutaneous lesions. The median number of disease sites was 4 (range, 1-15). The median number of positive lesions was 3 (range, 1-15) by PET/CT compared to 2 (range, 0-14) by CT (p = 0.12). Using PET/CT, 108 lesions (93%) were detected, and at least one FDG-avid lesion was observed at initial staging workups in all patients. In contrast, 70 lesions (60%) were detected by CT, and three patients (16%) did not show any positive lesion. Two lesions (2%) at the nasal cavity that were detected by biopsy were undetectable by either PET/CT or CT. The nodal and extranodal regions were separately evaluated by PET/CT and conventional modalities. In total, 28 nodal lesions were detected: all (100%) were positive by PET/CT and 26 (93%) by CT. Conversely, 89 extranodal lesions were detected, and 83 (93%) and 44 (49%) were positive by PET/CT and CT (p = 0.003), respectively. For the detection of upper aerodigestive lesions, PET/CT and CT demonstrated similar results: 23 lesions (92%) vs. 17 (68%), respectively. Notably, PET/CT was superior to CT in detecting cutaneous lesions [31 lesions (100%) vs. 19 lesions (61%), respectively; p = 0.026]. Bone marrow involvement was confirmed pathologically in only seven patients; four cases (57%) were positive by PET/CT and none by CT. Using conventional modalities, 11 patients (58%) were in the localized stage and eight (42%) were in the advanced stage. Using PET/CT, eight (42%) were in stage I-II and 11 (58%) were in stage III-IV. Most patients received chemotherapy plus local irradiation in stage I-II, and intensive chemotherapy with or without hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in stage III-IV. One patient did not receive treatment because of unwillingness for treatment and older age. PET/CT findin s altered the stage and treatment strategy in four (21%) and two cases (11%). Conclusion(s): In extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, PET/CT demonstrated a high detection rate for nodal and extranodal lesions, except in the bone marrow. PET/CT may have an impact on treatment strategy and is essential for risk-adapted treatment.",Excluded

Median doses to metastases were 20 Gy in 1 fraction, 27 Gy in 3 fractions, and 25 Gy in 5 fractions. Median interfraction CBCT shifts were submillimeter. Median patient follow-up was 6.28 months. 91% of patients with metastases maintained local control. Our early clinical experience has demonstrated limited toxicity profiles and high patient tolerance, which suggests that mask-based Gamma Knife SRS provides a safe alternative option for frameless SRS. Patients with large target volumes where fractionation is preferred or with small target volumes in non-eloquent areas can be considered for this approach. Response rates are encouraging, and continued follow-up is necessary to investigate long-term control and survival.Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
1550,"Effectiveness and Toxicities of Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy for Patients with Locally Recurrent Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma. Purpose:To analyze the effectiveness and toxicities in the re-irradiation of locally recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) using intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Method(s):This is a retrospective analysis of 54 NPC patients with local recurrence re-irradiated with IMRT. The re-staging for rT1, rT2, rT3, rT4 were 3 (5.6%), 8 (14.8%), 9 (16.7%), 34 (63%) respectively. The average dose to GTV was 69.95 Gy (49.8-76.58 Gy), the average BED3Gy was 116.8 Gy (83.5-127.9 Gy). V95 was 96%, and D95 was 65.75Gy. 33.3% of them received concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Result(s):Median overall survival (OS) was 21 months (1-93 mon). The 1-, 2-year local progression free survival (LPFS) rate was 84.5%, 64% and OS rate was 71.7%, 44.3%. Severe late adverse events (SLAE) occurred in 48.1% of patients, including 31.5% with ulcer or necrosis of the nasopharyngeal mucosa, 20.4% with difficulty in feeding, 18.5% with temporal lobe necrosis, 11.1% with massive hemorrhage. 15.4% died of local regional progression, 5.8% died of distant metastasis, 25% died of SLAE, 9.6% died of both local regional progression and SLAE that could not be differentiated, 5.8% died of other medical complications. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy was the independent negative prognostic factors for LPFS; PTV>100 ml was a predictive factor of poor OS; patients with invasion of post-styloid space were at higher risk of SLAE. Conclusion(s):The present study demonstrated that IMRT with 70Gy was efficient for local tumor control. However, we observed a high frequency of serious late complications. More optimized combination treatment and patient selection are required to achieve excellent local control without significant late morbidities in locally recurrent NPC. Â© 2013 Chen et al.",Excluded

1433,"[Radiological determination of femoral rotation deformity--computerized tomography, optimized measurement accuracy and exposure dosage]. 58 Patients, suspicious to have rotation deformity of the femur, were examined. To compare the value of diagnostic methods in measuring the degree of malrotation we estimated this degree using clinical examination and calculated the anteversion of the femoral neck, taking radiographs in the technique of Dunn and Rippstein, and a modified method of computed tomography. Only in twelve cases the direction of malrotation was corresponding in all three methods, although considerable variations in quantitative results were noted. Maintaining the exact position of the patient, necessary to get reproducible results using conventional X-ray technique, was impossible in most cases of patients with posttraumatic joint-stiffness and malalignment. Determination of femoral neck anteversion using this modified method of CT is a quick, reproducible technique to calculate the degree of malrotation, insensitive to the position of the patient. By means of this CT method it was possible to approach the highest accuracy in precise preoperative planing. Furthermore the radiation exposure could be reduced in a range of 20%-40%.",Excluded
4648,"A Bioadhesive Barrier-Forming Oral Liquid Gel Improved Oral Mucositis and Nutritional Status in Patients With Head and Neck Cancers Undergoing Radiotherapy: A Retrospective Single Center Study. Background: Episil is a bioadhesive barrier-forming oral liquid gel that can relieve oral mucositis (OM) caused by radiotherapy (RT) and hence relieves pain effectively. In this study, we observed the effects of Episil on the OM and nutritional status of patients with head and neck cancers (HNCs) undergoing RT. Method(s): A total of 50 HNC patients were divided into the Episil (25 patients) and control (25 patients) groups. Patients in the Episil group were sprayed with Episil. In the control group, the kangfuxin solution or KangsuTM oral gargle was used. Medical staff assessed the OM extent and timing as well as the nutritional status during treatment and recorded adverse reactions other than OM. The nutritional status assessment included the following indicators: Patient Generated-Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) score, body mass index (BMI), body weight, albumin levels, and other hematological indicators. Result(s): The incidence of high-level OM (III-IV) after RT was lower in the Episil group than in the control group (P < 0.05). Nutritional status assessments showed that the Episil group had a lower percentage of weight loss than the control group at weeks 4 and 7 after RT. Similar results were also obtained for BMI and albumin levels (P < 0.05). Moreover, according to PG-SGA scores, fewer patients in the Episil group were malnourished and more patients were well-nourished (P < 0.05) compared with the control group. Conclusion(s): Episil effectively improved OM and malnutrition in HNC patients who received RT and has a good clinical application value.Â© Copyright Â© 2021 Wei, Wu, Wang, Wang, Zhao, Meng, Dong and Jiang.",Excluded
3147,"Patterns of relapse in patients with high grade glioma receiving combined treatments including stereotactic re-irradiation for a first relapse. Purpose Bevacizumab and stereotactic treatment are efficient combined or alone in relapse glioma. However, patterns of relapse after this kind of salvage treatment have never been studied. The purpose of this unicentric retrospective analysis was to assess and understand the patterns of relapse of high grade glioma treated with stereotactic radiation, with or without bevacizumab. Patients and methods Twenty patients with high grade glioma relapse received a stereotactic radiation; among them two patients received temozolomide and eight patients received bevacizumab; among the latter, four received also irinotecan. We matched the stereotactic radiation treatment planning scan with the images of the first treatment and of the second relapse in order to determine the patterns of failure and associate dosimetric profile. Results For the total population, median follow-up from the first diagnosis and relapse were 46.1 and 17.6 months, respectively. Among the 13 patients who relapsed, ten did not receive chemotherapy and three received it (P < 0.05), two received temozolomide and one bevacizumab. Patients who received bevacizumab had no ""out-of-field"" recurrences. Among the 32 irradiated relapses, 15 were ""in-field"" recurrences; among them two were treated with bevacizumab and 13 were not (P < 0.05). For the 32 lesions, a favourable prognostic factor of control was the association of a high-dose of irradiation and the use of bevacizumab. Conclusion For patients with relapsed high grade glioma, local control was higher with combined bevacizumab and high-dose stereotactic radiation.Copyright Â© 2016",Excluded
2145,"New and evolving concepts in CT for abdominal vascular imaging. Computed tomographic (CT) angiography has become the standard of care, supplanting invasive angiography for comprehensive initial evaluation of acute and chronic conditions affecting the vascular system in the abdomen and elsewhere. Over the past decade, the capabilities of CT have improved substantially; simultaneously, the expectations of the referring physician and vascular surgeons have also evolved. Increasingly, CT angiography is used as an imaging biomarker for treatment selection and assessment of effectiveness. However, the growing use of CT angiography has also introduced some challenges, as potential radiation-associated and contrast media-induced risks need to be addressed. These concerns can be partly confronted by modifying scanning parameters (applying a low tube voltage) with or without using software-based solutions. Most recently, multienergy technology has endowed CT with new capabilities offering improved CT angiographic image quality and novel plaque characterization while decreasing radiation and iodine dose. In this article, we discuss current and new approaches using both conventional and multienergy CT for studying vascular disease in the abdomen. We propose various approaches to overcoming commonly encountered image quality challenges in CT angiography. In addition, we describe supplemental strategies for improving patient safety that leverage the available technology.Copyright Â©RSNA, 2014.",Excluded

There is a statistically significant relationship between the extent of surgery and the local control (19.4% of relapse after complete resection vs. 41.2% of relapse after partial resection or biopsy, p= 0.0001). Mediastinal radiation dose (>=50. Gy) had a significant effect in decreasing recurrence (p= 0.0001) and distant metastasis (p= 0.011). The rates of local recurrence (30%) and distant metastasis (25%) justify recommending a higher dose of mediastinal radiation (>=50. Gy) for patients with malignant thymoma. Â© 2012.",Excluded
3616,"Long-term pain outcomes for recurrent idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia after stereotactic radiosurgery: A prospective comparison of first-time microvascular decompression and repeat stereotactic radiosurgery. OBJECTIVE Microvascular decompression (MVD) and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) are common surgical treatments for trigeminal neuralgia (TN). Many patients who receive SRS have pain recurrence; the ideal second intervention is unknown. The authors directly compared pain outcomes after MVD and repeat SRS in a population of patients in whom SRS failed as their first-line procedure for TN, and they identified predictors of pain control. METHODS The authors reviewed a prospectively collected database of patients undergoing surgery for TN between 1997 and 2014 at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Standardized data collection focused on preoperative clinical characteristics, surgical characteristics, and postoperative outcomes. Patients with typical type 1, idiopathic TN with >= 1 year of follow-up were included. RESULTS In total, 168 patients underwent SRS as their first procedure. Of these patients, 90 had residual or recurrent pain. Thirty of these patients underwent a second procedure at UCSF and had >= 1 year of follow-up; 15 underwent first-time MVD and 15 underwent repeat SRS. Patients undergoing MVD were younger than those receiving repeat SRS and were more likely to receive >= 80 Gy during the initial SRS. The average follow-up was 44.9 +/- 33.6 months for MVD and 48.3 +/- 45.3 months for SRS. All patients achieved complete pain freedom without medication at some point during their follow-up. At last follow-up, 80% of MVD-treated patients and 33.3% of SRS-treated patients had a favorable outcome, defined as Barrow Neurological Institute Pain Intensity scores of I-IIIa (p < 0.05). Percentages of patients with favorable outcome at 1 and 5 years were 86% and 75% for the MVD cohort and 73% and 27% for the SRS cohort, respectively (p < 0.05). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis demonstrated that performing MVD was statistically significantly associated with favorable outcome (HR 0.12, 95% CI 0.02-0.60, p < 0.01). There were no statistically significant predictors of favorable outcome in the MVD cohort; however, the presence of sensory changes after repeat SRS was associated with pain relief (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Patients who received MVD after failed SRS had a longer duration of favorable outcome compared to those who received repeat SRS; however, both modalities are safe and effective. The presence of post-SRS sensory changes was predictive of a favorable pain outcome in the SRS cohort.Copyright Â©AANS 2019.",Excluded
3312,"A study of lipid peroxide-induced damage and of ultrastructure of lens epithelial cells in lens organ culture in vitro. OBJECTIVE: To understand the mechanism of the rabbit lens damage from lipid peroxidation (LPO) involved in cataract development.

1780,"Combining paratransgenesis with SIT: impact of ionizing radiation on the DNA copy number of Sodalis glossinidius in tsetse flies. BACKGROUND: Tsetse flies (Diptera: Glossinidae) are the cyclical vectors of the causative agents of African Trypanosomosis, which has been identified as a neglected tropical disease in both humans and animals in many regions of sub-Saharan Africa. The sterile insect technique (SIT) has shown to be a powerful method to manage tsetse fly populations when used in the frame of an area-wide integrated pest management (AW-IPM) program. To date, the release of sterile males to manage tsetse fly populations has only been implemented in areas to reduce transmission of animal African Trypanosomosis (AAT). The implementation of the SIT in areas with Human African Trypanosomosis (HAT) would require additional measures to eliminate the potential risk associated with the release of sterile males that require blood meals to survive and hence, might contribute to disease transmission. Paratransgenesis offers the potential to develop tsetse flies that are refractory to trypanosome infection by modifying their associated bacteria (Sodalis glossinidius) here after referred to as Sodalis. Here we assessed the feasibility of combining the paratransgenesis approach with SIT by analyzing the impact of ionizing radiation on the copy number of Sodalis and the vectorial capacity of sterilized tsetse males., RESULTS: Adult Glossina morsitans morsitans that emerged from puparia irradiated on day 22 post larviposition did not show a significant decline in Sodalis copy number as compared with non-irradiated flies. Conversely, the Sodalis copy number was significantly reduced in adults that emerged from puparia irradiated on day 29 post larviposition and in adults irradiated on day 7 post emergence. Moreover, irradiating 22-day old puparia reduced the copy number of Wolbachia and Wigglesworthia in emerged adults as compared with non-irradiated controls, but the radiation treatment had no significant impact on the vectorial competence of the flies., CONCLUSION: Although the radiation treatment significantly reduced the copy number of some tsetse fly symbionts, the copy number of Sodalis recovered with time in flies irradiated as 22-day old puparia. This recovery offers the opportunity to combine a paratransgenesis approach - using modified Sodalis to produce males refractory to trypanosome infection - with the release of sterile males to minimize the risk of disease transmission, especially in HAT endemic areas. Moreover, irradiation did not increase the vector competence of the flies for trypanosomes.",Excluded
1685,"Methods for assessing forward and backward light scatter in patients with cataract. PURPOSE: To compare objective methods for assessing backward and forward light scatter and psychophysical tests in patients with cataracts., SETTING: Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom., DESIGN: Prospective case series., METHODS: This study included patients scheduled for cataract surgery. Lens opacities were grouped into predominantly nuclear sclerotic, cortical, posterior subcapsular, and mixed cataracts. Backward light scatter was assessed using a rotating Scheimpflug imaging technique (Pentacam HR), forward light scatter using a straylight meter (C-Quant), and straylight using the double-pass method (Optical Quality Analysis System, point-spread function [PSF] meter). The results were correlated with visual acuity under photopic conditions as well as photopic and mesopic contrast sensitivity., RESULTS: The study comprised 56 eyes of 56 patients. The mean age of the 23 men and 33 women was 71 years (range 48 to 84 years). Two patients were excluded. Of the remaining, 15 patients had predominantly nuclear sclerotic cataracts, 13 had cortical cataracts, 11 had posterior subcapsular cataracts, and 15 had mixed cataracts. Correlations between devices were low. The highest correlation was between PSF meter measurements and Scheimpflug measurements (r = 0.32). The best correlation between corrected distance visual acuity was with the PSF meter (r = 0.45)., CONCLUSIONS: Forward and backward light-scatter measurements cannot be used interchangeably. Scatter as an aspect of quality of vision was independent of acuity. Measuring forward light scatter with the straylight meter can be a useful additional tool in preoperative decision-making.

PURPOSE: Accelerated hypofractionated radiation therapy (AHRT) is increasingly used for select lung cancer patients. We evaluated clinical outcomes and predictors of pulmonary/esophageal toxicity in patients treated with >=52.5 Gy in 15 fractions., METHODS AND MATERIALS: We evaluated 229 patients treated with radiation therapy doses >=52.5 Gy in 15 fractions for non-small cell lung cancer from January 2009 through January 2016. Toxicity was scored using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, v4.0. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of toxicity. Overall survival, progression-free survival, and local control were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Predictors of clinical outcome were modeled using Cox proportional hazards regression., RESULTS: Median follow-up was 7 months. Forty-two patients (19%) developed grade >=2 pneumonitis, and 9 (4%) developed grade >=3 esophagitis. In multivariate analysis, age >75 years (odds ratio [OR], 2.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24-5.25; P = .01) and percentage of lung volume receiving doses of >10 Gy higher than 32% were associated with grade >=2 pneumonitis (OR, 2.79; 95% CI, 1.39-5.79; P = .005).

A retrospective review is presented on 145 patients who underwent limb-sparing surgery and radiation therapy (with or without adjuvant chemotherapy) for their primary soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities on protocol between 1975 and 1986. The focus on our analysis was the acute and long term toxicity of treatment on limb function. The most common acute complication was skin reaction, occurring in 52 patients (36%). Long term (occurring after more than 1 year following all treatment) treatment complications in the extremity were as follows: bone fracture = 6%; contracture = 20%; pain requiring narcotics = 7%; edema greater than 2+ = 19%; moderate to severe decrease in range of motion = 32%; moderate to severe decrease in manual muscle strength = 20%; orthotic device required = 9%; cane or crutch required = 7%; chronic infection = 9%; and tissue induration = 57%. Three amputations for treatment complications were required. Inclusion of more than 50% of the joint in the radiation portal was associated with a higher frequency of contracture. High nominal standard dose (greater than 1760 rets, greater than 63 Gy at 1.8 Gy per fraction) resulted in more painful limbs as well as limbs with increased edema, decreased manual muscle strength, decreased range of motion, and skin telangiectasias. Edema was more often noted in patients with a longer radiation portal (greater than 35 cm), as was tissue induration. Chronic ulcer or infection was more frequently seen in patients with lower extremity tumors and when more than 75% of the extremity diameter was irradiated. Although chemotherapy given concurrent with radiation therapy was associated with a higher number of acute skin reactions, this did not appear to translate into increased long term morbidity. The percentage of patients ambulating without assistive devices and with mild or no pain was 84%. Careful attention to the techniques of radiation therapy may have a significant impact on minimizing acute and long term complications of limb sparing treatment for extremity soft tissue sarcoma.",Excluded
2131,"Inflammatory disease and C-reactive protein in relation to therapeutic ionising radiation exposure in the US Radiologic Technologists. Chronic inflammation underlies many autoimmune diseases, including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and rheumatoid arthritis, also type-2 diabetes and osteoarthritis. Associations have been suggested of high-dose ionising radiation exposure with type-2 diabetes and elevated levels of C-reactive protein, a marker of chronic inflammation. In this analysis we used a proportional hazards model to assess effects of radiotherapy on risks of subsequent inflammatory disease morbidity in 110,368 US radiologic technologists followed from a baseline survey (1983-1989/1994-1998) through 2008. We used a linear model to assess log-transformed C-reactive protein concentration following radiotherapy in 1326 technologists. Relative risk of diabetes increased following radiotherapy (p < 0.001), and there was a borderline significant increasing trend per treatment (p = 0.092). For osteoarthritis there was increased relative risk associated with prior radiotherapy on all questionnaires (p = 0.005), and a significant increasing trend per previous treatment (p = 0.024). No consistent increases were observed for other types of inflammatory disease (hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis) associated with radiotherapy. There was a borderline significant (p = 0.059) increasing trend with dose for C-reactive protein with numbers of prior radiotherapy treatments.

While lowering the radiation dose using a reduced tube potential (kVp) strategy for CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) maintains accuracy for pulmonary embolism detection, there is no data regarding the effect of increased noise from lower kVp on both the accuracy of lung and mediastinum lesion detection in the same patient cohort. This study compares the accuracy and diagnostic confidence of lung nodules and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes detection between low and standard kVp CTPA. The study cohort included 272 CTPA studies acquired at low kVp and 274 studies at standard kVp. Each patient had a routine chest CT acquired within 60 days of the CTPA that served as a reference standard for lung and mediastinum lesions. In additional to the evaluation of image quality, two radiologists independently interpreted lung nodules and mediastinal lymph nodes on CTPA and recorded confidence level for each interpretation. Multivariate models assessed effect of kVp settings on diagnostic accuracy and confidence level in interpretation. Low kVp CTPAs had higher image noise. A significant decrease in the confidence levels for evaluation of mediastinal lymph nodes was observed at low kVp by one of two readers, although there was no significant correlation between accuracy of interpretation and kVp settings for lung and mediastinum lesion detection (adjusted odds ratios = 0.67-1.22, p values >0.2). While increased image noise may decrease the diagnostic confidence of the radiologist, the detection of lung nodules and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes was not compromised.

4514,"Preoperative Prediction of Pathologic Response to Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy in Patients With Esophageal Cancer Using 18F-FDG PET/CT and DW-MRI: A Prospective Multicenter Study. Purpose: Accurate preoperative prediction of pathologic response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) in patients with esophageal cancer could enable omission of esophagectomy in patients with a pathologic complete response (pCR). This study aimed to evaluate the individual and combined value of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography with integrated computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) during and after nCRT to predict pathologic response in patients with esophageal cancer. Methods and Materials: In this multicenter prospective study, patients scheduled to receive nCRT followed by esophagectomy for esophageal cancer underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT and DW-MRI scanning before the start of nCRT, during nCRT, and before esophagectomy. Response to nCRT was based on histopathologic evaluation of the resection specimen. Relative changes in 18F-FDG PET/CT and DW-MRI parameters were compared between patients with pCR and non-pCR groups. Multivariable ridge regression analyses with bootstrapped c-indices were performed to evaluate the individual and combined value of 18F-FDG PET/CT and DW-MRI. Result(s): pCR was found in 26.1% of 69 patients. Relative changes in 18F-FDG PET/CT parameters after nCRT (DELTA standardized uptake value [SUV]mean,post P = .016, and DELTA total lesion glycolysis post P = .024), as well as changes in DW-MRI parameters during nCRT (DELTA apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC]during P = .008) were significantly different between pCR and non-pCR. A c-statistic of 0.84 was obtained for a model with DELTAADCduring, DELTASUVmean,post, and histology in classifying patients as pCR (versus 0.82 for DELTAADCduring and 0.79 for DELTASUVmean,post alone). Conclusion(s): Changes on 18F-FDG PET/CT after nCRT and early changes on DW-MRI during nCRT can help identify pCR to nCRT in esophageal cancer. Moreover, 18F-FDG PET/CT and DW-MRI might be of complementary value in the assessment of pCR.Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
4121,"Multifaceted applications of pre-mature chromosome condensation in radiation biodosimetry. Background: Biodosimetry with persistent cytogenetic indicators in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) plays crucial role in regulatory/medical management of individuals overexposed to radiation. Conventional methods require ~48 h culture and have limited dose range (0.1-5Gy) applications due to checkpoint arrest/poor stimulation. G0-Phase Premature chromosome condensation (G0-PCC) allows chromosome aberration analysis within hours after blood collection. Due to high skill demand, applications of G0-PCC were not very well explored and being re-visited worldwide. Among all aberrations, analysis of excess chromosomal fragments is quickest. Radiation dose response curve for the fragments has been reported. Purpose(s): In present study, excess fragment analysis has been addressed in detail, in addition to validation of radiation dose response curve, gender variation in the response, dose dependent repair kinetics, minimum detection limit (MDL), duration and accuracy of final dose estimation with 5blindfolded, ex vivo irradiated samples have been studied. In extension, feasibility of multiparametric dosimetry with Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) based endpoints were qualitatively explored. Material(s) and Method(s): PBLs were exposed to Gamma-Radiation and G0-PCC was performed at different time points. Decay kinetics and dose response curve were established. Gender Variation of the frequency of the fragments was assessed at 0, 2 and 4 Gy. FISH was performed with G0-PCC applying centromere probe, whole chromosome paints, multi-color FISH and multi-color banding probes. Result(s): Radiation response curve for fragments was found to be linear (Slope 1.09 +/- 0.031 Gy-1). Background frequency as well as dose response did not show significant gender bias. Based on variation in background frequency of fragments MDL was calculated to be ~0.3 Gy. Kinetics of fragment tested at 0, 4, 8, 16 and 24 h showed exponential decay pattern from 0 to 8 h and without further decay. Final dose estimation of five samples was completed within 13 man-hours. Dicentric chromosomes, translocations, insertions and breaks were identifiable in combination with centromere FISH and WCP. Advanced methods employing multicolor FISH and multi-color banding were also demonstrated with PCC spreads. Conclusion(s): G0-PCC, can be useful tool for high dose biodosimetry with quick assessment of fragment frequency. Further, it holds potential for multi-parametric dosimetry in combination with FISH.Â© Copyright Â© 2020 Taylor & Francis Group LLC.",Included

The mean ISQ value on the 3rd month (secondary stability) after placement for all implants was 65 (SD 5.55). An ISQ value >=65 was observed in 65 implants (78.82%) after 3 months of placement. Differences between primary and secondary mean ISQ values were statistically significant (p < 0.001). The one year cumulative success rate was 98.3% for tested and inserted oral implants. Conclusion(s): The results of presented study demonstrates and suggests that the influence and reliability of Osstell ISQ values, measured immediately and 3 months after placement it's predictable for the oral implant outcomes, especially analyzing the sensibility of secondary RFA values.Copyright Â© 2018, Peytchinski, Gospodin Iliev ET.

1329,"Set-up of an infrared fast behavioral assay using zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae, and its application in compound biotoxicity screening. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is increasingly employed for evaluating toxicity and drug discovery assays. Commonly experimental approaches for biotoxicity assessment are based on visual inspection or video recording. However, these techniques are limited for large-scale assays, as they demand either a time-consuming detailed inspection of the animals or intensive computing resources in order to analyze a considerable amount of screenshots. Recently, we have developed a simple methodology for tracking the locomotor activity of small animals cultured in microtiter plates. In this work, we implemented this automatic methodology, based on infrared (IR) microbeam scattering, for measuring behavioral activity in zebrafish larvae. We determined the appropriate culture conditions, number of animals and stage of development to get robust results. Furthermore, we validated this methodology as a rapid test for evaluating toxicity. By measuring the effects of reference compounds on larvae activity, we were able to estimate the concentration that could cause a 50% decrease in activity events values (AEC50), showing a strong linear correlation (R2 = 0.91) with the LC50 values obtained with the standard DarT test. The toxicity order of the measured compounds was CuSO4 > 2,4-dinitrophenol > 3,4-dichloroaniline > SDS > sodium benzoate > EDTA > K2CrO4 ; regarding solvents, EtOH = DMSO. In this study, we demonstrate that global swimming behavior could be a simple readout for toxicity, easy to scale-up in automated experiments. This approach is potentially applicable for fast ecotoxicity assays and whole-organism high-throughput compound screening, reducing the time and money required to evaluate unknown samples and to identify leading pharmaceutical compounds.

3671,"Dosimetric predictors of radiation-induced lung injury in stereotactic body radiation therapy. Materials and methods. The aim was to retrospectively investigate correlations between potential predictive parameters and the occurrence of radiation-induced lung injury in patients with primary or secondary lung tumours treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). Sixty patients (63 tumours) underwent SBRT, with a dose of 45 Gy in 3 fractions over 5 days or 26 Gy in single fraction. The following parameters were tested for correlation with Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) lung toxicity score: planning target volume (PTV), tumour location, primary vs. metastatic tumour, and Mean Lung Dose (in 2 Gy fractions, MLD2). Normal Tissue Complication Probability (NTCP) values were then estimated. Results. The median follow-up time was 30.9 months (range 6.756.7). RTOG grade 01 toxicity was observed in 54/63 (85.7%) and grade 23 in 9/63 (14.3%) cases. Mean values of MLD2 for RTOG grade 01 and 23 were respectively 11.2 Gy (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 10.112.3 Gy) and 20.3 Gy (95% CI 16.623.9 Gy). NTCP mean values for RTOG grade 01 and 23 were respectively 4% (95% CI 25.9%) and 37% (95% CI 11.662.3%). Univariate analysis, performed with t-Student test, showed a statistically significant difference between MLD2 values in the two groups (t = 5.93 and p <= 0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed a good correlation between MLD2 and toxicity scores 23 (p = 0.008, odds ratio 1.5). From logistic regression relationship between the observed rates of grade 23 and MLD2, a D50=19.8 Gy and a 50=2.2 were obtained. From the sigmoid-shaped dose-response relationship between NTCP and MLD2, a D50=22.4 Gy and 50=2.2 were derived. Discussion. MLD2 is strongly associated to the risk of lung injury. Higher NTCP values are associated with a higher risk, but when comparing the expected to the observed toxicity rate, NTCP seems to underestimate the risk.",Excluded
1136,"Dosimetric predictors of xerostomia for head-and-neck cancer patients treated with the smart (simultaneous modulated accelerated radiation therapy) boost technique. PURPOSE: To evaluate the predictors of xerostomia in the treatment of head-and-neck cancers treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), using the simultaneous modulated accelerated radiation therapy (SMART) boost technique. Dosimetric parameters of the parotid glands are correlated to subjective salivary gland function., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 1996 and June 2000, 30 patients with at least 6 months follow-up were evaluated for subjective xerostomia after being treated definitively for head-and-neck cancer with the SMART boost technique. Threshold limits for the ipsilateral and contralateral parotid glands were 35 Gy and 25 Gy, respectively. Dosimetric parameters to the parotid glands were evaluated. The median follow-up time was 38.5 months (mean 39.9 months). The results of the dosimetric parameters and questionnaire were statistically correlated., RESULTS: Xerostomia was assessed with a 10-question subjective salivary gland function questionnaire. The salivary gland function questionnaire (questions 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9) correlated significantly with the dosimetric parameters (mean and maximum doses and volume and percent above tolerance) of the parotid glands. These questions related to overall comfort, eating, and abnormal taste. Questions related to thirst, difficulty with speech or sleep, and the need to carry water daily did not correlate statistically with the dosimetric parameters of the parotid glands., CONCLUSIONS: Questions regarding overall comfort, eating, and abnormal taste correlated significantly with the dosimetric parameters of the parotid glands. Questions related to thirst, difficulty with speech or sleep, and the need to carry water daily did not correlate statistically with the dosimetric parameters of the parotid glands. Dosimetric sparing of the parotid glands improved subjective xerostomia. IMRT in the treatment of head-and-neck cancer can be exploited to preserve the parotid glands and decrease xerostomia. This is feasible even with an accelerated treatment regimen like the SMART boost. More patients need to be evaluated using IMRT to identify relevant dosimetric parameters.",Excluded

4936,"Low dose ionizing radiation exposure and cardiovascular disease mortality: cohort study based on Canadian national dose registry of radiation workers. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of our study was to assess the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in a Canadian cohort of 337 397 individuals (169 256 men and 168 141 women) occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation and included in the National Dose Registry (NDR) of Canada. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation, such as those received during radiotherapy, leads to increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. The emerging evidence of excess risk of CVDs after exposure to doses well below those previously considered as safe warrants epidemiological studies of populations exposed to low levels of ionizing radiation. In the present study, the cohort consisted of employees at nuclear power stations (nuclear workers) as well as medical, dental and industrial workers. The mean whole body radiation dose was 8.6 mSv for men and 1.2 mSv for women. RESULT(S): During the study period (1951-1995), as many as 3 533 deaths from cardiovascular diseases have been identified (3 018 among men and 515 among women). In the cohort, CVD mortality was significantly lower than in the general population of Canada. The cohort showed a significant dose response both among men and women. Risk estimates of CVD mortality in the NDR cohort, when expressed as excess relative risk per unit dose, were higher than those in most other occupational cohorts and higher than in the studies of Japanese atomic bomb survivors. CONCLUSION(S): The study has demonstrated a strong positive association between radiation dose and the risk of CVD mortality. Caution needs to be exercised when interpreting these results, due to the potential bias introduced by dosimetry uncertainties, the possible record linkage errors, and especially by the lack of adjustment for non-radiation risk factors.",Included
3666,"A tumor growth inhibition model for low-grade glioma treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Purpose: To develop a tumor growth inhibition model for adult diffuse low-grade gliomas (LGG) able to describe tumor size evolution in patients treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Experimental Design: Using longitudinal mean tumor diameter (MTD) data from 21 patients treated with first-line procarbazine, 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-l-nitrosourea, and vincristine (PCV) chemotherapy, we formulated a model consisting of a system of differential equations, incorporating tumorspecific and treatment-related parameters that reflect the response of proliferative and quiescent tumor tissue to treatment. The model was then applied to the analysis of longitudinal tumor size data in 24 patients treated with first-line temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy and in 25 patients treated with first-line radiotherapy. Result(s): The model successfully described the MTD dynamics of LGG before, during, and after PCV chemotherapy. Using the same model structure, we were also able to successfully describe the MTD dynamics inLGGpatients treated withTMZchemotherapy or radiotherapy. Tumor-specific parameters were found to be consistent across the three treatment modalities. The model is robust to sensitivity analysis, and preliminary results suggest that it can predict treatment response on the basis of pretreatment tumor size data. Conclusion(s): UsingMTDdata, we propose a tumor growth inhibition model able to describeLGGtumor size evolution in patients treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy. In the future, this model might be used to predict treatment efficacy in LGG patients and could constitute a rational tool to conceive more effective chemotherapy schedules. Â©2012 AACR.",Excluded

To evaluate the treatment outcome of radiotherapy for nodal recurrence after definitive chemoradiotherapy for esophageal carcinoma. Methods. Between 1996 and 2001, ten patients with isolated nodal recurrence after definitive chemoradiotherapy received radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. The site of recurrence was the mediastinum in five patients, the celiac node in four patients, and the supraclavicular fossa in one patient. All sites of nodal recurrence were outside the previous irradiated area and without local recurrence or distant metastases. Radiotherapy was given with three-dimensional conformal technique, and an average total dose was 60 Gy. Eight patients received chemotherapy concurrently with radiotherapy. Chemotherapy consisted of two cycles of cisplatin and 5-FU. Results. The control rate of the irradiated region was eight of ten patients. The size of all controlled lesions was 3 cm or less in diameter. In five patients, distant metastases developed to other organs and caused death. Two patients survived without disease for 5 years and three patients survived 2 years or more. In four patients with an interval of 2 years or longer between the previous treatment and nodal recurrence, three patients survived without disease. Improvement of clinical symptoms such as dysphagia or hoarseness was obtained in five of six patients. Conclusions. Radiotherapy for isolated nodal recurrence of esophageal carcinoma after definitive chemoradiotherapy is suggested to be safe and effective. This treatment is promising as well as palliative.

3681,"Magnetic resonance imaging of musculoskeletal neoplasms. MRI has been shown to be very useful in the work-up of musculoskeletal neoplasms. The lack of ionizing radiation, the superb contrast resolution, and the ability to directly scan the sagittal and coronal planes make MRI a very attractive imaging mode for treatment planning. With spin-echo MRI, maximum contrast between tumor and fatty tissues generally occurs with short TR and TE times (T1-weighted images). Likewise, maximum contrast between tumor and muscle, tendon, or ligaments occurs with long values of TR and TE (T2-weighted images). Early experience suggests that the already exceptional contrast resolution seen with MRI can be improved even more with the administration of intravenous contrast agents. Just as with CT, fatty tumors can usually be easily distinguished from other tissue types with MRI by means of their differential intensity behavior at different pulse sequences. Fluid-filled tumors, such as unicameral bone cysts or aneurysmal bone cysts may be suspected in the same manner, especially if a fluid-fluid level is seen within the lesion. Otherwise, MRI has not been useful so far in noninvasively determining the histologic type of tumors. Our experience and that of others suggests that MRI is equal or superior to CT in the work-up of musculoskeletal neoplasms. This is especially striking when it is remembered that one is comparing an immature MRI technology with a mature CT technology. Although CT presently has a central role in the staging of musculoskeletal tumors, MRI will shortly supplant it in many cases.",Excluded
3156,"Comparing outcomes of stereotactic body radiotherapy with intensity-modulated radiotherapy for patients with locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer. OBJECTIVES: Survival in patients with locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer (LAUPC) is poor, and local recurrence continues to be a major problem in the management of this disease. Radiotherapy (RT) using different RT techniques, including intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), may lead to different clinical outcomes for patients with LAUPC. Here, we compared SBRT with IMRT for patients with LAUPC with respect to survival rate, local control (LC) rate, and toxicity-related dose distribution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study from March 2007 to March 2011 included 41 patients with LAUPC who were divided into two groups, with 20 patients receiving SBRT and 21 patients receiving IMRT. The median follow-up time was 16 months. RESULT(S): For the IMRT and SBRT groups, the median survival times were 13 and 20 months, and 1-year overall survival (OS) rates were 70.7 and 80.0%, respectively. There was no difference in OS between the two RT techniques. RT with SBRT showed significantly better local disease-free survival than IMRT for patients with LAUPC. Tobacco use had a borderline effect on LC. Thus, further statistical analysis showed that patients who used tobacco had better LC after receiving SBRT than IMRT. CONCLUSION(S): SBRT improved LC for LAUPC patients and had similar radiation toxicity compared with IMRT. Further study is required to define the effects of administered radiation dose and fractionation, as well as to further expand the sample size, to use a prospective study, and to observe the long-term efficacy of these techniques..Copyright Â© 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

4865,"Induction chemotherapy with cisplatin and ifosfamide in locally advanced inoperable squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: A single-institution experience. BACKGROUND: Induction chemotherapy (ICT) in patients with head and neck cancer has been studied since a long time. The addition of taxanes to the cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5FU) (PF) regimen results in superior antitumor activity. We did this study to see the response and toxicity of ICT with cisplatin and ifosfamide followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in locally advanced, unresectable squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN). AIMS: The aim of this study was to see the results of ICT using cisplatin and ifosfamide regimen in locally advanced unresectable SCCHN in terms of acute and chronic toxicity and response to treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with Stage III and IV, nonmetastatic SCCHN were enrolled in the study. They were given two cycles of ICT with cisplatin and ifosfamide followed by CRT. RESULT(S): After ICT, the overall response rate (ORR) was 75.0% at the primary site and 70.0% at the nodal site. ORR for combined primary and nodal disease was observed to be 67.5%. The complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) for combined primary and nodal site were seen in 4 (10.0%) and 23 (57.5%) patients. Of 32 patients who received CRT after ICT, CR was 53.1% and PR was 31.3%. Mucositis, skin reaction, and pharyngeal and laryngeal toxicities were the most common but tolerable. CONCLUSION(S): ICT with cisplatin and ifosfamide gives comparable results to the standard paclitaxel, PF regimen. We conclude that this combination regimen for ICT is not only an economical alternative of taxol-based regimen but also well tolerated by the patients.Copyright Â© 2017 Indian Journal of Cancer.",Excluded
1006,"Initial evaluation of safety of wide-field irradiation in the treatment of hematopoietic neoplasia in the cat. Localized radiation therapy is well tolerated in cats with confined tumors; however, the use of wide-field radiation therapy to treat disseminated neoplasia has not been evaluated systematically in this species. Wide-field external beam radiation therapy, which we define as irradiation of cranial or caudal halves of the body either individually or sequentially, was undertaken as an experimental option to treat cats with either chemotherapy-refractory or naive hematopoietic neoplasia considered to have a poor prognosis. Fifteen cats with hematopoietic malignancies received wide-field external beam radiation therapy between 2003 and 2006. Cats received 8Gy delivered in 4Gy fractions with 60Co photons. Treatment-related toxicity was scored according to criteria established by the Veterinary Cooperative Oncology Group. Animals without preexisting abnormalities on hemograms exhibited no or mild (Grade 1 or 2) hematopoietic toxicity. Although most cats (14 of 15) had preexisting gastrointestinal (GI) signs, these signs were stable (29%) or improved (42%) following irradiation. Worsening GI signs following irradiation occurred transiently in two cats and in association with progressive disease in two others. No pulmonary, renal, hepatic, or dermatologic toxicities were detected. In summary, wide-field external beam radiation therapy can be administered safely to, and may provide therapeutic benefit for, cats with disseminated hematopoietic neoplasia.

We conducted a phase I trial to examine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of the oral protease inhibitor nelfinavir (NFV) in combination with temozolomide and concurrent radiotherapy in patients with glioblastoma and to gather preliminary data for response. The study was conducted in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma after surgical resection. Patients were treated with standard radiotherapy (6,000 cGy to the gross tumor volume), temozolomide (75 mg/m2 daily) together with daily oral NFV starting 7-10 days prior to chemoradiotherapy continuing for the duration of chemoradiation for 6 weeks. Temozolomide (150-200 mg/m2) was resumed 4 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy. Two dose levels of NFV were investigated: 625 mg twice daily (bid) and 1,250 mg bid in a cohort escalation design. A total of 21 patients were enrolled. At the maximum tolerated dose, 18 subjects were enrolled to further evaluate toxicity and for preliminary estimate of efficacy for further phase II study. No dose-limiting toxicity was noted at 625 mg bid. At 1,250 mg bid, 3 dose-limiting episodes of hepatotoxicity were noted and one dose-limiting episode of diarrhea. The MTD for this study was 1,250 mg bid. NFV (1,250 mg bid) concurrent with temozolomide and radiotherapy is tolerated in most patients with glioblastoma. At the 1,250 mg bid dose level, patients should be monitored for hepatotoxicity and GI side effects. Â© 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Excluded

Introduction: Total Hip replacement (THR) is considered an effective surgical intervention for the relief of chronic pain and functional disability. However, a proportion of patients experience a poor outcome. Leg length discrepancy (LLD) can be introduced, or not corrected, at the time of operation. Previous research has shown that patients with LLD reported a lower functional outcome than those with equal leg lengths. We report on a cohort of 146 patients with a minimum of 3-year follow-up who underwent cemented total hip replacement. We have compared the data when looking at independent variables including age, sex, BMI, femoral head size, offset of stem, grade of surgeon, surgical approach and cup type. Material(s) and Method(s): 146 patients were followed up for a mean of 3.66 years (range 3.25-4.5 years). There were 96 females and 45 males. The mean age at surgery was 77 years (range 50-95 years). All patients were reviewed in clinic or contacted by postal survey for assessment of function and satisfaction. The pre-operative X-rays were compared with early post-operative X-rays. LLD was assessed radiologically according to the method of Woolson, as modified by Konyves and Bannister, on plain sequential AP pelvis radiographs by 2 independent observers. Result(s): Mean LLD was 2 mm (range -10 mm to +14 mm). No significant association was found for the above independent variables. The overall stem alignment was satisfactory. A non-significant reduction in function (measured by oxford hip score, SF- 12 and satisfaction score) was noted in association with LLD of greater than 5 mm. Discussion(s): We report radiological LLD after cemented THR. This has previously been reported as being linked to function. We found a non-significant correlation between reported function and satisfaction with LLD. However 94% of our observed limb lengths were within 1 cm of the other side.

We report the safety, biodistribution, and internal radiation dosimetry profiles of (18)F-ICMT-11 in 8 healthy human volunteers., METHODS: (18)F-ICMT-11 was intravenously administered as a bolus injection (mean +/- SD, 159 +/- 2.75 MBq; range, 154-161 MBq) to 8 healthy volunteers (4 men, 4 women). Whole-body (vertex to mid thigh) PET/CT scans were acquired at 6 time points, up to 4 h after tracer injection. Serial whole blood, plasma, and urine samples were collected for radioactivity measurement and radiotracer stability. In vivo (18)F activities were determined from quantitative analysis of the images, and time-activity curves were generated. The total numbers of disintegrations in each organ normalized to injected activity (residence times) were calculated as the area under the curve of the time-activity curve, normalized to injected activities and standard values of organ volumes. Dosimetry calculations were then performed using OLINDA/EXM 1.1., RESULTS: Injection of (18)F-ICMT-11 was well tolerated in all subjects, with no serious tracer-related adverse events reported. The mean effective dose averaged over both men and women was estimated to be 0.025 +/- 0.004 mSv/MBq (men, 0.022 +/- 0.004 mSv/MBq; women, 0.027 +/- 0.004 mSv/MBq). The 5 organs receiving the highest absorbed dose (mGy/MBq), averaged over both men and women, were the gallbladder wall (0.59 +/- 0.44), small intestine (0.12 +/- 0.05), upper large intestinal wall (0.08 +/- 0.07), urinary bladder wall (0.08 +/- 0.02), and liver (0.07 +/- 0.01). Elimination was both renal and via the hepatobiliary system., CONCLUSION: (18)F-ICMT-11 is a safe PET tracer with a dosimetry profile comparable to other common (18)F PET tracers.

1132,"Breaking bad: Chromothripsis and malignancy in CNS tumors. Chromothripsis is a relatively novel form of genomic instability reported in a wide range of neoplasms [1, 2] and refers to shattering of a chromosome or part of a chromosome with subsequent segmental gene rearrangements in large numbers. It is currently thought to represent a single catastrophic breakage event leading to additional tumorigenesis. This is in contradistinction to the more well-delineated forms of genomic instability characterized by incremental changes. The mechanism by which chromothripsis occurs is not well understood; ionizing radiation, telomere dysfunction, abortive apoptosis, replication stress, and mitotic compaction of incompletely replicated chromosomes have been posited as potential triggers [2]. Generally, chromothripsis is linked to poorer prognosis [1]. With increased availability of advanced cytogenomic molecular assays, and growing recognition of the importance of molecular and genomic classification particularly of central nervous system neoplasms, an ever-increasing amount of molecular data becomes available. Here we report on a group of CNS neoplasms (primary and metastatic) in which cytogenomic analysis revealed chromothripsis. This cohort consists of 9 cases identified over a 7-month period. All cases were considered high-grade malignant neoplasms. Six of the cases (67%) represented primary CNS neoplasms consisting of glioblastoma (4), anaplastic pilocytic astrocytoma (1), and an atypical meningioma (1). The remaining cases (3) were metastases: melanoma, uterine sarcoma, and lung adenocarcinoma. The age range of patients affected was 27 to 80 years old with a median age of 57. Five of the nine patients (56%) were male, and 4 patients (44%) had passed away already at the time of this study, with a median survival of 4.5 months after surgery. Of note, all but one (89%) of the total patients had received radiation therapy prior to biopsy. From our institutional experience, chromothripsis is an indication of highgrade malignant neoplasms, both primary CNS tumors and metastases, with decreased survival.",Excluded
1802,"Comparison of definite chemoradiation therapy with carboplatin/paclitaxel or cisplatin/5-fluoruracil in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. Background: While neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (nCRT) with subsequent surgery is the treatment of choice for patients with locally advanced or node-positive squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus (SCC) suitable for surgery, patients who are unsuitable for surgery or who refuse surgery should be treated with definite chemoradiation therapy (dCRT). Purpose of this study was to compare toxicity and oncologic outcome of dCRT with either cisplatin and 5-fluoruracil (CDDP/5FU) or carboplatin and paclitaxel (Carb/TAX) in patients with SCC. Method(s): Twenty-two patients who received dCRT with carboplatin (AUC2, weekly) and paclitaxel (50 mg per square meter of body-surface area, weekly) were retrospectively compared to 25 patients who were scheduled for dCRT with cisplatin (20 mg/m2/d) and 5-fluoruracil (500 mg/m2/d) on day 1-5 and day 29-33. For the per-protocol (PP) analysis, PP treatment was defined as complete radiation therapy with at least 54Gy and at least three complete cycles of Carb/TAX or complete radiation therapy with at least 54Gy and at least one complete cycle of CDDP/5FU. While patients who were scheduled for dCRT with Carb/TAX received a significantly higher total radiation dose (median dose 59.4Gy vs. 54Gy, p < 0.001) than patients who were scheduled for dCRT with CDDP/5FU, no significant differences were seen for other parameters (age, sex, TNM-stage, grading and tumor extension). Result(s): Forty-seven patients (25 patients treated with CDDP/5FU and 22 patients treated with Carb/TAX) were evaluated for the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis and 41 of 47 patients (23 patients treated with CDDP/5FU and 18 patients treated with Carb/TAX) were evaluated for the PP analysis. Severe myelotoxicity (>= IIIdegree) was seen in 52% (CDDP/5FU) and 55% of patients (Carb/TAX), respectively (p = 1.000). In the univariate binary logistic regression analysis, patients age was the only factor associated with an increased risk of >= IIIdegree myelotoxicity (hazard ratio 1.145, 95% CI 1.035; 1.266; p = 0.009). Regarding treatment efficiency, no significant differences were seen for overall survival (OS) and freedom from relapse (FFR) between both treatment groups. Conclusion(s): Myelotoxicity and oncologic outcome under dCRT were not different for patients with SCC of the esophagus treated with either CDDP/5FU or Carb/TAX. The putative equivalence of dCRT with Carb/TAX in this setting should be further investigated in prospective trials. However, our data reveal that the risk of significant myelotoxicity increases with patient age and therefore other chemotherapy regimens might be evaluated in elderly patients.Copyright Â© 2018 The Author(s).",Excluded
2428,"Safety of deferred CT imaging of intoxicated patients presenting with possible traumatic brain injury. BACKGROUND: Patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with altered mental status and alcohol intoxication can clinically resemble patients with an intracranial hemorrhage. Although intracranial hemorrhage is quickly excluded with a head computed tomographic (CT) scan, it is common practice to defer imaging and allow the patient to metabolize to spare ED resources and minimize radiation exposure to the patient. Although this reduces unnecessary scans, it may delay treatment in patients with occult intracranial hemorrhage, which some fear may increase morbidity and mortality. We sought to evaluate the safety of deferred CT imaging in these patients by evaluating whether time to scan significantly affects the rate of neurosurgical intervention., METHODS: In this retrospective medical record review, all clinically alcohol-intoxicated patients presenting to 2 university EDs were included. Time to order CT imaging, findings on imaging, and outcomes of these patients were determined. Patients were assessed in 3 groups: CT ordered within 1 hour of triage, CT ordered 1-3 hours from triage, and CT ordered 3 or more hours from triage., RESULTS: During the study period, 5943 patients were included in the study. Of these, 0 patients scanned in less than 3 hours had intracranial findings on imaging requiring neurosurgery, whereas 1 patient with a deferred CT scan required a neurosurgical intervention; however, it was not emergently performed., CONCLUSION: Routine CT scanning of alcohol-intoxicated patients with altered mental status is of low clinical value.

OBJECTIVE: The present study aims to gain knowledge about the dentist's use and choice of digital intraoral imaging methods., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A questionnaire sent to 2481 dentists within the Swedish Dental Society contained questions about the type of X-ray technique used, problems experienced with digital radiography, and reasons for choosing digital technology, and about indications, clinic size and type of service. Response rate was 53%., RESULTS: Ninety-eight percent of the dentists had made the transition to digital radiography; only 2% used film technique, and solid-state detector (SSD) was the most used digital technique. More years in service decreases the likelihood of applying individual indications for performing a full mouth examination. More retakes were done with SSDs compared to storage phosphor plates. Reasons for choosing digital techniques were that work was easier and communication with the patients improved. However, dentists also experienced problems with digital techniques, such as exposure and projection errors and inadequate image quality.

Methods We conducted a retrospective nationwide analysis of 649 932 Crohn's disease (CD), 384 267 ulcerative colitis (UC), and 288 894 297 non-IBD hospitalisations in the US between 1998 and 2010. Mean UV exposure was assigned to each hospitalisation using surface measures from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Relative rates across UV exposures were estimated for IBD hospitalisations, prolonged hospitalisations, bowel surgeries and deaths. Results Among IBD patients, lower UV exposures had increased hospitalisation rates for CD (217.8 vs. 182.5 per 100 000 overall hospitalisations with low and very high UV, respectively; P trend <0.001) and UC (123.2 vs. 113.8 per 100 000; P trend = 0.033). Low UV groups had greater relative rates of prolonged hospitalisations [CD: 1.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-1.19; UC: 1.21, 95% CI 1.13-1.30], bowel surgeries (CD: 1.24, 95% CI 1.16-1.32; UC: 1.21, 95% CI 1.09-1.33), and CD deaths (CD: 1.76, 95% CI 1.14-2.71; UC: 1.24, 95% CI 0.92-1.67). Among non-IBD patients, low UV was associated with prolonged hospitalisations (1.09; 95% CI 1.07-1.11) and deaths (1.13; 95% CI 1.09-1.17), but not bowel surgeries (1.01; 95% CI 0.99-1.03). Conclusions Lower ultraviolet exposure is associated with greater rates of hospitalisation, prolonged hospitalisation and the need for bowel surgery in IBD. This trend for bowel surgery was not seen with non-IBD encounters. Â© 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Excluded
1165,"Clinical outcome of stereotactic body radiotherapy for primary and oligometastatic lung tumors: A single institutional study with almost uniform dose with different five treatment schedules. Background: To evaluate clinical outcomes of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for localized primary and oligometastatic lung tumors by assessing efficacy and safety of 5 regimens of varying fraction size and number. Method(s): One-hundred patients with primary lung cancer (n = 69) or oligometastatic lung tumors (n = 31), who underwent SBRT between May 2003 and August 2010, were included. The median age was 75 years (range, 45-88). Of them, 98 were judged to have medically inoperable disease, predominantly due to chronic illness or advanced age. SBRT was performed using 3 coplanar and 3 non-coplanar fixed beams with a standard linear accelerator. Fraction sizes were escalated by 1 Gy, and number of fractions given was decreased by 1 for every 20 included patients. Total target doses were between 50 and 56 Gy, administered as 5-9 fractions. The prescribed dose was defined at the isocenter, and median overall treatment duration was 10 days (range, 5-22). Result(s): The median follow-up was 51.1 months for survivors. The 3-year local recurrence rates for primary lung cancer and oligometastasis was 6 % and 3 %, respectively. The 3-year local recurrence rates for tumor sizes <=3 cm and >3 cm were 3 % and 14 %, respectively (p = 0.124). Additionally, other factors (fraction size, total target dose, and BED10) were not significant predictors of local control. Radiation pneumonia (>= grade 2) was observed in 2 patients. Radiation-induced rib fractures were observed in 22 patients. Other late adverse events of greater than grade 2 were not observed. Conclusion(s): Within this dataset, we did not observe a dose response in BED10 values between 86.4 and 102.6 Gy. SBRT with doses between 50 and 56 Gy, administered over 5-9 fractions achieved acceptable tumor control without severe complications.Copyright Â© 2016 Aoki et al.",Excluded
4547,"Salivary and serum proteomics in head and neck carcinomas: Before and after surgery and radiotherapy. Several body fluids have been evaluated as new sources for cancer biomarker discovery. In this context, salivary and serum proteomics seem promising diagnostic and predictive tools for head and neck diseases. In the present study, we performed a proteomic analysis of saliva and serum from patients presenting head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and compared the results before and after therapy. In saliva of cancer patients, we observed an altered protein profile, including over-expression of PLUNC and zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein. Both proteins may contribute to control tumor growth and, therefore, represent targets for new analysis. We also detected serotransferrin and a modified transthyretin form with altered levels in serum from patients. Comparing preoperative and postreatment samples, the results showed that the protein profile after treatment reverted to a pattern closer to those observed for controls. These results add information on the role of secreted proteins in the cancer process and emphasize the potential of saliva and serum analysis for diagnosis and monitoring of HNSCC.

4048,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma gene polymorphism in psoriasis and its relation to obesity, metabolic syndrome, and narrowband ultraviolet B response: A case-control study in Egyptian patients. Background: Psoriasis is a common dermatologic disease with multifactorial etiology in which genetic factors play a major role. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma is expressed in keratinocytes and is known to affect cell maturation and differentiation in addition to its role in inflammation. Aim(s): To study the association between PPAR-gamma gene polymorphism and psoriasis vulgaris in Egyptian patients to explore if this polymorphism influenced disease risk or clinical presentation. Method(s): Forty-five patients with psoriasis vulgaris and 45 age, sex and body mass index matched healthy volunteers who have no present, past or family history of psoriasis as a control group were enrolled. Selected cases included obese and nonobese participants. Detection of PPAR-gamma gene polymorphism was done with restriction fragment length polymorphism polymerase chain reaction. Narrow-band ultraviolet B (NBUVB) was given for every case three times/week for 12 weeks. Result(s): Homopolymorphism, heteropolymorphism, and Ala allele were significantly associated with cases (P = 0.01, P = 0.01, and P = 0.004, respectively) and increased risk of occurrence of psoriasis by 5.25, 3.65, and 3.37 folds, respectively. Heteropolymorphism was significantly associated with nonobese cases compared to obese ones (P = 0.01). Ala allele was significantly associated with obese cases (P = 0.001) and increased risk of occurrence of psoriasis in obese participants by 1.14 folds. Homopolymorphism, heteropolymorphism, and Ala allele were more prevalent among obese cases without metabolic syndrome (MS) than obese cases with MS but without statistical significance. Percentage of decrease of mean Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score before and after 3 months of treatment with NBUVB was higher in cases with heteropolymorphism with no significant difference between homo- and heteropolymorphism. Conclusion(s): PPAR-gamma gene polymorphism is associated with and increased the risk of psoriasis and its associated obesity in Egyptian patients. It has no role in NBUVB response in those patients. Future large-scale studies on different populations are recommended.Copyright Â© 2019 Indian Journal of Dermatology Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",Excluded
3339,"Conservative treatment by irradiation of epidermoid cancers of the anal canal: prognostic factors of tumoral control and complications. UNLABELLED: We analyzed in a retrospective series of patients treated by conservative irradiation for an epidermoid cancer of the anal canal (ECAC) the prognostic factors of locoregional control (LRC), survival, late severe complications (LSC), and sphincter conservation (SC)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: From 1976 until 1994, 118 patients presenting with an ECAC were conservatively treated (mean age, 65 years). According to the 1987 International Union Against Cancer (TNM) classification, they were: 19 T1, 70 T2, 22 T3, 7 T4, 94 N0, and 24 N1-3. The treatment started with external beam irradiation (EBI) (36 Gy in 3 weeks or 45 Gy in 5 weeks). Concomitant chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil and mitomycin C) was delivered to 31 patients. Two months later, a boost of 20 Gy was delivered by interstitial 192Ir brachytherapy to 101 patients and EBI in 5. Twelve other patients had an abdominoperineal resection (APR). The mean follow-up was 6 years., RESULTS: At 5 years the overall survival was 60%, and specific survival (SS) was 75%; it was 94% for T1, 79% for T2, 53% for T3, and 19% for T4. In multivariate analysis, tumor size (> or = 4 cm), node involvement, and no response to the EBI were factors of poor prognosis for SS. Thirty-two locoregional recurrences occurred of which 21 were local recurrences in the 106 patients treated by a conservative schedule. Only tumor size and response to the EBI were prognostic factors on multivariate analysis for local and LRC. A total of 17 patients presented with LSC (Grade 3, 16 patients; and Grade 4, 1 patient), which was treated by APR in 4 patients and colostomy in 11 (of which 7 were definitive). The only significant prognostic factor for LSC in the multivariate analysis was the total extrapolated response dose of irradiation. The definitive rate of SC after conservative treatment in cured patients was 100% for T1, 82% for T2, 58% for T3, and 100% for T4. Since 1989, improvements of the technique have allowed reduction of the LSC in maintaining the same local control., CONCLUSION: The results of this series are similar to those of the literature. The confirmation of pretherapeutic prognostic factors related to response to the treatment should allow us to adapt the therapeutic intensity for each case to obtain better tumor control, with as few sequelae as possible, to yield a better rate of SC.",Excluded
2273,"Three- Versus Five-Fraction Regimens of Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Peripheral Early-Stage Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer: A Two-Institution Propensity Score-Matched Analysis. We compared the outcomes of 3- versus 5-fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy regimens for early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer. Analysis was performed on 192 eligible lesions and a propensity score-matched 94 lesion subgroup. There were no statistically significant differences in outcomes between regimens, and both regimens are reasonable treatment options. Purpose(s): To evaluate differences in outcomes of early-stage peripheral non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with either 3- or 5-fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) at 2 institutions. Patients and Methods: Patients diagnosed with peripherally located early-stage NSCLC who received either a median dose of 60 Gy (interquartile range [IQR], 60-60, biologically effective dose, 151-151) in 3 fractions or a median dose of 50 Gy (IQR, 50-50, biologically effective dose, 94-94) in 5 fractions were included in this study. All data were retrospectively collected and reviewed in an institutional review board-approved database. Result(s): A total of 192 lesions in 192 patients were identified: 94 received 3-fraction SBRT and 98 received 5-fraction SBRT. Patients in the 5-fraction cohort had significantly smaller tumors (P =.0021). Larger tumor size was associated with worse overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.40, P =.0013) for all patients. A single grade 3 toxicity was reported in each cohort. A propensity score-matched cohort of 94 patients was constructed with a median follow-up of 29.3 months (IQR, 17.3-44.6) for the 3-fraction cohort and 31.0 months (IQR, 17.0-48.5) for the 5-fraction cohort (P =.84). There were no statistically significant differences between these 2 cohorts in overall survival (P =.33), progression-free survival (P =.40), local failure (P =.86), and nodal or distant failure (P =.57) at 2 years. Conclusion(s): The 3- and 5-fraction SBRT regimens for early-stage peripheral NSCLC had comparable clinical outcomes. Both regimens were well tolerated. A large tumor size was an adverse prognostic factor for worse survival.Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
3227,"Irradiation and free tissue transfer in head and neck cancer. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of surgery, irradiation, and free tissue transfer in locally advanced head and neck cancer patients. Forty-one patients with head and neck cancer were treated with surgery, irradiation, and free tissue transfer for reconstruction from 1977 to 1987. The age range was 38 to 78 years with a median age of 61. Patients were staged using the AJCC (1978) staging system. Eighty-four percent of the patients were in stage III or IV. The common sites of primary tumors were the oral cavity (22) and oropharynx (10). Forty patients had squamous cell carcinoma and 1 patient had basal cell carcinoma. Six patients had preoperative irradiation, and the rest had postoperative irradiation. The most common surgical procedures were partial glossectomy and neck dissection (17 patients) and wide excision of the primary and neck dissection (17 patients). The most common types of free tissue transfer were dorsalis pedis (13 patients) and scapular flaps (6 patients). The primary site was controlled in 22 patients (54%) and the neck in 36 patients (88%). Three patients (7.3%) had flap failure which required further surgical management. Eighteen patients are living with no evidence of disease with a median follow-up of 18 months (5-101 months), 10 patients are living with disease with a median follow-up of 9 months (3-40 months), 9 patients are dead of disease with a median survival of 13 months (6-54 months), and 4 patients are lost for follow-up.

In the period 1993-1997 we performed two phase II pilot studies of first-line chemo-radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced (T4) SCC of the esophagus. The first protocol (3 cycles of DDP-VP16 + 45 Gy) was used in 37 patients: toxicity was not negligible; a clinical tumor downstaging was obtained in 54% of cases; an R0 resection surgery was performed in 40% of patients. The overall median survival of the whole group of 37 patients was 11 months, while it was > 36 months for patients undergoing R0 resection. The second protocol (4 cycles of DDP-5FU + 45 Gy) was used in 25 patients: a clinical tumor downstaging was obtained in 55% of cases, and R0 resection surgery was performed in 45% of patients. The overall median survival of the whole group was 11 months. To date, all patients but one (who died after 13 months) are alive with a median follow up of 13 months. The prognosis of both groups of patients was improved compared to patients with T4 SCC of the esophagus who did not undergo chemo and/or radiotherapy. The survival advantage was especially evident for those who were able to undergo an R0 resection.

3893,"Is routine postoperative chest radiography needed after open nephrectomy?. OBJECTIVES: To assess whether routine postoperative chest radiography (CXR) is required after open nephrectomy for the detection and possible management of a pneumothorax. It has become the standard of care by many urologists to obtain routine postoperative CXRs after open nephrectomy to assess for the presence of a pneumothorax. However, at our institution, very few patients have developed a pneumothorax postoperatively, and, furthermore, the CXR findings almost never affected the clinical management., METHODS: Retrospective data were collected on the last 150 open nephrectomies performed by two urologists at our institution. All laparoscopic nephrectomies and thoracoabdominal nephrectomies were excluded from analysis., RESULTS: A total of 150 patients underwent open nephrectomy between 1998 and 2003. The procedure was performed with an anterior subcostal, 11th rib, 12th rib, midline, and 10th rib incision in 60 (40%), 51 (34%), 18 (12%), 20 (13.3%), and 1 (0.67%) patient, respectively. Of the 150 patients, 92 (61.3%) underwent postoperative CXR and 58 (38.7%) did not. Of the 150 patients, 92 of whom had undergone postoperative CXR, 4 (2.7%) had a postoperative pneumothorax. One of these patients (0.67%) received a chest tube. Of the 4 patients with a pneumothorax, 3 had had a recognized pleural tear that was repaired at nephrectomy and the fourth had had an unrecognized pleural injury., CONCLUSIONS: Routine postoperative CXRs are not needed after open nephrectomy. Obtaining a selective CXR when a recognized intraoperative pleural tear has occurred, a central line is placed, the physical examination reveals an abnormality (ie, decreased breath sounds), or the patient experiences respiratory difficulties in the postoperative period is safe, cost-effective, and decreases the radiation exposure to patients.",Excluded
2857,"Post-operative stereotactic radiotherapy for the treatment of intracranial haemangiopericytoma: 'A Study of Dose and Outcome'. Introduction: This study was performed to assess the relationship between tumour response and radiation dose in equivalent 2 Gy per fraction (EQD2). Method(s): A retrospective cohort analysis of 21 patients with a diagnosis of intracranial haemangiopericytoma between 2000 and 2013 was included in this study. A total of 39 lesions were analysed. The equivalent dose in 2 Gy per fraction was calculated by assigning an alpha-beta ratio of 12 Gy. A paired t-test compared dose (EQD2) and tumour response, and as the outcome was binary, a logistic regression analysis was performed. Result(s): In total, there were 14 cases of progression and 25 cases of non-progression. It was estimated that for a one unit increase in EQD2, the odds of non-progression were increased by a factor of 1.13 (P = 0.026). After adjusting for PTV volume, the estimated effect of EQD2 (min) on tumour response was stronger, with an estimated odds ratio of 1.36 for an increase of one unit and an odds ratio of 21.6 for an increase of 10 units (P = 0.015). The dose range varied with varying PTV volumes. Based on the logistic model, the probability of having non-progression is larger than 50% for EQ2Dmin doses larger than 30-40 Gy, in particular for volumes larger than 3.67 cm3. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates that there is a relationship between dose (EQD2) and outcome. With increasing dose, the likelihood of regression is higher. When adjusted for PTV volume, the response appeared stronger. The dose varied significantly with changes in the size of the PTV.Copyright Â© 2018 The Authors.

PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of focal X-ray irradiation on experimental corneal angiogenesis in the rabbit., METHODS: A gelatin hydrogel sheet impregnated with basic fibroblast growth factor was implanted into the corneal stroma of rabbits; this induced corneal angiogenesis. After the first sign of corneal angiogenesis was noted, the corneal region was irradiated with a dose of 10 Gy or 20 Gy. The control rabbits received no irradiation. The eyes were examined by slitlamp biomicroscopy and photographed, over a period of 28 days. The maximum length and total surface area of corneal angiogenesis were quantified by computerized image analysis., RESULTS: Corneal angiogenesis was noted on day 3 following implantation of the hydrogel sheet. In the rabbits irradiated with 10 Gy, the maximum length and total surface area of corneal angiogenesis were both significantly lower on day 4 and 7 following irradiation, compared to the respective measurement in the controls. In the rabbits irradiated with 20 Gy, the maximum length and total surface area of corneal angiogenesis were significantly lower between days 4 and 21, and between days 4 and 14, respectively, compared to the respective measurement in the controls., CONCLUSIONS: Focal X-ray irradiation to the corneal region suppressed corneal angiogenesis in a dose-dependent manner.

The expression levels of pChk2 and gamma-H2AX in oral cells were assessed by immunohistochemical assay. Both biomarkers showed statistically significant increases in levels of expression after the radiation exposure (P < 0.001). This suggests that pChk2 and gamma-H2AX may serve as sensitive indicators of low-dose radiation exposure.",Included

2458,"Retrograde nailing arthrodesis in distal leg deformities. Introduction Distal leg and ankle deformities lead to progressive degeneration of the distal tibia and astragalic articular surfaces. When the cartilagineous degeneration is severe, or it is not possible to surgically correct the bone deformity, arthrodesis is the only surgical operation that is able to restore functionality. Retrograde nailing is a stable synthesis that leads to rapid healing of the bone surfaces, and precocious recovery. We assessed its application in articular distal tibia and ankle axial deviations. Methods Between 2007 and 2012 we studied a group of 25 patients, 14 women and 11 men, mean age 43 years (min 31, max 74), affected by distal leg and ankle deformities.We divided them in 2 groups depending on the deformity site (tibia 11 patients, talus bone 14 patients). We assessed the surgical access, the corrective osteotomy site, the cancellous bone graft, the healing time through a modified AOFAS score and X-rays, with a 3 years follow-up. Weight bearing was allowed 35 days post-operatively. The bone graft was harvested through peroneal malleolus resection, with the same lateral surgical access. Results In all patients we achieved deformity correction. Bone consolidation occurred in 90 days. Nailing and preparation of the articular surfaces was associated to subtractive osteotomies in 9 cases. Five tibial osteotomies were performed mostly in post-traumatic deformities, 4 talus osteotomies mostly in degenerative deformities. A thin layer of cancellous bone graft was used 18 patients. Mean preoperative AOFAS score was 37. At the 12-month follow-up, the score increased to 80, and it was maintained in the following examinations. Discussion Retrograde nailing tibiotarsic arthrodesis with osteotomies is able to correct complex deformities with severe articular damage. Nailing makes this treatment more tolerable for patients comparing to techniques such as external fixation. Subtractive osteotomies or subtalar joint re-alignment are necessary in cases of severe rear foot deformities that prevent nail insertion. Conclusions Retrograde nailing arthrodesis allows a complete correction of distal tibia and ankle articular deformities, a rapid consolidation and a precocious functional recovery.",Excluded
3218,"Severity of radiation pneumonitis, from clinical, dosimetric and biological features: a pilot study. Background and objective: Radiation pneumonitis (RP) could be a lethal complication of lung cancer treatment. No reliable predictors of RP severity have been recognized. This prospective pilot study was performed to identify early predictors of high grade lung toxicity and to evaluate clinical, biological or dosimetric features associated with different grades of toxicity. Method(s): Sixteen patients with non-small cell lung cancer with indication of concurrent chemoradiotherapy using 60 Gy/2 Gy/fraction starting at cycle one of platinum based chemotherapy were included. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), pulmonary function testing (PFT), and 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron-emission tomography was performed before radiotherapy (RT), after three weeks of treatment, and two months post-RT. For analysis, patients were grouped by grade (low [G1-G2] vs. high [G3-G5]). The two groups were compared to identify predictors of RP. Protein expression BAL and lung tissue metabolism was evaluated in two patients (RP-G1 vs. RP-G3). Categorical variables such as comorbidities, stages and locations were summarized as percentages. Radiation doses, pulmonary function values and time to RP were summarized by medians with ranges or as means with standard deviation. Longitudinal analysis PFT was performed by a T-test. Result(s): All 16 patients developed RP, as follows: G1 (5 pts; 31.3%); G2 (5 pts; 31.3%); G3 (5 pts; 31.3%); and G5 (1 pts; 6.1%). Patients with high grade RP presented significant decrease (p = 0.02) in diffusing lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) after three weeks of RT. No correlation between dosimetric values and RP grades was observed. BAL analysis of the selected patients showed that CXCL-1, CD154, IL-1ra, IL-23, MIF, PAI-1 and IFN-gamma were overexpressed in the lungs of the RP-G3 patient, even before treatment. The pre-RT SUVmax value in the RP-G3 patient was non-significantly higher than in the patient with RP-G1. Conclusion(s): RT induces some degree of RP. Our data suggest that decrease in DLCO% is the most sensitive parameter for the early detection of RP. Moreover, we detect biological differences between the two grades of pneumonitis, highlighting the potential value of some cytokines as a prognostic marker for developing high grade lung toxicity. Further multicenter studies with larger sample size are essential to validate these findings.Copyright Â© 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded
3538,"Repeat Gamma Knife surgery for trigeminal neuralgia: long-term results. The purpose of this study was to assess the long-term outcome achieved after repeat Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) for trigeminal neuralgia (TN) using a uniform treatment plan. Between 1985 and 2010, 53 patients underwent repeat GKS for refractory TN. In the initial GKS, which involved targeting the root entry zone of the trigeminal nerve, a maximal dose of 80 Gy was used with a 4-mm collimator so that the 50% isodose line abutted the pons. In the second GKS, the treatment plan consisted of a 70-Gy dose directed at a target 4-5 mm distal to the first target on the trigeminal nerve. The mean follow-up duration in these patients was 42 months. Outcomes were defined using the Marseille scale: excellent (Class I or II, no pain with or without medications), good (Class III or IV, >= 50% relief), and poor (Class V, < 50% relief). Trigeminal neuralgia pain was controlled (>= 50% improvement with or without medications) after repeat GKS in 70% of patients at 1 year, 50% at 3 years, 50% at 5 years, and 50% at 10 years, as defined by a Kaplan-Meier analysis. A correlation was found between facial numbness and pain relief (p = 0.047). No difference was found between patients with Type 1 TN and those with Type 2 TN, and there was no correlation between the best relief obtained and long-term durability of relief from pain. Twenty-two patients (47.8%) described their trigeminal dysfunction in the following manner: numbness (45.6%), dry eye (10.9%), taste change (8.7%), or jaw weakness (2.2%). In only 8.7% of cases did the patient experience facial numbness that was regarded as bothersome. Repeat GKS for TN at the doses used provides substantial long-term relief. Treatment failure occurred up to 28 months after the second GKS. Facial numbness correlated with more durable pain relief after repeat GKS in this series.",Excluded
1237,"Use of Artificial Intelligence to Reduce Radiation Exposure at Fluoroscopy-Guided Endoscopic Procedures. OBJECTIVES:Exposure to ionizing radiation remains a hazard for patients and healthcare providers. We evaluated the utility of an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled fluoroscopy system to minimize radiation exposure during image-guided endoscopic procedures. METHOD(S):We conducted a prospective study of 100 consecutive patients who underwent fluoroscopy-guided endoscopic procedures. Patients underwent interventions using either conventional or AI-equipped fluoroscopy system that uses ultrafast collimation to limit radiation exposure to the region of interest. The main outcome measure was to compare radiation exposure with patients, which was measured by dose area product. Secondary outcome was radiation scatter to endoscopy personnel measured using dosimeter. RESULT(S):Of 100 patients who underwent procedures using traditional (n = 50) or AI-enabled (n = 50) fluoroscopy systems, there was no significant difference in demographics, body mass index, procedural type, and procedural or fluoroscopy time between the conventional and the AI-enabled fluoroscopy systems. Radiation exposure to patients was lower (median dose area product 2,178 vs 5,708 mGym2, P = 0.001) and scatter effect to endoscopy personnel was less (total deep dose equivalent 0.28 vs 0.69 mSv; difference of 59.4%) for AI-enabled fluoroscopy as compared to conventional system.

Objective: The aim of this study was to identify determinants of occupational sunburn in agricultural workers and assess their occupational and recreational sun protection habits. Method(s): Specific surveys of agricultural workers in Switzerland and France were conducted (N=1538). Multivariate logistic regressions identified occupational sunburn determinants. Occupational and recreational sun protection habits were estimated and correlated. Result(s): One-year occupational and recreational sunburn prevalences were 19.8% and 11.5%, respectively. Occupational sunburn increased with having a recent recreational sunburn, highly sensitive skin, young age, high perceived skin cancer risk, using sunscreen, and not wearing a hat. Correlation between protection habits during work and leisure was substantial (r s 0.5 to 0.7). Skin health knowledge was high and pro-tanning attitude moderate. Conclusion(s): Potentially modifiable sunburn determinants and suboptimal recreational and occupational sun protection practices were identified in agricultural workers. Refining and tailoring sun protection messages targeting the agricultural sector are needed.Â© Copyright 2017 American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine.",Excluded
1839,"Use of unstable chromosome aberrations for biological dosimetry after the first postirradiation mitosis. The loss of unstable chromosome aberrations after the first postirradiation mitosis makes their use difficult in radiation dosimetry. We describe here a method which, in a cell population observed at this stage, allows retrospective estimation of the frequencies of the unstable aberrations induced at the time of irradiation, and their use as a dosimeter. The laws controlling the behavior of unstable aberrations during mitosis were defined from a large-scale experiment on irradiated human lymphocytes. For cells undergoing the first, second, or third mitosis after irradiation, relationships were determined between the frequency, at irradiation time, of acentric fragments not arising from formation of dicentrics or rings, and the ratio of dicentrics and centric rings appearing without acentric fragments to the total number of dicentrics plus rings. On the basis of this ratio, the method described here provides an assessment of the postirradiation mitotic activity in a cell population. This assessment permitted estimation of the cell distribution and frequency of dicentrics plus centric rings, and of the frequency of acentric fragments at the time of irradiation. The use of this method for retrospective dosimetry after whole-body irradiation under various conditions of exposure is illustrated.",Excluded
4446,"Proton Pump Inhibitor Exposure and Acute Myocardial Infarction Risk: A Nested Cohort Study. Background: Association of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) exposure with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) risk in the Caucasian population remains under debate. Here, we clarified whether PPI exposure might be related to an increased new-onset AMI risk in an Asian population. Method(s): Data of 27,624 patients with PPI exposure followed by new-onset AMI development were extracted from Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database and age- and sex-matched with 27,624 controls with PPIs exposure, but without subsequent AMI and ischemic heart disease development. The amount of PPI exposure was calculated based on the cumulative defined daily dose (cDDD) during the follow-up period. Subsequent AMI risk was measured after adjustments of demographic data and indication of PPI use. Result(s): AMI risk increased with an increase in PPI exposure: with cDDD <= 30 as the reference, the odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for cDDDs of > 365 was 1.56 (1.45-1.69). All five PPI categories, including pantoprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, esomeprazole, and rabeprazole, increased AMI risk. Conclusion(s): Our study demonstrated long-term or high-dose PPI exposure associated with increased new-onset AMI risk in patients without a history of any ischemic heart disease. The underlying mechanisms of PPI-related cardiovascular effects deserve more investigation.Copyright Â© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
2834,"Unusual presentation of gouty arthrittis. Case Presentation: Gout is a crystalline arthropathy characterized by the deposition of urate crystals in joints. Typically, it involves the first metatarsophalangeal joint (podagra), ankle, or knee joint, although other joints may be affected. Gout presents as an acute mono- or oligoarticular arthritis with warm, tense, dusky red overlying skin. Increased serum uric acid may be seen in 70% cases of acute gout. Gout occurs in men and postmenopausal women, and risk factors include diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, increased purine intake, alcohol, diuretic therapy, land ow-dose aspirin. Definitive diagnosis is made through arthrocentesis with polarized microscopic examination of the synovial fluid showing intracellular or extracellular needle-shaped, negatively birefringent crystals. Discussion(s): A 61-year-old postmenopausal female with a history of moderate L4-L5 central spinal canal stenosis and hypertension, presented with 3 weeks of severe right lower-extremity pain, felt over the right hip, radiating to the right leg, and worsened on weight bearing. Multiple prior evaluations in the emergency room for these symptoms revealed unremarkable x-rays of the back, hips, and pelvis. Treatment with opiates and NSAIDs was ineffective. The patient was able to recall an isolated episode of possible podagra more than 10 years prior to her current events. On examination, flexion and extension of the right hip elicited slight tenderness, and point tenderness was noted over the right sacroiliac joint. A right knee effusion was detected. Laboratory examination was remarkable for a normal CBC and CMP, and her ESR (55 mm/Hg) and CRP (39 mg/L) were elevated along with a high serum uric acid level (10 mg/dL). On further investigation, MRI imaging revealed right-sided sacroiliitis along with edema in the iliopsoas region. CT-guided joint aspiration revealed large amounts of intra- and extracellular, negatively birefringent monosodium urate crystals along with prominent tophaceous formations. Infection was excluded. Diagnosis of chronic tophaceous gout with acute gouty sacroiliitis and a possible component of crystalline iliopsoas tendonitis was made. Patient refused intra-articular steroid injection and was treated with systemic glucocorticoids. Uric acid-lowering therapy with allopurinol was started on outpatient follow-up. Conclusion(s): Characteristically, gout affects peripheral joints, and axial involvement is considered infrequent. Literature on axial gout is limited to case reports and case series. Reports suggest that axial radiographic involvement in gout is frequently underrecognized, as it may remain subclinical. Patients with acute gouty sacroiliitis may present with pain referred to the thigh, hip, or back, and crystalline iliopsoas tendonitis may further restrict hip movement, as seen in our case. Acute gouty arthritis should be considered in patients presenting with sacroiliac joint pain, particularly if they have a history of gout or risk factors for this form of rheumatism.",Excluded
2742,"Preoperative isolated limb infusion of doxorubicin and external irradiation for limb-threatening soft tissue sarcomas. Background: At present, limb-sparing surgery is the most appropriate and acceptable treatment option for soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities. To increase the number of limb-sparing resections in the treatment of locally advanced soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities, preoperative radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy are often used. Isolated limb perfusion of cytostatic agents is an effective alternative option but technically complex. Isolated limb infusion, essentially a low-flow isolated limb perfusion without oxygenation via a percutaneous catheter, had been developed as a simple alternative. Objective(s): The objective of this study was to achieve limb-sparing surgery in patients with locally advanced soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities that would otherwise have required an amputation or a functionally mutilating surgery by performing preoperative isolated limb infusion with doxorubicin and external beam irradiation to obtain local control and make limb-sparing surgery feasible. Method(s): A total of 40 patients with locally advanced soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities were evaluated between 2002 and 2005. Tumors were located in the lower limb in 28 patients (70%) and in the upper limb in 12 patients (30%). All of these patients were felt to be unresectable and were referred because amputation was considered the only available treatment option. They underwent preoperative isolated limb infusion with doxorubicin (0.7 and 1.4 mg/kg for the upper and lower limbs, respectively). Preoperative external beam radiotherapy started within 3-7 days after isolated limb infusion was administered. The total dose was 35 Gy in ten fractions. After 3-7 weeks, surgery was performed aiming at limb preservation. Result(s): Tumor response was seen in 85% of patients, rendering these large sarcomas resectable in most cases. The mean values of pretreatment tumor volume and post-treatment volume were 2797 cm3 and 1781 cm3, respectively, with a significant p value of 0.0001. Histologic response was seen in 80% of patients. At a median followup of 15 months (range = 5-35), limb salvage was achieved in 82.5%. Procedure-related complications were limited and easily managed. Conclusion(s): Isolated limb infusion with doxorubicin is a simple and safe method of regional chemotherapy. The addition of preoperative external beam irradiation helped to increase the rate of limb salvage in patients with large and/or high-grade soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities.

Accurate visualization of the tumor base by diaphanoscopy is essential for optimal placement of a ruthenium plaque. Depending on the localization of the tumor, dissection of one or more of the rectus muscles is necessary during placement of the plaque or during the course of protracted irradiation. Orthoptic investigations were performed to evaluate the cause of motility disorders and to follow up the functional outcome. In 13 patients (out of 30) who underwent ruthenium-106 therapy for uveal melanomas, one or more muscles had to be dissected during placement of the plaque and were reinserted in the same operation or after removal of the applicator. In 4 cases rectus muscles had to be shifted and were replaced after the irradiation. There were 5 patients who developed motility disorders with double vision.

1392,"Cell-free DNA levels and correlation to stage and outcome following treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer. Accurate staging of rectal cancer remains essential for optimal patient selection for combined modality treatment, including radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery. We aimed at examining the correlation of cell free DNA with the pathologic stage and subsequent risk of recurrence for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer undergoing preoperative chemoradiation. We examined 75 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer receiving preoperative chemoradiation. Blood samples for translational use were drawn prior to rectal surgery. The level of cell free DNA was quantified by digital droplet PCR and expressed as copy number of beta 2 microglobulin. We found a median level of cell free DNA in the AJCC stages I-III of 3100, 8300, and 10,700 copies/mL respectively. For patients with 12 sampled lymph nodes or above, the median level of cell free DNA were 2400 copies/mL and 4400 copies/mL (p = 0.04) for node negative and node positive disease respectively. The median follow-up was 39 months and 11 recurrences were detected (15%). The median level for patients with recurrent disease was 13,000 copies/mL compared to 5200 copies/mL for non-recurrent patients (p = 0.08). We have demonstrated a correlation between the level of total cell free DNA and the pathologic stage and nodal involvement. Furthermore, we have found a trend towards a correlation with the risk of recurrence following resection of localized rectal cancer.Copyright Â© 2017, Â© The Author(s) 2017.",Excluded
4413,"The role of cross-cultural factors in long-duration international space missions: lessons from the SFINCSS-99 study. UNLABELLED: The role of cross-cultural factors in long-duration international space missions was examined during an isolation study that simulated many of the conditions aboard the International Space Station., METHODS: Interactions involving two heterogeneous crews and one homogeneous crew staying in isolation from 110 to 240 days were studied. Data consisted of post-isolation interviews with crewmembers, ground support personnel and management, observational data, and public statements by crewmembers. Data was analyzed using the techniques of linguistic anthropology and ethnography., RESULTS: Sub-cultural (organizational and professional) differences played a larger role than national differences in causing misunderstandings in this study. Conversely, some misunderstandings and conflicts were escalated by participants falsely assuming cultural differences or similarities. Comparison between the two heterogeneous crews showed the importance of training, personality factors, and commander and language skills in preventing and alleviating cultural misunderstandings., CONCLUSION: The study revealed a number of ways that cultural differences, real as well as assumed, can play a role and interact with other, non-cultural, factors in causing and/or precipitating conflict situations. It is postulated that such difficulties can be avoided by selecting culturally adaptive crewmembers and by cross-cultural and language training. Also the crew composition and role of commander were found to be important in mitigating conflict situations. Copyright c2002 Lister Science.",Excluded
3842,"A Serum Small Molecule Biosignature of Radiation Exposure from Total Body Irradiated Patients. The potential for radiological accidents and nuclear terrorism has increased the need for the development of new rapid biodosimetry methods. In addition, in a clinical setting the issue of an individual's radiosensitivity should be taken into consideration during radiotherapy. We utilized metabolomics and lipidomics to investigate changes of metabolites in serum samples following exposure to total body ionizing radiation in humans. Serum was collected prior to irradiation, at 3-8 h after a single dose of 1.25-2 Gy, and at 24 h with a total delivered dose of 2-3.75 Gy. Metabolomics revealed perturbations in glycerophosphocholine, phenylalanine, ubiquinone Q2, and oxalic acid. Alterations were observed in circulating levels of lipids from monoacylglycerol, triacylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylglycerol lipid classes. Polyunsaturated fatty acids were some of the most dysregulated lipids, with increased levels linked to proinflammatory processes. A targeted metabolomics approach for eicosanoids was also employed. The results showed a rapid response for proinflammatory eicosanoids, with a dampening of the signal at the later time point. Sex differences were observed in the markers from the untargeted approach but not the targeted method. The ability to identify and quantify small molecules in blood can therefore be utilized to monitor radiation exposure in human populations.",Included
3346,"Health status of Greek thyroid cancer patients after radioiodine administration compared to a demographically matched general population sample. The impact of radioiodine-131 (131I) treatment on thyroid cancer patients' quality of life is controversial. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 60 patients aged 18-73 years old who had recently underwent near total thyroidectomy due to papillary thyroid cancer and were scheduled for 131I treatment. On admission to our department, prior to 131I administration patients underwent clinical and laboratory investigation including routine clinical biochemistry, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroglobulin (Tg) measurements. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was estimated by the SF- 36 Health Survey a generic instrument which consisted from eight scales (four for physical and four for mental health). After 131I administration patients were discharged and approximately 6 months later they were re-evaluated. Our results showed that HRQoL in thyroid cancer patients receiving 131I treatment is independent of age/ gender and thyroid cancer-related variables. All SF-36 scales significantly improved six months after administration (P<0.05). Compared to Greek general population, before 131I administration all scales were significantly lower (P<0.05). Six months post 131I administration, scales were significantly lower for physical functioning (P=0.02), physical role (P=0.01), social functioning (P=0.03) and emotional role limitations (P=0.04), whereas the remaining SF-36 scales were comparable to the general population. In conclusion, hypothyroidism and anxiety for the outcome of their disease before 131I treatment exert a negative impact on thyroid cancer patients. Quality of life improvement post 131I is mainly attributed to the resumption of euthyroidism and familiarization with treatment and follow-up procedures rather than 131I treatment itself. There was no significant difference between patients receiving lower (2220-3700MBq) and higher (3700-7400MBq) dosage.",Excluded
2297,"Pulmonary nodules detected at lung cancer screening: Interobserver variability of semiautomated volume measurements. Purpose: To retrospectively determine interobserver variability of semiautomated volume measurements of pulmonary nodules and the potential reasons for variability. Material(s) and Method(s): The Dutch-Belgian lung cancer screening trial (NELSON) is a lung cancer screening study that includes men between the ages of 50 and 75 years who are current or former heavy smokers. The NELSON project was approved by the Dutch Ministry of Health and the ethics committee of each participating hospital. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. For this study, the authors evaluated 1200 consecutive low-dose computed tomographic (CT) scans of the chest obtained during the NELSON project and identified subjects who had at least one 50-500-mm3 nodule. One local and one central observer independently evaluated the scans and measured the volume of any detected nodule by using semiautomated software. Noncalcified solid nodules with volumes of 15-500 mm3 were included in this study if they were fully surrounded by air (intraparenchymal) and were detected by both observers. The mean volume and the difference between both measurements were calculated for all nodules. Intermeasurement agreement was assessed with the Spearman correlation coefficient. Potential reasons for discrepancies were assessed. Result(s): There were 232 men (mean age, 60 years; age range, 52-73 years) with 430 eligible nodules (mean volume, 77.8 mm3; range, 15.3-499.5 mm3). Interobserver correlation was high (r = 0.99). No difference in volume was seen for 383 nodules (89.1%). Discrepant results were obtained for 47 nodules (10.9%); in 16 cases (3.7%), the discrepancy was larger than 10%. The most frequent cause of variability was incomplete segmentation due to an irregular shape or irregular margins. Conclusion(s): In a minority (approximately 11%) of small solid intraparenchymal nodules, semiautomated measurements are not completely reproducible and, thus, may cause errors in the assessment of nodule growth. For small or irregularly shaped nodules, an observer should check the segmentation shown by the program. Â© RSNA, 2006.",Excluded

Radiation-induced liver disease is recorded as a form of veno-occlusive disease. Its pathogenesis remains unclear even if the initial injury likely occurs in the endothelial cells of central veins. The aim of our study was to investigate liver morphological features in relation to alpha-isoform of smooth muscle actin expression in hepatic stellate cells in six patients treated by localized radiotherapy on the biliopancreatic area. Within the month after completion of treatment, an activation of hepatic stellate cells strictly confined to irradiated areas and coinciding with congestive changes was observed. At a later stage, collagen deposition gradually increased, replacing the congestive and destroyed areas. This new fibrotic tissue also contained numerous alpha-smooth muscle positive cells. Our data suggest that early hepatic stellate cells activation coinciding with congestive changes plays an important role in radiation liver injury and ensuing fibrosis.",Included
4463,"Persistence of chromatid aberrations in the cells of solid mouse tissues exposed to 137Cs gamma radiation. Primary mouse ear and kidney cultures were established for determination of cytogenetic aberrations at short (3 days to 1 month) and long (12-23 months) times after exposure of their right sides to 7.5 Gy of (137)Cs gamma radiation. In every case, higher levels of aberrations were observed in primary cultures established from the irradiated tissues than in those established from the contralateral tissues. The most common aberrations in the contralateral tissues and those from nonirradiated mice were chromatid and isochromatid breaks and small chromatid fragments. Primary cells from irradiated tissues removed from animals within a month of exposure displayed a variety of unstable chromosome-type aberrations characteristic of recent exposure to ionizing radiation including rings, dicentrics, double minutes, and large acentric fragments. The percentages of cells exhibiting chromatid breaks and small chromatid fragments were also markedly elevated. Although the levels of chromosome-type aberrations found in primary cells from irradiated tissues dropped to near background levels a year or more after exposure, chromatid-type aberrations remained elevated. These results are consistent with long-term persistence of damage in the genomes of ionizing radiation-exposed cells in solid tissues and the induction of genomic instability in vivo.",Included

3062,"Gluteus maximus turnover flap for sacral osteomyelitis after radiation therapy. Developments in radiation therapy modalities offer alternative treatments for un-resectable malignant tumors in the pelvis and trunk. However, poor vascularity as a result of radiation therapy makes the treated lesion susceptible to infection, and there are no established treatments for pelvic osteomyelitis with a large dead space after radiation therapy. The authors report 2 cases of sacral osteomyelitis after radiation therapy that were treated successfully with a gluteus maximus turnover flap. To create the flap, the distal portion of the lower third of the muscle was detached from the trochanter. The distal edge of the flap was turned toward the sacral defect and sewn to the remnant of the sacrum, which filled the dead space with the muscle bulk. A 68-year-old man with a recurrent sacral chordoma was treated with carbon ion radiation therapy; however, a sacral infection developed 5 months later. De-bridement and a course of antibiotics could not control the infection and did not induce sufficient formation of granulation tissue in the large and deep dead space. The turnover flap with both gluteus maximus muscles cured the deep-seated infec-tion and closed the wound. A 58-year-old woman had sacral osteoradionecrosis with infection. A turnover flap created with the left gluteus maximus muscle controlled the infection and closed the wound after the first operation, a V-Y flap, failed. This study showed that a gluteus maximus muscle turnover flap effectively controlled infectious lesions with large and deep dead space around the sacrum.Copyright Â© SLACK Incorporated.",Excluded
4823,"Salvage stereotactic radiosurgery with adjuvant use of bevacizumab for heavily treated recurrent brain metastases: a preliminary report. It is not uncommon for brain metastasis (BM) treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to demonstrate radiographic enlargement, with the patient developing neurological deficits attributable to a lesion at the site of SRS. The management of both local recurrence and radiation-induced necrosis (RN) poses a significant therapeutic dilemma, if surgical resection is not feasible, and effective therapies have yet to be established. This preliminary study introduces our initial experience with salvage SRS using adjuvant bevacizumab for this refractory entity. We retrospectively reviewed five patients who had received salvage SRS using adjuvant bevacizumab for recurrent BM complicated by RN. The diagnosis was based on clinical features, serial imaging studies and/or histopathological findings. Patients underwent salvage SRS followed by the first cycle of bevacizumab (7.5-10 mg/kg intravenous). Bevacizumab was repeated every 3-4 weeks until tumor progression or significant toxic events. The number of bevacizumab doses ranged from 2 to 16 (median 4). Follow-up MR imaging demonstrated a clear radiographic response in all lesions. Neurological symptoms improved in three patients and stabilized in two. In two patients, bevacizumab treatment was discontinued due to anemia and gastrointestinal bleeding, respectively. At the time of data analysis, four patients had died and the other was still alive. The causes of death were neurological decline and systemic disease progression in two patients each. Salvage SRS with adjuvant bevacizumab use appeared to provide an adequate radiographic response as well as neurological palliation for selected patients with heavily treated recurrent BM complicated by RN.Copyright Â© 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Excluded
1569,"Early stage transplantation of bone marrow cells markedly ameliorates copper metabolism and restores liver function in a mouse model of Wilson disease. Background: Recent studies have demonstrated that normal bone marrow (BM) cells transplantation can correct liver injury in a mouse model of Wilson disease (WD). However, it still remains unknown when BM cells transplantation should be administered. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential impact of normal BM cells transplantation at different stages of WD to correct liver injury in toxic milk (tx) mice. Method(s): Recipient tx mice were sublethally irradiated (5 Gy) prior to transplantation. The congenic wild-type (DL) BM cells labeled with CM-DiI were transplanted via caudal vein injection into tx mice at the early (2 months of age) or late stage (5 months of age) of WD. The same volume of saline or tx BM cells were injected as controls. The DL donor cell population, copper concentration, serum ceruloplasmin oxidase activity and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels in the various groups were evaluated at 1, 4, 8 and 12 weeks post-transplant, respectively. Result(s): The DL BM cells population was observed from 1 to 12 weeks and peaked by the 4th week in the recipient liver after transplantation. DL BM cells transplantation during the early stage significantly corrected copper accumulation, AST across the observed time points and serum ceruloplasmin oxidase activity through 8 to 12 weeks in tx mice compared with those treated with saline or tx BM cells (all P < 0.05). In contrast, BM cells transplantation during the late stage only corrected AST levels from 4 to 12 weeks post-transplant and copper accumulation at 12 weeks post-transplant (all P < 0.05). No significant difference was found between the saline and tx BM cells transplantation groups across the observed time points (P > 0.05). Conclusion(s): Early stage transplantation of normal BM cells is better than late stage transplantation in correcting liver function and copper metabolism in a mouse model of WD.

Result(s): Neck computed tomography scans had a mean effective dose of 2.18 mSv. The mean effective dose for head computed tomography scans was 1.53 mSv. The highest mean equivalent organ dose was for the thyroid with the neck computed tomography scan and the lenses of the eyes with the head computed tomography scan. There was no significant difference between scan lengths in each computed tomography acquisition. There was a noticeable correlation observed between effective radiation dose and tube current. As anticipated, young people had a higher life attributable risk of cancer compared to the elderly. This amount was less than 0.011 per 100 persons for both computed tomography studies. Conclusion(s): Our data showed a significant organ radiation dose in both neck and head computed tomography scans, not only for the thyroid and the lenses of the eyes, but also for the chest.Copyright Â© 2019, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.

4342,"Lung cancer screening. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) in adults of age 55 to 80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and are currently smoking or have quit within the past 15 years. This recommendation is largely based on the findings of the National Lung Screening Trial. Both policy-level and clinical decision-making about LDCT screening must consider the potential benefits of screening (reduced mortality from lung cancer) and possible harms. Effective screening requires an appreciation that screening should be limited to individuals at high risk of death from lung cancer, and that the risk of harm related to false positive findings, overdiagnosis, and unnecessary invasive testing is real. A comprehensive understanding of these aspects of screening will inform appropriate implementation, with the objective that an evidence-based and systematic approach to screening will help to reduce the enormous mortality burden of lung cancer.",Excluded
3461,"Optimization of 64-MDCT urography: Effect of dual-phase imaging with furosemide on collecting system opacification and radiation dose. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to compare opacification of the urinary collecting system and radiation dose associated with three-phase 64-MDCT urographic protocols and those associated with a split-bolus dual-phase protocol including furosemide. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Images from 150 CT urographic examinations performed with three scanning protocols were retrospectively evaluated. Group A consisted of 50 sequentially registered patients who underwent a three-phase protocol with saline infusion. Group B consisted of 50 sequentially registered patients who underwent a reduced-radiation three-phase protocol with saline. Group C consisted of 50 sequentially registered patients who underwent a dual-phase split-bolus protocol that included a low-dose furosemide injection. Opacification of the urinary collecting system was evaluated with segmental binary scoring. Contrast artifacts were evaluated, and radiation doses were recorded. Results were compared by analysis of variance. RESULTS. A significant reduction in mean effective radiation dose was found between groups A and B (p < 0.001) and between groups B and C (p < 0.001), resulting in 65% reduction between groups A and C (p < 0.001). This reduction did not significantly affect opacification score in any of the 12 urinary segments (p = 0.079). In addition, dense contrast artifacts overlying the renal parenchyma observed with the three-phase protocols (groups A and B) were avoided with the dual-phase protocol (group C) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION. A dual-phase protocol with furosemide injection is the preferable technique for CT urography. In comparison with commonly used three-phase protocols, the dualphase protocol significantly reduces radiation exposure dose without reduction in image quality.

2549,"Endovascular stent treatment for symptomatic benign iliofemoral venous occlusive disease: Long-term results 1987-2009. Venous stenting has been shown to effectively treat iliofemoral venous obstruction with good short- and mid-term results. The aim of this study was to investigate long-term clinical outcome and stent patency. Twenty patients were treated with venous stenting for benign disease at our institution between 1987 and 2005. Fifteen of 20 patients (15 female, mean age at time of stent implantation 38 years [range 18-66]) returned for a clinical visit, a plain X-ray of the stent, and a Duplex ultrasound. Four patients were lost to follow-up, and one patient died 277 months after stent placement although a good clinical result was documented 267 months after stent placement. Mean follow-up after stent placement was 167.8 months (13.9 years) (range 71 (6 years) to 267 months [22 years]). No patient needed an additional venous intervention after stent implantation. No significant difference between the circumference of the thigh on the stented side (mean 55.1 cm [range 47.0-70.0]) compared with the contralateral thigh (mean 54.9 cm [range 47.0-70.0]) (p = 0.684) was seen. There was a nonsignificant trend toward higher flow velocities within the stent (mean 30.8 cm/s [range 10.0-48.0]) and the corresponding vein segment on the contralateral side (mean 25.2 cm/s [range 12.0-47.0]) (p = 0.065). Stent integrity was confirmed in 14 of 15 cases. Only one stent showed a fracture, as documented on x-ray, without any impairment of flow. Venous stenting using Wallstents showed excellent long-term clinical outcome and primary patency rate. Â© 2010 The Author(s).",Excluded
1547,"Functional and quality-of-life outcomes after reirradiation for head and neck cancer. Objectives/Hypothesis To examine functional and quality-of-life outcomes for patients treated by reirradiation to the head and neck for recurrent or new primary cancers. Study Design Retrospective review. Methods The University of Washington Quality of Life Instrument (UW-QOL) scores were reviewed with swallow evaluations for 17 patients with biopsy-proven recurrent or new primary squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck treated with reirradiation who were clinically without evidence of disease at a minimum follow-up of 1 year. All patients had received their initial radiation therapy to a median dose of 66 Gy (range, 60-72 Gy). The median interval between radiation courses was 30 months (range, 6-132 months). The median reirradiation dose was 60 Gy (range, 54-70 Gy). Results At 1 year after reirradiation, the mean UW-QOL composite score was 67.0 (range, 22.1-83.5), which did not differ significantly from baseline (P=.57). The proportion of patients who rated their global quality of life as ""very good"" or ""outstanding"" at 1 year after reirradiation was 35%. The percentage of patients who reported their global quality of life as ""good/fair"" and ""poor/very poor"" were 59% and 6%, respectively. Conclusions The majority of survivors in this highly selected series were devoid of new impairment after reirradiation and were satisfied with their functional status. Although nearly all patients had side effects from their prior radiation course prior to reirradiation, no patient reported a decline in global quality of life from before reirradiation to 1 year post-treatment.

3178,"Is the modified Mann Assessment of Swallowing Ability useful for assessing dysphagia in patients with mild to moderate dementia?. Dysphagia is an important causative factor of aspiration pneumonia among the elderly, particularly in patients with dementia. The modified Mann Assessment of Swallowing Ability (mMASA) is commonly used as a physician-administered screening protocol for assessing dysphagia due to its merits as a clinical test that does not involve special equipment or radiation exposure. The present study investigated whether the mMASA would reflect the dysphagia state as estimated by videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) findings and cognitive function in patients with dementia. This study included 25 subjects with mild to moderate dementia. In all subjects, swallowing function was evaluated with the mMASA and VFSS and cognitive function was evaluated using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Global Deterioration Scale (GDS), and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scales. The Spearman correlation and linear regression tests were conducted with the mMASA values and other tests for swallowing and cognition. The mMASA values were correlated with the Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS) of the VFSS as well as scores on the MMSE, MoCA, GDS, and CDR. In addition, the Judgment and Problem Solving and Community Affairs subscales of the CDR were correlated with mMASA values. The assessments of dysphagia using the mMASA were consistent with the VFSS findings and were reflected by cognitive function. Taken together, the present findings suggest that the mMASA would be useful for the routine evaluation of swallowing function in patients with mild to moderate dementia for the detection of dysphagia.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
2199,"Targeted radionuclide therapy for patients with metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of 90Y-DOTATOC and 131I-MIBG in treatment of metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). METHOD(S): Twelve histologically confirmed patients with metastatic MTC were included. All patients underwent both 111In-DTPA-octreotide imaging and 131I/ 123I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) imaging. According to the results of the combined imaging, positive patients were selected to be treated with 90Y-DOTA-D-Phe1-Tyr3-octreotide (90Y-DOTATOC) or 131I-MIBG, respectively. The therapeutic procedures of targeted internal radiation were performed with 3.33 GBq 90Y-DOTATOC at 6-week intervals, or 11.1 GBq 131I-MIBG with a minimum interval of three months. RESULT(S): The imaging procedure was positive in all 12 patients: 111In-DTPA-octreotide imaging in eight patients, 131I/ 123I-MIBG imaging in six patients. According to the results of combined imaging, we identified four patients to be treated with 90Y-DOTATOC, and five patients with 131 I-MIBG. After three to five sessions of treatment, three patients with partial remission and six with stable disease were observed. The effective rate was 3/9 (33.3%) and the overall tumor response rate was 9/9 (100%). No relevant toxicity was observed. CONCLUSION(S): The combined imaging technique can be used to identify patients for effective radionuclide treatment. The treatment with 90Y-DOTATOC or 131I-MIBG is well tolerated and may improve the fate of patients with metastatic MTC.",Excluded
835,"Do non-thermal electromagnetic fields cause nitrosative stress in male and female rats?. Nitrosative stress occurs when the generations of highly Reactive Nitrogen Species (RNS) such as nitric oxide (NO) exceed the ability of the human body to neutralize and eliminate them. It may lead to nitrosylation reactions that can alter protein structure by inhibiting normal body functions. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether RF Fields at non - thermal level can affect total NO (NOx) and antioxidant levels in plasma thus cause nitrosative stress. Twenty-four male and female Wistar rats were divided into four groups: Group I and Group II: male (n=6) and female (n=6) control groups, Group III and Group IV: male (n=6) and female (n=6) RF radiation exposed groups. The exposed groups of rats were exposed to non - thermal RF radiation 20 min/day for a month. NOx (nitrite/nitrate) levels were measured by Griess assay using Elisa reader. The total sulfhydryl (RSH) levels were determined spectrophotometrically by Kurtel method. The exposure to RF Radiation for a month caused significant increase in NOx plasma levels in male and female rats (p < 0.05). Conversely RSH levels were significantly lower in exposed rats compared to control rats (p < 0.05). No statistically significant difference was observed in the rectal temperature between control and RF - irradiated rats (p > 0.05). In the present study, we showed that plasma NOx level may be increased in both male and female rats due to RF radiation exposure. The results of our study are evident that RF Fields at non - thermal level can induce nitrosative stress by increasing NOx and decreasing antioxidant levels.",Excluded

4392,"Leg alignment does not affect tibial baseplate migration at 10 years following total knee arthroplasty. INTRODUCTION: Adequate fixation of implant components is an important goal for all arthroplasty procedures, and aseptic loosening is one of the leading causes of revision surgery in total knee arthroplasty [1]. Recent findings supporting a natural ""physiologic varus"" alignment in some patients have launched an ongoing debate in total knee arthroplasty with respect to the optimal position of the implant components [2]. The purpose of the present study was to examine the long-term fixation of a cemented titanium fixed bearing polished tibial baseplate, and examine the effect of alignment on implant migration. Method(s): Patients enrolled in a previous two-year prospective trial were recalled at ten years. While 35 patients were enrolled in the original study, 16 were available for follow-up at 10 years after excluding patients that were deceased (n = 9), unable to attend due to poor health (n = 9), or lost to follow-up (n = 1). All patients underwent total knee arthroplasty by one of three surgeons, receiving a posterior-stabilized CoCr-on-polyethylene implant from a single manufacturer. Each patient underwent radiostereometric analysis (RSA) imaging in a supine position using a conventional RSA protocol at 1 week, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 10 years post-operatively. Patients also received a three-foot standing x-ray from which leg alignment was measured at the 10-year follow-up. Migration of the tibial component in all planes, measured from RSA, was compared between the 2 year and 10-year follow-up visits. Comparisons of tibial component migration at 10 years between neutral (0 +/- 3 deg) and varus (>3 deg varus) aligned limbs were performed. Outcome scores including the Knee Society Score, WOMAC, SF-12, Forgotten Joint Score, and UCLA Activity Score were recorded. Result(s): At 10 years, the mean migrations of the tibial component were less than 0.1 mm and 0.1 deg in all planes relative to the post-operative RSA exam. There was no significant difference in tibial component migration between the 2 year and 10 year follow-ups, nor was there a significant difference in migration between the neutral and varus limb-aligned groups at 10 years. Tibial component subsidence at 10 years (Figure 1A) was -0.05 +/- 0.15 mm in the neutral group and -0.11 +/- 0.25 mm in the varus limb-aligned group (p = 0.81). The change of tibial component coronal plane alignment at 10 years (Figure IB) was 0.01 +/- 0.14 deg towards valgus in the neutral group and 0.13 +/- 0.38 deg towards varus in the varus limb-aligned group (p =0 .97). There was no correlation between any changes in the position of the tibial component with femoral alignment, tibial alignment, or overall limb alignment. WOMAC and Knee Society Scores were significantly improved (p < 0.0001) at the latest follow-up versus pre-operative scores. There was no significant correlation between implant migration and UCLA Activity Score (r2 = 0.02 to 0.18) or the Forgotten Joint Score (r = 0.01 to 0.34). Discussion(s): The implant was well fixed at 10 years, with no significant difference in migration from the previous two-year follow-up. The excellent long-term fixation of this implant supports the high survivorship for this implant system reported in the literature [3]. Femoral, tibial, and overall limb alignment had no effect on the migration of the tibial baseplate at 10 years follow-up. Both the neutral and varus aligned groups demonstrated minimal change in position of the tibial baseplate overtime. SIGNIFICANCE: The implant demonstrated excellent long-term fixation with no effect of alignment on migration in any plane. Based on the results of the present study, further assessment of patient-specific, physiologic alignment for total knee arthroplasty could be indicated.",Excluded
4724,"Three-dimensional anatomic analysis and navigation templates for C1 pedicle screw placement perpendicular to the coronal plane: a retrospective study. OBJECTIVE: To explore the corridor for atlas pedicle screw placement perpendicular to the coronal plane and to develop patient-specific navigation templates for pedicle screw placement., METHODS: This study is a retrospective analysis. A total of 71 patients (41 males and 30 females) were involved in this study from June 2016 to June 2018, and they were divided into a template group (39 patients) and a conventional group (32 patients). The CT-based 3D reconstruction models were analyzed in the template group. From the perspective of the 3D atlas in a coronal view, the pedicle corridor was obtained. Taking the center of the tangential circle of the pedicle as the entry point, we simulated screw placement perpendicular to the coronal plane. Then, the individual navigation template was designed and used in surgery. In the conventional group, free-hand pedicle screw placement was performed perpendicular to the coronal plane. The diameter of the maximum tangential circle and screw length of the pedicle corridor were measured in the template group. The surgical time, radiation exposure time, screw grading criteria and so on were evaluated and compared between the two groups after surgery., RESULTS: ;The diameter of the maximum tangential circle and the distance between the entry point and posterior tubercle were significantly greater in males than in females. The operation was successfully completed in all patients, without aggravation of nerve injury, and the follow-up was 12-20 months, with an average of 15.6 months. A total of 78 screws were inserted in the template group, and 64 screws were inserted in the conventional group. The surgical times in the template group and conventional group were 76.47+/-24.44 min and 125.63+/-36.41 min, respectively. The radiation exposure times in the template group and conventional group were 3.51+/-1.77 and 10.15+/-4.95, respectively, and there was a significant difference between the two groups. In the template group, the deviation in the screw entry point and screw angle were 1.92+/-1.67 mm and 2.08+/-1.98degree, respectively. The medial angle deviation between the left and right sides was 2.71+/-1.88degree in the template group, which was significantly less than the deviation of 3.76+/-2.22degree in the conventional group., CONCLUSION: A pedicle screw trajectory perpendicular to the coronal plane can be quickly obtained based on the perspective of 3D models. The technique of screw placement perpendicular to the coronal plane assisted by navigation templates has a shorter operative time, lessintraoperative fluoroscopy and a higher safety of screw placement than traditional surgery.",Excluded

Purpose/Objective(s): The purpose of this study was to evaluate the longterm treatment outcomes and patterns of failure in patients with primary ocular adnexal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma treated with involved-field radiation therapy. Materials/Methods: Patients who were pathologically diagnosed as Stage IE/IIE ocular adnexal MALT lymphoma and underwent radiation therapy were retrospectively analyzed. Since 2006, 55 patients received radiation therapy and were followed up for more than 6 months at our institution. At initial presentation, 53 patients had Stage IE disease and two had Stage IIE disease. There were 28 men and 27 women. The median age was 66 years (range, 39-90 years). Local control (LC), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): The median follow-up period was 47 months (range, 6-90 months). The median radiation dose was 30 Gy (range, 30-30.6 Gy in 15- 17 fractions). All patients were treated by radiation alone, but oral steroid was used for four patients who had double vision at the beginning of treatment. Thirty-four patients were treated with 6 MV photon beams with a wedged pair of fields. Nineteen patients with a lesion confined to the conjunctive or eyelid were treated with 9 MeV electron beams with a single anterior field. In the remaining two patients, combination of the two beams was used. A lead lens block was used in 16 patients. Six patients had bilateral lesions and were treated simultaneously. The 5-year LC rate was 100%. In two patients, local recurrence was suspected at 44 and 46 months, respectively, after radiation therapy, but both of them were diagnosed to have IgG4-related inflammation by biopsy, with no evidence of malignancy upon histological and immunohistochemical examinations. The 5-year PFS and OS rates were 89% and 100%, respectively. Four patients had recurrence at a distant site. The median time to recurrence was 24 months. Three of the four patients received systemic chemotherapy with R-CHOP and another patient is being followed up without second line treatment. One patient developed retinal detachment incidentally during radiation therapy and underwent surgery thereafter. There was no other Grade 3 or higher acute morbidity. Eleven patients had Grade 2 late morbidity (dry eye, 2; cataract, 9). Sixteen patients had Grade 3 cataract. No patients had severe late adverse events other than cataract. Conclusion(s): Patients with localized ocular adnexal MALT lymphoma achieved excellent local control after 30 Gy of radiation therapy alone. Local regrowth of the mass was observed in two patients, but both were diagnosed as IgG4-related disease. Association between MALT lymphoma and IgG4-related disease has been reported recently, and in such cases it should be born in mind.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: To test the feasibility of ureteral stent placement without image guidance after uncomplicated ureteral stone removal and to compare the outcomes of fluoro-less and conventional ureteral stent placement., METHODS: A technique was devised to allow placement of a ureteral stent without image guidance by substituting fluoroscopy with visual and tactile cues. A retrospective review of 25 patients using fluoro-less stent placement was compared with 25 consecutive patients who underwent conventional stent placement with fluoroscopy. Stent placement was graded on a 6-point scale to assess coil symmetry and location. Comparisons between the fluoro-less stent placements and controls were performed with the Mann-Whitney U test. All hypotheses were 2-sided and conducted at an alpha level of 0.05., RESULTS: All 25 ureteral stent placements were performed successfully without the use of fluoroscopy for image guidance. There was no significant difference in age, gender, body mass index, stone size, or complication rates when fluoro-less and conventional stent placements were compared. In addition, grade 1 placement was achieved in 76% of the fluoro-less group and in 64% of the conventional group. Although placement accuracy was higher in the fluoro-less group this was not statistically significant (P = .13)., CONCLUSION: Ureteral stent placement without fluoroscopic guidance is feasible. It maintains comparable efficacy and complication rates with conventional ureteral stent placement. This technique allows reduced radiation exposure in patients requiring ureteral stent placement.

4889,"Possible involvement of the facial nucleus in regulation of respiration in rats. The facial nucleus (FN) has been known as a motor nucleus to control the activity of the facial skeletal muscles by its efferent somatic motoneurons. Much less, however, is known about the non-motor control functions of its interneurons. The present study was designed to investigate if the interneurons of the FN participate in controlling rhythmic respiration in the sodium thiopental-anesthetized and vagotomized Sprague-Dawley rats with facial motoneurons retrogradely degenerated with techniques of electrical and chemical stimulation of the FN and extracellular recording of discharge of neurons in the FN. Single pulse stimulation (75-100 microA, 0.2 ms) of the FN during inspiration caused a transient restrain in phrenic discharge. Short train stimulation (75-100 microA, 0.2 ms, 100 Hz, 3-5 pulses) delivered during the early- or mid-term of inspiration augmented the inspiratory duration, but switched the inspiration off when delivered during the later stage of inspiration. Short train stimulation delivered during expiration prolonged the expiratory duration. Continuous stimulation could inhibit the inspiration. Microinjection of kainic acid into the FN caused an augmentation in inspiratory duration and amplitude and in expiratory duration. These data indicate that the interneurons of the FN might participate in the modulation of respiration. Different discharge patterns of interneurons in the FN, interestingly some respiratory related patterns, were observed, which provide a possible structural basis for the role of the FN in respiratory regulation.",Excluded

3481,"Bone mineral content in the senescent rat femur: an assessment using single photon absorptiometry. The single photon absorptiometry technique was evaluated for measuring bone mineral content (BMC) of the excised femurs of the rat, and the system was used to examine the changes in cortical and trabecular bone from young adult (6 mo), mature adult (12 mo), and senescent (24 mo) male and female animals. BMC of the femur midshaft, representing cortical bone, apparently increased progressively with advancing age. The width of the femur at the scan site also increased with age. Normalizing the midshaft BMC by width partially compensated for the age-associated increase. However, when bone mineral values were normalized by the cortical area at the scan site, to take into account the geometric differences in the femurs of different aged animals, maximum bone densities were found in the mature adult and these values decreased slightly in the femurs from senescent rats. In contrast, the BMC of the femur distal metaphysis, representing trabecular bone, decreased markedly in the aged rat. The loss of trabecular bone was also evident from morphological examination of the distal metaphysis. These findings indicated that bone mineral loss with age was site specific in the rat femur. These studies provided additional evidence that the rat might serve as a useful animal model for specific experiments related to the pathogenesis of age-associated osteopenia.",Excluded

Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the clinical efficacy of percutaneous endoscopic interlaminar discectomy (PEID) and percutaneous endoscopic transforaminal discectomy (PETD) in treating L5/S1 disc herniation. Method(s): A retrospective analysis of 76 patients with L5/S1 intervertebral disc herniation was performed. There were two surgical treatment groups: one with patients receiving PEID and the other with patients receiving PETD. The two groups were compared by length of surgery, times of intraoperative X-ray exposure, postoperative time in bed, length of hospital stay, operative complications, patient's assessment of pain using a visual analogue scale (VAS), and disability using the Oswestry disability index (ODI) before and after surgery. Result(s): Subjects in the PEID group were in surgery for 60.90 +/- 13.11 min and needed intraoperative X-ray exposure 4.10 +/- 1.09 times. Patients in this group were ambulatory by 7.52 +/- 1.08 h after surgery and were hospitalized for 5.05 +/- 0.92 days. In contrast, patients in the PETD group were in surgery for 84.06 +/- 15.58 min and needed intraoperative X ray exposure 12.81 +/- 8.46 times. These patients were ambulatory by 7.06 +/- 0.91 h after surgery and remained in the hospital for 4.94 +/- 0.80 days. Based on these data, operation time and fluoroscopy time were significantly less (P < 0.002 and P < 0.001, respectively) for subjects in the PEID group. However, ambulatory time and hospitalization were similar for both in terms of pain relief and decreased disability, and subjects in both groups responded well to the surgery and showed a significant decrease in both VAS and ODI scores at their 1-year follow-up (P < 0.01). Furthermore, there were no statistically significant differences between the two surgeries in terms of pain relief and decrease in disability. Conclusion(s): For L5/S1 disc herniation, PEID and PETD provide similar results for patients. However, PEID has the advantage over PETD in that it is a shorter procedure and exposes the patient to less radiation. Keywords.Copyright Â© 2020 The Authors.

All patients have experienced clinical complete response (cCR). After a median follow-up of 30 months (range, 18-39 months), no patient had local recurrence or distant metastasis. Two-year colostomy-free survival (CFS) and two-year disease-free survival (DFS) were both 100%. The median overall survival (OS) has not reached. Grade 3 acute toxicities included leukopenia (1, 9.1%), neutropenia (2, 18.2%) and thrombocytopenia (2, 18.2%). No grade 4 acute adverse events occurred. Conclusion(s): In our study, cisplatin/capecitabine combined with IMRT was safe in ASCC patients, with favorable efficacy as an alternative, and is expected to be explored in study with larger sample.Copyright Â© 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Excluded
4584,"Scintigraphic studies of rectal emptying in patients with constipation and defecatory difficulty. We prospectively evaluated 38 adult patients with chronic constipation with and without defecatory difficulties using a newly described scintigraphic test to measure rectal emptying and compared them to 20 healthy controls. All patients underwent anorectal manometry, and 30 who complained of infrequent defecation underwent a colonic transit study using radiopaque markers. Control subjects promptly evacuated both 100 ml and 200 ml artificial stool in a characteristic fashion, but three evacuated none of the 100-ml volume and two had no evacuation of the 200-ml stool (inhibited controls). Constipated patients exhibited three patterns of emptying: (1) normal emptying of both volumes (47%); (2) poor emptying of both volumes or inhibited defecation (29%); and (3) normal emptying of the 200-ml but abnormal evacuation of the 100-ml volume (24%). An abnormal expulsion pattern during manometry occurred in 21% of patients and was strongly associated with the inhibited defecation pattern. However, defecation patterns could not be predicted on the basis of age, gender, symptoms, duration of complaints, colonic transit, or other rectal manometric parameters. Although rectal scintigraphy has potential advantages as a diagnostic test in terms of quantitation and decreased radiation exposure, the inability of the test to distinguish patients with slow transit constipation and defecatory complaints makes the potential utility of this test of uncertain value in clinical and investigative settings.",Excluded

PURPOSE: The traditional prone positioning of percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is associated with various anesthetic and logistic difficulties. We aimed to compare the surgical outcomes of PCNLs performed using our modified supine position with those performed in the standard prone position., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective group of 236 renal units (224 patients) undergoing PCNL were included in this 2 site study: 160 were performed in the modified supine position were compared with 76 undergoing PCNL in the prone position. The outcomes of radiation dose, radiation time, stone free rate, body mass index (BMI), stone size, operative time, length of stay (LOS), in hospital and complications were compared. Chi-square and t-tests were used., RESULTS: There were no significant differences in mean radiation time, radiation dose or stone size between the modified supine and prone groups. The supine group had a higher mean BMI (31 kg/m(2) vs. 28 kg/m(2), p=0.03), shorter mean surgical time (93 minutes vs. 123 minutes, p<0.001), shorter mean LOS (2 days vs. 3 days, p=0.005) and higher stone free rate (70% vs. 50%, p=0.005). There were no differences in septic or bleeding complications but the prone group had a higher rate of overall complications., CONCLUSIONS: Modified supine PCNL has significantly lower operative time, shorter LOS and higher stone-free rate compared with prone in our series, while remaining a safe procedure.",Excluded
2303,"Liver cancers in Mayak workers. Liver cancer mortality risks were evaluated in 11,000 workers who started working at the 'Mayak' Production Association in 1948-1958 and who were exposed to both internally deposited plutonium and external gamma radiation. Comparisons with Russian liver cancer incidence rates indicate excess risk, especially among those with detectable plutonium body burdens and among female workers in the plutonium plant. Comparisons within the Mayak worker cohort which evaluate the role of plutonium body burden with adjustment for cumulative external dose indicate excess risk among workers with burdens estimated to exceed 7.4 kBq (relative risk = 17; 95% CI = 8.0-36) and among workers in the plutonium plant who did not have routine plutonium monitoring data based on urine measurements (relative risk = 2.8; 95% CI = 1.3-6.2). In addition, analyses treating the estimated plutonium body burden as a continuous variable indicate increasing risk with increasing burden (P < 0.001). Relative risks tended to be higher for females than for males, probably because of the lower baseline risk and the higher levels of plutonium measured in females. Because of limitations in current plutonium dosimetry, no attempt was made to quantify liver cancer risks from plutonium in terms of organ dose, and risk from external dose could not be reliably evaluated.

4436,"Early and late lung radiographic injury following stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). OBJECTIVE: To describe early and late CT patterns of radiographic lung injury after SBRT for lung cancer, and to correlate radiological findings with patient and treatment characteristics., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Follow-up CT scans of 68 patients with 70 tumors were divided into 4 periods: (1) 6 weeks; (2) 2-6 months; (3) 7-12 months and (4) 13-18 months after SBRT. Early (within 6 months) and late radiological injuries were evaluated according to Ikezoe and Koening, respectively. The correlation between CT findings and patient characteristics was evaluated., RESULTS: Radiographic injury in periods 1 and 2 was: (1) diffuse consolidation 3 and 27%, (2) patchy consolidation and ground-glass opacity (GGO) 13.2 and 33%, (3) diffuse GGO 13.2 and 21%, (4) patchy GGO 16.2 and 6%, and (5) no findings 54.4 and 21%, respectively. Late injury in periods 3 and 4 were: (1) modified conventional pattern (consolidation, volume loss, bronchiectasis) 54 and 44%, (2) mass-like 20 and 28%, (3) scar-like 14 and 16% and (4) no findings 20 and 12%, respectively. The proportion of emphysema grades 2-4 was significantly higher in patients who had no radiological findings 6 weeks after treatment (p=0.021). Both patchy consolidation and GGO patterns resulted more frequently in patients who were not administered steroids (p=0.035). No relationship was found with smoking, tumor dimension and radiation dose., CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients had no evidence of radiographic lung injury 6 weeks after SBRT; the most prevalent findings were diffuse or patchy GGO. Patchy and diffuse consolidation develops 2-6 months after SBRT. Modified conventional pattern was the most prevalent in the late periods. Copyright 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

2321,"Different pedicle osteosynthesis for thoracolumbar vertebral fractures in elderly patients. Introduction: Pedicle screws' stability, especially in osteoporotic fractures, is a really problem for spinal surgeons. Nowadays, little is known about the influence of different screw types and amount of cement applied. This single-center retrospective observational study has the aim of evaluating the middle- to long-term mechanical performances of different types of screws in elderly patients with thoracolumbar fractures. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 91 patients (37 males and 54 females), treated between 2011 and 2016, affected by somatic osteoporotic fractures aged over 65 years were treated. We divided patients into three different populations: solid screws, cannulated screws and cannulated screws augmented with poly methyl methacrylate cement (PMMA). Patients were radiologically evaluated with X-rays in pre- and post-surgery and at the follow-up (FU). Clinical evaluations were made with VAS and Oswestry Disability Index. Result(s): A total of 636 screws were implanted (222 pedicle screws, 190 cannulated and 224 cannulated screws with PMMA augmentation). At FU, we found significative differences between populations in terms of mechanical performances. We founded five cases of loosening; these were reported in solid screws group and in cannulated screws one. No mechanical failures were reported in cannulated screws with augmentation of PMMA. No rods breakage cases were reported. Conclusion(s): All stabilization methods showed good clinical results, but cannulated screws augmented with PMMA seem to provide better implant stability with the lowest rate of loosening.

2188,"Spanish translation and psychometric evaluation of the Healthcare Professional Knowledge of Radiation Protection scale. The objective of this work was to make an intercultural adaptation and provide a Spanish translation and psychometric evaluation of the original English version of the Healthcare Professional Knowledge of Radiation Protection (HPKRP) scale. The Spanish translation was carried out following international guidelines for the process of cross-cultural adaptation of self-report measures. A cross-sectional design study was carried out. One hundred and thirty-eight nurses from four different hospitals in Barcelona (Spain) completed the Spanish version of the scale. The total score of the scale was calculated. The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) was used to evaluate a possible correlation between score and years of experience. A t-test for independent samples was used to evaluate significant differences between different groups. Cronbach's alpha, the corrected item-total correlation coefficient and the test-retest coefficient were used to determine internal consistency. The exploratory factor and parallel analysis were also calculated. All statistical tests were carried out with a level of significance alpha = 0.05. The mean scale score was poor among Spanish nurses. The PCC between total score and years of experience showed a non-significant correlation (p > 0.05). No differences were found between nurses who worked in radiation-exposed units and those who worked in units without radiation exposure (p > 0.05). A Cronbach alpha of 0.98 was obtained for the items of the scale. The corrected item-total correlation range was 0.5-0.8. The test-retest correlation coefficient was 0.9. The exploratory analysis factor showed a single factorial structure which explained 60.86% of the variance. The new scale translated into Spanish (Sp-HPKRP) could be used to evaluate the degree of knowledge about radiological protection.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether an intraoral stent may decrease radiation dose to health tissues during intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and to evaluate the effect on mucositis., STUDY DESIGN: A total of 33 patients with tongue or floor of the mouth cancer were retrospectively evaluated and divided into 2 groups: group 1 (with stent, n = 19) and group 2 (without stent, n = 14). Data were collected on dosimetric and mucositis outcomes., RESULTS: The mean dose to the maxilla was significantly lower in group 1 (20.9 Gy) than in group 2 (35.8 Gy) (P = .05). The mean dose to the ipsilateral parotid was 35.0 Gy in group 1 vs 41.8 Gy in group 2 (P = .05). No difference was seen in the severity of mucositis between groups (P = .82). However, grade III mucositis was present in group 1 at 4 weeks after IMRT, 1 week after its occurrence in group 2., CONCLUSIONS: A stent was effective in decreasing doses to healthy structures and delaying the emergence of mucositis.Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc.

4114,"Genetic susceptibility to thymic lymphomas and K-ras gene mutation in mice after exposure to X-rays and N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea. PURPOSE: Ras activation is one of the major mechanisms for the development of murine thymic lymphomas by radiation and chemical carcinogens. To gain insight into the relationship between genetic susceptibility and ras gene mutation, the frequency and spectrum of ras gene mutation was examined in thymic lymphomas from susceptible and resistant mice., MATERIALS AND METHODS: K- and N-ras mutations in thymic lymphomas that arose in X-ray-irradiated and N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-treated mice of susceptible C57BL/6, rather resistant C3H and their hybrid B6C3F1 were analysed by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism and subsequent DNA sequencing., RESULTS: C57BL/6 exhibited a higher incidence of thymic lymphomas after exposure to X-rays and ENU than C3H, with B6C3F1 being intermediate. K-ras gene mutations occurred frequently in the pathogenesis of ENU-induced thymic lymphomas in susceptible C57BL/6 as opposed to resistant C3H. The ras mutations were more frequent in ENU-induced thymic lymphomas than X-ray-induced thymic lymphomas, and with the latter, there was no clear evidence for strain differences, suggesting that the genetic susceptibility to X-rays was independent of ras activation. The mutations of K-ras in thymic lymphomas from C57BL/6 were predominantly GGT to GAT in codon 12, whereas this mutation type was never found in those from C3H. No strain difference was observed in the nucleotide sequence or expression levels of O(6)-alkylguanine alkyltransferase, indicating that this enzyme did not account for the genetic susceptibility to ras activation., CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that there is a clear strain and carcinogen dependency of K-ras mutation and that the frequency of ras mutation might determine the genetic susceptibility to ENU-induced lymphomagenesis, whereas pathways independent of ras activation might determine the susceptibility to X-ray-induced lymphomagenesis.",Included
1054,"Third-generation iterative reconstruction on a dual-source, high-pitch, low-dose chest CT protocol with tin filter for spectral shaping at 100 kV: a study on a small series of COVID-19 patients. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the role of third-generation iterative reconstruction (ADMIRE) in dual-source, high-pitch chest CT protocol with spectral shaping at 100 kVp in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHOD(S): Confirmed COVID-19 inpatients undergoing to unenhanced chest CT were scanned with a dual-energy acquisition (DECT, 90/150Sn kV) and a dual-source, high-pitch acquisition with tin-filtered 100 kVp (LDCT). On the DECT with ADMIRE 3 (DECT3) were evaluated the pulmonary findings and their extension (25-point score). Two radiologists in consensus evaluated with 5-point scales the overall image quality, the anatomical structures, and the elementary findings on LDCT reconstructed with filtered backprojection (LDCT0), with ADMIRE 3 (LDCT3) and 5 (LDCT5), and on DECT3. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the body mass index, the exposure times, and the radiation doses were recorded. RESULT(S): Seventy-five patients (57 M/18F; median age: 63 y.o.) were included, with median pulmonary extension of 13/25 points. The imaging findings were detected in proportion comparable to the available literature. The ADMIRE significantly improved the SNR in LDCT (p<0.00001) with almost no significant differences in overweight patients. The LDCT had median effective dose of 0.39 mSv and acquisition time of 0.71 s with significantly less motion artifacts than DECT (p<0.00001). The DECT3 and LDCT3 provided the best image quality and depiction of pulmonary anatomy and imaging findings, with significant differences among all the series (p<0.00001). CONCLUSION(S): The LDCT with spectral shaping and ADMIRE3 provided acceptable image quality in the evaluation of patients with COVID-19, with significantly reduced radiation dose and motion artifacts.",Excluded
4357,"Extracorporeal irradiation of tumorous calvaria: a case series. OBJECT When intracranial tumors invade the overlying skull, gross resection typically includes removal of the involved bone. Methods used to repair the resulting structural defect in the cranium include artificial prostheses, allogeneic bone grafts, and autoclaving the autologous graft. The authors have previously reported a case involving high-dose extracorporeal ionizing radiation to treat the tumorous calvaria intraoperatively, followed by reimplantation of the treated bone flap. In this paper the authors report the long-term follow-up of that case, as well as results of using extracorporeal irradiation of tumorous calvaria (EITC) for an additional 20 patients treated similarly. METHODS The decision to undergo EITC was typically anticipated preoperatively, but determined intraoperatively, if upon inspection the bone flap was invaded by tumor. The bone flap was then delivered to the radiation oncology department, where a total dose of 120 Gy was delivered, using a clinical linear accelerator, over a period of approximately 15 minutes. After the intracranial tumor resection was completed, the irradiated craniotomy bone flap was reimplanted and the wound was closed in a standard fashion. A retrospective review of patients who had undergone EITC was performed for evidence of calvarial tumor recurrence or other complications. RESULTS Since the originally reported case, 20 additional patients have received EITC during craniotomy for invasive tumors. Eighteen (86%) of 21 patients were diagnosed with meningioma: 12 (67%) with WHO Grade I, 5 (28%) with WHO Grade II, and 1 with WHO Grade III (6%). The remaining 3 patients presented with dural-based B-cell lymphoma with extensive adjacent bone invasion (n = 2) and metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung (n = 1). Follow-up of the 21 patients ranged from 1 to 132 months, with a mean of 41 months and a median of 23 months. No patients have experienced tumor recurrence, infection associated with the treated calvaria, or evidence of bone flap resorption. CONCLUSIONS Calvaria reconstructions represent an important component in structural and cosmetic outcome following craniectomy for tumorous bone. The authors' long-term experience with EITC has been excellent with no local tumor recurrence or complications. Therefore, EITC represents an excellent and efficient option for cranial reconstruction in such patients.",Excluded
3080,"Finger joint cartilage evaluated by ultrasound and X-ray in rheumatoid arthritis and control joints. Background: Joint destruction in RA includes both bone and cartilage lesions. By X-ray examination, cartilage destruction is evaluated as a joint space narrowing (JSN). However, joint space narrowing is not a direct evaluation of cartilage. Objective(s): The aim of the study was to examine the finger joint cartilage by ultrasound (US) imaging and to compare it with JSN score in relation to clinical relevance. Method(s): We enrolled 27 RA patients in low disease activity or clinical remission (DAS28-CRP <2.7) and 21 healthy controls in this study. The cartilage thickness (CT) of metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints of 2nd to 5th fingers was bilaterally visualized and measured from a dorsal view, with approximately 90 degrees flexion. In addition, JSN of finger were scored by van der Heijde- modified Sharp method. Result(s): In patients with RA, CT in MCP joints ranged from 0.0 to 0.8 mm (median 0.4 mm), and CT in PIP ranged from 0.0 to 0.4mm (median 0.2mm), respectively. The sum of total CT from 8 fingers ranged from 2.7 to 6.8 mm (median 4.7 mm), and there was a significant difference in CT, but not in JSN score, between male and female patients (5.6 versus 4.6, respectively, p=0.005). Healthy controls had the sum of total CT significantly thicker as compared with RA (p<=0.001). Importantly, CT was well correlated with JSN (r=-0.696, p<0.001). Although CT was not correlated with age, disease duration, DAS28-CRP, functional disability score, positivity of rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP-antibody, CT was reduced in RA patients with elevated serum matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) values compared with those with normal MMP-3 (3.9 versus 5.0, p=0.015). Conclusion(s): The US method of direct visualization and quantification of cartilage in MCP and PIP joints can be valid and useful in RA, and our results may support the importance of MMP-3 in the pathophysiology of cartilage destruction.",Excluded
4753,"Radiation exposure to staff in intensive care unit with portable CT scanner. Background. Bedside radiological procedures pose a risk of radiation exposure to ICU staff. The perception of risk may increase the degree of caution among the health care staff and raise new barriers preventing patients from obtaining prompt care. Objective. The aim of this study was to estimate the annual cumulative radiation dose to individual ICU staff. Methods. In this prospective study, forty subjects were required to wear thermoluminescent dosimeter badges during their working hours. The badges were analyzed to determine the exposure after 3 months. Results. A total of 802 radiological procedures were completed at bedside during the study period. The estimated annual dosage to doctors and nurses on average was 0.99 mSv and 0.88 mSv (p < 0.001), respectively. Residents were subjected to the highest radiation exposure (1.04 mSv per year, p = 0.002). The radiation dose was correlated with day shift working hours (r = 0.426; p = 0.006) and length of service (r = - 0.403; p < 0.01). Conclusions. With standard precautions, bedside radiological procedures - including portable CT scans - do not expose ICU staff to high dose of ionizing radiation. The level of radiation exposure is related to the daytime working hours and length of service.Copyright Â© 2016 Zhichao Xie et al.",Excluded

2838,"Physiological, behavioral, and serological responses of horses to shaded or unshaded pens in a hot, sunny environment. Housing recommendations for horses invariably include providing access to shade on hot, sunny days, but the potential benefits have not been scientifically studied. This experiment measured physiological, behavioral, and serological responses of horses confined individually to completely shaded (SH) or completely unshaded (SUN) drylot pens during the summer in Davis, CA. Twelve healthy adult horses in a crossover design experienced both treatments for 5 d each. Rectal temperature, respiration rate, skin temperature, and sweat scores were recorded hourly from 1230 to 1730 h daily. Observations were recorded from 1200 to 1800 h for proximity to water, foraging, locomotion, and insect avoidance behaviors. Daily blood samples were obtained to measure cortisol, hematocrit, and neutrophil- to-lymphocyte ratio. Automated and handheld sensors were used to record environmental conditions. The mean ambient temperature from 1200 to 1800 h during the study was 30.6degreeC. Rectal temperature was greater for horses in SUN than for SH (mean 37.8degreeC and 37.5degreeC, respectively, SE = 0.06, P = 0.002) as was respiration rate (25.5 and 20.5 breaths/min, SE = 1.3, P = 0.008), and skin temperature (35.6degreeC and 34.6degreeC, SE = 0.1, P < 0.001). Horses in SUN showed sweat in 51.4% of observations vs. 1.1% for horses in SH. Horses in SUN spent more time than SH horses standing near their water source (34.0% of observations vs. 20.2%, SE = 0.3, P = 0.004). No differences were observed for foraging, locomotion, or insect avoidance behavior (P > 0.05). Cortisol concentrations were greater in SUN than SH (3.4 and 2.6 mug/dL, respectively, P < 0.001) but remained within the normal range for resting horses. No treatment differences were observed for hematocrit or neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (P > 0.05). Horses exhibited treatment differences in the physiological measures first, most notably in rectal temperature at 1230 h, corresponding to peak solar radiation. Behavioral responses followed these physiological changes, with treatment differences in time standing near water becoming apparent at 1400 h as ambient and black globe temperature increased. Our results indicate that both the SH and SUN treatment groups exhibited thermoregulatory responses to these summer conditions and horses benefited from shade, as it mitigated these physiological and behavioral changes. These results are applicable in developing best management practices for the care of domestic horses. Â© 2013 American Society of Animal Science. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1369,"Concurrent Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) and Radiation Therapy for Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma: A Prospective Safety and Feasibility Study. Background: TTFields are a loco-regional, anti-mitotic treatment comprising low-intensity alternating electric fields. In the EF-14 study of newly diagnosed glioblastoma (ndGBM), TTFields in combination with temozolomide (TMZ) significantly improved survival vs. TMZ alone. In preclinical studies TTFields had a radiosensitizing effect and increased the efficacy of radiation therapy (RT). This study prospectively evaluated the feasibility and safety of TTFields administered concurrently with RT and TMZ in ndGBM patients. Method(s): Patients with histologically confirmed ndGBM were treated with TTFields/RT/TMZ followed by adjuvant TMZ/TTFields. TTFields (200 kHz) were delivered for >=18 hours/day with transducer arrays removed during RT delivery. RT was administered to the tumor bed in 30 fractions (total dose 60 Gy) combined with daily TMZ (75 mg/m2). In the adjuvant phase, patients received monthly TMZ (150-200 mg/m2 for 5 days) plus TTFields. Patients were followed for 24 months or until second disease progression. The primary outcome was safety of the combined therapies; secondary outcomes included progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Adverse events (AEs) were graded per CTCAE v4.0. Result(s): Ten patients were enrolled at a single center between April and December 2017. Median age was 60.2 years, median Karnofsky Performance Score was 90.0, and 80% patients were male. Five (50%) patients had undergone tumor resection while the remainder had biopsy only. Eight patients experienced >=1 RT treatment delay; delays were unrelated to TTFields treatment. All patients experienced >=1 AE. Three patients suffered from serious AEs (urinary tract infection, confusional state, and decubitus ulcer) that were considered unrelated to TTFields. The most common AE was skin toxicity, reported in eight (80%) patients; all were of low severity (CTCAE grade 1-2) and were reported as related to TTFields treatment. Median PFS from enrollment was 8.9 months; median OS was not reached at the time of study closure. Conclusion(s): Eighty percent of patients experienced grade 1-2 TTFields-related skin toxicity. No other TTFields-related toxicities were observed without an increase in RT- or TMZ-related toxicities as a result of combining TTFields with these therapies. Preliminary efficacy results are promising and warrant further investigation of concurrent TTFields/RT/TMZ treatment in ndGBM patients.Â© Copyright Â© 2020 Bokstein, Blumenthal, Limon, Harosh, Ram and Grossman.",Excluded
4511,"Cardiac valve calcifications on low-dose unenhanced ungated chest computed tomography: Inter-observer and inter-examination reliability, agreement and variability. Objectives: To determine inter-observer and inter-examination variability for aortic valve calcification (AVC) and mitral valve and annulus calcification (MC) in low-dose unenhanced ungated lung cancer screening chest computed tomography (CT). Method(s): We included 578 lung cancer screening trial participants who were examined by CT twice within 3 months to follow indeterminate pulmonary nodules. On these CTs, AVC and MC were measured in cubic millimetres. One hundred CTs were examined by five observers to determine the inter-observer variability. Reliability was assessed by kappa statistics (kappa) and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs). Variability was expressed as the mean difference +/- standard deviation (SD). Result(s): Inter-examination reliability was excellent for AVC (kappa=0.94, ICC=0.96) and MC (kappa=0.95, ICC=0.90). Inter-examination variability was 12.7+/-118.2 mm3 for AVC and 31.5+/-219.2 mm3 for MC. Inter-observer reliability ranged from kappa=0.68 to kappa=0.92 for AVC and from kappa=0.20 to kappa=0.66 for MC. Inter-observer ICC was 0.94 for AVC and ranged from 0.56 to 0.97 for MC. Inter-observer variability ranged from -30.5+/-252.0 mm3 to 84.0+/-240.5 mm3 for AVC and from -95.2+/-210.0 mm3 to 303.7+/-501.6 mm 3 for MC. Conclusion(s): AVC can be quantified with excellent reliability on ungated unenhanced low-dose chest CT, but manual detection of MC can be subject to substantial inter-observer variability. Lung cancer screening CT may be used for detection and quantification of cardiac valve calcifications. Key points: * Low-dose unenhanced ungated chest computed tomography can detect cardiac valve calcifications. * However, calcified cardiac valves are not reported by most radiologists. * Inter-observer and inter-examination variability of aortic valve calcifications is sufficient for longitudinal studies. * Volumetric measurement variability of mitral valve and annulus calcifications is substantial.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To describe the experiences of radiation-induced xerostomia in patients with head and neck cancer., BACKGROUND: Xerostomia is the most commonly occurring complication during and following radiotherapy. It can persist for several months or years and can have a significant impact on patients' quality of life., DESIGN: This was a qualitative descriptive study., METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a sample of 20 participants. Inductive content analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data., RESULTS: Analysis of the manifest content identified five categories: communication problems, physical problems, psychosocial problems, treatment problems and relief strategies. The latent content was formulated into a theme: due to lack of information from professionals, the patients had to find their own solutions for their problems., CONCLUSIONS: Xerostomia is not only a biophysical symptom but also has a profound effect on the emotional, intellectual and sociocultural dimensions of life. The majority of patients continued to suffer from xerostomia and its associated symptoms after radiotherapy, in part, because of a lack of professional support, including the inability of nurses to provide oral health care., RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses need to be knowledgeable about the effects of radiotherapy on oral mucosa and about appropriate interventions. The healthcare system requires a symptom management platform for radiation-induced complications, to help patients, their families and healthcare professionals obtain information about self-care, treatments and relief strategies.

Materials and Methods From 2004 to 2011, 138 patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 2002 stage II nasopharyngeal carcinoma were treated with curative radiotherapy in 12 hospitals in South Korea. Treatment methods included radiotherapy alone in 34 patients, neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy alone in seven, concurrent chemoradiotherapy in 80, and neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy in 17. Adjuvant chemotherapy was used in 42 patients. Total radiation dose ranged from 64 Gy to 74.2 Gy (median, 70 Gy). Results Median follow-up was 48 months (range, 7 to 97 months) for all patients. At the last followup, 13 patients had died and 32 had experienced treatment failure; locoregional failure occurred in 14, distant failure in 16, and both in two. Five-year locoregional relapse-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival, progression-free survival, and overall survival were 86.2%, 85.5%, 74.4%, and 88.2%, respectively. Multivariate analyses showed that the significant prognostic factors were concurrent chemotherapy and N stage for locoregional relapse-free survival, concurrent chemotherapy for progression-free survival, and age and N stage for overall survival. Neither neoadjuvant nor concurrent chemotherapy improved distant metastasis-free survival. Conclusion Concurrent chemotherapy significantly improved 5-year locoregional relapse-free survival and progression-free survival in stage II nasopharyngeal carcinoma. However, neoadjuvant chemotherapy failed to improve either.Copyright Â© 2015 by the Korean Cancer Association.",Excluded
4722,"The irradiation of babesia bovis. II. The immunogenicity of irradiated blood parasites for intact cattle and splenectomised calves. Intraerythrocytic forms of B. bovis were exposed to 350 Grays (Gy) gamma irradiation and were then injected intravenously into intact two and three year old Hereford steers. One of 15 steers died on initial infection and subsequently six steers were given a virulent heterologous challenge three weeks after recovery; all six animals were highly immune. The remaining eight animals were kept under quarantine conditions for 10 months and were then challenged with a different virulent heterologous strain of B. bovis. Seven of eight were highly immune, but one animal died. Subsequently a further 12 steers were injected intravenously with 1 X 10(8) irradiated organisms. All showed only mild transient clinical signs. After 12 months quarantine in a tick-free area these animals were then challenged with a virulent heterologous strain and all 12 were shown to be highly immune. Irradiation reduced the infective dose from 1 X 10(8) to 2.5 X 10(3) parasites. These parasites multiplied at the same rate, and achieved the same maximum parasitaemia as the parent non-irradiated strain, but the disease produced by them was not severe. A dose of 2.5 X 10(3) non-irradiated parasites was lethal to all of the four animals which received it. It was concluded that irradiation had produced a predominantly avirulent parasite population.",Excluded
4926,"Impact of chemical exposure on cancer mortality in a French cohort of uranium processing workers. Background: Nuclear workers may be exposed to a variety of chemical hazards, in addition to radiation. We examined the effect of chemical exposures on cancer mortality among French uranium processing workers at the AREVA NC Pierrelatte facility. Method(s): A cohort of 2,897 uranium processing workers employed for at least 6 months was followed from 1968 through 2006. Exposure to uranium and potentially carcinogenic chemicals was assessed with a plant-specific job-exposure matrix. Mortality hazard ratios (HRs) for cancers of the lung, lymphohematopoietic system, kidney and bladder, brain and central nervous system (BCNS), and prostate were estimated for each specific chemical exposure, with Cox regression models stratified for sex and calendar period and adjusted for socioeconomic status. Additional adjustments enabled us to examine the effect of co-exposure to uranium and other chemicals. Result(s): Exposure to aromatic solvents was associated with increased risk of BCNS malignancies after adjustment for other chemicals (HR=6.53, 95% CI=1.14-37.41; n=6) and for other chemicals and uranium (HR=7.26, 95% CI=0.90-58.19) in the annual exposure status model. Selected groups of lymphohematopoietic cancers were found associated with solvent exposure. Inconclusive results were found regarding chromium (VI) exposure, since only 2 workers died from lung cancer among 109 exposed. Conclusion(s): Based on our pilot study, it seemed important to take into account chemical exposures in the analyses of cancer mortality among French uranium processing workers. Am. J. Ind.

Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) performed by trainees may be related to increased radiation exposure. This study was aimed to investigate and quantify this learning effect, with fluoroscopy time and dose-area product (DAP) as parameters. We collected procedure data of the first to the fortieth cerebral DSA consecutively performed by 13 trainees in a training centre. DAP, procedure time, fluoroscopy time, number of cine-frames of the first 20 DSA procedures performed by these trainees were compared with that of the second 20 procedures. There was no significant difference concerning the procedure time between the first and the second 20 procedures (56.3 +/- 29.5 vs 51.5 +/- 20.2 min, p = 0.113). Numbers of cine-frames were very similar between the first and the second 20 procedures (750.7 +/- 290.3 vs 744.5 +/- 188.7, p = 0.830). Fluoroscopy time of the first 20 procedures was significantly longer than that of the second 20 procedures (17.8 +/- 15.4 vs 12.6 +/- 9.0, p = 0.001). DAP of the first 20 procedures was significantly higher than that of the second 20 procedures (6.4 +/- 4.9 vs 3.8 +/- 1.8, p < 0.001). DAP was correlated significantly with the performer's experience (R = -0.288, p < 0.001). There exists a learning effect of radiation exposure during cerebral DSA procedures performed by trainees. The learning effect is significant during the first 20 procedures, and becomes insignificant after 20 procedures. Insufficient catheter skills in novice trainees may be one reason for this effect.

Aim: The purpose of this study was the evaluation of the feasibility and outcome of definitive radio-chemotherapy without split-course technique but with individualised short treatment interruption in anal cancer patients. Method(s): Between 1993 and 2008, 101 patients with anal cancer were treated in our institution with definitive radio-chemotherapy with individualised short treatment interruptions. Treatment was halted independent of dose in case of acute grade 3 toxicities and started again until improvement. Short interruption was defined as completing treatment without exceeding six cumulative treatment days beyond a scheduled plan; otherwise, it was defined as prolonged interruption. Result(s): Median overall treatment time was 47 days corresponding to an interruption of six cumulative treatment days. Fifty-one patients (50%) had treatment interruption of >=6 days. No acute grade 4 toxicities were observed. One fatality occurred during treatment due to ileus-like symptoms according to acute grade 5 toxicity. After a median follow-up of 56 months, the 5-year actuarial rates for local control comparing patients with short vs. prolonged treatment interruption were 78% vs. 81% (p=0.904) and, for colostomy-free survival, 83% vs. 85% (p=0.784), respectively.

1923,"Radiotherapeutic factors affecting the incidence of developing hypothyroidism after radiotherapy for head and neck squamous cell cancer. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to determine radiotherapy (RT) dose-volumetric threshold of radiation-induced hypothyroidism (HT) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients., PATIENTS AND METHODS: The diagnosis of HT in 78 HNSCC patients treated with RT was based on a thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level greater than the maximum value of laboratory range. In all patients, dose-volumetric parameters were analyzed according to their relation to development of HT, and thyroid volumes spared from doses >=10, 20, 30, 40 and 50Gy (V10, V20, V30, V40 and V50) were analyzed from the dose volume histograms (DVHs)., RESULTS: Median follow-up duration was 31months. At the end of study, 33 patients (42.3%) developed HT and the cumulative incidence of HT was 24.6%, 36.5% and 42.3% at one, two and three years, respectively. V30 of 42.1% (P=0.005) was defined as dose-volumetric threshold of radiation-induced HT in HNSCC patients. Our analysis showed that V30 separates patients into low- and high-risk groups; the incidence of radiation-induced HT in the group with V30<42.1% and V30>=42.1% was 29.4% and 71.4%, respectively (P=0.002)., CONCLUSIONS: The V30 may predict risk of developing HT after RT for HNSCC patients. V30 of 42.1%, defined as dose-volumetric threshold of radiation-induced HT, can be useful in treatment planning of HNSCC patients. Copyright Â© 2018 National Cancer Institute, Cairo University.

3330,"Endocrine function and reproductive impairment in an irradiated population of the lizard Uta stansburiana. This study describes gonadal changes in lizards (Uta stansburiana) exposed to chronic low levels of gamma radiation (1.5-10 R/day) under field conditions and attempts to evaluate endocrine involvement in these changes. Reproductive impairment in irradiated males is demonstrated during the breeding season by reduced testes weights and by seminiferous tubules devoid of germ cells. Ultrastructural morphology of Leydig cells, plasma testosterone levels, and developed accessory sex structures indicate normal steroidogenesis in such males; cytology of the pituitary gonadotropes and pituitary gonadotropin content indicate normal gonadotropin levels. These findings suggest that low levels of radiation affect the spermatogenic process directly, rather than through damage to the pituitary. Comparable irradiation causes complete resorption of ovarian tissue in some female Uta. The oviducts are atrophic and the pituitary gonadotropes hyperactive. Resemblance of gonadotropes to those of castrated animals and reduced pituitary hormone content suggest elevated levels of gonadotropin production, probably due to the absence of ovarian steroid feedback in affected animals. The continued mitotic activity of oogonia in adult reptiles and their limited number contribute to the vulnerability of germinal tissue in irradiated female lizards. Destruction of the germ cells is accompanied by resorption of all ovarian tissue including steroidogenic elements. Thus, in females as in males, radiation appears to damage gametogenesis rather than pituitary function.",Excluded
1558,"Validation of a Dose Assessment Method to be Used in 18F FDG Loose Contamination Exercises. ABSTRACT: Radiological emergency response may require responders to operate in contaminated environments. To provide more realistic training to these individuals, it has been proposed to disperse low amounts of short-lived radioactive material in simulated emergency scenarios. To demonstrate the applicability and safety of such activities, a limited exercise was conducted where 18F was sprayed in a small area and survey activities were executed. A pre-job external radiation exposure dose assessment was performed in preparation for this training. The research presented here compares participant external recorded doses to assessment results in order to validate the dose estimates. Two individuals were used during the dispersion, search, and survey activities. First, a radiation worker mixed 200 MBq Fludeoxyglucose 18F with 470 mL H2O in a weed sprayer and distributed it over a 3 m x 3 m area. After evaporation, an exercise participant performed search and survey activities in the area. Actual whole-body doses measured with optically stimulated luminescence dosimeters were 10 +/- 1 muSv for both personnel. Whole-body digital dosimeters read 4.3 +/- 0.2 muSv and 3.3 +/- 0.5 muSv for the radiation worker and exercise participant, respectively. Actual extremity doses were below the dosimeters' minimum detectable limits for the radiation worker (thermoluminescence dosimeter) and exercise participant (optically stimulated luminescence dosimeter). The dose assessment-predicted whole-body doses were 2.8 +/- 0.4 muSv and 3.2 +/- 0.1 muSv for the radiation worker and exercise participant, respectively. The estimated dose to the radiation worker's hand was 21.8 +/- 3.8 muSv, and the estimated dose to the exercise participant's knee was 13.4 +/- 0.6 muSv. The study provided substantial evidence for the validity of the dose assessment method, supporting its use for a larger training exercise.Copyright Â© 2021 Health Physics Society.",Excluded
2151,"Imaging changes over 18 months following stereotactic radiosurgery for brain metastases: both late radiation necrosis and tumor progression can occur. Following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for brain metastases, the median time range to develop adverse radiation effect (ARE) or radiation necrosis is 7-11 months. Similarly, the risk of local tumor recurrence following SRS is OpenSPiltSPi 5% after 18 months. With improvements in systemic therapy, patients are living longer and are at risk for both late (defined as CloseSPigtSPi 18 months after SRS) tumor recurrence and late ARE, which have not previously been well described. An IRB-approved, retrospective review identified patients treated with SRS who developed new MRI contrast enhancement CloseSPigtSPi 18 months following SRS. ARE was defined as stabilization/shrinkage of the lesion over time or pathologic confirmation of necrosis, without tumor. Local failure (LF) was defined as continued enlargement of the lesion over time or pathologic confirmation of tumor. We identified 16 patients, with a median follow-up of 48.2 months and median overall survival of 73.0 months, who had 19 metastases with late imaging changes occurring a median of 32.9 months (range 18.5-63.2 months) after SRS. Following SRS, 12 lesions had late ARE at a median of 33.2 months and 7 lesions had late LF occurring a median of 23.6 months. As patients with cancer live longer and as SRS is increasingly utilized for treatment of brain metastases, the incidence of these previously rare imaging changes is likely to increase. Clinicians should be aware of these late events, with ARE occurring up to 5.3 years and local failure up to 3.8 years following SRS in our cohort.Copyright Â© 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Excluded

The characteristics and estimated effective dose of CTs unrelated to the final diagnosis were analyzed. The factors affecting the estimated effective dose of CTs unrelated to final diagnosis were investigated., Results. More than half of all CT examinations were not associated with the final diagnosis. The additional estimated effective dose due to CTs being unrelated to the final diagnosis in each patient was a sufficient amount of radiation exposure to increase the possibility of fatal cancer., Introduction. Computed tomography (CT) has many diagnostic advantages, spurring growth in the number of CT examinations. As the use of CT increases, the potential for radiation-induced adverse effects has become an issue. The primary objective of this study was to assess the liberal use of CT induced radiation exposure in patients with multiple blunt traumas. The secondary objective was to investigate the factors affecting the estimated effective dose resulting from CTs unrelated to final diagnosis., Conclusion. A considerable number of CT scans were unrelated to the patient's final diagnosis, which exposes the patient to additional radiation exposure.Copyright Â©, Pharmamed Mado Ltd.

1575,"IL-6 promotes stemness of cancer stem cells and may contribute to radiation resistance of non-small cell lung cancer. Background: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among both men and women. Long-term survival of lung cancer patients remains low despite aggressive therapies including surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Ionizing radiation (IR) is the standard therapy for patients diagnosed with localized unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However local tumor control by standard fractionated radiotherapy (RT) remains poor due to tumor resistance to IR. Accumulating evidences have indicated that cancer stem cells (CSCs, also known as cancer initiating cells) exist as a very minor population in NSCLC tumors, which are composed of heterogeneous cell populations. Our laboratory and others found that CSC population increases upon irradiation, which may contribute to radiation resistance. The role of IL-6 in NSCLC progression has been suggested since high IL-6 levels were detected in sera of lung cancer patients, but not detectable in most patients with benign lung diseases. However, the exact mechanism by which IL-6 influences lung cancer progression and its role in CSCs mediated radioresistance remain unresolved. Method(s): We isolated CD133+ CSC population from 3 NSCLC cell lines (NSCLC-CSCs) and studied the role of IL-6 in CD133+ CSCs growth by treating cells with IL-6. In addition, we manipulated IL-6 expression levels in the IL-6 expressing A549 and H157 cells by the knockdown of IL-6 using lentiviral infection system carrying IL-6siRNA and isolated CD133+ cells for further analyses. The growth and stem cell marker expressions of these CSCs, IL-6 treated or non-treated, or IL-6 expressing or knocked down cells upon irradiation were then investigated. The differences in the activation of signaling pathways and neuroendocrine differentiation were also studied. Results and Conclusion(s): We found that IL-6 increased self-renewal of NSCLC-CSCs significantly and thereby increased NSCLC-CSC population. We also found that IL-6 increased stemness of the isolated CD133+ CSCs when CD133+ cells were treated with IL-6. More importantly, when we irradiated the CD133+ CSCs isolated from the IL-6 knocked down and scramble control A549 cells, we found that the CSCs isolated from the IL-6 knocked down cells exhibited lower survival than the CSCs of control cells. Therefore, we suggest that IL-6 may contribute to NSCLC-CSCs mediated-radioresistance via (i) direct triggering radioresistance, and (ii) increasing self-renewal and stemness of the survived CSCs. Mechanistic dissection studies revealed that the increased self-renewal of CSCs by IL-6 is due to the activation of the hedgehog signaling and the increased expression of bcl-2, while the IL-6 mediated increase of radioresistance is due to the activation of neuroendocrine differentiation, Stat 3 signaling pathway, and increased expression of bcl-2.",Excluded
2313,"Organ doses, effective dose, and cancer risk from coronary CT angiography examinations. OBJECTIVE. The purposes of this study were to determine organ and effective doses and to estimate the risk of exposure-induced cancer death (REID) associated with coronary CT angiography (CCTA) examinations. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. CCTA examinations were performed in three stages: calcium score, monitoring, and cardiac phases for all patients. Effective dose was calculated using two methods. The first was based on the scanner-derived dose-length product, and the second entailed use of an organ and effective dose calculator software application. Organ doses were calculated on the basis of the tissue weighting factors of International Commission on Radiation Protection report 103. REID values were assessed with a cancer risk estimator software application. RESULTS. The study included 185 patients (95 men, 90 women). For women, breast doses were high at 52.04 +/- 14.08 mGy. The mean effective dose in the women was greater than that in the men (24.05 vs 16.30 mSv, p < 0.05). The mean REID values in patients undergoing CCTA with a 64-MDCT scanner were 13.4 per 10,000 men (1 in 746) and 19.6 per 10,000 women (1 in 508). The REID values were considerably higher for the younger women. CONCLUSION. The results of this study will help referring physicians justify requesting CCTA examinations by considering their benefits for diagnosis on the one hand and awareness of the risk of radiation-induced cancer on the other. In the case of CCTA scans that are properly justified by clinical indication, patients and physicians should not be concerned about the radiation risks.Copyright Â© American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded
2084,"Management and long-term outcomes of sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma: Twenty-year experience at a single institution. Purpose/Objective(s): Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC) is a rare malignancy of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses generally associated with an aggressive clinical course and poor long-term survival. Optimal management is not well-defined, and varying combinations of surgery (S), radiation therapy (RT) and chemotherapy (CT) have been reported. There have been substantial advances in surgery as well as radiation therapy, which may offer improved outcomes. We review the management approaches, long-term outcomes, and patterns of failure of patients treated at our institution to help define the optimal management for this rare malignancy. Materials/Methods: Fifteen patients with SNUC were treated from 1992- 2012 at our institution, with pathology reviewed and confirmed. Demographic, treatment, and clinical data were collected from medical records. Patients underwent imaging evaluation with CT and/or MRI. Event outcomes were calculated from date of surgery to time of recurrence, death, or last follow-up. Survival statistics were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier and Cox Regression methods. Result(s): There were 10 male and 5 female patients with median age 49 years (range 22-82). Most patients had locally advanced T stage: T2 (n = 2), T3 (n = 5), and T4 (n = 8). At diagnosis, 1 patient was clinically node positive and none had distant metastases. Treatment was as follows: 4 S + postoperative RT +/- chemotherapy (CT); 3 preoperative chemoradiation (CRT) + S; 7 primary CRT; 1 RT alone. Nine had RT to primary site alone, and 6 had elective neck RT. Median dose was 69.5 Gy (range 50.4-70.2). Most received concurrent CT (n = 12). Median follow up was 39 months (range 3-206). At time of analysis, 8 patients are alive, 6 have died and 1 is lost to follow up. KM projected 5-year OS and RFS-rates were 70% and 53%, respectively. Five patients recurred: 1 local, 1 local/neck, 1 neck, 1 distant, 1 local/neck/distant. Median time to recurrence was 7 months. On univariate analysis, there was no statistically significant impact of stage, use of surgery, use of chemotherapy, radiation dose, gender, or age on survival. A trend for improved survival with concurrent CRT was seen (p = 0.097). Conclusion(s): SNUC is a highly aggressive malignancy associated with a high risk of disease recurrence, consistent with other series reported in the literature. There are some long term survivors who were treated with primary CRT or preoperative CRT followed by surgery. Early multimodality therapy is necessary for improved outcomes. The optimal timing and sequence of S, RT and CT should be further investigated.",Excluded
1045,"Assessment of pulmonary 18F-FDG-PET uptake and cytokine profiles in non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with radiotherapy and erlotinib. Purpose To investigate effects of radiotherapy (RT) and erlotinib on pulmonary glucose uptake using 2-deoxy-2-(18F)fluoro-D-glucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) during and after treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to identify associations between serum cytokine levels and lung glucose uptake. Material and methods Twenty-seven patients with advanced NSCLC, receiving RT alone or concomitant RT and erlotinib therapy, were examined by 18F-FDG PET before, during, and after treatment. A total of 57 18F-FDG PET scans were analyzed. Pulmonary 18F-FDG uptake and radiotherapy dose mapping were used to acquire dose-response curves for each patient, where subsequent linear regression gave a glucose uptake level in the un-irradiated parts of the lungs (SUV0) and a response slope (DELTASUV). Serum cytokine levels at corresponding time points were assessed using a multiplex bioassay. Correlations between the most robust cytokines and lung 18F-FDG dose response parameters were further investigated. Results From the dose response analysis, SUV0 at post-therapy was significantly higher (P < 0.001) than at mid- and pre-therapy (45% and 58%, respectively) for the group receiving RT + erlotinib. Also, SUV0 at post-therapy was higher for patients receiving RT + erlotinib compared to RT alone (42%; P < 0.001). No differences in DELTASUV were seen with treatments or time. SUV0 was positively associated (r = 0.47, P = 0.01) with serum levels of the chemokine C-C motif ligand 21 (CCL21) for patients receiving RT + erlotinib. Conclusions Concomitant RT and erlotinib causes an elevation in pulmonary 18F-FDG uptake post treatment compared to RT alone. Pulmonary glucose uptake is associated with an upregulation of a chemokine (CCL21) involved in inflammatory reactions.Copyright Â© 2017 The Authors",Excluded
1047,"Thermophysiological consequences of whole body resonant RF exposure (100 MHz) in human volunteers. Thermophysiological responses of heat production and heat loss were measured in seven adult volunteers (six males and one female, aged 31-74 years) during 45 min dorsal exposures of the whole body to 100 MHz continuous wave (CW) radio frequency (RF) energy. Three power densities (PD) (average PD = 4, 6, and 8 mW/cm(2); whole body specific absorption rate [SAR] = 0.068 [W/kg]/[mW/cm(2)]) were tested in each of three ambient temperatures (T(a) = 24, 28, and 31 degrees C), as well as in T(a) controls (no RF). A standardized protocol (30 min baseline, 45 min RF or sham exposure, 10 min baseline) was used. Measured responses included esophageal and seven skin temperatures, metabolic heat production, local sweat rate, and local skin blood flow. No changes in metabolic heat production occurred under any test condition. Unlike published results of similar exposures at 450 and 2450 MHz, local skin temperatures, even those on the back that were irradiated directly, changed little or not at all during 100 MHz exposures. The sole exception was the temperature of the ankle skin, which increased by 3-4 degrees C in some subjects at PD = 8 mW/cm(2). During the 45 min RF exposure, esophageal temperature showed modest changes (range = -0.15 to 0.13 degrees C) and never exceeded 37.2 degrees C. Thermoregulation was principally controlled by appropriate increases in evaporative heat loss (sweating) and, to a lesser extent, by changes in skin blood flow. Because of the deep penetration of RF energy at this frequency, effectively bypassing the skin, these changes must have been stimulated by thermal receptors deep in the body rather than those located in the skin.

1734,"Astronaut EVA exposure estimates from CAD model spacesuit geometry. Ongoing assembly and maintenance activities at the International Space Station (ISS) require much more extravehicular activity (EVA) than did the earlier U.S. Space Shuttle missions. It is thus desirable to determine and analyze, and possibly foresee, as accurately as possible what radiation exposures crew members involved in EVAs will experience in order to minimize risks and to establish exposure limits that must not to be exceeded. A detailed CAD model of the U.S. Space Shuttle EVA Spacesuit, developed at NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC), is used to represent the directional shielding of an astronaut; it has detailed helmet and backpack structures, hard upper torso, and multilayer space suit fabric material. The NASA Computerized Anatomical Male and Female (CAM and CAF) models are used in conjunction with the space suit CAD model for dose evaluation within the human body. The particle environments are taken from the orbit-averaged NASA AP8 and AE8 models at solar cycle maxima and minima. The transport of energetic particles through space suit materials and body tissue is calculated by using the NASA LaRC HZETRN code for hadrons and a recently developed deterministic transport code, ELTRN, for electrons. The doses within the CAM and CAF models are determined from energy deposition at given target points along 968 directional rays convergent on the points and are evaluated for several points on the skin and within the body. Dosimetric quantities include contributions from primary protons, light ions, and electrons, as well as from secondary brehmsstrahlung and target fragments.

Mucositis is the limiting toxicity of radio(chemo)therapy of head and neck cancer. Diagnostics, prophylaxis and correction of this condition demand new accurate and objective approaches. Here we report on an in vivo longitudinal monitoring of the oral mucosa dynamics in 25 patients during the course of radiotherapy of oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal cancer using multifunctional optical coherence tomography (OCT). A spectral domain OCT system with a specially-designed oral imaging probe was used. Microvasculature visualization was based on temporal speckle variations of the full complex signal evaluated by high-pass filtering of 3D data along the slow scan axis. Angiographic image quantification demonstrated an increase of the vascular density and total length of capillary-like-vessels before visual signs or clinical symptoms of mucositis occur. Especially significant microvascular changes compared to their initial levels occurred when grade two and three mucositis developed. Further, microvascular reaction was seen to be dose-level dependent. OCT monitoring in radiotherapy offers a non-invasive, convenient, label-free quantifiable structural and functional volumetric imaging method suitable for longitudinal human patient studies, furnishing fundamental radiobiological insights and potentially providing useful feedback data to enable adaptive radiotherapy (ART).",Excluded
952,"Variants in the ATM-CHEK2-BRCA1 axis determine genetic predisposition and clinical presentation of papillary thyroid carcinoma. The risk of developing papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), the most frequent form of thyroid malignancy, is elevated up to 8.6-fold in first-degree relatives of PTC patients. The familial risk could be explained by high-penetrance mutations in yet unidentified genes, or polygenic action of low-penetrance alleles. Since the DNA-damaging exposure to ionizing radiation is a known risk factor for thyroid cancer, polymorphisms in DNA repair genes are likely to affect this risk. In a search for low-penetrance susceptibility alleles we employed Sequenom technology to genotype deleterious polymorphisms in ATM, CHEK2, and BRCA1 in 1,781 PTC patients and 2,081 healthy controls. As a result of the study, we identified CHEK2 rs17879961 (OR=2.2, P=2.37e-10) and BRCA1 rs16941 (odds ratio [OR]=1.16, P=0.005) as risk alleles for PTC. The ATM rs1801516 variant modifies the risk associated with the BRCA1 variant by 0.78 (P=0.02).

3464,"[Influence of the dose rate and postradiation hyperthermia on the cytogenetic effect of irradiation of cells in the G0 stage by 252Cf and 60Co sources]. The paper is concerned with the results of a comparative study of radiation injury of chromosomes of human lymphocytes at the G0 stage resulting from the influence of 60Co gamma quanta and high activity 252Cf radiation sources and depending on a dose and dose rate; with the potentialities of modifying a cytogenetic effect of irradiation by postradiation hyperthermia of cells. It has been shown that at the G0 stage of a cell cycle the frequency of chromosome aberrations does not depend on the dose rate of 252Cf radiation within the range of 0.0035-0.35 Gy/min. by the neutron component. Linear correlation between the frequency of induced chromosome aberrations and a dose was observed within a dose range of 0.27-3.1 Gy. Thus, a conclusion is that postradiation hyperthermia at the G0 stage does not almost influence the frequency of chromosome aberrations during 252Cf radiation, and increases it insignificantly during 60Co gamma-radiation.",Included
1016,"Cost of treating diabetic foot ulcers in five different countries. Most estimates in the literature for the economic cost of treating a diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) are from industrialized countries. There is also marked heterogeneity between the complexity of cases considered in the different studies. The goal of the present article was to estimate treatment costs and costs to patients in five different countries (Chile, China, India, Tanzania, and the United States) for two hypothetical, but well-defined, DFUs at the extreme ends of the complexity spectrum. A co-author, who is a treating physician in the relevant country, was asked to choose treatment plans that represented the typical application of local resources to the DFU. The outcomes were pre-defined as complete healing in case 1 and trans-tibial amputation in case 2, but the time course of treatment was determined by each investigator in a manner that would be typical for their clinic. The costs, in local currencies, for each course of treatment were estimated with the assistance of local hospital administrators. Typical reimbursement scenarios in each country were used to estimate the cost burden to the patient, which was then expressed as a percentage of the annual per capita purchasing power parity-adjusted gross domestic product. There were marked differences in the treatment plans between countries based on the availability of resources and the realities of local conditions. The costs of treatment for case 1 ranged from Int$102 to Int$3959 in Tanzania and in the United States, respectively. The cost for case 2 ranged from Int$3060 to Int$188645 in Tanzania and in the United States, respectively. The cost burden to the patient varied from the equivalent of 6days of average income in the United States for case 1 to 5.7years of average annual income for case 2 in India. Although these findings do not take cost-effectiveness into account, they highlight the dramatic economic burden of a DFU for patients in some countries. Â© 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Excluded
1083,"Antibiotic protocol for the prevention of osteoradionecrosis following dental extractions in irradiated head and neck cancer patients: A 10 years prospective study. Aims of Study: The aim of the study was to establish the long term efficacy of a perioperative antibiotic protocol combined with antibacterial mouthwashes in preventing osteoradionecrosis (ORN). Material(s) and Method(s): Irradiated head and neck cancer patients reporting for dental extractions were prospectively enrolled to the study between January 2002 and December 2009. Selection criteria for the patients included the presence of nonrestorable tooth/teeth in the field of radiation, latency period of 6 months since completion of radiotherapy, radiation dosages >60 Gy, and availability for follow-up. Starting from 10 days preextraction, the patients were prescribed 8th hourly oral amoxicillin 500 mg along with 12th hourly mouthwashes using 10 ml of undiluted chlorhexidine gluconate 0.2% solution. The same prescription was continued for 7 days postextraction. All patients were followed-up at regular intervals until December 2013. Result(s): A total of 89 patients (55 male and 34 female) underwent extractions of teeth which were present in the radiation field. Mean age of the patients was 41.8 years (range 36-54 years) and extractions were done between 12 and 33 months (mean - 15 months) postradiation therapy. Altogether, 232 teeth were extracted (maxilla - 78/mandible - 154) at an average of 2.6 teeth per patients. After a mean follow-up period of 63 months (range 48-123 months) there were no reported cases of ORN. Conclusion(s): Based on the results of this study, perioperative oral antibiotics in combination with antibacterial mouthwashes are effective in preventing ORN following dental extractions in irradiated patients.",Excluded
1946,"Fifteen-year survival of the CediorTM total knee prosthesis. Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is an effective treatment for advanced osteoarthritis of the knee. No large and long-term follow-up study has been done about Cedior prosthesis. The study hypothesis was that 15-year survival for the CediorTM prosthesis is at least as good as rates reported for other models. A continuous retrospective single-center study included patients managed by CediorTM TKA with at least 15-year follow-up. The main endpoint was prosthesis survival; secondary objectives were to identify factors for implant revision and to assess functional scores at 15 years. In the present series, 15-year all-cause survival for the Cedior knee prosthesis was 93.03%; comparable to rates in the literature, posterior-stabilized implants showed higher revision rates. No other factors for revision emerged. These findings are comparable with those of the literature.Copyright Â© 2019, Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded

4183,"Comparative toxicity of synchrotron and conventional radiation therapy based on total and partial body irradiation in a murine model. Synchrotron radiation can facilitate novel radiation therapy modalities such as microbeam radiation therapy (MRT) and high dose-rate synchrotron broad-beam radiation therapy (SBBR). Both of these modalities have unique physical properties that could be exploited for an improved therapeutic effect. While pre-clinical studies report promising normal tissue sparing phenomena, systematic toxicity data are still required. Our objective was to characterise the toxicity of SBBR and MRT and to calculate equivalent doses of conventional radiation therapy (CRT). A dose-escalation study was performed on C57BLJ/6 mice using total body and partial body irradiations. Dose-response curves and TD50 values were subsequently calculated using PROBIT analysis. For SBBR at dose-rates of 37 to 41 Gy/s, we found no evidence of a normal tissue sparing effect relative to CRT. Our findings also show that the MRT valley dose, rather than the peak dose, best correlates with CRT doses for acute toxicity. Importantly, longer-term weight tracking of irradiated animals revealed more pronounced growth impairment following MRT compared to both SBBR and CRT. Overall, this study provides the first in vivo dose-equivalence data between MRT, SBBR and CRT and presents systematic toxicity data for a range of organs that can be used as a reference point for future pre-clinical work.",Excluded
2810,"Leukopenia is a biomarker for effective temozolomide dosing and predicts overall survival of patients with glioblastoma. The median survival time of patients with glioblastoma is 14-16 months with a 5-year overall survival rate of 9.8%. Standard of care treatment includes radiation with concomitant temozolomide followed by cyclic temozolomide. If the patient develops myelosuppression (thrombocytopenia, leukopenia or anemia), the dose of temozolomide is reduced or stopped to avoid bleeding or infections. Recent studies have demonstrated that mild leukopenia is associated with increased overall survival in patients with glioblastoma. To confirm prior results showing that leukopenia is associated with increased overall survival as a primary outcome in patients with glioblastoma, the present study retrospectively collected complete blood counts from 141 patients with glioblastoma treated at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Boston, USA) between January 2012 and December 2017. According to Kaplan-Meier analysis with a log-rank test, the presence of leukopenia was associated with increased overall survival (P=0.008). Furthermore, patients with grade 2 leukopenia (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0) survived longer than those without myelosuppression (P=0.024). There was no difference in overall survival between patients with grade 1, 3 or 4 leukopenia and those without myelosuppression. Leukopenia was associated with longer survival independent of age or extent of surgery in Cox proportional hazards regression modeling (P=0.00205). A possible interpretation is that grade 2 leukopenia is a biomarker of adequate temozolomide dosing in a population with diverse DNA repair function, which may be the consequence of variable O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase activity. A prospective dose escalation trial is necessary to determine if treatment-induced leukopenia is beneficial for all patients receiving temozolomide.Copyright Â© 2020, Spandidos Publications.

2257,"Combined Use of Automatic Tube Voltage Selection and Current Modulation with Iterative Reconstruction for CT Evaluation of Small Hypervascular Hepatocellular Carcinomas: Effect on Lesion Conspicuity and Image Quality. OBJECTIVE: To assess the lesion conspicuity and image quality in CT evaluation of small (<= 3 cm) hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) using automatic tube voltage selection (ATVS) and automatic tube current modulation (ATCM) with or without iterative reconstruction., MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and five patients with 123 HCC lesions were included. Fifty-seven patients were scanned using both ATVS and ATCM and images were reconstructed using either filtered back-projection (FBP) (group A1) or sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction (SAFIRE) (group A2). Forty-eight patients were imaged using only ATCM, with a fixed tube potential of 120 kVp and FBP reconstruction (group B). Quantitative parameters (image noise in Hounsfield unit and contrast-to-noise ratio of the aorta, the liver, and the hepatic tumors) and qualitative visual parameters (image noise, overall image quality, and lesion conspicuity as graded on a 5-point scale) were compared among the groups., RESULTS: Group A2 scanned with the automatically chosen 80 kVp and 100 kVp tube voltages ranked the best in lesion conspicuity and subjective and objective image quality (p values ranging from < 0.001 to 0.004) among the three groups, except for overall image quality between group A2 and group B (p = 0.022). Group A1 showed higher image noise (p = 0.005) but similar lesion conspicuity and overall image quality as compared with group B. The radiation dose in group A was 19% lower than that in group B (p = 0.022)., CONCLUSION: CT scanning with combined use of ATVS and ATCM and image reconstruction with SAFIRE algorithm provides higher lesion conspicuity and better image quality for evaluating small hepatic HCCs with radiation dose reduction.",Excluded
2109,"The metabolic effects of abdominal irradiation in man with and without dietary therapy with an elemental diet. The metabolic effects of abdominal radiotherapy were assessed in patients with pelvic neoplasms, and the effects of supplementation of the diet with an 'elemental' diet assessed. Therapeutic irradiation led to significant mean weight losses of 1.4 kg in control patients and 1.0 kg in patients receiving 'elemental' diet supplements. Irradiation was associated with small falls in plasma potassium and calcium concentrations in both groups. In the 'elemental' group there was a small increase in circulating alanine and insulin concentrations and a fall in glycerol and ketone body concentrations, but all variables remained within or close to normal basal reference ranges. Plasma albumin fell slightly but significantly in the 'elemental' diet group from 44 +/- 1 to 42 +/- 1 g/litre during treatment. Is is concluded that modern radiotherapy is no more than a modest catabolic stimulus. Long-term dietary supplementation with 'elemental' diets in ill subjects did not produce adverse effects.",Excluded
3017,"Improving adjuvant therapy for rectal cancer by combining protracted-infusion fluorouracil with radiation therapy after curative surgery. BACKGROUND: The combination of radiation therapy and chemotherapy with fluorouracil plus semustine after surgery has been established as an effective approach to decreasing the risk of tumor relapse and improving survival in patients with rectal cancer who are at high risk for relapse or death. We sought to determine whether the efficacy of chemotherapy could be improved by administering fluorouracil by protracted infusion throughout the duration of radiation therapy and whether the omission of semustine would reduce the toxicity and delayed complications of chemotherapy without decreasing its antitumor efficacy., METHODS: Six hundred sixty patients with TNM stage II or III rectal cancer received intermittent bolus injections or protracted venous infusions of fluorouracil during postoperative radiation to the pelvis. They also received systemic chemotherapy with semustine plus fluorouracil or with fluorouracil alone in a higher dose, administered before and after the pelvic irradiation., RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 46 months among surviving patients, patients who received a protracted infusion of fluorouracil had a significantly increased time to relapse (P = 0.01) and improved survival (P = 0.005). There was no evidence of a beneficial effect in the patients who received semustine plus fluorouracil., CONCLUSIONS: A protracted infusion of fluorouracil during pelvic irradiation improved the effect of combined-treatment postoperative adjuvant therapy in patients with high-risk rectal cancer. Semustine plus fluorouracil was not more effective than a higher dose of systemic fluorouracil given alone.",Excluded
3923,"Thigh Ultrasound Used to Identify Frail Elderly Patients with Sarcopenia Undergoing Surgery: A Pilot Study. BACKGROUND: Computed tomography (CT) scan quantifying skeletal muscle mass is the gold standard tool to identify sarcopenia. Unfortunately, high cost, limited availability, and radiation exposure limit its use. We suggest that ultrasound of the thigh muscle could be an objective, reproducible, portable, and risk-free tool, used as a surrogate to a CT scan, to help identify frail patients with sarcopenia., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included 49 patients over 64 y old, referred to the acute care surgery service. An ultrasound of thigh muscle thickness was standardized to patient thigh length (U/Swhole/L). CT skeletal muscle index (SMI) was calculated using skeletal muscle surface area of the L3 region divided by height2. Frailty status was assessed using the Canadian Study of Healthy Aging Clinical Frailty Scale., RESULTS: The mean (SD) age was 76 (8) y, and 34% (n = 17) were men. CT-defined sarcopenia was identified in 65% (n = 11) of men and 75% (n = 24) of women. In general, women had longer stay in hospital than men (mean + SD 14 +/- 9 versus 7 +/- 3 d, P = 0.003). There was a significant positive correlation between thigh U/Swhole/L and CT SMI. There was an inverse correlation between thigh U/Swhole/L and frailty score; a similar relationship was observed between CT SMI and frailty. There was an association between U/Swhole/L and postoperative major complications., CONCLUSIONS: This prospective observational study illustrates that the U/Swhole/L index can be used as a surrogate to CT scan, whereby it can identify elderly frail patients with sarcopenia. Thigh ultrasound should be further tested as an objective tool to assess for stratifying frailty. Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
4083,"Posterior intersegmental fusion of unstable Jefferson fracture. Introduction The patient was a 37-year-old man who was a victim of a motor-vehicle accident. On arrival at the emergency department, the patients' vital signs were all within normal physiological range. His GCS was 15/15. He had suffered from neck pain. In physical examination, he had upper cervical spine tenderness but there was no abnormal palpable deformity. Other physical examinations were normal. Plain X-ray of the cervical spines was nonconclusive. Cervical-spine CT scan demonstrated an isolated unstable Jefferson fracture associated with Spence's criteria. Cervical CT angiography was normal. Materials and Methods The patient was placed in the prone position and the alignment and the position of the atlantoaxial complex was verified by the use of real-time fluoroscopy. The cervical spine was exposed subperiosteally from the occiput to the level of C3-4. The C1-2 articulation was exposed. After the dorsal root ganglion of C2 was retracted inferiorly, the middle of the junction of the posterior arch of C1 and the midpoint of the inferoposterior part of the C1 lateral mass was exposed. The screws were placed via Magerl trans-facet screw technique. Then screws were connected with a rod and nuts to reduce lateral spread of the lateral masses. Results Postoperative cervical CT scan showed that the screws are in favorable position. Conclusion The treatment of unstable Jefferson fractures remains controversial. Conservative treatment usually associates with the longtime of immobilization in halo vest, whereas conventional posterior surgical treatments generally eliminate the range of motion of the upper cervical spines. With the posterior intersegmental fusion of unstable atlas fracture, the stabilization of anterior arch of atlas can be achieved while at the same time atlantoaxial rotation is preserved.",Excluded
2950,"Assessment of ureteric colic in irish emergency departments-how do we compare with the gold standard?. Ureteric colic describes the spasmodic pain that arises from obstruction of the ureter by a calculus. It is a common presentation in the Emergency Department (ED) with a lifetime risk of 12 % in men and 5 % in women with an incidence of 3/1000 population per year [1]. Prompt assessment and diagnosis is important as infection in the presence of obstruction is a surgical emergency. The aim of this study is to ascertain the work-up of ureteric colic in Irish EDs and compare these to the agreed gold-standard. An electronic survey was distributed to Consultants and Specialist Registrars in Emergency Medicine. Hospital demographics and presence of a urology service within the hospital were also recorded. Out of 63 responses, 66 % were Consultants and 27.4 % were Specialist Registrars in Emergency Medicine. All HSE training networks were represented. 62.9 % had established guidelines for ureteric colic in their ED. While FBC, U&E, and urine dipstick were routinely performed, metabolic profile and mid-stream urine was only performed 31 and 39 % of the time, respectively. 88.5 % of physicians agree that CT KUB should be the first-line imaging however, only 65 % of EDs actually do this, with X-ray KUB representing 36.5 % of initial imaging. The recommended analgesic-NSAIDs, are prescribed 61.9 % versus morphine, 69.8 % of the time. This is the first study to assess the work-up of ureteric colic in Irish EDs and is important in that it may change Emergency Physician behavior before Urological opinion is sought. Despite the presence of evidence-based guidelines, heterogeneity exists in care pathways used in Irish hospitals.",Excluded

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Esophageal variceal ligation (EVL) is the most preferable method for controlling variceal bleeding. However, EVL is associated with complications such as hemorrhage, chest pain, dysphagia, and odynophagia due to post-EVL ulcers in the esophageal mucosa. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of proton pump inhibitor (PPI), pantoprazole on the healing of post-EVL ulcers., METHODS: Forty seven patients were randomly allocated into PPI group and control group. Patients in PPI group received 40 mg of pantoprazole intravenously for 3 days after EVL, then 40 mg of oral pantoprazole for 11 days consecutively. Control patients received intravenous and oral placebo. Endoscopic examinations were performed twice at 7+/-2 days and 14+/-2 days after EVL respectively. Clinical outcomes include the size of ulcers, symptoms reported by patients; chest pain, dysphagia, and odynophagia., RESULTS: Forty seven patients completed the 7 days protocol (PPI/control; 25/22), and twenty six patients completed the 14 days protocol (PPI/control; 16/10). Post-EVL ulcers in PPI group were significantly smaller than those in control group (7 days; 98.7 mm2/119.4 m2, 14 days; 32.3 m2/43.8 m2, p<0.01). No difference was observed between two the groups with respect to summations of symptom scores (p> 0.05). Nineteen patients (PPI/control; 9/10) did not complete the 14 days protocol due to patients' refusal and adverse outcomes, such as hepatic failure and sepsis with bleeding from post-EVL ulcer occurred in two patients of control group., CONCLUSIONS: PPI treatment following EVL may be effective in healing post-EVL ulcer.",Excluded
2086,"Malignant melanoma and other second cutaneous malignancies in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The influence of additional therapy after total skin electron beam radiation. BACKGROUND: Previous large studies have shown that patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma are at increased risk for basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, and anecdotal case reports have suggested an association with malignant melanoma. It has been postulated that the exposure of cutaneous structures to potentially carcinogenic therapies, such as ionizing radiation or alkylating agents, might be causally associated with the development of these second cutaneous malignancies, but, to date, no study has directly addressed this issue. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of second cutaneous malignancies in a group of patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma treated with total skin electron beam therapy and to examine the additional effects of oral psoralen with UV-A phototherapy, topical mechlorethamine hydrochloride therapy, and further radiation therapy. One hundred sixty-four patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma who had received total skin electron beam therapy between 1974 and 1990 were identified, and information was abstracted from their records., RESULTS: Six patients developed malignant melanoma 12 to 95 months after total skin electron beam therapy. Of the six patients, three had received oral psoralen with UV-A as additional therapy and two had received topical mechlorethamine. None had received additional radiation therapy. Twenty-four patients developed more than 37 basal cell carcinomas and 34 squamous cell carcinomas from 11 months to more than 10 years after total skin electron beam therapy. Of the 24 patients, 15 had received oral psoralen with UV-A and 12 had received mechlorethamine as additional therapy. Additional radiation therapy had been administered to nine patients. During a median follow-up of 6 years, no patients died of any second cutaneous malignancy., CONCLUSION: We found a high rate of both melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer. The additional use of mechlorethamine or oral psoralen plus UV-A, but not radiation, was significantly associated with the development of basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, but not malignant melanoma.",Excluded
3599,"Low dose IR-induced IGF-1-sCLU expression: a p53-repressed expression cascade that interferes with TGFbeta1 signaling to confer a pro-survival bystander effect. Inadvertent mammalian tissue exposures to low doses of ionizing radiation (IR) after radiation accidents, remediation of radioactive-contaminated areas, space travel or a dirty bomb represent an interesting trauma to an organism. Possible low-dose IR-induced bystander effects could impact our evaluation of human health effects, as cells within tissue are not equally damaged after doses of IR <=10 cGy. To understand tissue responses after low IR doses, we generated a reporter system using the human clusterin promoter fused to firefly luciferase (hCLUp-Luc). Secretory clusterin (sCLU), an extracellular molecular chaperone, induced by low doses of cytotoxic agents, clears cell debris. Low-dose IR (>=2 cGy) exposure induced hCLUp-Luc activity with peak levels at 96 h, consistent with endogenous sCLU levels. As doses increased (>=1 Gy), sCLU induction amplitudes increased and time-to-peak response decreased. sCLU expression was stimulated by insulin-like growth factor-1, but suppressed by p53. Responses in transgenic hCLUp-Luc reporter mice after low IR doses showed that specific tissues (that is, colon, spleen, mammary, thymus and bone marrow) of female mice induced hCLUp-Luc activity more than male mice after whole body (>=10 cGy) irradiation. Tissue-specific, non-linear dose- and time-responses of hCLUp-Luc and endogenous sCLU levels were noted. Colon maintained homeostatic balance after 10 cGy. Bone marrow responded with delayed, but prolonged and elevated expression. Intraperitoneal administration of alpha-transforming growth factor (TGF)beta1 (1D11), but not control (13C4) antibodies, immediately following IR exposure abrogated CLU induction responses. Induction in vivo also correlated with Smad signaling by activated TGFbeta1 after IR. Mechanistically, media with elevated sCLU levels suppressed signaling, blocked apoptosis and increased survival of TGFbeta1-exposed tumor or normal cells. Thus, sCLU is a pro-survival bystander factor that abrogates TGFbeta1 signaling and most likely promotes wound healing.",Included
3611,"Parasympathetic stimulation improves epithelial organ regeneration. Parasympathetic nerves are a vital component of the progenitor cell niche during development, maintaining a pool of progenitors for organogenesis. Injured adult organs do not regenerate after parasympathectomy, and there are few treatments to improve organ regeneration, particularly after damage by therapeutic irradiation. Here we show that restoring parasympathetic function with the neurotrophic factor neurturin increases epithelial organ regeneration after damage. We use mouse salivary gland explant culture containing fluorescently labelled progenitors, and injure the tissue with irradiation. The progenitors survive, parasympathetic function is diminished and epithelial apoptosis reduces the expression of neurturin, which increases neuronal apoptosis. Treatment with neurturin reduces neuronal apoptosis, restores parasympathetic function and increases epithelial regeneration. Furthermore, adult human salivary glands damaged by irradiation also have reduced parasympathetic innervation. We propose that neurturin will protect the parasympathetic nerves from damage and improve organ regeneration. This concept may be applicable for other organs where parasympathetic innervation influences their function.",Excluded
4080,"Optimization of CT protocols for thyroid and parathyroid SPECT/CT imaging. The first national survey of patient exposures from hybrid imaging in Nuclear Medicine, performed in Bulgaria in 2014, revealed that SPECT/CT imaging of either thyroid or parathyroid glands was performed by applying a CT scan of the whole anatomical region, neck and chest, subject to SPECT. In most cases it was not necessary to perform a CT scan matching the whole SPECT region. The aim of this study is to propose an optimized CT protocol by reducing the CT scan length. The standard CT protocols for both types of examinations included neck and chest scan with the same exposure data. After the optimization the CT scan was restricted to the region of radiopharmaceutical uptake. Comparison of scan length, dose-length product (DLP) and effective dose from the old and the new protocols was performed. Software was used to estimate effective dose from the CT scan separately for males and females. A total of 17 patients undergoing either thyroid or parathyroid examination received CT of the neck and chest before the optimization. After the introduction of the optimized protocol, data were collected for a total of 70 patients. The mean scan length for males was reduced from 39 to 22 cm (42% reduction) and for females the reduction was from 44 to 22 cm (50%). The mean DLP was decreased by about 34% (from 138 to 91 mGy.cm) for * males and 48% (from 147 to 77 mGy.cm) for females respectively.

Objective: Radiotherapy techniques have evolved from 3D conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) to intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) where boost fields are delivered either sequentially (IMRTseq) or with a simultaneous integrated boost (IMRT+SIB). Our goal was to compare the outcomes of patients treated with IMRT+SIB to traditional standards. Method(s): We analyzed the efficacy and toxicity of patients treated with concurrent chemoradiation using 3D-CRT, IMRTseq or IMRT+SIB. Between 1993 and 2012, 379 patients with non-metastatic Stage III-IV head and neck squamous cell cancer were treated with concurrent chemoradiation using 3D-CRT (n = 125), IMRTseq (n = 120) and IMRT+SIB (n = 134). Result(s): Patients treated with any technique had similar rates of 2y local control, 2y regional control, 2y progression free survival and 2y overall survival. Patients treated with IMRT +SIB had lower rates acute toxicity according to Grade 3 or greater mucositis (3D-CRT: 44.0% vs. IMRTseq: 36.7% vs. IMRT+SIB: 22.4%; P<.0001), dermatitis (3D-CRT: 44.0% vs. IMRTseq: 20.0% vs. IMRT+SIB: 7.5%; P<.0001) and feeding tube placement during radiotherapy (3D-CRT: 80.0% vs. IMRTseq: 50.8% vs. IMRT+SIB: 44.0%; P<.0001) as well as late toxicity as measured by feeding tube use (P<.0001) and tracheostomy use (P<.0001). On multivariate analysis, IMRT+SIB predicted for less mucositis, dermatitis and feeding tube use compared to 3D-CRT and for less dermatitis compared to IMRTseq.

4578,"Validity of sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection following adjuvant radiochemotherapy (RCT) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The effect of preoperative radio chemotherapy on lymphatic drainage and intraoperative gamma probe-guided sentinel lymph node detection has yet not been investigated. In this study, we study 13 patients with SCC. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) imaging of the patients was performed using SPECT-CT. Special care was taken to use identical injection sites for both studies. Imaging comprised planar and SPECT, iterative reconstruction and were viewed with the co-registered CT image. The results were validated by comparison with the histological results of intraoperative gamma probe detection and histology of the completed neck dissection. Identical SLNs were found in 6/13 patients. In 2/13 cases SLN biopsies were false-negative. In 4/13 patients preoperative SLN imaging identified more/additional nodes than the initial imaging, whereas fewer nodes were seen in 3/13 patients. Neither the primary tumor site nor the TNM stage was predictive for changes in the lymphatic drainage pattern. No constant effect of irradiation could be demonstrated. Preoperative radio chemotherapy has an unpredictable influence on the lymphatic drainage pattern in HNSCC. Consequently, the intraoperative gamma probe-guided sentinel lymph node detection after radio chemotherapy does not reveal the SLN of carcinogenesis. Thus, we advise fused functional/anatomical imaging (SPECT-CT) before and after radiochemotherapy if the SLN concept is utilized in HNSCC.",Excluded
1440,"MiR-19 in blood plasma reflects lung cancer occurrence but is not specifically associated with radon exposure. Radon is one of the most powerful carcinogens, particularly in terms of lung cancer onset and development. miRNAs may be considered not only as markers of the ongoing tumorigenesis but also as a hallmark of exposure to radiation, including radon and its progeny. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to estimate the value of plasma miR-19b-3p level as the prospective marker of the response to radon exposure in lung cancer pathogenesis. A total of 136 subjects were examined, including 49 radon-exposed patients with lung cancer, 37 patients with lung cancer without radon exposure and 50 age/sex matched healthy controls. Total RNA from blood samples was extracted and used to detect miR-19b-3p expression via reverse transcription quantitative-polymerase chain reaction. The 2-DELTADELTACq method was used to quantify the amount of relative miRNA. The plasma level of p53 protein was determined using a Human p53 ELISA kit. Plasma miR-19b-3p level was significantly higher in the patients with lung cancer groups, compared with the healthy control group (P<0.0001). No other statistically significant differences were determined in the expression level of plasma miR-19b-3p between patients diagnosed with lung cancer exposed to radon and not exposed to radon. The expression level of free circulating miR-19b-3p was higher in the group of non-smoking patients with lung cancer, compared with smokers with lung cancer. The miR-19b-3p was 1.4-fold higher in non-smokers than in smokers (P<0.05). No association between plasma levels of p53 protein and miR-19b-3p freely circulating in patients with lung cancer was observed.

These results indicated that detection of miR-19b-3p levels in plasma potentially could be exploited as a noninvasive method for the lung cancer diagnostics. However, this miRNA is not suitable as the precise marker for radon impact.Copyright Â© 2018, Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.",Included
1717,"Selection of comparable anatomical locations of muscle cross-sectional images in the Osteoarthritis Initiative MRI data. Purpose: Muscle forces and cross sectional areas (CSA) play an important role in the onset and progression of OA. The OA Initiative provides images of muscle CSAs of both limbs. These images are acquired starting 10 cm proximally of the distal epiphyseal line of the femur and cover 15 slices of 0.5 mm (7.5 cm) in proximal direction. The images therefore have a variable anatomical location with regard to the femur and thigh muscles in short and tall individuals, and this poses limits on the comparability between participants in cross sectional studies. The objectives were therefore to determine a) the location of the 15 slices in relation to the femur (%length) in persons with variable body height, b) which part of the femur (% length) is covered in all subjects, and c) whether the inter-subject variability of the location of these cross sectional images (versus the femoral length) can be effectively reduced, when accounting for differences in body height. Method(s): Clinical data, MR images of the thigh muscles, and full limb X-rays from 48 OA participants with calculated Kellgren Lawrence grade 3 were studied (OAI public data sets 0.2.2, 0.E.1, 1.E.1). The subjects were selected to cover the full body height distribution in men and women. In the women (n=24), the body height ranged from 151.1 to 180.2 cm, and in the men (n=24) from 162.8 to 188.8 cm. From the full-limb X-rays, the femoral length (distance of the knee joint space to the proximal end of the femoral head was determined in vertical direction. The position of the epiphyseal line (in the femur) was measured in MRI scout views which were used to plan the thigh muscle MRI acquisitions. Result(s): The femoral length (F) in the full-limb X-rays varied from 47.3 to 55.1 cm in men, and from 44.2 to 55.9 cm in women The relationship between F and the body height (H) was similar in men and women (F=29.4% of H in women [min:27.5%, max:31.5%], and F=30.0% of H in men [min: 27.9%, max:33.8%]). Linear regression analysis provided the equations F=0.29xH mm + 15.7mm for men (r2=63%) and F=0.33 x Hmm - 51.93mm for women (r2=57%) as estimates of F. The epiphyseal line was clearly visible in 24 of the 48 MRI scout views; its relative position in the femur (from distal) was 6.0% in women (min:3.4%; max:8.5%), and 7.2% in men (min:5.5%, max:8.8%), The location was significantly different (p=0.03) between sexes. From these data, it was derived that a region of 29.4% to 36.7% of the femoral length (from distal) was covered by the 15 axial MRI muscle slices in all men, and a region between 31.1% and 35.7% in all women, across the full range of body heights. Therefore a target slice located at 33% of F (from distal to proximal) was selected, so that all participants could be included in a measurement, independent of body height. This location corresponded to slice No7 (from distal to proximal) in a person of average height (=mean across the 48 subjects). When selecting slice No7 in every participant, its location varied between 30% and 37% of the femoral length (standard deviation [SD]=1.5%). When choosing the most appropriate slice after accounting for differences in body height (slice number 4 to 9), its location varied only between 32.5% and 33.5% (SD=0.3%). Conclusion(s): Measurement of the femoral length and the epiphyseal line allows for the precise selection of comparable slices for measuring muscle CSAs in subjects with different heights. In cases where no full limb radiographs are available, the use of body height (H) as an estimate of femoral length (F) can reduce the variability of the slice location as expressed by the standard deviation by a factor of 5 compared with choosing the same slice across all subjects.",Excluded

4556,"Effects of 2 different swallowing exercise regimens during organ-preservation therapies for head and neck cancers on swallowing function. Background. This study investigated the effects of 2 different swallowing exercise regimens performed during radiation therapy with/without chemotherapy on swallowing function. Methods. Fifty patients were recruited prospectively to 2 groups (the exercise group, n = 26 and the repetitive swallow group, n = 24). Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) scores and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placements were compared at posttreatment and at 3 months. Results. The exercise group eliminated significantly more PEG tubes at 3 months posttreatment compared to the swallow group (16% vs 50%). Among patients who received both radiation and chemotherapy, the exercise group had significantly less PEG tubes immediately posttreat-ment as well as 3 months posttreatment (35% and 10%), compared to the swallow group (69% and 50%). Conclusion. Findings indicate significant benefits of the exercise group's exercise regimen in reducing PEG dependence and oral intake difficulties.Copyright Â© 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
1488,"Long-term hearing outcomes following stereotactic radiosurgery for vestibular schwannoma: Patterns of hearing loss and variables influencing audiometric decline. Object. The goals of this retrospective cohort study were as follows: 1) to describe the long-term prevalence and timing of hearing deterioration following low-dose (12- to 13-Gy marginal dose) stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for vestibular schwannoma (VS); and 2) to identify clinical variables associated with long-term preservation of useful hearing following treatment. Methods. Patients with serviceable hearing who underwent SRS for VS between 1997 and 2002 were studied. Data including radiosurgery treatment plans, tumor characteristics, pre- and posttreatment pure tone average, speech discrimination scores, and American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery hearing class were collected. Time to nonserviceable hearing was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate associations with time to nonserviceable hearing were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results. Forty-four patients met the study criteria and were included. The median duration of audiometric follow- up was 9.3 years. Thirty-six patients developed nonserviceable hearing at a mean of 4.2 years following SRS. The Kaplan-Meier estimated rates of serviceable hearing at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 years following SRS were 80%, 55%, 48%, 38%, and 23%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that pretreatment ipsilateral pure tone average (p < 0.001) and tumor size (p = 0.009) were statistically significantly associated with time to nonserviceable hearing. Conclusions. Durable hearing preservation a decade after low-dose SRS for VS occurs in less than one-fourth of patients. Variables including preoperative hearing capacity and tumor size may be used to predict hearing outcomes following treatment. These findings may assist in pretreatment risk disclosure. Furthermore, these data demonstrate the importance of long-term follow-up when reporting audiometric outcomes following SRS for VS. Â© AANS, 2013.",Excluded
2720,"Comparative evaluation of the in vitro micronucleus test and the comet assay for the detection of genotoxic effects of X-ray radiation. The genotoxic effects of X-ray radiation on human lymphocytes were measured using the single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assay (comet assay) and the cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus (CBMN) test; both were carried out in vitro on isolated human lymphocytes in order to compare the relationship and sensitivity of these two detecting methods. The radiation-doses were 0.00, 0.02, 0.05, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 1.00 and 2.00 Gy. In the comet assay, the average comet length (38.6+/-0.8 microm) of 0.05 Gy was significantly longer than that (29.4+/-1.1 microm) of 0 Gy (P<0.01), moreover, the average comet length increased with the dose of X-ray radiation. In the CBMN, both the average micronucleus rate (MN) and micronucleated cell rate (MNC) of 0.05 Gy were 11.5+/-4.5 per thousand, which showed no difference with that (7.5+/-0.5 per thousand) of 0 Gy (P>0.05). The lowest dose, which induced significant increase of average MN and MNC, was 0.25 Gy. The average MN and MNC rates increased with radiation-dose. The results showed that there was correlation between SCGE and CBMN, and the sensitivity of SCGE was significantly higher than that of CBMN.",Included
2918,"Stereotactic body radiation therapy for lung metastases from soft tissue sarcoma. Purpose: To appraise the role of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in patients with lung metastasis from primary soft tissue sarcoma. Method(s): Twenty-eight patients (51 lesions) were analysed. All patients were in good performance status (1-2 eastern cooperative oncology group (ECOG)), unsuitable for surgical resection, with controlled primary tumour and the number of lung metastases was <=4. In a risk adaptive scheme, the dose prescription was: 30 Gy/1 fr, 60 Gy/3 fr, 60 Gy/8 fr and 48 Gy/4 fr. Treatments were performed with Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy. Clinical outcome was evaluated by thoracic and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan before SBRT and than every 3 months. Toxicity was evaluated with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) scale version 4.0. Result(s): Leiomyosarcoma (36%) and synovial sarcoma (25%) were the most common histologies. Five patients (18%) initially presented with pulmonary metastasis, whereas 23 (82%) developed them at a median time of 51 months (range 11-311 months) from the initial diagnosis. The median follow-up time from initial diagnosis was 65 months (5-139 months) and from SBRT was 21 months (2-80 months). No severe toxicity (grades III-IV) was recorded and no patients required hospitalisation. The actuarial 5-years local control rate (from SBRT treatment) was 96%. Overall survival at 2 and 5 years was 96.2% and 60.5%, respectively. At last follow-up 15 patients (54%) were alive. All other died because of distant progression. Conclusion(s): SBRT provides excellent local control of pulmonary metastasis from soft tissue sarcoma (STS) and may improve survival in selected patients. SBRT should be considered for all patients with pulmonary metastasis (PM) and evaluated in a multidisciplinary team.Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded

3253,"Correlation of pharyngeal residue with penetration- aspiration in post-radiotherapy nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia. Background: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) ranks first for head and neck malignancies, and radiotherapy is a recommended treatment. Most post-radiotherapy NPC patients experience oropharyngeal dysphagia that results in pharyngeal residue. Pharyngeal residue is thought to be a risk factor for aspiration-penetration. Objective(s): Examining the correlation between pharyngeal residue and penetration-aspiration in postradiotherapy NPC patients. Method(s): Participants have been identified since 2018 to find out the total number of NPC patients. In the period January-October 2019, identification of NPC patients was performed according to participant criteria. Participants were examined for fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES), pharyngeal residue using the Yale Pharyngeal Residue Severity Rating Scale (YPR-SRS), and penetration-aspiration using Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS). Statistical tests were used Spearman correlation test with p<0.05. Result(s): The highest participant's pharyngeal residue appeared in vallecula when given soft bolus (96.55%), and in pyriform sinus when given thick liquid bolus (72.41%). Most participants with soft bolus had the highest negative penetration (72.59%) and positive penetration in thick liquid bolus (51.72%), while most had negative aspirations with the lowest value (89.66%). There is aspiration in 10.34% of patients when given a dilute liquid. There was a significant correlation between pharyngeal residue in vallecula and pyriform sinus with penetration-aspiration (p<0.05). There was a positive association with the use of soft bolus (r=0.623), thick liquid bolus (r=0.631), and dilute liquid bolus (r=0.891).

4299,"Cerebral metastases pathology after radiosurgery: a multicenter study. BACKGROUND: To the authors' knowledge, comprehensive human pathologic investigations that explore fundamental radiosurgical effects on metastatic brain tumors are sparse in the literature. The objective of this study was to analyze histopathologic findings in a set of clinically recurrent cerebral metastases after patients underwent stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)., METHODS: In a series of 7500 patients who underwent radiosurgery, 2020 patients (27%) harbored cerebral metastases. Eighteen of 2020 patients (0.9%) underwent subsequent craniotomy for tumor removal anywhere from 1 month to 59 months after they received high-dose irradiation. Histologic and immunohistochemical investigations were performed on the surgically resected tissue specimens. These specimens were within the radiosurgical treatment volume of the metastatic tumor., RESULTS: Light microscopy revealed 3 basic categories of histologic responses: acute-type, subacute-type, and chronic-type tissue reactions. A moderate-to-intense inflammatory cell reaction was seen in the tissue responses of well controlled neoplasms (i.e., in patients who had neoplasms that required craniotomy for recurrent disease > 5 months after SRS), whereas the inflammatory reaction was missing or sparse in poorly controlled neoplasms (patients who required craniotomy for recurrent disease < 5 months after SRS). This reaction was seen within the irradiated tumor volume and not in the peritumoral area nor in areas remote from the radiosurgical treatment volume. Immunohistochemical characterization demonstrated the presence of prominent CD68-positive macrophage and CD3-positive T-lymphocyte populations. A progressively severe vasculopathy also was observed with increasing time after radiosurgery., CONCLUSIONS: Although causality has not been established, a brisk inflammatory response and more severe vasculopathy were observed in lesions in which recurrences were more delayed.

1508,"Modeling the risk of radiation-induced lung fibrosis: Irradiated heart tissue is as important as irradiated lung. Purpose We used normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) modeling to explore the impact of heart irradiation on radiation-induced lung fibrosis (RILF). Materials and methods We retrospectively reviewed for RILF 148 consecutive Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) patients treated with sequential chemo-radiotherapy (CHT-RT). Left, right, total lung and heart dose-volume and dose-mass parameters along with clinical, disease and treatment-related characteristics were analyzed. NTCP modeling by multivariate logistic regression analysis using bootstrapping was performed. Models were evaluated by Spearman Rs coefficient and ROC area. Results At a median time of 13 months, 18 out of 115 analyzable patients (15.6%) developed RILF after treatment. A three-variable predictive model resulted to be optimal for RILF. The two models most frequently selected by bootstrap included increasing age and mass of heart receiving >30 Gy as common predictors, in combination with left lung V5 (Rs = 0.35, AUC = 0.78), or alternatively, the lungs near maximum dose D2% (Rs = 0.38, AUC = 0.80). Conclusion CHT-RT may cause lung injury in a small, but significant fraction of HL patients. Our results suggest that aging along with both heart and lung irradiation plays a fundamental role in the risk of developing RILF.Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

2702,"Treatment of recurrent bronchial carcinoma: the role of high-dose-rate endoluminal brachytherapy. PURPOSE: This study's aim was to assess outcome and toxicity of high-dose-rate endoluminal brachytherapy (HDREB) for recurrent bronchial carcinoma., METHODS AND MATERIALS: From 1987 to 2005, 41 patients were treated with HDREB for symptomatic recurrent bronchial carcinoma. All patients had previously undergone external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) with a median dose of 56 Gy (range, 30-70 Gy). The median HDREB dose applied was 15 Gy (range, 5-29 Gy). The median time interval between primary EBRT and reirradiation was 9 months (range, 2-54 months)., RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 6.7 months, the 6-, 12-, and 24-month overall survival rates were 58%, 18%, and 7%, respectively. The median overall survival time was 6.7 months. Local remission was achieved in 73% of patients (n = 30). A total of 24% of patients (n = 10) showed no response or progressive disease within 8 weeks after treatment. In 1 patient, treatment response was not documented. The 6-, 12-, and 24-month local control rates were 38%, 17%, and 3%, respectively. The median local progression-free survival time was 4 months (range, 1-23 months). Prognostic factors were a total dose of >or=15 Gy of HDREB (p = 0.029) and a Karnofsky performance score of >or=80% (p = 0.0012). The cause of death was locoregional progression in 27% of patients (n = 11), distant metastases in 24% of patients (n = 10), fatal hemorrhage in 15% of patients (n = 6), and other causes in 29% of patients (n = 12). None of the patients with locally controlled disease showed grade 3 or 4 late effects., CONCLUSIONS: Palliative treatment of symptomatic, locally recurrent bronchial carcinoma with HDREB can effectively relieve symptoms in the majority of patients while causing only few complications. Still, time to progression is short. Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2263,"Multiple cervical lymph node involvement and extra-capsular extension predict for contralateral nodal recurrence after ipsilateral radiotherapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the tonsil. Background: Ipsilateral radiotherapy is an established technique for treating well-lateralised tonsillar tumours. Concerns exist regarding the risk of contralateral nodal failure, particularly in patients with ipsilateral nodal involvement at presentation. In this study, we retrospectively reviewed the clinical outcomes of patients treated with ipsilateral radiotherapy aiming to identify factors that predispose to a higher risk of contralateral nodal recurrence. Method(s): Retrospective case note review of all patients with tonsillar cancer who were treated using ipsilateral radiotherapy between September 1995 and September 2011 was performed. Demographics, T and N stage, involvement of soft palate and/or tongue base, presence of extra-capsular spread (ECS) and treatment details were recorded. Kaplan-Meier curves for treatment outcomes were generated. Result(s): A total of 136 patients were identified. Median follow-up was 4.2 years. Twelve (9%) patients had loco-regional recurrence. Eight patients (6%) had contralateral recurrence. N2b disease, ECS and number of pack-years of smoking were associated with contralateral nodal recurrence. Five-year overall survival was 89%, loco-regional disease-free survival 90%, disease-free survival 86% and distal recurrence-free survival 96%. Conclusion(s): N2b disease, ECS and a greater than 10 pack-year smoking history are risk factors for contralateral nodal recurrence in well-lateralised tonsillar cancers. Prophylactic irradiation of the contralateral neck should be recommended in this group of patients.Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Objectives: We evaluated outcomes in patients with high-grade neuroendocrine (HGNE) carcinoma of the anorectum treated with pelvic chemoradiation. Material(s) and Method(s): Between January 1, 2000 and February 17, 2013, 10 patients were confirmed to have HGNE carcinoma of the rectum or anal canal and treated with pelvic chemoradiation (radiation dose >=45 Gy). Overall survival (OS), locoregional control (LRC), progression-free survival (PFS), and patterns of failure were evaluated. Result(s): Eight had pure HGNE carcinoma and 2 had HGNE carcinoma with minor component of adenocarcinoma. Median age was 62 years. Median follow-up was 15 months (range, 3 to 128 mo). Tumor stages included TxN0M0 (1), II (1), III (4), and IV (4) including 2 with only inguinal involvement. Median tumor size was 5.5 cm (range, 3 to 7 cm). Patients received postoperative chemoradiation (1), preoperative chemoradiation (2), and chemoradiation without surgery (7). Median dose was 50.4 Gy (range, 45 to 60 Gy). All patients received chemotherapy before or after chemoradiation. Seven had pelvic LRC; 2 had possible and 1 had confirmed local progression. Both patients who had preoperative chemoradiation only had microscopic focus of residual carcinoma at surgery. Seven had disease progression; of which all developed distant progression, with distant progression occurring as the first event in 6 (liver, lung, bone, and abdominal nodes). Actuarial 2-year PFS and OS were 30% and 46%, respectively. One patient received prophylactic cranial irradiation; only one of the other 9 patient developed brain metastasis. Conclusion(s): Pelvic chemoradiation provided LRC for the majority of the patients' lifetime. Most patients had distant failure, but patterns of distant failure do not support routine prophylactic cranial irradiation.Â© Copyright 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Mean improvement of arm abduction, flexion and reflexion angles ranged from 24degree to 83degree, from 47degree to 91degree and from 4degree to 13degree, respectively. The sole prognostic factor found in this study was the degree of orthopedic disability before the treatment. Small impairment at the onset correlated with significant improvement after radiotherapy. No radiation toxicity or secondary malignancies were observed. Conclusion. Radiotherapy of PHS is an effective, safe and economical treatment modality, which could form an alternative for standard orthopedic and pharmacological treatment in recurrent or persistent disease.",Excluded
3634,"Influence of the human papillomavirus on the radio-responsiveness of cancer stem cells in head and neck cancers. A growing proportion of head and neck cancers (HNC) result from HPV infection. Between HNC aetiological groups (HPV positive and HPV negative) clinical evidence demonstrates significantly better treatment response among HPV positive cancers. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are identified in HNC tumour populations as agents of treatment resistance and a target for tumour control. This study examines dynamic responses in populations of a CSC phenotype in HNC cell lines following X-irradiation at therapeutic levels, and comparing between HPV statuses. Variations in CSC density between HPV groups showed no correlation with better clinical outcomes seen in the HPV positive status. CSC populations in HPV positive cell lines ranged from 1.9 to 4.8%, and 2.6 to 9.9% for HPV negative. Following 4Gy X- irradiation however, HPV negative cell lines demonstrated more frequent and significantly greater escalation in CSC proportions, being 3-fold that of the HPV positive group at 72hours post irradiation. CSC proportions of tumour populations are not fixed but subject to change in response to radiation at therapeutic dose levels. These findings imply a potential effect of aetiology on radio-responsiveness in CSCs, illustrating that clonogen treatment response may be more informative of therapy outcomes than inherent population density alone.",Excluded
3349,"Determinants of vitamin D status in long-term renal transplant patients. In this study, we explored the determinants of vitamin D status in a large cohort of stable, Long-term renal transplant (RTx) patients. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations, and bone biochemistry parameters, were retrospectively analyzed from 266 RTx patients (>10 yr post-engraftment) presenting to clinic over the course of a year. Forty-five percent of the cohort were vitamin D deficient (<37.5 nM), 38% insufficient (37.5 75-nM), and 17% sufficient (>75 nM). Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were higher in patients presenting in summer (p<0.001) and in more active patients (p<0.05). RTx patients with non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) (n=45) had higher 25(OH)D concentrations than patients without NMSC (n=221; p<0.05) despite these patients being older, having worse eGFR, transplanted for longer, and less active physically (p<0.05). Lower 25(OH)D concentrations were associated with higher PTH concentrations (p<0.05) which, in the setting of widespread hypovitaminosis, suggests that secondary hyperparathyroidism was common in this cohort. In conclusion, season and activity status are important determinants of vitamin D status. We report, for the first time, that NMSC is associated with higher 25(OH)D, probably through increased UV radiation exposure. Long-term RTx patients may benefit from oral vitamin D supplementation, but this requires a randomized controlled trial to confirm. Copyright Â© 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.",Excluded
2791,"Residual tumor after neoadjuvant chemoradiation outside the radiation therapy target volume: A new prognostic factor for survival in esophageal cancer. Purpose/Objective(s) The aim of this study was to analyze the accuracy of gross tumor volume (GTV) delineation and clinical target volume (CTV) margins for neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (neo-CRT) in esophageal carcinoma at pathologic examination and to determine the impact on survival. Methods and Materials The study population consisted of 63 esophageal cancer patients treated with neo-CRT. GTV and CTV borders were demarcated in situ during surgery on the esophagus, using anatomical reference points to provide accurate information regarding tumor location at pathologic evaluation. To identify prognostic factors for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), a Cox regression analysis was performed. Results After resection, macroscopic residual tumor was found outside the GTV in 7 patients (11%). Microscopic residual tumor was located outside the CTV in 9 patients (14%). The median follow-up was 15.6 months. With multivariate analysis, only microscopic tumor outside the CTV (hazard ratio [HR], 4.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-15.36), and perineural growth (HR, 5.77; 95% CI, 1.27-26.13) were identified as independent prognostic factors for OS. The 1-year OS was 20% for patients with tumor outside the CTV and 86% for those without (P<.01). For DFS, microscopic tumor outside the CTV (HR, 5.92; 95% CI, 1.89-18.54) and ypN+ (HR, 3.36; 95% CI, 1.33-8.48) were identified as independent adverse prognostic factors. The 1-year DFS was 23% versus 77% for patients with or without tumor outside the CTV (P<.01). Conclusions Microscopic tumor outside the CTV is associated with markedly worse OS after neo-CRT. This may either stress the importance of accurate tumor delineation or reflect aggressive tumor behavior requiring new adjuvant treatment modalities. Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc.

3402,"Imbalanced MMP-3 and MMP-12 serum levels in systemic lupus erythematosus patients with Jaccoud's arthropathy and a distinctive MRI pattern. OBJECTIVE: Metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 and MMP-12 are proteolytic enzymes especially implicated in joint inflammation. This study aims to evaluate their association with arthritis features and hand MRI abnormalities in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHOD(S): Fifty SLE patients, with a mean (SD) age of 48.1 (14.6) years were tested for MMP-3 and MMP-12 serum levels, then further classified according to the presence of X-Ray erosions and joint deformities. Eighteen rheumatoid arthritis patients aged 47.9 (11.8) and 14 healthy people aged 46.0 (11.0) were enrolled as control groups. A subgroup of 28 SLE patients underwent a dominant-hand MRI; the detected changes were classified and semiquantitatively scored as capsular swelling, synovitis, edematous or proliferative tenosynovitis, bone oedema, bone erosions. Statistical analysis was performed using multiple regression models. RESULT(S): MMP-3 were significantly higher in patients with Jaccoud's arthropathy (JA) (22.1ng/ml, p< 0.05) and independently associated with hsCRP serum levels (B-coeff 0.50; r=0.30; p< 0.05). MMP-12 serum levels were significantly lower in patients with JA (0.18ng/ml, p< 0.05) and inversely associated with the prednisone daily dose (B-coeff -0.03; r= -0.44; p< 0.01). Capsular swelling and edematous tenosynovitis, the most prevalent hand MRI changes in patients with JA, associated with higher MMP-3 (B-coeff 0.12; r=0.66; p< 0.01 and B-coeff 0.08; r=0.59; p< 0.01, respectively) and lower MMP-12 serum levels (B-coeff -7.4; r= -0.50; p< 0.05 and B-coeff -5.2; r= -0.44; p= 0.05, respectively). CONCLUSION(S): Imbalanced MMP-3 and MMP-12 serum levels are influenced by inflammation and glucocorticoids in SLE patients and associated with JA and distinctive hand MRI changes.Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2021.

Background: To evaluate the safety of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) of bone metastases in oligometastatic disease and to investigate prognostic factors of local control (LC), progression/disease-free survival (PDFS), and overall survival (OS). Method(s): Eligibility criteria were number of metastates <=5, controlled primary tumor without evidence of progression under systemic therapy, exclusion of surgery, and no previous radiotherapy of the lesion of interest. Oligometastatic status was classified into only bone (BOD) and outside bone disease (OBOD), whereas SBRT was delivered to bone lesions using 2 different schedules: 24 Gy/1 fraction or 27 Gy/3 fractions. A positron emission tomography study of the lesion of interest was performed at baseline and at 3 months after SBRT to evaluate metabolic response according to European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) criteria. A Cox regression model was used for univariate and multivariate analysis. Result(s): Between January 2010 and December 2013, 40 patients were enrolled. Only 1 patient experienced severe late toxicity (radiation-related fracture). Local control was longer among responders' than nonresponders' lesions (94.2% and 91.2% versus 63% and 35% at 1 and 2 years, respectively) (p = 0.004; hazard ratio = 9.958). The multivariate analysis of PDFS showed a significant correlation with planning target volume (PTV) size (p = 0.003) and oligometastatic status (p = 0.002). The multivariate analysis of OS confirmed a statistically significant value of the oligometastatic status (p = 0.002) and a significant trend for PTV size (p = 0.065). Conclusion(s): Stereotactic body radiotherapy is safe with a low incidence of severe toxicity. Positron emission tomography response was a strong prognostic factor of LC whereas BOD status and small PTV size could identify a subset of oligometastatic patients at better prognosis.Copyright Â© 2015 INTM, Italy.",Excluded
2939,"Opioid prescription patterns among radiation oncologists in the United States. Background: Radiation oncologists (ROs) play an important role in managing cancer pain; however, their opioid prescribing patterns remain poorly described. Method(s): The 2016 Medicare Physician Compare National Downloadable and the 2016 Medicare Part D Prescriber Data files were cross-linked to identify RO-written opioid prescriptions. Result(s): Of 4,627 identified ROs, 1,360 (29.3%) wrote >10 opioid prescriptions. The average number of opioid prescriptions written was significantly (P <=.05) associated with the following RO characteristics: sex [13.1 +/- 36.5 male vs 7.5 +/- 16.9 female]; years since medical school graduation [4.5 +/- 11.5 1-10 years vs 12.6 +/- 26.0 11-24 years vs 13.3 +/- 40.9 >=25 years]; practice size [15.5 +/- 44.6 size <=10 vs 13.3 +/- 25.9 size 11-49 vs 8.5 +/- 12.7 size 50-99 vs 8.8 +/- 26.9 size >=100]; Medicare Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS) participation [12.6 +/- 31.8 yes vs 7.0 +/- 35.4 no]; and practice location [17.4 +/- 47.0 South vs 10.6 +/- 29.4 Midwest vs 8.1 +/- 13.9 West vs 6.9 +/- 15.2 Northeast]. On multivariable regression modeling, male sex (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.22-1.35, P <.001), >=25 years since graduation (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.64-0.70, 1-10 years vs >=25 years; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.96 - 1.04, 11-24 years vs >=25 years; P <.001), practice size <10 members (RR 1.51, CI 1.44-1.59, <=10 vs >=100 members, RR 1.27, CI 1.20-1.34, 10-49 vs >=100 members, RR 0.86, CI 0.80-0.92, 50-99 vs >=100 members, P <.001), PQRS participation (RR 1.12, CI 1.04-1.19, P <.002), and Southern location (RR 0.67, CI 0.64-0.70, Midwest vs South; RR 0.39, CI 0.37-0.41, Northeast vs South; RR 0.43, CI 0.41-0.46, West vs South; P <.001) were predictive of higher opioid prescription rates. Conclusion(s): Factors associated with increased number of RO-written opioid prescriptions were male sex, >=25 years since graduation, group practice <10, PQRS participation, and Southern location. Additional research is required to establish optimal opioid prescribing practices for ROs.Copyright Â© 2020 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Excluded
3355,"Central command and metaboreflex cardiovascular responses to sustained handgrip during microgravity. Four subjects were studied before and during a 16-day space flight. The test included 2min of rest, 2min of sustained handgrip (SHG), and 2min of post-exercise circulatory occlusion (PECO). Heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) responses to central command and mechanoreceptor stimulation were determined from the difference between SHG and PECO. Responses to metaboreceptor stimulation were determined from the difference between PECO and rest. Late in-flight (days 12-14) the central command/mechanoreceptor component of the HR response was reduced by 5bpm (P=0.01) from its pre-flight value of 15 (+/-3)bpm (mean (+/-SEM)). At the same time the metaboreflex responses of HR and MAP were unchanged. The attenuated HR response to central command was likely of baroreflex origin. Together with a parallel study of PECO after dynamic leg exercise, our data indicate that central processing of metaboreflex inputs is unchanged in microgravity whereas metaboreflex inputs from weight-bearing muscles are enhanced.",Excluded

2902,"Selective Nodal Irradiation for Head and Neck Cancer Using Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy: Application of RTOG Consensus Guidelines in Routine Clinical Practice. Purpose: We have been using intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for selective neck irradiation. This article presents an analysis of patterns of failure and their dosimetric correlation. Methods and Materials: Between October 2003 and January 2008, 83 patients with head-and-neck cancer were treated with IMRT. Nodal levels were contoured as per the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) consensus guidelines. Result(s): There were 32 relapses with 23 local relapses (21 local relapses alone and 2 local and regional relapses, simultaneously), 9 regional relapses (including 2 simultaneous local and regional relapses), and 5 distant relapses, of which 2 patients had local relapses. At 2 and 3 years, the locoregional relapse-free survival rates were was 68.3% and 60.8%, respectively, while the overall survival rates were 84.1% and 81.7%, respectively. Subgroup analyses revealed significant differences in locoregional relapse-free survival rates for total treatment times of <53 days vs. >53 days, a volume of CTV1PTV (i.e., the volume prescribed 70 Gy) <177 cc vs. >177 cc, a V100 for CTV1PTV of <91% vs. >91%, and a minimum dose to CTV1PTV of <54 Gy vs. >54 Gy. There were no failures in the elective nodal volume, substantiating both the nodal selection criteria and the RTOG consensus guidelines for delineation of neck node levels. Conclusion(s): IMRT for head-neck cancer is feasible, using elective nodal selection criteria along with RTOG consensus guidelines for the radiological boundaries of levels of neck nodes.

1208,"Indoor exposure to 222Rn: a public health perspective. The objective of this study was to assess the lung cancer risk resulting from indoor radon exposure in the province of Quebec, Canada, and to evaluate the efficacy of mitigation measures to reduce this exposure. Concentrations of radon were determined in a representative sample of houses, and the corresponding lung cancer risk estimates were generated using the BEIR IV model, taking into account smoking, residential mobility, and regional variations in radon concentrations. Mean (geometric) radon concentrations in basements (n = 418) and on first floors (n = 319) were, respectively, 34.4 (95% CI-30.6 to 38.8) and 16.5 Bq m(-3) (14.2 to 19.3). A total of 109 deaths from lung cancer are predicted to occur as a result of this exposure in a cohort of 60,000 people. Detecting all residences with high radon concentrations (equal to or above 200 Bq m(-3)) and implementing mitigation measures in each of them would reduce by 4 the number of lung cancer deaths attributable to indoor radon exposure. A reduction of 0.05% in the prevalence of smoking would prevent as many deaths from lung cancer as would radon mitigation. From a public health perspective, in order to reduce mortality from lung cancer, most efforts should be focused on smoking, not on the relatively minor and hardly preventable population risk arising from household radon exposure.",Excluded
3869,"Long-term evaluation of the effect of hypofractionated high-energy proton treatment of benign meningiomas by means of 11C-l-methionine positron emission tomography. Purpose: To determine if 11C-l-methionine PET is a useful tool in the evaluation of the long-term effect of proton beam treatment in patients with meningioma remnant. Method(s): Included in the study were 19 patients (4 men, 15 women) with intracranial meningioma remnants who received hypofractionated high-energy proton beam treatment. Patients were examined with 11C-l-methionine PET and MRI prior to treatment and after 6 months, and 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10 years. Temporal changes in methionine uptake ratio, meningioma volume, meningioma regrowth and clinical symptoms throughout the follow-up period were evaluated. Result(s): In 17 patients the tumour volume was unchanged throughout the follow-up. The methionine uptake ratio on PET decreased over the years in most patients. In two patients the tumour remnant showed progression on MRI. In these patients, prior to the volume increase on MRI, the methionine uptake ratio increased. One patient experienced transient clinical symptoms and showed radiological evidence of a radiation-induced reaction close to the irradiated field. Conclusion(s): Proton beam treatment is a safe and effective treatment for achieving long-term growth arrest in meningioma remnants. Follow-up with 11C-l-methionine PET may be a valuable adjunct to, but not a replacement for, standard radiological follow-up.Copyright Â© 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
2121,"Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in the combined modality treatment of anal cancer patients. Objective: To report clinical and dosimetric outcomes of a consecutive series of patients with anal cancer treated with volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) concomitant to chemotherapy (CT). Method(s): A cohort of 39 patients underwent VMAT employing a schedule consisting of 50.4Gy/28 fractions to the gross tumour volume (GTV) and 42Gy/28 fractions to the elective nodal volumes for patients with cT2N0 disease. Patients with cT3-T4/N0-N3 tumours were prescribed 54Gy/30 fractions to the GTV and 50.4Gy/30 fractions to the gross nodal volumes if sized #3cm or 54Gy/30 fractions if . 3cm. Elective nodal regions were given 45Gy/30 fractions. CT was administered concurrently following Nigro's regimen. The primary end point was acute toxicity. Secondary end points were colostomy-free survival (CFS), disease-free survival (DFS), cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS). Dosimetric data are also provided. Result(s): Median follow-up was 21 months. Maximum acute toxicities were: dermatologic-G3: 18%; gastrointestinal-G3: 5%; genitourinary-G3: 2%; anaemia-G2: 7%; leukopenia-G3: 28%; G4: 8%; neutropenia-G3: 13%; G4: 18%; thrombocytopenia-G3: 11%; and G4: 2%. The actuarial 2-year CFS was 77.9% [95% confidence interval (CI): 54-90.4%]. Actuarial 2-year OS and CSS were 85.2% (95% CI: 60.1-95.1%), while DFS was 75.1% (95% CI: 52.4.7-88.1%).

3108,"Additional myeloablation with 52Fe before bone marrow transplantation. For many hematological malignancies, high-dose chemoradiotherapy followed by bone marrow transplantation offers the best and sometimes the only chance for cure. However, the main causes of failure of this therapy are relapse and toxicity. In order to selectively deliver higher doses of radiotherapy to the bone marrow and to spare normal organs, we explored 52Fe therapy before a conventional BMT conditioning regimen. Twenty-four patients at high risk for relapse after BMT were included in a phase II study. The median follow-up was 42 months. The median 52Fe dose was 59 mCi. This resulted in a median radiation-absorbed dose (RAD) to the BM of 626 rad. The median RAD to the liver was 338 rad. No untoward effects were noted after the injections of 52Fe. The patients recovered hematopoiesis without toxicity in excess of that expected with conventional conditioning alone. The 3-year DFS probability was 49% (95% CI: 20-78%), Eight patients have relapsed,three of them in extramedullary sites. 52Fe should provide a way to boost the radiation dose to marrow-based diseases before bone marrow transplantation without excessive toxicity.",Excluded
1526,"Upfront gefitinib/erlotinib treatment followed by concomitant radiotherapy for advanced lung cancer: A mono-institutional experience. Background: Upfront tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) has proved effective for selective advanced lung cancer patients in Taiwan. We hypothesized that early integration of radiotherapy during TKI treatment would decrease the chance of drug resistance and prolong progression-free survival (PFS). Method(s): This study included 25 patients with stage IIIb or IV non-squamous cell, non-small cell lung cancer (NSqCLC) who responded to upfront TKI treatment. Multi-target radiotherapy was administered during the TKI treatment course. Tomotherapy comprising a hypofractionated schedule with a dose of 40-50. Gy in 16-20 fractions was used for individual metastatic lesions. Result(s): The patients' median follow-up duration was 30 months (range, 9-62 months). Of the 23 patients who had stage IV disease, 9 had oligometastases (<=5 gross target volumes) and 14 were in the more advanced stages of the disease. Twelve patients received more than 1 cycle of radiotherapy (median, 3; range, 2-6) with TKI being the only systemic treatment before they were salvaged with chemotherapy. The overall response rate after radiotherapy was 84.0%, and the median PFS was 16 months. The 3-year overall survival rate was 62.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 39.1-85.8%). Toxicities were generally tolerated but it is necessary to prevent radiation-induced pneumonitis. Conclusion(s): We showed that combined first-line TKI therapy and early multi-target radiotherapy are very effective in selected patients that respond to TKI, when the status of mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are not known before the treatment. Our data may aid expansion of the effectiveness of TKI treatment through radiotherapy in Asian patients with stage IV NSqCLC. Â© 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Excluded
3217,"Comparing outcomes of concurrent chemotherapy regimens in patients 65 years old or older with locally advanced oropharyngeal carcinoma. Background: The comparative efficacy of cisplatin (CDDP), carboplatin, and cetuximab (CTX) delivered concurrently with radiation for locally advanced oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma continues to be evaluated. Method(s): The linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database was used to identify and compare patient and disease profiles, mortality, toxicity, and overall cost for patients with oropharynx cancer undergoing definitive concurrent chemoradiation with CDDP, carboplatin, or CTX between 2006 and 2011. The human papillomavirus status was unknown. The primary outcome was 2-year overall survival (OS). Result(s): Four hundred nine patients receiving concurrent CDDP (n = 167), carboplatin (n = 69), or CTX (n = 173) were included. Those who were older, those who were nonwhite, and those with a Charlson Comorbidity Index >= 2 were less likely to receive CDDP. Two-year OS was inferior with CTX (hazard ratio [HR], 1.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-2.60; P =.020) and no different with carboplatin (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.73-2.35; P =.362) in a Cox proportional hazards model (reference CDDP). There was no statistically significant difference between carboplatin and CTX (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.77-2.14; P =.891). Rates of antiemetic use and hospital visits for nausea/emesis/diarrhea or dehydration were statistically higher with CDDP. Pneumonia rates were higher with carboplatin. In the multivariate model, the corrected mean per-patient spending was significantly higher for CTX and carboplatin than CDDP ($61,133 and $65,721 vs $48,709). Conclusion(s): Patients who received CDDP had improved OS. CDDP was also associated with slightly lower overall costs and higher antiemetic usage and hospital visit rates, although a strong selection bias was observed because those receiving CTX and carboplatin were older and had higher comorbidity scores.Copyright Â© 2018 American Cancer Society",Excluded

1112,"Impact of clinical and therapeutic factors on major late complications after radiotherapy with or without concomitant chemotherapy for anal carcinoma. PURPOSE: To investigate factors potentially influencing major late morbidity after sphincter-conserving treatment for anal carcinoma., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Grade 3-4 complications were retrospectively analyzed in 144 evaluable patients (pts), 55 pts after split-course radiotherapy (RT), and 89 after concomitant chemo-RT. First sequence RT delivered a median dose of 39.6 Gy using megavoltage photon beams. Boost treatment used either 192Ir implantation or external beam RT (median dose 20 Gy). Chemotherapy started on day 1 and in 83% of pts consisted of Mitomycin-C (10 mg/m2) and a 5-day infusion of 5-fluorourcil (600-800 mg/m2/day). Uni- and multivariate analyses tested the association of following factors with complication rate: age, gender, stage, anatomic tumor extent, type of biopsy, external RT technique (dose, fraction size, field arrangement), boost type (brachytherapy vs. external), brachytherapy dose and dose rate, overall treatment time, and addition of chemotherapy., RESULTS: Five-year actuarial complication rate was 16%. Two variables were significantly associated with complication rate: anatomic tumor extent (canal or margin vs. both +/- rectum; 10 vs. 31% complications, p = 0.0004) and first sequence prescribed dose (< 39.6 Gy vs. > or = 39.6 Gy; 7 vs. 23% complications, p = 0.012), confirmed as independent factors by Cox analysis. Grade 4 anal morbidity correlated significantly with prior local excision. All six bone complications were observed in pts treated by chemo-RT using large pelvic fields, five occurring in pts older than 66., CONCLUSION: Pts with tumors involving more than one anatomic subsite or treated with the higher first sequence RT dose are at greater risk of major complications. Prior tumor excision and combined modality therapy in older pts appear to favor major anal and bone complications, respectively.",Excluded
1183,"Evaluation of automated lung nodule detection on low-dose computed tomography scans from a lung cancer screening program(1). RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of a fully automated lung nodule detection method in a large database of low-dose computed tomography (CT) scans from a lung cancer screening program. Because nodules demonstrate a spectrum of radiologic appearances, the performance of the automated method was evaluated on the basis of nodule malignancy status, size, subtlety, and radiographic opacity., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A database of 393 thick-section (10 mm) low-dose CT scans was collected. Automated lung nodule detection proceeds in two phases: gray-level thresholding for the initial identification of nodule candidates, followed by the application of a rule-based classifier and linear discriminant analysis to distinguish between candidates that correspond to actual lung nodules and candidates that correspond to non-nodules. Free-response receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to evaluate the performance of the method based on a jackknife training/testing approach., RESULTS: An overall nodule detection sensitivity of 70% (330 of 470) was attained with an average of 1.6 false-positive detections per section. At the same false-positive rate, 83% (57 of 69) of the malignant lung nodules in the database were detected. When the method was trained specifically for malignant nodules, a sensitivity of 80% (55 of 69) was attained with 0.85 false-positives per section., CONCLUSION: We have evaluated an automated lung nodule detection method with a large number of low-dose CT scans from a lung cancer screening program. An overall sensitivity of 80% for malignant nodules was achieved with 0.85 false-positive detections per section. Such a computerized lung nodule detection method is expected to become an important part of CT-based lung cancer screening programs.",Excluded
2914,"Embo-EVAR: A Technique to Prevent Type II Endoleak? A Single-Center Experience. Background Intraprocedural aneurysm sac embolization (embo-EVAR) during endovascular abdominal aneurysm repair (EVAR) using coils and fibrin glue is a technique for preventing type II endoleak (EII). Our aim is to evaluate feasibility, safety and clinical outcome of this promising approach. Materials and Methods A retrospective clinical case analysis of 72 patients who underwent EVAR during the period 2011-2014. Two groups were compared at 6 and 12 months follow-up with contrast media computed tomography scan and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) imaging: consecutively, 36 patients (group A) treated with classic EVAR and 36 patients (group B) treated with embo-EVAR. Coils were released filling better as possible the aneurysm sac; the embolization was completed by injecting fibrin glue. Device and materials used, differential systemic and sac pressures, presence of any endoleak, and complication were registered. Results In our experience, we had 100% technical success without surgical conversion. Embo-EVAR was performed, after endograft deployment, in group B patients, all with ratio of DELTA-pressures (obtained from DELTA-sac pressure/DELTA-differential pressure) > 0.16. No early or late complications occurred and mortality was nil. Follow-up was performed with computed tomography-angiography and CEUS at 6 and 12 months. We observed 9 type II and 1 type Ia endoleak in group A and 2 type II and 1 type Ib endoleaks in group B. Mean radiation exposure time was 30.3 min in group A and 43.3 min in group B. EVAR procedure average cost was 9,000 . The average cost of sac embolization was 1,500. Conclusions Although a randomized study is necessary, embo-EVAR may be a valid approach to prevent type II endoleaks and further complications. Mild costs and exposure-dose increase could be accepted to avoid reinterventions, and in our experience, it could be routinely performed with excellent results.Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
4141,"Establishing the European diagnostic reference levels for interventional cardiology. Interventional cardiac procedures may be associated with high patient doses and therefore require special attention to protect the patients from radiation injuries such as skin erythema, cardiovascular tissue reactions or radiation-induced cancer. In this study, patient exposure data is collected from 13 countries (37 clinics and nearly 50 interventional rooms) and for 10 different procedures. Dose data was collected from a total of 14,922 interventional cardiology procedures. Based on these data European diagnostic reference levels (DRL) for air kerma-area product are suggested for coronary angiography (CA, DRL = 35 Gy cm2), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI, 85 Gy cm2), transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI, 130 Gy cm2), electrophysiological procedures (12 Gy cm2) and pacemaker implantations. Pacemaker implantations were further divided into single-chamber (2.5 Gy cm2) and dual chamber (3.5 Gy cm2) procedures and implantations of cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemaker (18 Gy cm2). Results show that relatively new techniques such as TAVI and treatment of chronic total occlusion (CTO) often produce relatively high doses, and thus emphasises the need for use of an optimization tool such as DRL to assist in reducing patient exposure. The generic DRL presented here facilitate comparison of patient exposure in interventional cardiology.Copyright Â© 2018 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica",Excluded
1504,"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, glioblastoma multiforme, and impact on toxicities and overall survival: The mayo clinic experience. Purpose: The diagnoses of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and depression are often found to coexist. The impact of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) on treatment-related toxicity and outcome in patients with GBM is unclear. Methods and Materials: We retrospectively reviewed 160 patients with GBM who received treatment at our institution between 1999 and 2008. Those taking an SSRI during treatment for GBM were identified and toxicities were assessed. Result(s): Median survival for the entire cohort was 1.05 years. A total of 35 patients (21.8%) took an SSRI during initial treatment for GBM. There was no statistical difference in the rate of >=grade 3 toxicity in patients taking an SSRI when compared with those who were not (11.4% vs. 13.6%, respectively; P = 1.00). Two-year survival in the cohort of patients taking an SSRI was 32% versus 17% in those who were not (P = 0.18). After making adjustment for age, recursive partitioning analysis class, and extent of surgery, absence of an SSRI during treatment was associated with a hazard risk of 1.5 (95% confidence interval = 1.00-2.42; P = 0.05). Conclusion(s): This retrospective review suggests that concomitant use of an SSRI during treatment does not adversely affect survival. There was no increased toxicity with the use of SSRI concurrent with treatment of newly-diagnosed GBM. Copyright Â© 2011 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Excluded
1718,"Impact of VMAT-IMRT compared to 3D conformal radiotherapy on anal sphincter dose distribution in neoadjuvant chemoradiation of rectal cancer. Background: Neoadjuvant radio- or chemoradiation (nIRT) therapy is the standard treatment for loco-regional advanced rectal cancer patients of the lower or middle third. Currently, intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is not the recommended radiation technique even though IMRT has advantages compared to 3D-radiation regarding dose sparing to organs at risk like small bowel and urinary bladder. So far, the benefit of IMRT concerning the anal sphincter complex is not examined. With this study we intended to evaluate the dose distribution on the anal sphincters of rectal cancer patients treated with IMRT in comparison with 3D-techniques. Method(s): We selected 16 patients for the IMRT-group and 16 patients for the 3D-group with rectal cancer of the middle third who were treated in our institute. All patients received 45 Gy in a chemoradiation protocol. Patients in both groups were matched regarding stage, primary tumor distance to the anal verge and size of the tumor. We delineated the internal and external anal sphincters, the addition of both sphincters and the levator ani muscle in all patients. Subsequently, we evaluated and compared dose parameters of the different sphincters in both groups and analysed the configuration of the isodoses in the area of the caudal radiation field, respectively. Result(s): Most of the relevant dose parameters of the caudal sphincters (Dmean, Dmedian, V10-V40) were significantly reduced in the IMRT-group compared to the 3D-group. Accordingly, the isodoses at the caudal edge of the target volume in the IMRT group demonstrated a steep dose fall. The levator ani muscle always was included into the planned target volumes and received the full dose in both groups. Conclusion(s): The modern VMAT-IMRT can significantly reduce the dose to the anal sphincters for rectal cancer patients of the middle third who were treated with conventional chemoradiation therapy.Copyright Â© 2018 The Author(s).",Excluded
4218,"The use of a comprehensive tumour xenograft dataset to validate gene signatures relevant for radiation response. PURPOSE: To investigate the use of xenograft models in a novel gene signature validation method using gene expression microarrays., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gene expression profiles of ten human Head and Neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) were obtained. Several published prognostic gene expression signatures were evaluated within this set. These consisted of different radiotherapy relevant signatures (i.e. for hypoxia, proliferation and 'stemness'). Signatures were correlated with various endpoints that have been determined in the ten different xenograft models. These include immunohistochemical measures for hypoxia and proliferation, volume doubling time (VDT) and local tumour control after fractionated irradiation or after single dose irradiation under clamp hypoxia., RESULTS: We found several significant correlations between the published gene expression signatures and tumour parameters. Several signatures, like the proliferation and wound signature correlated with BrdU labelling index. Further a 'stemness'-related gene signature showed a strong negative correlation with hypoxic fraction., CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous assessment of immunohistochemistry, in vivo tumour properties and gene expression profiling in a comprehensive set of xenograft models can be used to validate and potentially infer biological information about prognostic gene signatures.",Excluded
4402,"What can space radiation protection learn from radiation oncology?. Protection from cosmic radiation of crews of long-term space missions is now becoming an urgent requirement to allow a safe colonization of the moon and Mars. Epidemiology provides little help to quantify the risk, because the astronaut group is small and as yet mostly involved in low-Earth orbit mission, whilst the usual cohorts used for radiation protection on Earth (e.g. atomic bomb survivors) were exposed to a radiation quality substantially different from the energetic charged particle field found in space. However, there are over 260,000 patients treated with accelerated protons or heavier ions for different types of cancer, and this cohort may be useful for quantifying the effects of space-like radiation in humans. Space radiation protection and particle therapy research also share the same tools and devices, such as accelerators and detectors, as well as several research topics, from nuclear fragmentation cross sections to the radiobiology of densely ionizing radiation. The transfer of the information from the cancer radiotherapy field to space is manifestly complicated, yet the two field should strengthen their relationship and exchange methods and data.Copyright Â© 2021",Excluded
3307,"[Simultaneous radiochemotherapy and endoluminal HDR brachytherapy in esophageal cancer]. PURPOSE: To study efficacy and toxicity of radiochemotherapy in esophageal cancer including initial endoluminal high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT)., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 01/1995 and 06/2005, 61 patients with esophageal cancer were treated preoperatively with definitive and palliative intent. Treatment started with intraluminal HDR-BT for recanalization of the esophagus (single fraction size of 8 Gy in 0.5 cm depth, three times, q7d) followed by external-beam radiation therapy (50 Gy total dose, 5 x 2 Gy/week, 25 fractions in 5 weeks). Chemotherapy was started simultaneously with external irradiation (three courses of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil, q21d)., RESULTS: Swallowing function improved in 55/61 patients (dysphagia classification according to the RTOG), and worsened in 6/61 patients, respectively. Median duration of symptomatic improvement was 11 months, median follow-up 12 months (range 3-68 months). Following simultaneous radiochemotherapy, tumor resectability was achieved in 7/25 patients of the neoadjuvant group, and the histological specimen showed complete remission in 6/7 patients., CONCLUSION: These results indicate a favorable effect of simultaneous radiochemotherapy starting with endoluminal HDR-afterloading-( AL-)BT in esophageal cancer.",Excluded
1252,"Late radiation-associated dysphagia (late-RAD) with lower cranial neuropathy after oropharyngeal radiotherapy: A preliminary dosimetric comparison. Background and objectives Late radiation-associated dysphagia (late-RAD) is a rare delayed toxicity, in oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) survivors. Prevention of late-RAD is paramount because the functional impairment can be profound and refractory to standard therapies. The objective of this analysis is to identify candidate dosimetric predictors of late-RAD and associated lower cranial neuropathies after radiotherapy (RT) or chemo-RT (CRT) for OPC. Materials and methods An unmatched retrospective case-control analysis was conducted. Late-RAD cases were identified among OPC patients treated with definitive RT or CRT. Controls were selected with minimum of 6 years without symptoms of late-RAD. Dysphagia-aspiration related structures (DARS) and regions of interest containing cranial nerve paths (RCCNPs) were retrospectively contoured. Dose volume histograms were calculated. Non-parametric bivariate associations were analyzed with Bonferroni correction and multiple logistic regression models were fit. Results Thirty-eight patients were included (12 late-RAD cases, 26 controls). Median latency to late-RAD was 5.8 years (range: 4.5-11.3 years). Lower cranial neuropathies were present in 10 of 12 late-RAD cases. Mean superior pharyngeal constrictor (SPC) dose was higher in cases relative to controls (median: 70.5 vs. 61.6 Gy). Mean SPC dose significantly predicted late-RAD (p = 0.036) and related cranial neuropathies (p = 0.019). RCCNPs did not significantly predict late-RAD or cranial neuropathies. Conclusions SPC dose may predict for late-RAD and related lower cranial neuropathies. These data, and those of previous studies that have associated SPC dose with classical dysphagia endpoints, suggest impetus to constrain dose to the SPCs when possible. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

1909,"Cancer risk estimation of genotoxic chemicals based on target dose and a multiplicative model. A mechanistic model and associated procedures are proposed for cancer risk assessment of genotoxic chemicals. As previously shown for ionizing radiation, a linear multiplicative model was found to be compatible with published experimental data for ethylene oxide, acrylamide, and butadiene. The validity of this model was anticipated in view of the multiplicative interaction of mutation with inherited and acquired growth-promoting conditions. Concurrent analysis led to rejection of an additive model (i.e. the model commonly applied for cancer risk assessment). A reanalysis of data for radiogenic cancer in mouse, dog and man shows that the relative risk coefficient is approximately the same (0.4 to 0.5 percent per rad) for tumours induced in the three species. Doses in vivo, defined as the time- integrated concentrations of ultimate mutagens, expressed in millimol x kg- 1 x h (mMh) are, like radiation doses given in Gy or rad, proportional to frequencies of potentially mutagenic events. The radiation dose equivalents of chemical doses are, calculated by multiplying chemical doses (in mMh) with the relative genotoxic potencies (in rad x mMh-1) determined in vitro. In this way the relative cancer incidence increments in rats and mice exposed to ethylene oxide were shown to be about 0.4 percent per rad-equivalent, in agreement with the data for radiogenic cancer. Our analyses suggest that values of the relative risk coefficients for genotoxic chemicals are independent of species and that relative cancer risks determined in animal tests apply also to humans. If reliable animal test data are not available, cancer risks may be estimated by the relative potency. In both cases exposure dose/target dose relationships, the latter via macromolecule adducts, should be determined.",Excluded
3553,"COPD: Do imaging measurements of emphysema and airway disease explain symptoms and exercise capacity?1. Purpose: To determine the role of imaging measurements of emphysema and airway disease in determining chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) symptoms and exercise limitation in patients with COPD, particularly in patients with mild-to-moderate disease. Material(s) and Method(s): Participants (n = 116) with Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) grade U (unclassified) or grade I-IV COPD provided informed consent to an ethics board-approved HIPAA-compliant protocol and underwent spirometry and plethysmography, completed the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), completed a 6-minute walk test for the 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), and underwent hyperpolarized helium 3 (3He) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and computed tomography (CT). Emphysema was estimated by using the MR imaging apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and the relative area of the CT attenuation histogram with attenuation of 2950 HU or less (RA950). Airway disease was measured by using the CT airway wall thickness of airways with an internal perimeter of 10 mm and total airway count. Ventilation defect percentage at 3He MR imaging was used to measure ventilation. Multivariable regression models for the 6MWD and SGRQ symptom subscore were used to evaluate the relationships between physiologic and imaging measurements. Result(s): Multivariate modeling for the 6MWD in 80 patients with GOLD grade U-II COPD showed that ADC (b = 0.34, P = .04), diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (b = 0.60, P = .0008), and residual volume/total lung capacity (b = 20.26, P = .02) were significant variables, while forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and airway disease measurements were not. In 36 patients with GOLD grade III or IV disease, FEV1 (b = 0.48, P = .01) was the only significant contributor in a multivariate model for 6MWD. MR imaging emphysema measurements also made the greatest relative contribution to symptoms in patients with milder (GOLD grade U-II) COPD (ADC: b = 0.60, P = .005; RA950: b = 20.52, P = .02; FEV1: b = 20.45, P = .0002) and in grade III or IV disease (ADC: b = 0.95, P = .01; RA950: b = 20.62, P = .07; airway count: b = 20.49, P = .01). Conclusion(s): In patients with mild-to-moderate COPD, MR imaging emphysema measurements played a dominant role in the expression of exercise limitation, while both CT and MR imaging measurements of emphysema explained symptoms.Copyright Â© RSNA, 2015.",Excluded
3740,"Cytogenetic assessment of heterogeneous radiation doses in cancer patients treated with fractionated radiotherapy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vivo dose-response relation of chromosome aberration formation and distribution in a context of localised and fractionated radiotherapy. Cytogenetic analysis was applied to eight patients, all treated for the same tumour localisation; the same localisation was used to prevent the variability usually observed between patients treated with radiotherapy and to allow the corresponding roles of the size of irradiation field and of the dose rate to be studied. The yield of dicentrics, centric rings and fragments was measured in blood samples taken before treatment, during the course of radiotherapy and up to 6 months after. After the first fraction of radiotherapy, we observed that the whole-body dose estimated from the yield of dicentrics and rings was higher (0.35+/-0.2 Gy) than the calculated equivalent whole-body dose (0.07+/-0.04 Gy). By contrast, the partial-body dose derived from the Qdr (quotient of dicentrics and rings) model was estimated to be 2.2+/-0.3 Gy, which agreed quite well with the dose delivered to the tumour (2.1+/-0.1 Gy). We also found a correlation between the yield of induced chromosome aberrations and the target field size (p = 0.014). U-value analysis showed that the distribution of dicentrics and rings was overdispersed, despite the fractionation of the exposure, and a positive correlation between the U-value and the dose rate was observed (p = 0.017). Overall, these results suggest that the proportion of undamaged lymphocytes could increase with the dose rate.",Excluded
2602,"A pilot comparison of 18F-fluorocholine PET/CT, ultrasonography and 123I/99mTc-sestaMIBI dual-phase dual-isotope scintigraphy in the preoperative localization of hyperfunctioning parathyroid glands in primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism: Influence of thyroid anomalies. We compared 18F-fluorocholine hybrid positron emission tomography/X-ray computed tomography (FCH-PET/CT) with ultrasonography (US) and scintigraphy in patients with hyperparathyroidism and discordant, or equivocal results of US and 123I/99mTc-sesta-methoxyisobutylisonitrile (sestaMIBI) dual-phase parathyroid scintigraphy. FCH-PET/CT was performed in 17 patients with primary (n=11) lithium induced (n=1) or secondary hyperparathyroidism (1 dialyzed, 4 renal-transplanted). The reference standard was based on results of surgical exploration and histopathological examination. The results of imaging modalities were evaluated, on site and by masked reading, on per-patient and perlesion bases. In a first approach, equivocal images/foci were considered as negative. On a per-patient level, the sensitivity was for US 38%, for scintigraphy 69% by open and 94% by masked reading, and for FCHPET/CT 88% by open and 94% by masked reading. On a per-lesion level, sensitivity was for US 42%, for scintigraphy 58% by open and 83% by masked reading, and for FCH-PET/CT 88% by open and 96% by masked reading. One ectopic adenoma was missed by the 3 imaging modalities. Considering equivocal images/foci as positive increased the accuracy of the open reading of scintigraphy or of FCH-PET/CT, but not of US. FCH-PET/CT was significantly superior to US in all approaches, whereas it was more sensitive than scintigraphy only for open reading considering equivocal images/foci as negative (P=0.04). FCH uptake was more intense in adenomas than in hyperplastic parathyroid glands. Thyroid lesions were suspected in 9 patients. They may induce falsepositive results as in one case of oncocytic thyroid adenoma, or falsenegative results as in one case of intrathyroidal parathyroid adenoma. Thyroid cancer (4 cases) can be visualized with FCH as with 99mTcsestaMIBI, but the intensity of uptake was moderate, similar to that of parathyroid hyperplasia. This pilot study confirmed that FCH-PET/CT is an adequate imaging tool in patients with primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism, since both adenomas and hyperplastic parathyroid glands can be detected. The sensitivity of FCH-PET/CT was better than that of US and was not inferior to that of dual-phase dual-isotope 123I/99mTcscintigraphy. Further studies should evaluate whether FCH could replace 99mTc-sestaMIBI as the functional agent for parathyroid imaging, but US would still be useful to identify thyroid lesions.Copyright Â© 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

4597,"Hormonal suppression restores fertility in irradiated mice from both endogenous and donor-derived stem spermatogonia. Irradiation interrupts spermatogenesis and causes prolonged sterility in male mammals. Hormonal suppression treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues has restored spermatogenesis in irradiated rats, but similar attempts were unsuccessful in irradiated mice, monkeys, and humans. In this study, we tested a stronger hormonal suppression regimen (the GnRH antagonist, acyline, and plus flutamide) for efficacy both in restoring endogenous spermatogenesis and in enhancing colonization of transplanted stem spermatogonia in mouse testes irradiated with a total doses between 10.5 and 13.5 Gy. A 4-week hormonal suppression treatment, given immediately after irradiation, increased endogenous spermatogenic recovery 1.5-fold, and 11-week hormonal suppression produced twofold increases compared with sham-treated irradiated controls. Furthermore, 10-week hormonal suppression restored fertility from endogenous surviving spermatogonial stem cells in 90% of 10.5-Gy irradiated mice, whereas only 10% were fertile without hormonal suppression. Four-and 11-week hormonal suppression also enhanced spermatogenic development from transplanted stem spermatogonia in irradiated recipient mice, by 3.1-and 4.8-fold, respectively, compared with those not given hormonal treatment. Moreover, the 10-week hormonal suppression regimen, but not a sham treatment, restored fertility of some 13.5-Gy irradiated recipient mice from donor-derived spermatogonial stem cells. This is the first report of hormonal suppression inducing recovery of endogenous spermatogenesis and fertility in a mouse model treated with anticancer agents. The combination of spermatogonial transplantation with hormonal suppression should be investigated as a treatment to restore fertility in young men after cytotoxic cancer therapy. Â© The Author 2010.

1122,"In vitro radiosensitivity of skin fibroblasts can identify a group of radiotherapy patients having developed complications in a variety of normal tissues. Purpose. - A retrospective study of the in vitro radiosensitivity of skin fibroblasts derived from two groups of patients treated by definitive radiotherapy for a variety of tumors who either displayed or did not display severe complications. Patients and methods. - Seven radiotherapy patients were selected: three were treated for head and neck, prostate and non-Hodgkin lymphoma tumors, and did not develop any significant complications (control group); four patients were treated for bladder, thyroid, head and neck and anal canal tumors and developed serious acute and especially late reactions (hypersensitive group). Primary cell cultures of skin fibroblasts were established and their radiosensitivity studied by the clonogenic assay after exposing to single radiation doses ranging between 1 and 8 Gy. Results. - The survival fraction at 2 Gy (SF2) ranged from 0.27 to 0.38, with a mean of 0.33 for the control group, and from 0.10 to 0.20 with a mean of 0.17 for the hypersensitive group. The Mann-Whitney non-parametric test showed that the difference between the two means was statistically significant (p = 0.03). Conclusion. - The data are in favor of a correlation between the radiosensitivity of patients' fibroblasts and the reactions of different normal tissues to radiotherapy. This association supports the use of the clonogenic survival, or a surrogate test, as a predictive assay. The multiplicity of normal tissues and organs implicated in this association suggests the existence of genetic factors that determine, at least in part, the radiosensitivity of target cells involved in the expression of normal tissues complications following radiotherapy.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To assess the effect of different reconstruction algorithms on computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) performance in ultra-low-dose CT colonography (ULD CTC)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: IRB approval and informed consents were obtained. Thirty prospectively enrolled patients underwent non-contrast CTC at 120 kVp/10 mAs in supine and 100 kVp/10 mAs in prone positions, followed by same-day colonoscopy. Images were reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP), 80% adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR80), and model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR). A commercial CAD system was applied and per-polyp sensitivities and numbers of false-positives (FPs) were compared among algorithms., RESULTS: Mean effective radiation dose of CTC was 1.02 mSv. Of 101 polyps detected and removed by colonoscopy, 61 polyps were detected on supine and on prone CTC datasets on consensus unblinded review, resulting in 122 visible polyps (32 polyps<6 mm, 52 6-9.9 mm, and 38>=10 mm). Per-polyp sensitivity of CAD for all polyps was highest with MBIR (56/122, 45.9%), followed by ASIR80 (54/122, 44.3%) and FBP (43/122, 35.2%), with significant differences between FBP and IR algorithms (P<0.017). Per-polyp sensitivity for polyps>=10 mm was also higher with MBIR (25/38, 65.8%) and ASIR80 (24/38, 63.2%) than with FBP (20/38, 58.8%), albeit without statistical significance (P>0.017). Mean number of FPs was significantly different among algorithms (FBP, 1.4; ASIR, 2.1; MBIR, 2.4) (P=0.011)., CONCLUSION: Although the performance of stand-alone CAD for ULD CTC can be improved, IR algorithms, particularly MBIR, were shown to significantly increase the per-polyp sensitivity of CAD compared to FBP according to this study. Therefore, as ULD CTC only requires 1.02mSv, specific optimization of CAD for ULD CTC and IR algorithms is strongly warranted to make ULD CTC with CAD clinically viable.

Background: To examine toxicity and outcomes for patients treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for gastric cancer. Method(s): Patients with gastroesophageal (GE) junction (Siewert type II and III) or gastric adenocarcinoma who underwent neoadjuvant CRT followed by planned surgical resection at Duke University between 1987 and 2009 were reviewed. Overall survival (OS), local control (LC) and disease-free survival (DFS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Toxicity was graded according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. Result(s): Forty-eight patients were included. Most (73%) had proximal (GE junction, cardia and fundus) tumors. Median radiation therapy dose was 45 Gy. All patients received concurrent chemotherapy. Thirty-six patients (75%) underwent surgery. Pathologic complete response and R0 resection rates were 19% and 86%, respectively. Thirty-day surgical mortality was 6%. At 42 months median follow-up, 3-year actuarial OS was 40%. For patients undergoing surgery, 3-year OS, LC and DFS were 50%, 73% and 41%, respectively. Conclusion(s): Preoperative CRT for gastric cancer is well tolerated with acceptable rates of perioperative morbidity and mortality. In this patient cohort with primarily advanced disease, OS, LC and DFS rates in resected patients are comparable to similarly staged, adjuvantly treated patients in randomized trials.

2167,"Correlation of bone mineral density with skeletal muscle content and physical activity. BACKGROUND: Bone mineral density is the most important indicator for bone level. Osteoporosis is a worldwide problem, and there is no safe and effective radical treatment. It can only be prevented, so bone mineral density arise more attention. OBJECTIVE(S): To explore the relationship between skeletal muscle content, physical activity level and bone mineral density in older adults, so as to provide theoretical basis for preventing osteoporosis treatment. METHOD(S): Totally 111 subjects aged 40 to 84 years were recruited randomly. The bone mineral density was measured by double energy X-Ray bone density meter, and the human skeletal muscle content, fat content and percentage of skeletal muscle were measured by human body component analyzer. The variance analysis was used for multiple group comparisons in different age groups, LSD method for comparisons between groups, and Pearson correlation analysis for correlation analysis. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION(S): Bone mineral density was significantly related to the physical activity, body mass, and skeletal muscle content (r=0.30, 0.41, and 0.45, P < 0.01). For middle and older adults, skeletal muscle content, physical activity level and body mass were positively related to bone mineral density. Age and bone mineral density had a negative relationship. These results indicate that physical activity is an important factor affecting bone density, and higher level of physical activity is beneficial to maintain and improve bone mineral density. Increasing muscle mass and improving body composition can improve bone mineral density.Copyright Â© 2018, Journal of Clinical Rehabilitative Tissue Engineering Research.

Objectives: Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is increasingly used for disease staging and evaluation of treatment effectiveness in limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC). However, the prognostic value of PET/CT metrics in LS-SCLC is not clear. Method(s): Subjects in this retrospective study were 50 patients with LS-SCLC who had had PET/CT before definitive chemoradiation therapy in January 2003 to August 2009; 15 (29%) had also had induction chemotherapy. Median radiation dose was 45 Gy (range, 40.5 to 61.8 Gy). All scans were read and scored by 1 radiologist. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate survival outcomes, and Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the prognostic value of pretreatment standardized uptake values (SUVs) with regard to locoregional control (LRC) and overall survival (OS). Result(s): At a median follow-up time of 18.2 months (range, 2.1 to 78 mo), LRC rates were 64% at 2 and 3 years; OS rates were 81% at 2 years and 61% at 3 years. None of the metrics assessed (receipt of induction chemotherapy, pretreatment SUV primary, SUVnodal, meanSUVmax) was associated with LRC or OS, but patients with residual SUV<=5.5 after treatment had a 3-year OS rate of 69% versus 34% for those with SUV>5.5. Conclusion(s): Pretreatment PET/CT metrics had no prognostic significance for patients with LS-SCLC, perhaps because of the rapid proliferation of SCLC or other confounding factors affecting survival.

Thermosensitive hydrogels are of a great interest due to their many biomedical and pharmaceutical applications. In this study, we synthesized a new series of random poly (methyl vinyl ether-co-maleic anhydride) (Gantrez( R) AN, GZ) and Pluronic( R) F127 (PF127) copolymers (GZ-PF127), that formed thermosensitive hydrogels whose gelation temperature and mechanical properties could be controlled by the molar ratio of GZ and PF127 polymers and the copolymer concentration in water. Gelation temperatures tended to decrease when the GZm/PF127 ratio increased. Thus, at a fixed GZm/PF127 value, sol-gel temperatures decreased at higher copolymer concentrations. Moreover, these hydrogels controlled the release of proteins such as bovine serum albumin (BSA) and recombinant recombinant kinetoplastid membrane protein of Leishmania (rKMP-11) more than the PF127 system. Toxicity studies carried out in J774.2 macrophages showed that cell viability was higher than 80%. Finally, histopathological analysis revealed that subcutaneous administration of low volumes of these hydrogels elicited a tolerable inflammatory response that could be useful to induce immune responses against the protein cargo in the development of vaccine adjuvants.

Background and purpose: In a previous randomized trial we showed that the short-course radiotherapy (RT) regimen of 8 Gy x 2 was feasible in patients with metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC) and short life expectancy. This phase III trial was planned to determine whether in the same category of patients 8 Gy single-dose is as effective as 8 Gy x 2. Material(s) and Method(s): Three hundred and twenty-seven patients with MSCC and short life expectancy were randomly assigned to a short-course of 8 Gy x 2 or to 8 Gy single-dose RT. Median follow-up was 31 months (range, 4-58). Result(s): A total of 303 (93%) patients are assessable, 150 treated with the short-course and 153 with the single-dose RT. No difference in response was found between the two RT schedules adopted. Median duration of response was 5 and 4.5 months for short-course and single-dose RT (p = 0.4), respectively. The median overall survival was 4 months for all cases. Light acute toxicity was registered in a minority of cases. Late toxicity was never recorded. Conclusion(s): Both RT schedules adopted were effective. As already shown in several trials evaluating RT regimens in uncomplicated painful bone metastases, also MSCC patients may achieve palliation with minimal toxicity and inconvenience with a single-dose of 8 Gy.

3322,"Automatic measurements of arterial input and venous output functions on cerebral computed tomography perfusion images: A preliminary study. Background: The current automatic techniques for measuring arterial input function (AIF) and venous output (VOF) on cerebral computed tomography perfusion images are prone to motion artifact and random noise, and their failure rates vary between 10% and 65%. We developed a new automatic technique to overcome these problems. Method(s): A principle axis transformation was applied to perfusion images to correct for translational and rotational motion artifacts. Bone voxels and neighboring voxels were removed from the perfusion images. Only brain voxels were included in the AIF and VOF measurement procedures. The selection criteria, such as large area under the concentration-time curve, early arrival of contrast agents, and narrow effective width, were used to select appropriate arterial and venous voxels for the AIF and VOF measurements. The proposed automatic technique was tested in 20 patients with unilateral cerebral arterial stenosis. The results of the proposed technique were compared to the results obtained by manual measurements and commercially available automatic selection software. Result(s): The AIFs and VOFs were successfully measured using the proposed automatic technique in all 20 patients. The curve shapes, including the area under the concentration-time curve, peak concentration, time to peak, and effective width of the automatically measured AIFs or VOFs were comparable to that were measured manually. Conclusion(s): The proposed automatic measurement technique successfully overcomes the motion artifact and random noise problems encountered in measuring AIF and VOF. It can be easily integrated into software for the automatic calculation of cerebral blood volume and flow. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Excluded
945,"Increased oxidative stress in barn swallows from the Chernobyl region. The Chernobyl nuclear accident produced the largest unintended release of radionuclides in history, with dramatic consequences for humans and other organisms. Exposure to ionizing radiation is known to reduce circulating and stored levels of specific antioxidants in birds and humans, thus potentially increasing oxidative stress. However, overall effects of radioactive exposure on oxidative status have never been investigated in any free ranging vertebrate. We measured plasma antioxidant capacity and concentration of reactive oxygen metabolites in adult barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) from colonies with variable background radiation levels in the Chernobyl region in Ukraine and Belarus. We predicted that antioxidants would decrease while reactive oxygen metabolites would increase with exposure to increasing levels of radiation at the breeding sites. Consistent with this expectation, radiation level positively predicted plasma concentration of reactive oxygen metabolites, whereas no significant covariation was found with non-enzymatic plasma antioxidant capacity. An index of oxidative stress was also larger in barn swallows exposed to high contamination levels. Thus, radioactive contamination appeared to be responsible for the increased generation of reactive oxygen metabolites and the imbalance between reactive oxygen metabolites and non-enzymatic plasma antioxidant capacity.",Included

To improve the early response and local control of parotid tumors, local microwave hyperthermia was used in combination with ionizing radiation in a biinstitutional Phase I/II study., METHODS: From 1984 to 1991, 13 patients (20 lesions) with advanced (10 lesions) or recurrent (10 lesions) parotid tumors (15 primaries and the remaining 5 nodal metastases), were treated with 300-915 MHz of external hyperthermia after external irradiation. Heat was applied twice weekly at a minimum desired temperature of 42.0 degrees C for 30 minutes at steady state. Ionizing radiation was delivered using photon, electron, or mixed electron-photon beams; the prescribed total dose was 70 Gy and 30 Gy for untreated and previously treated lesions, respectively; the median computed total dose was 66 Gy for previously untreated patients (range, 56-70 Gy) and 30 Gy for previously irradiated patients (range, 28-32 Gy)., RESULTS: Acute side effects were limited. Major acute toxicities included three patients (15%) with superficial necrosis, two of three who healed spontaneously in 4 and 6 months. Clinical response evaluated during the third month after the completion of therapy found that 16/20 patients (80%) had a complete response (CR), and 4 (20%) had a partial response. Four out of 16 patients who had CRs (20%) had a local recurrence, resulting in an actuarial local control at 5 years of 62.3 +/- 13.2%., CONCLUSIONS: The combined treatment of local microwave hyperthermia and ionizing radiation proved to be feasible and moderately toxic for patients with advanced, inoperable, or recurrent parotid tumors. Even if clinical result evaluation was not the study endpoint, early response, and 5-year local control rates were encouraging.",Excluded
934,"The role of curative radiotherapy in the treatment of lung cancer. From 1963-1974, 141 patients with lung cancer were treated with curative intent in the A. Maxwell Evans Clinic in Vancouver. The clinical presentation, age and sex distribution, histology, and reasons for surgery not being carried out are examined. The results of this treatment are presented. An attempt has been made to isolate a group of patients who have a better prognosis so that treatment selection can be improved. Hemoptysis, cough, dyspnea, and incidental finding on routine chest x-ray were the most common manner of presentation. Thirty-four percent of the patients were over 70 years of age and 13% were women. The crude overall three- and five-year survival rates were 18 and 10% (19 and 9% in the men, 17 and 14% in the women). Patients presenting with dyspnea had a better survival than those presenting with cough and hemoptysis. Patients with lesions less than 3 cm in diameter had a 28% three-year survival, compared with 14% for lesions greater than 5 cm in diameter. The three- and five-year survival rates in patients over 70 years of age were 23 and 17% respectively. The response to treatment and the survival was better in the patients with squamous cell carcinoma. Twenty-two percent were alive at three years and 12% at five years as compared with 9 and 5% for other histologies. Fifty-four percent of the 35 patients with a complete response and with squamous cell carcinoma were alive at three years, compared with only 8% of the 12 patients with other histologies who showed a complete response.",Excluded
2126,"PET quantification of brain O-GlcNAcase with [18F]LSN3316612 in healthy human volunteers. Background: Previous studies found that [18F]LSN3316612 was a promising positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand for imaging O-GlcNAcase in nonhuman primates and human volunteers. This study sought to further evaluate the suitability of [18F]LSN3316612 for human clinical research. Method(s): Kinetic evaluation of [18F]LSN3316612 was conducted in a combined set of baseline brain scans from 17 healthy human volunteers and test-retest imaging was conducted in 10 of these volunteers; another 6 volunteers had whole-body scans to measure radiation exposure to body organs. Total distribution volume (VT) estimates were compared for the one- and two-tissue compartment models with the arterial input function. Test-retest variability and reliability were evaluated via mean difference and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The time stability of VT was assessed down to a 30-min scan time. An alternative quantification method for [18F]LSN3316612 binding without blood was also investigated to assess the possibility of eliminating arterial sampling. Result(s): Brain uptake was generally high and could be quantified as VT with excellent identifiability using the two-tissue compartment model. [18F]LSN3316612 exhibited good absolute test-retest variability (12.5%), but the arithmetic test-retest variability was far from 0 (11.3%), reflecting a near-uniform increase of VT on the retest scan in nine of 10 volunteers. VT values were stable after 110 min in all brain regions, suggesting that no radiometabolites accumulated in the brain. Measurements obtained using only brain activity (i.e., area under the curve (AUC) from 150-180 min) correlated strongly with regional VT values during test-retest conditions (R2 = 0.84), exhibiting similar reliability to VT (ICC = 0.68 vs. 0.64). Estimated radiation exposure for [18F]LSN3316612 PET was 20.5 +/- 2.1 muSv/MBq, comparable to other 18F-labeled radioligands for brain imaging. Conclusion(s): [18F]LSN3316612 is an excellent PET radioligand for imaging O-GlcNAcase in the human brain. Alternative quantification without blood is possible, at least for within-subject repeat studies. However, the unexplained increase of VT under retest conditions requires further investigation.Copyright Â© 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded
2336,"Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia-a diagnostic enigma!. LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1: Recognize the clinical features of Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2: Discuss the management of Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. CASE: In 2019, an 87-year-old Caucasian male with a history of chronic back pain presented to his primary care doctor's office with a chief complaint of low back pain. In 2004, an X-ray of the lumbosacral spine revealed mild lumbar spondylosis. His back pain began after bending over to pick up his wife. He denied recent trauma, fevers, chills, intravenous drug use, unexplained weight loss, history of malignancy, saddle anesthesia, bowel or bladder incontinence or progressive weakness. He was referred to pain medicine for consideration of steroid injection. MRI lumbar spine was ordered which showed a pathologic compression fracture of L4 with abnormal bone marrow involvement of the left iliac wing. MRI cervical, thoracic spine and CT chest, abdomen and pelvis were ordered to work up malignancy. CT was without metastatic disease. Repeat MRI showed diffuse heterogeneous bone marrow signal concerning for an infiltrating process. The patient was referred to oncology clinic. His father passed away from lymphoma. Physical exam revealed a well appearing male without adenopathy or midline spinal tenderness. Labs showed WBC 7.2, Hb 15.1, platelet count 250, monocytes elevated to 1.0. IgM was elevated to 1,694 while IgG and IgA levels were decreased. 24-hour urine protein collection was negative. Bone marrow biopsy showed CD5 negative/CD10 negative B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder involving approximately 35% of the marrow cellularity. The differential included marrow involvement by a B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma such as lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (favored by the presence of IgM monoclonal gammopathy) and marginal zone lymphoma. The MYD88 L265P mutation was negative. IMPACT/DISCUSSION: Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia is a rare clinicopathologic entity demonstrating bone marrow infiltration by lymphoplasmacytic cells and a serum IgM gammopathy. Elderly, white males are more commonly affected with an annual incidence of 3-4 persons per million. Symptoms are due to the infiltration of lymphoplasmacytic cells in the bone marrow and IgM gammopathy of the blood. Milder symptoms can be secondary to anemia and organomegaly, while more severe symptoms can be due to CNS involvement and hyperviscosity syndrome. Diagnosis is made by monoclonal IgM gammopathy and a bone marrow biopsy demonstrating greater than 10% infiltration by small lymphocytes with a typical immunophenotype. The differential diagnosis includes IgM MGUS, CLL, marginal zone lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma. Asymptomatic patients are managed by observation alone while symptomatic patients are treated with chemotherapy. CONCLUSION(S): * Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia is a rare clinicopathologic entity demonstrating bone marrow infiltration by lymphoplasmacytic cells and a serum IgM gammopathy. * Asymptomatic patients can be managed by observation alone while symptomatic patients are treated with chemotherapy.",Excluded
4248,"Evaluation of myocardial perfusion and left ventricular function six months after percutaneous transmyocardial laser revascularization: comparison of two Ho-YAG laser systems with the same wavelength, but different energy delivery and navigation systems. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Myocardial perfusion and left ventricular function (LVF) were assessed after percutaneous transmyocardial laser revascularization (PTMR) in patients not amenable to conventional revascularization, with a comparison of two laser systems., STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: PTMR was performed with an Eclipse laser in 15 patients, and with a Biosense DMR in 10 patients. (201)Thallium scintigraphy, coronary angiography, and ventriculography were performed at baseline and at the 7.5+/-4.3-month follow-up. All patients in the Biosense DMR group and 10 in the Eclipse group underwent NOGA mapping before PTMR and after follow-up., RESULTS: The event-free survival rates were comparable, and the angina scores of all patients improved significantly, but more so in the Biosense DMR group than in the Eclipse group (1.2+/-1.1 vs. 2.3+/-0.9, P < 0.05). Both, the electrical activity assessed by NOGA mapping and the normalized (201)thallium uptake at redistribution improved significantly in the treated segments after Biosense DMR, while the global LVF decreased insignificantly in the Eclipse group., CONCLUSIONS: PTMR resulted in significant improvements in the clinical symptoms, but the electrical activity improved only in the Biosense DMR group, without transforming to a better LVF.

3296,"The impact of radiotherapy dose and other treatment-related and clinical factors on in-field control in stage I and II non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Purpose/Objective: To assess local (in-field) disease control, identify potential prognostic factors, and elucidate the optimal radiotherapy dose in various clinical settings of Stage I and II nonHodgkin's lymphoma (non-CNS). Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 285 consecutive patients with Stage I and II non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were treated with curative intent, including 159 with radiotherapy (RT) alone and 126 with combined-modality therapy (CMT). Of these, 72 patients had low-grade lymphomas (LGL), 92 had intermediate or high-grade lymphomas (I/HGL), and 21 had unclassified lymphomas. Clinical and treatment variables with potential prognostic significance for in-field disease control, freedom from relapse (FFR), and absolute survival (AS) were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses. Result(s): The 5-, 10-, and 20-year actuarial AS rates were 73%, 46%, and 33% for patients with LGL and 64%, 44%, and 18% for patients with I/HGL, respectively. The 5-, 10-, and 20- year actuarial FFR rates were 62%, 59%, and 49% for patients with LGL and 66%, 57%, and 57% for patients with I/HGL, respectively. Significant prognostic factors identified by the multivariate analysis were age, tumor size, and histology for AS; tumor size and treatment for FFR; and only tumor size for in-field disease control. There were 95 total failures, with only 12 occurring infield. Most failures (65%) were in contiguous unirradiated sites. All 4 in-field failures in patients with LGL occurred after RT doses < 30 Gy, although none occurred in 10 patients with small-volume LGL of the orbit treated with doses < 30 Gy. The 8 in-field failures in patients with I/HGL were distributed evenly throughout the RT dose range; 5 occurred in patients treated with CMT, all with tumors > 6 cm, and 4 with less than a complete response (CR) to chemotherapy. Conclusion(s): Our analysis suggests that the overwhelming problem in the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is not in- field failure but, rather, failure in contiguous unirradiated sites. A dose of 20-25 Gy may be sufficient for small-volume LGL of the orbit. A dose of 30 Gy is sufficient for LGL in general, as well as for patients with nonbulky (<= 6 cm) I/HGL treated with CMT who have a CR. However, patients with I/HGL treated with CMT for tumors > 6 cm and/or without a CR may benefit from doses >= 40 Gy.",Excluded
3772,"Effectiveness and limitations of human identification from cremains: A report of two cases. The present study of two case reports of the victims of the Great East Japan Earthquake demonstrates the effectiveness and limitations of using dental cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging of cremains as a means of identification. In case 1, identification was assisted by further expanding the age range of the cremains evaluated on macroscopy by obtaining CBCT images of the cremated maxilla. The findings of case 2 presented the possibility that the deceased and the candidate were the same person by superimposing the CBCT images of the cremated patella on the X-ray of the candidate. However, since cremated bones are deformed to varying degrees, it is clear that the images obtained before, rather than after, cremation are more effective in comparing post-mortem and ante-mortem images. Thus, it is necessary to collect extensive and diverse data on the deceased before cremation.Copyright Â© 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
3731,"A prospective, matched comparison of ultra-low and standard-dose computed tomography for assessment of renal colic. OBJECTIVE: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of ultra-low-dose computed tomography (ULDCT) compared with standard-dose CT (SDCT) in the evaluation of patients with clinically suspected renal colic, in addition to secondary features (hydroureteronephrosis, perinephric stranding) and additional pathological entities (renal masses)., PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective, comparative cohort study was conducted amongst patients presenting to the emergency department with signs and symptoms suggestive of renal or ureteric colic. Patients underwent both SDCT and ULDCT. Single-blinded review of the image sets was performed independently by three board-certified radiologists., RESULTS: Among 21 patients, the effective radiation dose was lower for ULDCT [mean (SD) 1.02 (0.16) mSv] than SDCT [mean (SD) 4.97 (2.02) mSv]. Renal and/or ureteric calculi were detected in 57.1% (12/21) of patients. There were no significant differences in calculus detection and size estimation between ULDCT and SDCT. A higher concordance was observed for ureteric calculi (75%) than renal calculi (38%), mostly due to greater detection of calculi of <3 mm by SDCT. Clinically significant calculi (>=3 mm) were detected by ULDCT with high specificity (97.6%) and sensitivity (100%) compared to overall detection (specificity 91.2%, sensitivity 58.8%). ULDCT and SDCT were highly concordant for detection of secondary features, while ULDCT detected less renal cysts of <2 cm. Inter-observer agreement for the ureteric calculi detection was 93.9% for SDCT and 87.8% for ULDCT., CONCLUSION: ULDCT performed similarly to SDCT for calculus detection and size estimation with reduced radiation exposure. Based on this and other studies, ULDCT should be considered as the first-line modality for evaluation of renal colic in routine practice.

2501,"The features of bone metabolism in patients with periodontal diseases. Background The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between bone metabolic disturbances and periodontal diseases Objectives Several studies discuss the relationship between systemic bone mineral density (BMD) and periodontal diseases. Osteoporosis or low systemic BMD should be considered as the risk factor for periodontal disease progression. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of bone metabolism on the periodontal status in the patients. Methods The study included 89 patients (38 men and 51 women, mean age - 43.5+/-5.1 years) with the healthy periodontal status (HPS) and 231 patients (108 men and 123 women, mean age - 45.6+/-5.2 years) with generalized periodontitis (GP). Clinical conditions of periodontal tissue and radiographic determinations (panoramic X-Ray) were evaluated. Skeletal systemic BMD was measured by DXA. Metabolic processes of bone tissue were evaluated by bone turnover markers: bone tissue formation - osteocalcin (OC), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) in serum and bone tissue resorption marker - deoxypiridinoline (DPD) in urine. Results Comparative analysis of structural and functional state of bone tissue in patients showed a mineral density reduction in GP group compared to HPS, but these changes were not statistically significant. Disorders of bone tissue metabolism and dissociation in the processes of bone tissue remodeling were determined in patients with GP. The OC level in the patients with GP (18.89+/-0.87 ng/ml in men and 20.39+/-1.14 ng/ml in women) was statistically significantly (p<0.01) lower compared to the HPS group (24.14+/-1.04 ng/ml in men and 27.56+/-1.12 ng/ml in women). BAP show significant differences between groups. The level of DPD in the GP group (5.78+/-0.79 mmol in men, 8.34+/-0.56 mmol in women) was significantly higher (p<0.01) compared to HPS group (3.57+/-1.12 mmol in men, 4.47+/-0.76 mmol in women).

OBJECTIVES: Atrophic post-acne scarring remains a therapeutically challenging condition despite various currently available technologies. Fractional photothermolysis (FP) is a novel concept of cutaneous resurfacing which induces non-contiguous microscopic thermal injury. The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of FP in the treatment of acne scars in Asian patients., METHODS: A total of 27 Korean patients (Fitzpatrick skin types IV or V) with moderate to severe facial acne scars received three to five sessions of FP treatment (Fraxel Laser; Reliant Technologies, CA, USA), each spaced 3-4 weeks apart. Standardized digital photographs were obtained before each treatment and 3 months after the final treatment. In addition, the patients' perceived degrees of improvement were assessed 3 months after the final treatment using a five-point grading scale., RESULTS: FP led to marked improvement in the appearance of acne scars at 3 months post-treatment. Patients' self-assessed degrees of improvement were as follows: excellent improvement in eight patients (30%), significant improvement in 16 patients (59%), and moderate improvement in three patients (11%).

3516,"Increased susceptibility to ionizing radiation in mice with ST6Gal-1 deficiency. Sporadic reports have associated the degree of N-linked alpha2,6 sialylation, mediated by the sialyltransferase ST6Gal-1, with increased chemo-and radio-resistance of tumor cells, therapeutic failures in colorectal cancers, and protection against Fas-mediated apoptosis. Radiation exposure, whether iatrogenic or accidental, is a significant health concern. ST6Gal-1 has been suggested as a candidate biomarker for exposure to ionizing radiation; both enzyme expression and the level of protein sialylation increase following radiation exposure in a dose dependent manner. Here we report a striking sensitivity of animals with non-functional ST6Gal-1 to ionizing radiation. We attempted to rescue st6gal1-KO and wild-type C57BL/6J mice that were subjected to 12 Gy full body irradiation by bone marrow transplantation with congenic wild-type marrow cells. While the wild-type, st6gal1-normal animals uniformly survived the procedure, st6gal1-KO mice suffered 100% morbidity within 8 days of irradiation. There was comparable homing and retention of donor cells to the marrow of st6gal1-KO and wild-type recipients, and failure of hematopoietic cell engraftment was unlikely as a cause for morbidity. However, st6gal1-KO recipients suffered heavy damage to the gastrointestinal tract resulting in an almost complete loss of absorptive tissue and integrity of the gastrointestinal architecture. This damage was far less severe in the wild-type recipients. Damage to the gastrointestinal tract is an especially frequent and detrimental complication of radiation used in cancer therapy. Our data indicate a critical role for ST6Gal-1 in the maintenance of radioresistance in the gastrointestinal tract.",Included

The paper presents comparative analysis of preoperation MR-angiography and X-ray angiography carried out before renal denervation of sympathetic plexus of renal arteries in patients with resistant arterial hypertension. Purpose. To compare the data of MRA and diagnostic X-ray angiography of the renal arteries to determine a method that allows you to plan in detail the renal denervation procedure. Materials and methods. 44 patients (16 men, 28 women; average age was 59.18 years) with a verified diagnosis: resistant hypertension, admitted to treatment (renal denervation). All patients underwent standard preoperative laboratory and instrumental diagnostics. Survey aortography with selective renal angiography and MR angiography were performed in all 44 (100%) patients. Results and conclusion. It has been shown that both methods are comparable in the detection of renal arteries stenosis, as well as in visualization of the main renal artery and of segment branches of arteries, and in measurement of their diameters. In most cases MR-angiography a little bit exaggerates the diameter of the artery for as low as 0.6-0.8 mm. Also MR-angiography do not deliver radiation exposure to a patient. Moreover, MRA provides the opportunity of sequential thin-slice imaging, and may separate branches of the renal arteries up to segment branches of 3-4 classes with high accuracy. In total, the MRA predicts the anatomic imaging with invasive catheter X-ray angiography and allows to plan it in details before renal sympathetic denervation.Copyright Â© 2019 Russian Electronic Journal of Radiology.

1546,"Evaluating the role of prophylactic gastrostomy tube placement prior to definitive chemoradiotherapy for head and neck cancer. Purpose: To determine the effect of prophylactic gastrostomy tube (GT) placement on acute and long-term outcome for patients treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced head and neck cancer. Methods and Materials: One hundred twenty consecutive patients were treated with chemoradiotherapy for Stage III/IV head and neck cancer to a median dose of 70 Gy (range, 64-74 Gy). The most common primary site was the oropharynx (66 patients). Sixty-seven patients (56%) were treated using intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Seventy patients (58%) received prophylactic GT placement at the discretion of the physician before initiation of chemoradiotherapy. Result(s): Prophylactic GT placement significantly reduced weight loss during radiation therapy from 43 pounds (range, 0 to 76 pounds) to 19 pounds (range, 0 to 51 pounds), which corresponded to a net change of -14% (range, 0% to -30%) and -8% (range, +1% to -22%) from baseline, respectively (p < 0.001). However, the proportion of patients who were GT-dependent at 6- and 12-months after treatment was 41% and 21%, respectively, compared with 8% and 0%, respectively, for those with and without prophylactic GT (p < 0.001). Additionally, prophylactic GT was associated with a significantly higher incidence of late esophageal stricture compared with those who did not have prophylactic GT (30% vs. 6%, p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Although prophylactic GT placement was effective at preventing acute weight loss and the need for intravenous hydration, it was also associated with significantly higher rates of late esophageal toxicity. The benefits of this strategy must be balanced with the risks. Â© 2010 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
4621,"Ultraviolet-B induces ERCC6 repression in lens epithelium cells of age-related nuclear cataract through coordinated DNA hypermethylation and histone deacetylation. Background: Ultraviolet-B (UVB) exposure attributes to the formation of age-related nuclear cataract (ARNC), which is mediated with DNA damage. DNA damage, an important factor for pathogenesis of ARNC, is induced by UVB, and is generally resolved by the nucleotide excision repair (NER) repair mechanism. Cockayne syndrome complementation group B (CSB) protein coded by ERCC6 is a vital component for NER. However, we found no association between selected ERCC6 polymorphisms and ARNC. In this study, we investigated whether UVB exposure could alter ERCC6 expression and the process could involve epigenetic changes of DNA methylation and/or histone acetylation of ERCC6 in the lens epithelial cells (LECs). We also assessed the involvement of those coordinated changes in lens tissue from ARNC patients. Result(s): mRNA and protein expression of ERCC6 in lens tissue (LECs) were lower in ARNCs than those in the controls. This reduction corresponded to methylation of a CpG site at the ERCC6 promoter and histone modifications (methylation and acetylation) nearby this site. UVB-treated human lens epithelium B3 (HLE-B3) and 239T cell presented (1) increased apoptosis, suggesting reduced UV-damage repair, (2) hypermethylation of the CpG site located at position -441 (relative to transcription start site) within the binding region for transcriptional factor Sp1 in the ERCC6 promoter, (3) the enhancement of histone H3K9 deacetylation, (4) induction in DNA methyltransferases 3b (DNMT3b) and histone deacetylase1 (HDAC1) associated to the CpG site of ERCC6 by CHIP assay. Conclusion(s): These findings suggest an orchestrated mechanism triggered by UVB radiation where the concurrent association of specific hypermethylation CpG site, H3K9 deacetylation of ERCC6, and repression of ERCC6 gene expression. Taken together, with the similar changes in the lens tissue from ARNC patients, our data unveiled a possible mechanism of epigenetic modification of DNA repair gene in the pathogenesis of ARNC.Copyright Â© 2016, The Author(s).",Excluded
2594,"The Aftermath of Surviving Acute Radiation Hematopoietic Syndrome and its Mitigation. Intensive research is underway to find new agents that can successfully mitigate the acute effects of radiation exposure. This is primarily in response to potential counterthreats of radiological terrorism and nuclear accidents but there is some hope that they might also be of value for cancer patients treated with radiation therapy. Research into mitigation countermeasures typically employs classic animal models of acute radiation syndromes (ARS) that develop after whole-body irradiation (WBI). While agents are available that successfully mitigate ARS when given after radiation exposure, their success raises questions as to whether they simply delay lethality or unmask potentially lethal radiation pathologies that may appear later in time. Life shortening is a well-known consequence of WBI in humans and experimental animals, but it is not often examined in a mitigation setting and its causes, other than cancer, are not well-defined. This is in large part because delayed effects of acute radiation exposure (DEARE) do not follow the strict time-dose phenomena associated with ARS and present as a diverse range of symptoms and pathologies with low mortality rates that can be evaluated only with the use of large cohorts of subjects, as in this study. Here, we describe chronically increased mortality rates up to 660 days in large numbers of mice given LD70/30 doses of WBI. Systemic myeloid cell activation after WBI persists in some mice and is associated with late immunophenotypic changes and hematopoietic imbalance. Histopathological changes are largely of a chronic inflammatory nature and variable incidence, as are the clinical symptoms, including late diarrhea that correlates temporally with changes in the content of the microbiome. We also describe the acute and long-term consequences of mitigating hematopoietic ARS (H-ARS) lethality after LD70/30 doses of WBI in multiple cohorts of mice treated uniformly with radiation mitigators that have a common 4-nitro-phenylsulfonamide (NPS) pharmacophore. Effective NPS mitigators dramatically decrease ARS mortality. There is slightly increased subacute mortality, but the rate of late mortalities is slowed, allowing some mice to live a normal life span, which is not the case for WBI controls. The study has broad relevance to radiation late effects and their potential mitigation and epitomizes the complex interaction between radiation-damaged tissues and immune homeostasis.Copyright Â© 2019 by Radiation Research Society.

2787,"Stereotactic single-dose radiotherapy (radiosurgery) of early stage nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). BACKGROUND. The clinical results after stereotactic single-dose radiotherapy of nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) stages I and II were evaluated. METHODS. Forty-two patients with biopsy-proven NSCLC received stereotactic radiotherapy. Patients were treated in a stereotactic body frame and breathing motion was reduced by abdominal compression. The single doses used ranged between 19 and 30 Gy/isocenter. RESULTS. After a median follow-up period of 15 months (range, 1.5-72 months) the actuarial overall survival rates and disease-free survival rates were 74.5%, 65.4%, 37.4%, and 70.2%, 49.1%, 49.1% at 12, 24, and 36 months after therapy, respectively. The actuarial local tumor control rates were 89.5%, 67.9%, and 67.9% at 12, 24, and 36 months after therapy, respectively. A significant difference (P = .032) in local tumor control was found for patients receiving 26-30 Gy (n = 32) compared with doses of less than 26 Gy (n = 10). The effect of the tumor volume on local tumor control was also evaluated. Although the difference was not statistically significant (P = .078), the subgroup of tumors with a tumor volume of less than 12 cm3 (n = 10) experienced no tumor recurrence. Thirteen (31%) patients developed metastases during follow-up, whereas isolated regional lymph node recurrence was only encountered in 2 patients. No clinically significant treatment-associated side effects were documented. CONCLUSIONS. Stereotactic single-dose radiotherapy is a safe and effective treatment option for patients with early stage NSCLC not suitable for surgery. Especially for small tumor volumes it seems to be equally effective as hypofractionated radiotherapy, while minimizing the overall treatment time. Â© 2007 American Cancer Society.",Excluded

To evaluate the utility of serum and urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) in depicting an event of contrast material-induced nephropathy (CIN) in patients who received iodinated contrast media, gadoterate meglumine, or radiopharmaceutical technetium-99m ( 99mTc) and to evaluate the protective effect exerted by isotonic saline infusion, sodium bicarbonate administration, or N-acetylcysteine administration. Material(s) and Method(s): Institutional ethics committee approval was given, and informed consent was obtained. One hundred twenty patients were enrolled in a prospective study and divided into three groups: iomeprol group, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging group (gadoterate meglumine), and renal scintigraphy group (99mTc). They randomly received Nacetylcysteine, physiologic saline, or sodium bicarbonate. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, Kaplan- Meier curves, and Cox proportional hazard regression analysis were used. Result(s): In the MR imaging and renal scintigraphy groups, there were significant changes in serum creatinine and NGAL levels, and there were no cases of CIN. In the iomeprol group, an early rise in NGAL was found, while serum creatinine level changes occurred 24 hours after contrast material administration. At ROC analysis, NGAL showed high sensitivity and specificity (serum NGAL: area under the curve, 0.995; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.868, 0.992; urinary NGAL: area under the curve, 0.992; 95% CI: 0.925, 1.000) in identifying CIN 8 hours after iomeprol administration. Regression analysis showed that NGAL independently predicted CIN. Administration of N-acetylcysteine, sodium bicarbonate, or physiologic saline did not influence NGAL level. Conclusion(s): NGAL depicted CIN in patients who received iodinated contrast material within 8 hours of contrast material administration. Â© 2013 RSNA.",Excluded
2101,"Assessment of inflammatory back pain and axial spondyloarthritis in Brazil. Background/Purpose: The concept of inflammatory back pain (IBP) was proposed in association with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), one prototype of Spondyloarthritis (SpA), more than 60 years ago. Spondyloarthritis (SpA) comprises several rheumatic diseases. Although several criteria sets have been developed, the diagnosis of SpA remains challenging. This study aims to evaluate the frequency of inflammatory back pain (IBP) among Brazilian subjects with chronic back pain (CBP), and to describe the results of rheumatologic evaluation based on the axial SpA classification criteria from the Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society (ASAS). Method(s): This was an observational study with retrospective (phase 1) and one-month prospective (phase 2) data collection. Medical records of subjects 18-60 years old, with onset of back pain at age <40 years, and with CBP (pain almost daily >=3 months), were included in phase 1. Subjects with at least one ASAS screening parameter for IBP were contacted by phone, and confirmed IBP cases were invited to phase 2. At phase 2 visit 1, HLA-B27 and C-reactive protein (CRP) were requested. At phase 2 visit 2, the fulfilment of the ASAS classification criteria for axial SpA was verified. Frequency of IBP among subjects with CBP starting before the age of 40 years was estimated. For subjects included in phase 2, the proportions of positive HLA-B27, AS and non-radiographic axial SpA (nrAxSpA) were calculated. Result(s): A total of 363 records of subjects with CBP were reviewed from five sites. Based on medical records and phone contact, 130 subjects had IBP confirmed (35.8%, 95%CI: 30.9-40.7%). From IBP population, only 52 subjects accepted to participate in phase 2. Mean age was 38.8+/-11.43 years, 64% were female, 85% professionally active, and 14% had family history of IBP related conditions. Time since CBP onset was 12.3+/-10.09 years and no subject had a prior diagnosis of SpA. Among the 50 patients that completed visit 2, 14% had positive HLA-B27, 82% had lesions of the sacroiliac joint assessed by MRI, 16% had abnormal clinically significant CRP results, and 10% had grade 3-4 lesions assessed by X-ray. The proportions of AS and nrAxSpA cases were 46% and 26%, respectively by ASAS classification criteria. Conclusion(s): More than one third of the CBP subjects with onset <40 years had IBP by ASAS criteria. Of notice, subjects with a positive HLA-B27 test did not have prior diagnosis of axial SpA. The results in this Brazilian population suggest that patients with IBP may be under diagnosed, delaying their treatment, and that women may seek more for medical care than men. An eventual selection bias cannot be excluded.",Excluded
1107,"Gamma teletherapy of inoperable retroperitoneal tumors with nonuniform distribution of the dosage in the tissues. The clinical material is used to substantiate the advantage of the technic of uneven irradiation of patients with primary locally spread tumors of the retroperitoneal space, in whom all the routinely used methods of treatment proved to be infective. Uneven distribution of the dosage is provided by using a grid diaphragm and conducting gamma-therapy only from one static field during the whole course of irradiation. This pattern of radiotherapy is shown to increase radioresistance of normal tissues and allows 1.5--4 times large focal dose to be applied to tumor compared with gamma-therapy via moving lead strips, thus rendering an enhanced antitumor effect of radiation. These data are confirmed by the results of clinical observations over 30 patients with locally spread inoperable tumors of the retroperitoneal space.",Excluded

3547,"Protein expression of nucleophosmin, annexin A3 and nm23-H1 correlates with human nasopharyngeal carcinoma radioresistance in vivo. Radioresistance is a significant obstacle in the treatment of endemic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The present study aimed to identify proteins associated with radioresistance in NPC in vitro and in vivo. Proteomics analyses were conducted to screen for differentially-expressed proteins (DEPs) in parental CNE-2 cells and CNE-2R cells. Using proteomics approaches, 16 DEPs were identified. Of these DEPs, nucleophosmin (NPM1), annexin A3 and nm23-H1, were verified using western blot analyses. The tumorigenicity was investigated using mouse xenograft tumorigenicity assays, and tumor growth curves were generated. The protein expression of NPM1, annexin A3 and nm23-H1 was examined by immunohistochemically staining tumor tissues. NPM1 and annexin A3 protein levels were downregulated in the CNE-2R cells, whereas nm23-H1 expression was upregulated. In vivo tests showed that compared with the CNE-2 tumors, CNE-2R tumor growth was significantly retarded (P<0.05). CNE-2 tumor progression was inhibited by irradiation, but CNE-2R tumor progression was not, indicating that the CNE-2R cells were also radioresistant in vivo. NPM1 and annexin A3 expression was significantly lower in non-irradiated (NIR)-CNE-2R tumors compared with NIR-CNE-2 tumors (P<0.01). However, Nm23-H1 protein levels were significantly higher (P<0.05). Overall, the present study established comparable radioresistant and radiosensitive tumor models of human NPC, and identified candidate biomarkers that may correlate with radioresistance. The data showed that dysregulation of NPM1, annexin A3 and nm23-H1 expression correlated with the cellular and tumor radioresponse. These proteins are involved in the regulation of intracellular functions, including stress responses, cell proliferation and DNA repair. However, further clinical evaluations are required.Copyright Â© 2016, Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.",Included
844,"Induction of malformations by X-ray exposure of various stages of the oogenesis of mice. We studied the effects of ionizing radiation (X-rays, 0-3 Gy, dose rate 1 Gy/min) on various stages of oogenesis of a mouse strain (HLG/Zte) that had been shown previously to respond with an increased number of malformations after radiation exposure of preimplantation stages. Like the results obtained with preimplantation stages, we observed a statistically significant increase in the number of malformed fetuses (exclusively gastroschises) on day 19 of gestation, when oocytes within 1-4 weeks before ovulation were exposed to 2 or 3 Gy. Less mature oocytes were killed by radiation doses of 0.5 Gy and higher. In addition to the increased frequency of malformations, we found a dose-dependent increase of lethal effects (affecting either oocytes or specific gestational stages) and of runts ('dwarfs').",Excluded
4854,"Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization combined with simultaneous DynaCT-guided radiofrequency ablation in the treatment of solitary large hepatocellular carcinoma. PURPOSE: To introduce the technique and investigate the clinical efficacy of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) in combination with simultaneous DynaCT-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the treatment of solitary large hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) (maximal diameter > 5 cm)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-six patients who received TACE combined with simultaneous DynaCT-guided RFA for solitary large HCCs between January 2012 and August 2016 were reviewed, and the success rate, safety, local tumor progression (LTP), and overall survival (OS) were retrospectively investigated. OS and time to progression were analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier method., RESULTS: Technical success rate was 100%, average operative time for DynaCT-guided RFA was 45.3 +/- 4.8 min, average radiation dose was 730.5 +/- 78.8 mGy, and no life-threatening complications were observed. At 1-month follow-up enhanced MRI, complete remission was achieved in 82.6% of patients (38/46), and partial remission in 17.4% (8/46). The median follow-up period was 29.5 months (interquartile range 4.0-69.0 months). At 1, 2, and 3 years after surgery, the LTP rates were 4.3, 13.1, and 30.4%, respectively, and the OS rates were 89.1, 71.7, and 56.5%, respectively., CONCLUSION: DynaCT-guided TACE + RFA is safe and feasible for the treatment of solitary large HCCS. TACE combined with simultaneous RFA provides a new treatment option for solitary large HCCs in which DynaCT has important clinical value.",Excluded
2574,"Opaque intraocular lens for intractable diplopia: experience and patients' expectations and satisfaction. AIM: To report the authors' experience with the use of opaque intraocular lenses (IOL) in diplopia unresponsive to traditional management strategies, and to assess patients' satisfaction and the visual function of patients following insertion of opaque IOL using the Visual Function Index (VF-14)., SETTINGS: Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK., METHOD: Data were obtained on all patients who underwent insertion of an opaque IOL at our institution between 2002 and 2006. Patients were interviewed by telephone. Any visual function impairment was assessed using the VF-14 questionnaire. Patients were also asked to score subjectively their overall satisfaction with the visual outcome after opaque IOL insertion., RESULTS: The authors studied 12 patients (n = 12) who had insertion of opaque IOL. All patients had constant and persistent diplopia unresponsive to other treatments acceptable to the patient. The median duration of diplopia was 5.5 years (interquartile range was 2.4-17.3 years). The postoperative VF-14 ranged from 75 to 100, and the mean VF-14 was 91 (95% CI 83-99). Three patients reported a maximum score of 100. Patient satisfaction ranged from 2 to 4, and the average was 3.4 out of 4., CONCLUSIONS: Opaque IOL insertion is a valuable option in the management of intractable diplopia. The VF-14 revealed very little or no impairment in visual function following the procedure. All patients reported improvement in their visual function and were pleased with the final outcome.",Excluded
2368,"[Changes in thyroid volume after radioactive iodine therapy in patients with single toxic thyroid nodule]. Radioactive iodine (131I) is a well-established therapeutic modality in the treatment of toxic solitary autonomous thyroid nodules. This method is preferred in patients with small, benign nodules. The aim of our study was to investigate the effects of radioiodine therapy on thyroid size in patients with a solitary toxic thyroid nodule. 22 patients with single nodule in USG and confirmed ""hot"" nodule in scintigraphy were enrolled in the study. Thyroid and nodule volume were determined by ultrasound before, 3 and 6 months after the administration of 131I. Thyroid function was assessed by TSH level prior to the treatment and 6 weeks after the therapy. Thyroid volume and nodule size decreased significantly within 3 and 6 months after 131I treatment. The mean reduction of thyroid volume within 6 month after treatment was 32%. Reduction in thyroid volume and nodule, size was significantly greater within first 3 months than within next 3 months. Patients with smaller nodules (less than 70% of thyroid volume) were characterized by greater reduction of goiter size than patients with nodules bigger or equal to 70% of thyroid volume.",Excluded
4094,"Further validation to support clinical translation of [18F]FTC-146 for imaging sigma-1 receptors. Background: This study aims to further evaluate the specificity and selectivity of [18F]FTC-146 and obtain additional data to support its clinical translation. Method(s): The binding of [19F]FTC-146 to vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) was evaluated using [3H]vesamicol and PC12A123.7 cells in an in vitro binding assay. The uptake and kinetics of [18F]FTC-146 in S1R-knockout mice (S1R-KO) compared to wild-type (WT) littermates was assessed using dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Ex vivo autoradiography and histology were conducted using a separate cohort of S1R-KO/WT mice, and radiation dosimetry was calculated from WT mouse data (extrapolated for human dosing). Toxicity studies in Sprague-Dawley rats were performed with a dose equivalent to 250x the anticipated clinical dose of [19F]FTC-146 mass. Results and discussion: VAChT binding assay results verified that [19F]FTC-146 displays negligible affinity for VAChT (Ki = 450 +/- 80 nM) compared to S1R. PET images demonstrated significantly higher tracer uptake in WT vs. S1R-KO brain (4.57 +/- 1.07 vs. 1.34 +/- 0.4 %ID/g at 20-25 min, n = 4, p < 0.05). In S1R-KO mice, it was shown that rapid brain uptake and clearance 10 min post-injection, which are consistent with previous S1R-blocking studies in mice. Three- to fourfold higher tracer uptake was observed in WT relative to S1R-KO mouse brains by ex vivo autoradiography. S1R staining coincided well with the autoradiographic data in all examined brain regions (r2 = 0.85-0.95). Biodistribution results further demonstrated high [18F]FTC-146 accumulation in WT relative to KO mouse brain and provided quantitative information concerning tracer uptake in S1R-rich organs (e.g., heart, lung, pancreas) for WT mice vs. age-matched S1R-KO mice. The maximum allowed dose per scan in humans as extrapolated from mouse dosimetry was 33.19 mCi (1228.03 MBq). No significant toxicity was observed even at a 250X dose of the maximum carrier mass [19F]FTC-146 expected to be injected for human studies. Conclusion(s): Together, these data indicate that [18F]FTC-146 binds specifically to S1Rs and is a highly promising radiotracer ready for clinical translation to investigate S1R-related diseases.Copyright Â© 2015, Shen et al.",Excluded
