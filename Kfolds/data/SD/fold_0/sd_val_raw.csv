1093,"Assessment of genetic damage in peripheral blood of human volunteers exposed (whole-body) to a 200 muT, 60 Hz magnetic field AIM: To investigate the extent of damage in nucleated cells in peripheral blood of healthy human volunteers exposed to a whole-body 60 Hz, 200 microT magnetic field., MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, 10 male and 10 female healthy human volunteers received a 4 h whole-body exposure to a 200 microT, 60 Hz magnetic field. In addition, five males and five females were treated in a similar fashion, but were exposed to sham conditions. For each subject, a blood sample was obtained prior to the exposure period and aliquots were used as negative- (pre-exposure) and positive- [1.5 Gray (Gy) (60)Cobalt ((60)Co) gamma-irradiation] controls. At the end of the 4 h exposure period, a second blood sample was obtained. The extent of DNA damage was assessed in peripheral human blood leukocytes from all samples using the alkaline comet assay. To detect possible clastogenic effects, the incidence of micronuclei was assessed in phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated lymphocytes using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay., RESULTS: There was no evidence of either increased DNA damage, as indicated by the alkaline comet assay, or increased incidence of micronuclei (MN) in the magnetic field exposed group. However, an in vitro exposure of 1.5 Gy gamma-irradiation caused a significant increase in both DNA damage and MN induction., CONCLUSIONS: This study found no evidence that an acute, whole-body exposure to a 200 microT, 60 Hz magnetic field for 4 hours could cause DNA damage in human blood.",Excluded
1054,"Third-generation iterative reconstruction on a dual-source, high-pitch, low-dose chest CT protocol with tin filter for spectral shaping at 100 kV: a study on a small series of COVID-19 patients OBJECTIVES: To investigate the role of third-generation iterative reconstruction (ADMIRE) in dual-source, high-pitch chest CT protocol with spectral shaping at 100 kVp in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHOD(S): Confirmed COVID-19 inpatients undergoing to unenhanced chest CT were scanned with a dual-energy acquisition (DECT, 90/150Sn kV) and a dual-source, high-pitch acquisition with tin-filtered 100 kVp (LDCT). On the DECT with ADMIRE 3 (DECT3) were evaluated the pulmonary findings and their extension (25-point score). Two radiologists in consensus evaluated with 5-point scales the overall image quality, the anatomical structures, and the elementary findings on LDCT reconstructed with filtered backprojection (LDCT0), with ADMIRE 3 (LDCT3) and 5 (LDCT5), and on DECT3. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the body mass index, the exposure times, and the radiation doses were recorded. RESULT(S): Seventy-five patients (57 M/18F; median age: 63 y.o.) were included, with median pulmonary extension of 13/25 points. The imaging findings were detected in proportion comparable to the available literature. The ADMIRE significantly improved the SNR in LDCT (p<0.00001) with almost no significant differences in overweight patients. The LDCT had median effective dose of 0.39 mSv and acquisition time of 0.71 s with significantly less motion artifacts than DECT (p<0.00001). The DECT3 and LDCT3 provided the best image quality and depiction of pulmonary anatomy and imaging findings, with significant differences among all the series (p<0.00001). CONCLUSION(S): The LDCT with spectral shaping and ADMIRE3 provided acceptable image quality in the evaluation of patients with COVID-19, with significantly reduced radiation dose and motion artifacts.",Excluded
212,"Detection of coronary artery stenoses by low-dose, prospectively ECG-triggered, high-pitch spiral coronary CT angiography Objectives: We sought to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a new prospectively electrocardiogram (ECG)-triggered high-pitch scan mode for coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA), which allows an effective dose of less than 1 mSv. Background(s): Coronary CTA provides increasingly reliable image quality, but the associated radiation exposure can be high. Method(s): Seventy-five patients with suspected coronary artery disease and in sinus rhythm were screened for participation. After exclusion of 25 patients for body weight >100 kg or failure to lower heart rate to <=60 beats/min, 50 patients were studied by prospectively ECG-triggered high-pitch spiral computed tomography (CT). Coronary CTA was performed using a dual-source CT system with 2 x 128 x 0.6-mm collimation, 0.28-s rotation time, a pitch of 3.4, 100-kVp tube voltage, and current of 320 mA. Data acquisition was prospectively triggered at 60% of the R-R interval and completed within 1 cardiac cycle. Diagnostic accuracy for detection of coronary artery stenoses <50% diameter stenosis was determined by comparison to invasive coronary angiography. Per-patient diagnostic performance was the primary form of analysis. Result(s): In all 50 patients (34 males, 59 +/- 12 years of age), imaging was successful. For the detection of 16 patients with at least 1 coronary artery stenosis, CT demonstrated a sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 79% to 100%) and specificity of 82% (95% CI: 65% to 93%). The positive predictive value was 72% (95% CI: 49% to 89%) and the negative predictive value was 100% (95% CI: 87% to 100%). Sensitivity was 100% (95% CI: 88% to 100%) and specificity was 94% (95% CI: 89% to 97%) on a per-vessel basis. Per-segment sensitivity was 92% (95% CI: 80% to 97%), and specificity was 98% (95% CI: 96% to 98%). Mean dose-length product for coronary CTA was 54 +/- 6 mGy . cm, the effective dose was 0.76 +/- 0.08 mSv (0.64 to 0.95 mSv). Conclusion(s): In nonobese patients with a low and stable heart rate, prospectively ECG-triggered high-pitch spiral coronary CTA provides high diagnostic accuracy for the detection of coronary artery stenoses. © 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation.",Excluded
707,"Radiation dose of fluoroscopic vs computer-assisted pedicle screw insertion There is a rapid increase of computer-assisted surgery (CAS) in the spine for insertion of pedicle screws. In contrast to the traditional technique using fluoroscopy, CT is the primary source for surgical navigation systems. Purpose of the study: to compare organ and effective doses of fluoroscopy-controlled versus computer-assisted pedicle screw insertion under the aspect of risk reduction and number needed to treat. Material(s) and Method(s): in 20 consecutive cases of traditional pedicle screw instrumentation under fluoroscopic control the effective doses were recorded in vivo and the organ doses then calculated. Simulating a spiral CT necessary for the 3-D-model for navigation we defined a spiral CT protocol for the instrumented levels and calculated organ and effective doses from Monte Carlo Results from CT examinations. Result(s): Organ doses were clearly higher for the CT model than in any of the fluoroscopic procedures in vivo. The mean effective dose for the CT model was fifteen times higher than the fluoroscopic dose: 7.27 mSv versus 0.48 mSv. Conclusion(s): in experienced hands open pedicle screw insertion in the thoracic and lumbar spine using fluoroscopy-control requires a fifteen times lower radiation dose than do CT scans necessary for computer-assisted surgery. Regarding the published small percentage of neurological complications in traditional screw insertion technique the use of computer-assisted surgery in pedicle screw insertion using CT scan should be limited to carefully chosen indications. The development of navigation systems based on other data sources than CT should be encouraged. © Springer-Verlag 2002.",Excluded
978,"Management of mandibular osteoradionecrosis corresponding to the severity of osteoradionecrosis and the method of radiotherapy PURPOSE: : To demonstrate appropriate treatment methods for mandibular osteoradionecrosis (ORN) by evaluating previous results., METHODS: : The relationship between the time interval after radiation therapy (RT) and the severity of ORN was examined. Eighty-seven patients were classified according to the extent of the lesion (grades), and the cure rates were calculated according to the RT modality, the grade, and the treatment method for ORN., RESULTS: : The later ORN developed and the higher the dose of irradiation, particularly among the patients who received external RT, the more it progressed. The initial cure rates for conservative management, marginal, and segmental mandibulectomy were 39.7%, 50%, and 86.7%, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: : Conservative management should be limited to early-onset ORN after brachytherapy with or without a low dose of external irradiation. Marginal mandibulectomy is appropriate for the late-onset ORN after brachytherapy with or without low-dose external irradiation. Segmental mandibulectomy is required for late-onset ORN after a high dose of external irradiation. Copyright 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 25: 181-186, 2003",Excluded
423,"Prospective and retrospective ECG-gating for CT coronary angiography perform similarly accurate at low heart rates OBJECTIVE: To compare, in patients with suspicion of coronary artery disease (CAD) and low heart rates, image quality, diagnostic performance, and radiation dose values of prospectively and retrospectively electrocardiography (ECG)-gated dual-source computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) for the diagnosis of significant coronary stenoses., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two-hundred consecutive patients with heart rates <=70 bpm were retrospectively enrolled; 100 patients undergoing prospectively ECG-gated CTCA (group 1) and 100 patients undergoing retrospectively-gated CTCA (group 2). Coronary artery segments were assessed for image quality and significant luminal diameter narrowing. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPV), negative predictive values (NPV), and accuracy of both CTCA groups were determined using conventional catheter angiography (CCA) as reference standard. Radiation dose values were calculated., RESULTS: Both groups were comparable regarding gender, body weight, cardiovascular risk profile, severity of CAD, mean heart rate, heart rate variability, and Agatston score (all p>0.05). There was no significant difference in the rate of non-assessable coronary segments between group 1 (1.6%, 24/1404) and group 2 (1.4%, 19/1385; p=0.77); non-diagnostic image quality was significantly (p<0.001) more often attributed to stair step artifacts in group 1. Segment-based sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy were 98%, 98%, 88%, 100%, and 100% among group 1; 96%, 99%, 90%, 100%, and 98% among group 2, respectively. Parameters of diagnostic performance were similar (all p>0.05). Mean effective radiation dose of prospectively ECG-gated CTCA (2.2+/-0.4 mSv) was significantly (p<0.0001) smaller than that of retrospectively ECG-gated CTCA (8.1+/-0.6 mSv)., CONCLUSION: Prospectively ECG-gated CTCA yields similar image quality, performs as accurately as retrospectively ECG-gated CTCA in patients having heart rates <=70 bpm while being associated with a lower mean effective radiation dose.

607,"Defeating Unconscious Bias: The Role of a Structured, Reflective, and Interactive Workshop Background: Unconscious or implicit biases are universal and detrimental to health care and the learning environment but can be corrected. Historical interventions used the Implicit Association Test (IAT), which may have limitations. Objective(s): We determined the efficacy of an implicit bias training without using the IAT. Method(s): From April 2019 to June 2020, a 90-minute educational workshop was attended by students, residents, and faculty. The curriculum included an interactive unconscious biases presentation, videoclips using vignettes to demonstrate workplace impact of unconscious biases with strategies to counter, and reflective group discussions. The evaluation included pre- and postintervention surveys. Participants were shown images of 5 individuals and recorded first impressions regarding trustworthiness and presumed profession to unmask implicit bias. Result(s): Of approximately 273 participants, 181 were given the survey, of which 103 (57%) completed it with significant increases from pre- to postintervention assessments for perception scores (28.87 [SEM 0.585] vs 32.73 [0.576], P < .001) and knowledge scores (5.68 [0.191] vs 7.22 [0.157], P < .001). For a White male physician covered in tattoos, only 2% correctly identified him as a physician, and 60% felt he was untrustworthy. For a smiling Black female astronaut, only 13% correctly identified her as an astronaut. For a brooding White male serial killer, 50% found him trustworthy. Conclusion(s): An interactive unconscious bias workshop, performed without the use of an IAT, was associated with increases in perceptions and knowledge regarding implicit biases. The findings also confirmed inaccurate first impression stereotypical assumptions based on ethnicity, outward appearances, couture, and media influences.",Excluded
984,"Prognostic factors and prevention of radioembolization-induced liver disease UNLABELLED: Radioembolization (RE)-induced liver disease (REILD) has been defined as jaundice and ascites appearing 1 to 2 months after RE in the absence of tumor progression or bile duct occlusion. Our aims were to study the incidence of REILD in a large cohort of patients and the impact of a series of changes introduced in the processes of treatment design, activity calculation, and the routine use of ursodeoxycholic acid and low-dose steroids (modified protocol). Between 2003 and 2011, 260 patients with liver tumors treated by RE were studied (standard protocol: 75, modified protocol: 185). REILD appeared only in patients with cirrhosis or in noncirrhosis patients exposed to systemic chemotherapy prior to RE. Globally, the incidence of REILD was reduced in the modified protocol group from 22.7% to 5.4% and the incidence of severe REILD from 13.3% to 2.2% (P<0.0001). Treatment efficacy was not jeopardized since 3-month disease control rates were virtually identical in both groups (66.7% and 67.2%, P=0.93). Exposure to chemotherapy in the 2-month period following RE and being treated by the standard protocol were independent predictors of REILD among noncirrhosis patients. In cirrhosis, the presence of a small liver (total volume<1.5 L), an abnormal bilirubin (>1.2 mg/dL), and treatment in a selective fashion were independently associated with REILD., CONCLUSION: REILD is an uncommon but relevant complication that appears when liver tissue primed by cirrhosis or prior and subsequent chemotherapy is exposed to the radiation delivered by radioactive microspheres. We designed a comprehensive treatment protocol that reduces the frequency and the severity of REILD. Copyright © 2012 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.",Excluded
801,"Impaired permeability in radiation-induced lung injury detected by technetium-99m-DTPA lung clearance UNLABELLED: This study evaluates the use of the 99mTc-DTPA aerosol lung clearance method to investigate radiation-induced lung changes in eight patients undergoing radiotherapy for lung or breast carcinoma. The sensitivity of the method was compared with chest radiography for detecting radiation-induced changes in the lung, regional alterations within (irradiated region) and outside (shielded region) the treatment ports, effect of irradiated lung volume, and dependence on time after radiotherapy., METHODS: Serial DTPA lung clearance studies were performed before the first radiation treatment (baseline), then weekly during a 5- to 7-wk course, and up to 12 times post-therapy over periods of 56-574 days. The total activity deposited in the lungs for each study was approximately 150 microCi (approximately 5.6 MBq). DTPA clearance, expressed in terms of the biological half-time, t 1/2, was computed from the slopes of the least-squares fit regression lines of the time-activity curves for the first 10 min for irradiated and shielded lung regions., RESULTS: Major findings include: (a) significant and early DTPA t 1/2 changes were observed in all patients during and after radiotherapy; (b) changes in DTPA t 1/2 values were observed in both irradiated and shielded lung regions in all patients suggesting a radiation-induced systemic reaction; (c) changes in DTPA t 1/2 values were correlated (p < 0.05) with the irradiated lung volumes; (d) significantly reduced DTPA t 1/2 values were observed in three patients who subsequently presented with clinical symptoms and/or radiographic changes consistent with radiation pneumonitis (t1/2 felt to 19% +/- 6% of baseline values, compared with 64% +/- 17% in the remaining patients [p < 0.01]); (e) the onset of decreased DTPA t 1/2 values in these three patients occurred 35-84 days before clinical symptoms and/or radiographic changes; and (f) DTPA t 1/2 tended to approach baseline values with time after radiotherapy, suggesting a long-term recovery in lung injury., CONCLUSION: These observations show significant and early alterations in DTPA lung clearance during and after radiotherapy that may provide a sensitive assay to monitor changes in radiation-induced lung injury and may facilitate early therapeutic intervention.",Included
1047,"Thermophysiological consequences of whole body resonant RF exposure (100 MHz) in human volunteers Thermophysiological responses of heat production and heat loss were measured in seven adult volunteers (six males and one female, aged 31-74 years) during 45 min dorsal exposures of the whole body to 100 MHz continuous wave (CW) radio frequency (RF) energy. Three power densities (PD) (average PD = 4, 6, and 8 mW/cm(2); whole body specific absorption rate [SAR] = 0.068 [W/kg]/[mW/cm(2)]) were tested in each of three ambient temperatures (T(a) = 24, 28, and 31 degrees C), as well as in T(a) controls (no RF). A standardized protocol (30 min baseline, 45 min RF or sham exposure, 10 min baseline) was used. Measured responses included esophageal and seven skin temperatures, metabolic heat production, local sweat rate, and local skin blood flow. No changes in metabolic heat production occurred under any test condition. Unlike published results of similar exposures at 450 and 2450 MHz, local skin temperatures, even those on the back that were irradiated directly, changed little or not at all during 100 MHz exposures. The sole exception was the temperature of the ankle skin, which increased by 3-4 degrees C in some subjects at PD = 8 mW/cm(2). During the 45 min RF exposure, esophageal temperature showed modest changes (range = -0.15 to 0.13 degrees C) and never exceeded 37.2 degrees C. Thermoregulation was principally controlled by appropriate increases in evaporative heat loss (sweating) and, to a lesser extent, by changes in skin blood flow. Because of the deep penetration of RF energy at this frequency, effectively bypassing the skin, these changes must have been stimulated by thermal receptors deep in the body rather than those located in the skin.

417,"[Radiation therapy of eyelid carcinomas] Forty patients with histologically verified tumors of the eyelid, partly being pretreated surgically, were irradiated and reexamined. The irradiations were performed with an apparatus for surface therapy using soft rays. The radiation quality was between 55 and 100 kV, the dose between 3000 and 6000 rd. The single doses amounted to 300 or 400 rd. The rate of recurrences after primary irradiation of basaliomas was 5,5%, the rate of recovery 94,5%. The patients who underwent primary operation show a distinctly increased rate of recurrences. The percentage of complications was small, amounting to 8%. Primary irradiation is recommended for the treatment of stages T1 and T2 of eyelid tumors, the percentage of recovery being high and the number of complications small. Advanced stages ought to be treated according to the site and infiltration of the tumor either by the telecaesium apparatus under conditions of semi-deep therapy with use of a lead satellite for protection of the cristalline lens and with following soft-ray therapy, or by primary operation followed by radiation therapy.",Excluded
66,"Occipitocervical fixation in the management of craniocervical instabilities Introduction: The occipitocervical junction presents a unique, complex, biomechanical interface between the cranium and the upper cervical spine. Occipitocervical fixation has undergone significant evolution due to advances in operative techniques and instrumentation techniques. Objective(s): This study was done to evaluate clinical picture, radiographic findings and results of occipitocervical fusion in 10 patients with craniocervical instabilities. Also to compare these results with other results reported in the literature. Method(s): This retrospective study reviewed 10 patients who underwent occipitocervical fixation for craniocervical instabilities between April 2007 and October 2010 in Alexandria hospitals. There were 7 males and 3 females and their ages ranged from 16 to 63. years with mean age of 42.1. years. As regards the clinical presentation, all patients had presented with neck pain before surgery, 8 patients (80%) with myelopathy, and 8 patients (80%) had presented with a neurological deficit either motor or sensory or both. The etiologies of occipitocervical instability in this study were trauma in three patients, rheumatoid arthritis in three patients, tumor in two patients and Down syndrome in two patients. All patients had preoperative craniocervical plain X-ray, CT and MRI examination. All patients underwent occipitocervical fixation surgery with various fixation systems and autologous bone grafts for fusion. Fusion was assessed by plain cervical X-ray films and CT scan, and the neurological outcome by Frankel grade. The mean follow-up period was 14.7. months (range, 4-24. months) including both clinical and radiological examinations. Result(s): There were no operative mortalities or vascular injuries in this series. Two patients showed transient neurological deterioration postoperatively that had resolved within three months. Two cases had superficial wound infection and one case had cerebrospinal fluid leak. The mean operation time was 207. min (range 130-320. min) and the mean volume of blood loss was 354. mL (range 120-750. mL). Neck pain improved in all patients and no new instability developed at adjacent levels. Regarding the Frankel grade, five patients had shown improvement (Three patients improved from Frankel grade C to grade D, one patient from grade A to grade B and one patient from grade D to grade E), while five patients remained stationary at the same grade. At the last follow-up examination period, a solid fusion was achieved in nine patients out of ten (90%). Conclusion(s): Occiptocervical fixation is indicated in the management of craniocervical instabilities resulting from trauma, rheumatoid arthritis, tumors and congenital anomalies of the craniocervical junction. Accurate imaging studies and proper patient selection are the keys to a successful outcome. Occipitocervical fusion procedures can be performed with low morbidity. A comprehensive knowledge of the anatomy of the occipital-cervical junction is imperative. A wide variety of stabilization techniques and instrumentation systems are currently available, each of which has its own advantages and disadvantages. © 2011.",Excluded
336,"Dose escalation via brachytherapy boost for nasopharyngeal carcinoma in the era of intensity-modulated radiation therapy and combined chemotherapy To investigate if dose escalation using intracavitary brachytherapy (ICBT) improves local control for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in the era of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and concurrent chemoradiation treatment (CCRT). We retrospectively analyzed 232 patients with Stage T1-3 N0-3 M0 NPC who underwent definitive IMRT with or without additional ICBT boost between 2002 and 2013. For most of the 124 patients who had ICBT boost, the additional brachytherapy was given as 6 Gy in 2 fractions completed within 1 week after IMRT of 70 Gy. CCRT with or without adjuvant chemotherapy was used for 176 patients, including 88 with and 88 without ICBT boost, respectively. The mean follow-up time was 63.1 months. The 5-year overall survival and local control rates were 81.5% and 91.5%, respectively. ICBT was not associated with local control prediction (P = 0.228). However, in a subgroup analysis, 75 T1 patients with ICBT boost had significantly better local control than the other 71 T1 patients without ICBT boost (98.1% vs 85.9%, P = 0.020), despite having fewer patients who had undergone chemotherapy (60.0% vs 76.1%, P = 0.038). Multivariate analysis showed that both ICBT (P = 0.029) and chemotherapy (P = 0.047) influenced local control for T1 patients. Our study demonstrated that dose escalation with ICBT can improve local control of the primary tumor for NPC patients with T1 disease treated with IMRT, even without chemotherapy.

24,"Assessment of periodontal changes in patients undergoing radiotherapy for head and neck malignancy: A hospital-based study Background: Surgical resection, radio and chemotherapy, either used singly or in combination, are the three most common modalities used in head and neck cancer treatment. These modalities are effective in eradicating the tumor; they also negatively impact the normal head and neck structures surrounding the tumor. Direct damage to the oral structures (soft and hard tissue) frequently occurs from radio and chemotherapy, and indirect damage may also arise from systemic toxicity. Material(s) and Method(s): This prospective study was designed to analyze the effect of radiotherapy on periodontal parameters in oncology patients prior to irradiation in the head and neck area, compared with 6 months following treatment. The statistical analysis was done using SPSS. Result(s): The study sample consisted of total 29 patients of head and neck malignancy (M = 17, F = 12), of mean age 45.66 years. Only 22% of patients had various habits (smoking, tobacco chewing, and alcohol consumption) and majority (27.59% patients) had tongue malignancy. All periodontal parameters-oral hygiene index Siller (OHIS), clinical attachment level (CAL), gingival recession (GR), except probing pocket depth (PPD)-were significantly increased after radiotherapy. When comparison was made between doses and fractions, only in mandible statistically significant difference were observed in GR. Conclusion(s): Although there was no significant change in PPD, there was increased GR, CAL, and plaque index associated with radiotherapy. In this study, 61.5% cases of mandibular teeth and 34.4% cases of maxillary teeth showed attachment loss greater than 0.2 mm. So, all patients with head and neck malignancy should undergo an oral examination before the initiation of cancer therapy with adequate prophylaxis.",Excluded
7,"Time course of pain relief in patients treated with radiotherapy for cancer pain: a prospective study OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this prospective study was to analyze time course of pain relief by radiotherapy for cancer pain., METHODS: A total of 91 patients with painful bone metastases were treated by radiotherapy with a median total dose of 46 Gy. Pain of the irradiated site was assessed using a numerical rating scale (pain score: 0 to 10) once a week from the beginning of radiotherapy (day 1) for about 5 weeks., RESULTS: In time course analysis of the 91 cases, the mean (+/-SD) pain scores at day 5, day 12, day 19, day 26, day 33, and day 40 were 7.8 (+/-1.6), 5.3 (+/-2.5), 3.5 (+/-2.5), 2.4 (+/-2.5), 1.6 (+/-2.1), and 1.1 (+/-1.9), respectively, and mean pain score was significantly reduced with time from the start of radiotherapy (P<0.001: repeated measure ANOVA). Mean pain score was significantly reduced every week by d33 (P<0.05: d5 vs. d12, d12 vs. d19, d19 vs. d26, and d26 vs. d33). Complete pain relief was obtained in 45/91 (49%) cases, and partial (> or =50%) pain relief was obtained in 83/91 (91%) cases. The mean time to obtain 50% pain relief was 13 days. The mean time to obtain complete pain relief (n=45) was 24 days. Doses of analgesics were reduced in 28/64 (44%) cases at the end of radiotherapy., DISCUSSION: Telling approximate time course of pain relief seems to reduce patients' anxiety, and knowing time course of pain relief seems to be useful to determine optimal dose of analgesics that changes according to the course.",Excluded
219,"Electron beam radiation for conjunctival squamous carcinoma PURPOSE: To describe the authors' technique and preliminary results using electron beam radiation as rescue therapy for recalcitrant squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva and cornea.
METHODS: A retrospective review comprised of an interventional case series of patients with pathologically confirmed diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva and cornea, who had failed multiple standard treatments and underwent electron beam radiation therapy. Outcomes, radiation-related complications, and adverse effects were documented. Mortality and local control rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier survival probability method.
RESULTS: Eight patients met the inclusion criteria; of these, 6 (75%) were men and 2 (25%) were women, with ages ranging from 38 to 65 years (mean 50 years). One tumor (12.5%) was classified as T2N0M0, 6 (75%) were classified as T3N0M0, and one (12.5%) was classified as T4N0M0. Follow up from electron beam radiation therapy ranged from 3 to 72 months (mean 30.25 months). The most common side effect was erythema and edema of the eyelids with diffuse transient eyelash loss, seen in all patients. Tumor local control and regression after electron beam radiation therapy were noted in 6 patients (75%); recurrence was noted in 2. There was neither metastatic spread nor tumor-related deaths.
CONCLUSIONS: The authors report a small case series where local tumor control was achieved with electron beam radiation therapy for recalcitrant squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva and cornea. This approach may be considered for patients who fail conventional therapy.",Excluded
328,"Comparison between slope-intercept and slope-only techniques for measuring glomerular filtration rate: use of two independent markers and an independent arbiter PURPOSE: Exclusive use of the half-time of clearance of a filtration marker in the bolus injection, single compartment technique for measuring glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a convenient approach that gives GFR (GFR(SO)) already scaled for extracellular fluid volume (ECV). It has been criticized as less accurate than the conventional, slope-intercept technique (GFR(SI)). The aim of the study was to compare the respective levels of agreement of GFR(SI) and GFR(SO) with GFR based on plasma creatinine (eGFR) used as an independent arbiter., METHODS: GFR was measured with both 51Cr-EDTA and iohexol, simultaneously injected into opposite arms. Plasma obtained bilaterally 20, 40, 60, 120, 180 and 240 min after injection was assayed for marker injected contra-laterally, 51Cr-EDTA by well-counting and iohexol by X-ray fluorescence. ECV and GFR, scaled to body surface area (BSA), were formally measured from six samples and GFR(SI) (scaled to BSA) and GFR(SO) from the last three., RESULTS: Disagreement between GFR(SO) measured with 51Cr-EDTA and eGFR was not significantly higher than the corresponding disagreement between eGFR and GFR(SI). Disagreement between GFR(SO) measured with iohexol and eGFR was significantly higher than between eGFR and GFR(SI). GFR(SI) and GFR(SO) correlated more closely when measured with 51Cr-EDTA than with iohexol. Individual differences between GFR(SI) and GFR(SO) using one marker correlated significantly with ECV measured with the other., CONCLUSIONS: GFR(SO) is critically dependent on the accuracy of half-time measurement and, measured with iohexol, appeared less reliable than GFR(SI). GFR(SI) and GFR(SO) measured with 51Cr-EDTA, however, have similar levels of reliability.",Excluded
311,"The Impact of Hypoxia on Out-of-Field Cell Survival after Exposure to Modulated Radiation Fields Advanced radiotherapy techniques such as intensity modulated radiation therapy achieve highly conformal dose distributions within target tumor volumes through the sequential delivery of multiple spatially and temporally modulated radiation fields and have been shown to influence radiobiological response. The goals of this study were to determine the effect of hypoxia on the cell survival responses of different cell models (H460, DU145, A549, MDA231 and FADU) to modulated fields and to characterize the time dependency of signaling under oxic conditions, following reoxygenation and after prolonged hypoxia. Hypoxia was induced by incubating cells at 95% nitrogen and 5% carbon dioxide for 4 h prior to irradiation. The out-of-field response in MDA231 cells was oxygen dependent and therefore selected for co-culture studies to determine the signaling kinetics at different time intervals after irradiation under oxic and hypoxic conditions. Under both oxic and hypoxic conditions, significant increases in cell survival were observed in-field with significant decreases in survival observed out-of-field (P < 0.05), which were dependent on intercellular communication. The in-field response of MDA231 cells showed no significant time dependency up to 24 h postirradiation, while out-of-field survival decreased significantly during the first 6 h postirradiation (P < 0.05). While in-field responses were oxygen dependent, out-of-field effects were observed to be independent of oxygen, with similar or greater cell killing under hypoxic conditions. This study provides further understanding of intercellular signaling under hypoxic conditions and highlights the need for further refinement of established radiobiological models for future applications in advanced radiotherapies.",Excluded
458,"Assessment of internal exposure doses in Fukushima by a whole body counter within one month after the nuclear power plant accident Information on early internal radiation doses in Fukushima after the nuclear power plant accident on March 11, 2011, is quite limited due to initial organizational difficulties, high background radiation and contamination of radiation measuring devices. In Nagasaki, approximately 1,200 km away from Fukushima, the internal radioactivity in evacuees and short-term visitors to Fukushima has been measured by a whole body counter (WBC) since March 15, 2011. A horizontal bed-type scanning WBC equipped with two NaI(Tl) scintillation detectors was used for 173 people who stayed in the Fukushima prefecture between March 11 and April 10, 2011. The average length of stay was 4.8 days. The internal radioactivity was converted to an estimated amount of intake according to the scenario of acute inhalation, and then the committed effective dose and the thyroid dose were evaluated. 131I, 134Cs and 137Cs were detected in more than 30% of examined individuals. In subjects who stayed in Fukushima from March 12 to March 18, the detection rate was approximately 50% higher for each radionuclide and 44% higher for all three nuclides. The maximum committed effective dose and thyroid equivalent dose were 1 mSv and 20 mSv, respectively. Although the number of subjects and settlements in the study are limited, the results suggest that the internal radiation exposure in Fukushima due to the intake of radioactive materials shortly after the accident will probably not result in any deterministic or stochastic health effects. © 2013 by Radiation Research Society.",Excluded
869,"Application of interstitial brachytherapy via parapharynx involvement transnasal approach to enhance dose in radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Although intracavitary irradiation (ICI) is usually applied to enhance dose in radiotherapy for early stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), its use in parapharyngeal enhancing dose is limited because of dislocation and poor repetition of conventional catheterization. This study was to evaluate the application of a new technique, interstitial brachytherapy via parapharynx involvement transnasal approach, to enhance dose in radiotherapy for NPC. METHOD(S): Twenty-three naive and recurrent NPC patients with tumor residue of more than 1 cm under nasopharyngeal mucosa or restricted tumor residue in the parapharyngeal space received interstitial brachytherapy between Sep. 2005 and Aug. 2006 via parapharynx involvement transnasal approach under the guidance of sinus endoscopy. The 3-dimensional (3D) planning system was used to delineate target volume, optimize dose distribution, and perform interstitial brachytherapy after CT scan. The depths of catheters under mucosa on the moment of inserting and pulling out were measured. The efficacy and complications were assessed. RESULT(S): All catheters were intubated into tumors successfully; the veracity of catheter location was 100%. The submucosa depths of catheters were (9.59+/-2.72) mm when inserted and (9.43+/-2.30) mm when pulled out, without significant difference (t = 0.23,P > 0.05); the shift length was (0.75+/-0.75) mm. The patients were followed up from 3 to 15 months (median, 6 months), and no one dropt out. Three cases of irradiation-associated turbinate adhesion occurred and were cured after lysis; no infection, serious bleeding, palatal perforation, nasopharyngeal necrosis, and other serious complications occurred. All tumors disappeared in 3 months after treatment. No local recurrence and distant metastasis occurred. CONCLUSION(S): The nasopharyngeal and parapharyngeal catheterization with sinus endoscopy guidance is accurate, steady, safe, and feasible. Interstitial brachytherapy is effective for tumor residue in the nasopharynx or parapharyngeal space of NPC patients after radiotherapy without serious complications.",Excluded
81,"The effect of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography on the management of cutaneous malignant melanoma PURPOSE: To assess the effect of positron emission tomography (PET) with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) on the treatment of patients with cutaneous malignant melanoma., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 38 patients with newly diagnosed (n = 25) and recurrent (n = 13) cutaneous melanoma who were referred for evaluation with FDG PET imaging at our institution. We compared the PET findings with computed tomography (CT), which was available in 21 (55%) patients, and tabulated the changes in the diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic management that were prompted by PET during a follow-up period of 10 to 36 months., RESULTS: Compared with PET, the extent of disease was underestimated by CT in 5 (13%) patients. Planned surgical resection of metastases was canceled in two of these patients. In another patient, surveillance PET detected an unsuspected hypermetabolic abdominal mass that was noted on a subsequent CT to arise from the small bowel. The mass was found to be jejunal metastatic melanoma at the time of resection. Overall, PET influenced surgical management in 3 (8%) patients, but it did not affect the wait-and-watch strategy or decision to initiate immunotherapy in the others., CONCLUSIONS: FDG PET contributes important information not provided by CT and has a substantial effect on the clinical management of patients with malignant melanoma.",Excluded
422,"First-in-Man Evaluation of 124I-PGN650: A PET Tracer for Detecting Phosphatidylserine as a Biomarker of the Solid Tumor Microenvironment PURPOSE: PGN650 is a F(ab')2 antibody fragment that targets phosphatidylserine (PS), a marker normally absent that becomes exposed on tumor cells and tumor vasculature in response to oxidative stress and increases in response to therapy. PGN650 was labeled with 124I to create a positron emission tomography (PET) agent as an in vivo biomarker for tumor microenvironment and response to therapy. In this phase 0 study, we evaluated the pharmacokinetics, safety, radiation dosimetry, and tumor targeting of this tracer in a cohort of patients with cancer., METHODS: Eleven patients with known solid tumors received approximately 140 MBq (3.8 mCi) 124I-PGN650 intravenously and underwent positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) approximately 1 hour, 3 hours, and either 24 hours or 48 hours later to establish tracer kinetics for the purpose of calculating radiation dosimetry (from integration of the organ time-activity curves and OLINDA/EXM using the adult male and female models)., RESULTS: Known tumor foci demonstrated mildly increased uptake, with the highest activity at the latest imaging time. There were no unexpected adverse events. The liver was the organ receiving the highest radiation dose (0.77 mGy/MBq); the effective dose was 0.41 mSv/MBq., CONCLUSION: Although 124I-PGN650 is safe for human PET imaging, the tumor targeting with this agent in patients was less than previously observed in animal studies.",Excluded

The histological analysis showed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and intravascular large B-cell lymphoma in 12 and 1 patient, respectively. After initial chemotherapy, 1 patient showed initial complete response, 8 showed partial response and 4 showed progressive disease. Eleven patients had primary CNSL and 2 had secondary CNSL. The median total radiation dose was 40 Gy (range, 30-60 Gy). The median overall survival time from start of salvage RT was 16.3 months. The 1-year overall survival rate was 64%.

297,"Effects of medical diagnostic X-rays delivered at 0.01 or 0.05 mGy on human blood cells Background: Low-dose X-rays are commonly used in medical imaging to help in the diagnosis of diseases. However, the deleterious effects of exposure to medical diagnostic low-dose X-rays remain a highly debated topic. The objective was to study the effects of medical diagnostic X-rays on human blood cells. Material(s) and Method(s): We studied the effects of medical diagnostic low-dose X-rays (80 kVp), i.e.,0.01 or 0.05 mGy, after the in vitro exposure of human red blood cells (RBCs) and peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMCs).Cells with no irradiation served as the control group. The biological endpoints that were used to determine the effects of medical diagnostic low-dose X-rays were hemolysis for RBCs and mitochondrial membrane potential, lysosomes, and the cell cycle for PBMCs. Result(s): Our results showed no changes in the hemolysis of RBCs and mitochondrial membrane potential, lysosome, or cell cycle in cells exposed to these low doses of X-rays when compared to the corresponding nonirradiated cells at all harvest timepoints. Conclusion(s): These results suggested that there were no deleterious effects of diagnostic low-dose X-rays when human RBCs and PBMCs were exposed in vitro.Copyright © 2021, Ibn Sina Trust.

1143,"AN INTERVENTIONAL CARDIOLOGY INVESTIGATION: PATIENT EXPOSURE TO RADIATION AND INTER-OPERATOR VARIABILITY IN AN IRISH SETTING AIM: To evaluate patient radiation exposure for Diagnostic Coronary Angiography (DCA) and Percutaneous Cardiac Intervention (PCI) performed by different operators. METHODS AND RESULTS: Retrospective (n = 160) and prospective (n = 62) data for DCA (n = 179) and PCI (n = 43) examinations performed by interventional cardiologists (n = 3) using the same imaging equipment were reviewed. The operator with consistently low diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) was interviewed for their personal perceptions upon operator training. Retrospective Median [IQR] DAP was 18.8 [11.8-31.6] and 50.7 [35.3-85.6] Gy.cm2 for DCA and PCI, respectively. Prospective Median [IQR] DAP for DCA and PCI was 7.9 [5.2-10.6] and 15.9 [10.0-17.7] Gy.cm2, respectively. DRLs were within Irish and European DRLs; however, significant inter-operator variability (p < .001) was identified.

1168,"Radiation-induced rib fracture after stereotactic body radiotherapy with a total dose of 54-56Gy given in 9-7 fractions for patients with peripheral lung tumor: Impact of maximum dose and fraction size Background: Radiation-induced rib fracture after stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for lung cancer has been recently reported. However, incidence of radiation-induced rib fracture after SBRT using moderate fraction sizes with a long-term follow-up time are not clarified. We examined incidence and risk factors of radiation-induced rib fracture after SBRT using moderate fraction sizes for the patients with peripherally located lung tumor. Method(s): During 2003-2008, 41 patients with 42 lung tumors were treated with SBRT to 54-56Gy in 9-7 fractions. The endpoint in the study was radiation-induced rib fracture detected by CT scan after the treatment. All ribs where the irradiated doses were more than 80% of prescribed dose were selected and contoured to build the dose-volume histograms (DVHs). Comparisons of the several factors obtained from the DVHs and the probabilities of rib fracture calculated by Kaplan-Meier method were performed in the study. Result(s): Median follow-up time was 68months. Among 75 contoured ribs, 23 rib fractures were observed in 34% of the patients during 16-48 months after SBRT, however, no patients complained of chest wall pain. The 4-year probabilities of rib fracture for maximum dose of ribs (Dmax) more than and less than 54Gy were 47.7% and 12.9% (p = 0.0184), and for fraction size of 6, 7 and 8Gy were 19.5%, 31.2% and 55.7% (p = 0.0458), respectively. Other factors, such as D2cc, mean dose of ribs, V10-55, age, sex, and planning target volume were not significantly different. Conclusion(s): The doses and fractionations used in this study resulted in no clinically significant rib fractures for this population, but that higher Dmax and dose per fraction treatments resulted in an increase in asymptomatic grade 1 rib fractures.Copyright © 2015 Aoki et al.; licensee BioMed Central.",Excluded
1076,"NORMAL TISSUE REACTIONS TO CHRONIC RADIATION EXPOSURE IN MAN This paper presents an overview of radiobiological dependences governing the occurrence of tissue (organ) reactions that determine the outcomes of chronic exposure to low-LET ionizing radiation (IR) in humans. The mechanisms involved in the development of tissue reactions (TRs) to long-term exposures to IR and radioadaptation are considered. The overview describes the reactions of the haematopoietic, immune, nervous, reproductive and endocrine systems, lungs, skin and crystalline lens to chronic radiation exposure, which are of fundamental importance in view of radiation protection. It is shown that the individual's physiological tissue (organ) reserve, and also that induced by radiation exposure at low-dose rates are of great significance in the context of TR development.

838,"A randomized comparison of methods of selecting narrowband UV-B starting dose to treat chronic psoriasis Objectives: To compare narrowband UV-B (TL-01 lamp) phototherapy for psoriasis with individual patient starting doses based on minimal erythemal dose (MED) determination vs a standard fixed starting dose and to compare the efficacy of 70% of MED vs 50% of MED starting dose regimens. Design(s): Single-center, randomized, double-blind, clinical trial. Setting(s): Department of Dermatology, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, Dundee, Scotland. Patient(s): A total of 210 adult patients (207 of skin phototypes I to III) referred for narrowband UV-B to treat chronic psoriasis. The study was designed to have 90% power to detect a difference of 3 or more treatments to clearance and/ or minimal residual activity (MRA) between groups. Intervention(s): Narrowband UV-B phototherapy was given according to 3 standard regimens, differing only by starting dose selection method. The randomly allocated starting doses were (1) a fixed starting dose, (2) 70% of individual MED, and (3) 50% of individual MED. All patients were MED tested to ensure blinding and for safety reasons. Main Outcome Measure(s): The number of treatments to clearance and/or MRA of psoriasis was the primary efficacy outcome measure, with changes in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index and Psoriasis Disability Index scores as secondary measures. Adverse effects were recorded. Result(s): There were no significant differences in the number of treatments to clearance and/or MRA across all 3 groups or in the percentages achieving clearance in each group. More uncomfortable erythemas occurred in the 50% of MED starting dose group (39%) than in the 70% of MED starting dose group (24%) or the fixed starting dose group (24%) (P=.07). Conclusion(s): The methods of determining the starting dose in this predominantly skin phototype I and II population, treated 3 times weekly, with a 20% followed by 10% incremental reduction in dose, did not significantly influence the effectiveness of treatment. Had there been a clinically important difference in efficacy, we would have expected to identify this. Thus, basing starting dose on individual MED assessments may not influence the treatment's efficacy in a skin phototype I to III population, although it remains important for patient safety. It remains possible that in populations containing individuals with a broader range of erythemal sensitivity, basing the starting dose on MED testing could have an important impact on treatment effectiveness.

130,"Spatial temperature distribution in human hairy and glabrous skin after infrared CO2 laser radiation CO2 lasers have been used for several decades as an experimental non-touching pain stimulator. The laser energy is absorbed by the water content in the most superficial layers of the skin. The deeper located nociceptors are activated by passive conduction of heat from superficial to deeper skin layers. In the current study, a 2D axial finite element model was developed and validated to describe the spatial temperature distribution in the skin after infrared CO2 laser stimulation. The geometry of the model was based on high resolution ultrasound scans. The simulations were compared to the subjective pain intensity ratings from 16 subjects and to the surface skin temperature distributions measured by an infrared camera. The stimulations were sensed significantly slower and less intense in glabrous skin than they were in hairy skin (MANOVA, p < 0.001). The model simulations of superficial temperature correlated with the measured skin surface temperature (r > 0.90, p < 0.001). Of the 16 subjects tested; eight subjects reported pricking pain in the hairy skin following a stimulus of 0.6 J/cm2 (5 W, 0.12 s, d1/e2 = 11.4 mm) only two reported pain to glabrous skin stimulation using the same stimulus intensity. The temperature at the epidermal-dermal junction (depth 50 mum in hairy and depth 133 mum in glabrous skin) was estimated to 46degreeC for hairy skin stimulation and 39degreeC for glabrous skin stimulation. As compared to previous one dimensional heat distribution models, the current two dimensional model provides new possibilities for detailed studies regarding CO2 laser stimulation intensity, temperature levels and nociceptor activation.",Excluded

344,"Radiation-induced and transposon-induced chromosome damage in Drosophila: translocations and transmission distortion The possible interaction between X-ray- and transposon-induced chromosome damage was monitored in the P-M system of hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. One- to two-day-old F1 dysgenic males originating from a cross between M strain females and P strain males were irradiated with 5.5 Gy (550 rad) or used as controls to monitor X-Y translocations and transmission ratio distortion. Two 3-day sperm broods were sampled for the former and two 4-day broods for the latter to detect damage induced in the most radiosensitive cells. F1 nondysgenic males derived from M female to M male crosses (controls) were treated identically. X-Y chromosome translocations induced by P element mobility alone declined sharply with a decrease in temperature (18 versus 21 degrees C) and they were significantly reduced with aging of hybrid males from brood 2, 4-8 days of age, to brood 3, 7-11 days of age. No significant increase in translocations was observed when X irradiation and P-M dysgenesis were combined, showing no interaction between damages induced by the two mutator systems. In contrast, interaction was observed in transmission ratio distortion which was significantly increased by X irradiation of hybrid males derived from both reciprocal M X P and P x M crosses. The preferential elimination of P element-bearing autosomes occurred when either spermatocytes or spermatids were irradiated. An aging effect was also observed, resulting in less distortion in 9- to 14-day-old dysgenic males compared to 5- to 10-day-old hybrids.",Included
454,"Residential radon exposure and lung cancer--an epidemiological study of Norwegian municipalities The study is based on a collaboration between the Cancer Registry of Norway, the Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority, and National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB, UK). The association between indoor radon exposure and lung cancer was studied in 427 municipalities. NRPB detectors were sent to 10,000 households, and 7,500 of the detectors were returned. Data from a nation-wide survey of smoking habits in 1964-1965 were available. Data on asbestos exposure were also used in a regression analysis. The reporting to the Cancer Registry of all new cases of cancer is fairly complete, as hospital departments and institutes of pathology are obliged to report all cancer cases. The histologically confirmed lung cancer cases were grouped into squamous-cell carcinoma, small-cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma and other or non-specified histological types. The age-adjusted rate of lung cancer by histological type was the dependent variable in the regression analysis. A consistent increase in incidence of lung cancer was seen with increasing tobacco consumption, but no positive trend could be shown with increasing radon exposure in the descriptive presentation of the data. In the regression analysis, however, the incidence of small-cell anaplastic lung tumors in females increased significantly with increasing radon exposure. When based on the regression coefficients, the fraction of lung cancers attributable to radon is about 2-4%.

Biochemical failure-free survival (BFFS), distant metastases-free survival (DMFS), prostate cancer-specific survival (PCSS), and overall survival (OS) were selected as study endpoints. Survival was examined using the log-rank test, Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox regression modelling. Urinary, quality of life (QoL), and potency scores at baseline and last follow-up were recorded., RESULTS: The median follow-up was 12.5 years (range, 10.1-21.8 years). At the time of analysis, 88.6% of patients were alive, 1.5% died from prostate cancer and 13.9% developed biochemical failure, with 82% of failures occurring in the first decade of follow-up. Overall, 2.3% developed distant metastases. On multivariate analyses, stage T3a-T3b, prostate-specific antigen level of >20 ng/mL, intermediate- and high-risk disease predicted worse BFFS; whereas age >70 years at diagnosis and stage T3a-T3b predicted worse OS. A total biologically effective dose of >=150 Gy and androgen-deprivation therapy were associated with improved BFFS, but not OS. The overall 17-year rates for BFFS, DMFS, PCSS, and OS were 79, 97, 97, and 72%, respectively. Respective 17-year BFFS rates for low-, intermediate- and high-risk patients were 86, 80, and 65% (P < 0.001), whereas OS rates for the same groups were 82, 73, and 60%, respectively (P = 0.09). Amongst those patients who were potent at baseline, 25% remained potent at the last follow-up. Urinary function and QoL were mainly unaffected., CONCLUSIONS: LDR-BT yields excellent survival rates, with a 17-year PCSS rate of 97%. In all, 18% of patients with biochemical relapse failed at >10 years after implantation, which justifies their continued follow-up.

428,"Scattering matrix imaging pulse design for real-time respiration and cardiac motion monitoring PURPOSE: The scattering matrix (S-matrix) of a parallel transmit (pTx) coil is sensitive to physiological motion but requires additional monitoring RF pulses to be measured. In this work, we present and evaluate pTx RF pulse designs that simultaneously excite for imaging and measure the S-matrix to generate real-time motion signals without prolonging the image sequence., THEORY AND METHODS: Three pTx waveforms for measuring the S-matrix were identified and superimposed onto the imaging excitation RF pulses: (1) time division multiplexing, (2) frequency division multiplexing, and (3) code division multiplexing. These 3 methods were evaluated in healthy volunteers for scattering sensitivity and image artefacts. The S-matrix and real-time motion signals were calculated on the image calculation environment of the MR scanner. Prospective cardiac triggers were identified in early systole as a high rate of change of the cardiac motion signal. Monitoring accuracy was compared against electrocardiogram or the imaged diaphragm position., RESULTS: All 3 monitoring approaches measure the S-matrix during image excitation with quality correlated to input power. No image artefacts were observed for frequency multiplexing, and low energy artefacts were observed in the other methods. The accuracy of the achieved prospective cardiac gating was 15 +/- 16 ms for breath hold and 24 +/- 17 ms during free breathing. The diaphragm position prediction accuracy was 1.3 +/- 0.9 mm. In all volunteers, good quality cine images were acquired for breath hold scans and dual gated CINEs were demonstrated., CONCLUSION: The S-matrix can be measured during image excitation to generate real-time cardiac and respiratory motion signals for prospective gating.

199,"Dual-time-point 18F-FDG PET/CT in patients with colorectal cancer: clinical value of early delayed scanning OBJECTIVE: In dual-time-point PET/CT, early delayed scanning (D-1) just after the completion of whole body scanning (E) is easy to perform without additional radiation exposure and repositioning. Our aim was to assess the clinical value of D-1 compared with conventional delayed scanning (D-2)., METHODS: Our institutional review board approved this retrospective study. Fifty-four patients with known or suspected colorectal cancer underwent (18)F-FDG PET/CT at our institution. The E scan at 1-h post-injection was followed by D-1 at 85 +/- 7 min post-injection and D-2 at 124 +/- 7 min post-injection. The clinical value of D-1 was evaluated by comparing diagnostic performance with D-2 for differentiating physiologic from pathological uptake and for staging colorectal cancer. Colonoscopic findings, histopathological results and clinical follow-up including radiological findings were used as reference standards., RESULTS: Thirty-two, eight and 73 focal or short segmental FDG foci by physiologic processes in the colon/rectum, the small intestine and the ureter, respectively, noted in the E scan were evaluated in this study. Using D-1 and D-2, 14/32 (44%) and 17/32 (53%) in the colon/rectum, 5/8 (63%) and 8/8 (100%) in the small intestine, and 55/73 (75%) and 69/73 (95%) in the ureter, respectively, were accurately interpreted as physiologic with the change of intensity and/or shape/location. A significant difference between D-1 and D-2 was observed in the ureter, but not in the bowel. The 55 colorectal cancers were finally diagnosed in 52 patients. In the staging of colorectal cancer, there were no significant differences among the three scans in the lesion-based detectability, the patient-based sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for the identification of primary tumors, nodal and hepatic metastases, and dissemination., CONCLUSIONS: Neither D-1 nor D-2 improved staging of colorectal cancer. However, delayed scans yielded information useful for differentiating physiologic uptake from pathological uptake and D-1 may provide comparable efficacy with D-2 in the bowel. Because of the ease of acquisition, the D-1 scan was considered a practical way to reduce false-positives in the abdomen and possibly helpful to avoid unnecessary additional invasive examinations, such as colonoscopy.",Excluded

Collected data included device model, anatomic location, and treatment beam energies, treatment type, and estimated dose to the device. Patients were treated with either high-energy (16-MV) and/or low-energy (6 MV) photon beams with or without electron beams (6-16 MeV). The devices were interrogated with pre- and post-RT and/or weekly with either in-treatment or home interrogation, depending on the patient's dependence on the device and the estimated or measured delivered dose. Outcomes analyzed were inappropriate ICD therapies, device malfunctions, or device-related clinical events., RESULTS: The PMs were exposed to 84.4 +/- 99.7 cGy of radiation, and the ICDs were exposed to 92.1 +/- 72.6 cGy of radiation. Two patients with ICDs experienced a partial reset of the ICD with the loss of historic diagnostic data after receiving 123 and 4 cGy, respectively. No device malfunction or premature battery depletion was observed at 6-month follow-up from RT completion., CONCLUSIONS: CIED malfunction due to indirect RT exposure is uncommon. Regular in-treatment or home interrogation should be done to detect and treat these events and to ensure that diagnostic data are preserved. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

776,"A Randomized Controlled Trial about the Levels of Radiation Exposure Depends on the Use of Collimation C-arm Fluoroscopic-guided Medial Branch Block BACKGROUND: C-arm fluoroscope has been widely used to promote more effective pain management; however, unwanted radiation exposure for operators is inevitable. We prospectively investigated the differences in radiation exposure related to collimation in Medial Branch Block (MBB)., METHODS: This study was a randomized controlled trial of 62 MBBs at L3, 4 and 5. After the patient was laid in the prone position on the operating table, MBB was conducted and only AP projections of the fluoroscope were used. Based on a concealed random number table, MBB was performed with (collimation group) and without (control group) collimation. The data on the patient's age, height, gender, laterality (right/left), radiation absorbed dose (RAD), exposure time, distance from the center of the field to the operator, and effective dose (ED) at the side of the table and at the operator's chest were collected. The brightness of the fluoroscopic image was evaluated with histogram in Photoshop., RESULTS: There were no significant differences in age, height, weight, male to female ratio, laterality, time, distance and brightness of fluoroscopic image. The area of the fluoroscopic image with collimation was 67% of the conventional image. The RAD (29.9 +/- 13.0, P = 0.001) and the ED at the left chest of the operators (0.53 +/- 0.71, P = 0.042) and beside the table (5.69 +/- 4.6, P = 0.025) in collimation group were lower than that of the control group (44.6 +/- 19.0, 0.97 +/- 0.92, and 9.53 +/- 8.16), resepectively., CONCLUSIONS: Collimation reduced radiation exposure and maintained the image quality.

For each patient dose-volume histograms were calculated and the volume values of both kidneys and liver receiving 25 Gy (V25), 30 Gy (V30) and 40 Gy (V40) individually estimated with the M-F and two-field techniques were compared in detail. Result(s): Right kidney median V25, V30 and V40 values for the two-field and M-F techniques were 1.50%, 0%, 0% and 0%, 0% and 0%, respectively (P <0.005, P <0.01, P <0.05). Left kidney median V25, V30 and V40 values for the M-F and two-field technique were 16%, 9.80%, 0.90% and 33.20%, 30.20%, 21.40% (P <0.001, P <0.0005, P <0.0005). Liver median V25, V30 and V40 values for the M-F and two-field techniques were 51.30%, 22.30%, 8.90% and 13.30%, 11.60%, 8.10%, respectively (P <0.0001, P <0.0005 and P = 0.18). Conclusion(s): Our comparison revealed that with the multiple-field technique the right kidney may be largely spared from irradiation; with respect to the two-field technique, the left kidney may receive a significantly reduced dose; however, the liver receives an increased dose that warrants careful long-term monitoring of hepatic function.",Excluded

59,"Preferential damage to IgM production by ultraviolet B in the cells of patients with Bloom's syndrome In most patients with Bloom's syndrome (BS), selective IgM deficiency is commonly found. We examined proliferative responses by incorporation of [3H]-thymidine and the production of immunoglobulin after ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation in the cells of two patients with BS. With regard to the proliferative responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) cultured with pokeweed mitogen (PWM), the patients' PBMC were more sensitive to UVB irradiation than controls. Although the effect of UVB irradiation in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) after 0 days of culture showed no difference between one patient and controls, the patient's LCL were more sensitive to UVB than the controls after 3 and 7 days of culture. These results suggest that the proliferative responses of the patient's LCL recovered later than those of controls. IgM production was the most sensitive to UVB in the patients' PBMC and LCL. IgG and IgA production in the patients' PBMC and LCL showed the same sensitivity as controls. From our results, it is suspected that the preferential damage to IgM production by UVB is connected with the selective IgM deficiency of BS.",Excluded
716,"Diagnostic accuracy of 320-row computed tomography as compared with invasive coronary angiography in unselected, consecutive patients with suspected coronary artery disease Noninvasive coronary angiography with multislice computed tomography (CT) scanners is feasible with high sensitivity and negative predictive value. The radiation exposure associated with this technique, however, is high and concerns in the widespread use of CT have arisen. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of coronary angiography using 320-row CT, which avoids exposure-intensive overscanning and overranging. We prospectively studied 118 unselected consecutive patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) referred for invasive coronary angiography (ICA). All patients had 320-row CT within 1 week of ICA, which, together with quantitative analysis, served as the reference standard. Of the 65 out of 118 patients who were diagnosed as having CAD by ICA, 64 (98 %) were correctly identified at 320-row CT. Noteworthy, 320-row CT correctly detected CAD in 3 patients with atrial fibrillation and ruled out the disease in the other 8 patients. From 151 significant coronary stenoses detected on ICA, 137 (91 %) were correctly identified with 320-row CT. In the per-patient analysis, sensitivity and specificity of 320-row CT were 98 and 91 %, respectively. In the per-vessel analysis, sensitivity and specificity of 320-row CT were 93 and 95 %, respectively. In the per segment analysis, sensitivity and specificity of 320-row CT were 91 and 99 %, respectively. Diameter stenosis determined with the use of CT showed good correlation with ICA (P < 0.001, R = 0.81) without significant underestimation or overestimation (-3.1 +/- 24.4 %; P = 0.08). Comparison of CT with ICA revealed a significantly smaller effective radiation dose (3.1 +/- 2.3 vs. 6.5 +/- 4.2 mSv; P < 0.05) and amount of contrast agent required (99 +/- 51 vs. 65 +/- 42 ml, P < 0.05) for 320 row CT. The present study in an unselected population including patients with atrial fibrillation demonstrates that 320-row CT may significantly reduce the radiation dose and amount of contrast agent required compared with ICA while maintaining a very high diagnostic accuracy. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.",Excluded

To investigate whether it is possible to obtain adequate images at uniform image noise levels and reduced radiation exposure with our automatic tube current modulation (ATCM) technique for 64-detector CT. The study population consisted of 64 patients with known or suspected lung or abdominal disease. We used a 64-detector CT scanner (LightSpeed VCT, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA) and a combined angular and longitudinal tube current modulation technique (Smart mA, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA) to examine 34 patients. The scanning parameters were identical; the minimum and maximum tube current thresholds were 50 and 800 mA, respectively. For study of the constant tube current technique, 30 additional patients were examined at 350 mA. The CT number and image noise (SD of the CT number) were measured in the 64 patients at six levels, i.e., the center of the left ventricle, the liver dome, the porta hepatis, the center of the spleen and the right and left renal pelvis. When we used the ATCM technique, the mean image noise ranged from 8.40 at the center of the left ventricle to 11.31 at the porta hepatis; the mean tube current ranged from 105.9 mAs at the center of the left ventricle to 169.6 mAs at the center of the spleen. The mean dose reduction rate per constant tube current at 175 mAs ranged from 3.1 to 39.5%.

792,"Radiosurgery for lung metastases secondary to renal cell carcinoma Purpose/Objective(s): Hypofractionated Stereotactic Body Radiosurgery (HFSR) is a noninvasive focused beam technique that delivers high-dose radiation. Reviewed were 77 treated kidney cancers metastases in the lungs of 44 patients in this prospective study. Materials/Methods: Seventy-seven renal cell carcinoma (RCC) lung metastases in 44 patients underwent HFSR. All the patients were evaluated prospectively before and after treatment. Age at treatment ranged from 42 to 85 years (mean 65.9) with 11 females and 33 males. Fifty-five percent of patients had prior chemotherapy, 86% had prior surgery to the primary site, and 9% had prior surgery to the lung. Tumor volumes ranged from 0.06 to 3166 cc (mean 119.5). Patients were treated with 400-900 cGy per fraction (median 800) in 3-8 fractions (median 5) for a total dose of 2000-4500 cGy (median 4000). Cancers were radiographically evaluated with contrast CT and/or MRI studies and reviewed independently by radiologists. Control of the treated cancer is defined as cessation of growth, shrinkage, or disappearance of the cancer after treatment. Result(s): Follow up ranged from 1 to 59 months (mean 12) with an overall control rate of 97%. Two of the 77 lung metastases did not respond to radiosurgery. By dose, volume, age, sex, and prior treatment, there was no statistically significant difference in outcome. Conclusion(s): Radiosurgery for metastatic RCC to the lung offers a generally well-tolerated, noninvasive treatment method with a high rate of tumor control. Patients will continue to be evaluated for longer follow-up, possible benefits of metastatic cancer treatment and survival advantage. HFSR remains an option for those whom standard approaches have not produced desired results or in patients seeking an alternative to surgical or chemotherapeutic treatment.",Excluded
52,"Genetic and environmental components of thermal tolerance in the least killifish, Heterandria formosa Populations of the least killifish, Heterandria formosa are found in a wide variety of habitats, including habitats that differ widely in average temperature and in range of seasonal temperatures. To determine whether this ability to exist in thermally different sites is owing to phenotypic plasticity or to population differentiation I raised fish from a spring site and a pond site under common laboratory conditions. Fish were raised at one of two temperatures during gestation and at one of two temperatures from birth to sexual maturity. Gestation temperature, rearing temperature, population of origin, and gender had complex, interacting effects on critical thermal maximum and minimum at sexual maturity, on offspring survival, and on time to maturity. In particular, the populations were strongly differentiated for offspring survival and time to maturity, although the magnitude of the differences depended on the environment. Females performed better than males when genders differed. H. formosa also exhibit superfetation, the presence of embryos in different developmental stages in the ovary at one time. There have been few comparative studies of interspecific variation in superfetation, and there have been no surveys of population variation in reproductive traits within a superfetating species. In this study I followed seasonal changes in reproductive parameters of four populations of H. formosa for all or part of 4 years. The four populations differed in breeding phenology, level of superfetation, total volume of embryos carried, and brood size. This variation does not correspond to either general habitat similarities among the populations (ponds versus rivers), or to habitat stability. I also discovered that first, females must hold back some same-stage embryos while advancing others and second, that size of females, as measured by standard length, clearly influences the total number of embryos, brood size, and number of embryos carried in each stage. Yet despite this relationship between body size and embryo capacity, brood size is not constrained by space available for late-stage embryos. ProQuest Subject Headings: Ecology, Remote sensing.

488,"Variation in position and volume of organs at risk in the small pelvis UNLABELLED: In preparation for studies of dose volume of ionizing radiation and long-term side effects, we assessed both variation in position and volume of organs at risk in the small pelvis., MATERIAL AND METHODS: On 10 men and seven women we delineated the sigmoid, rectum, anal sphincter, bladder, penile bulb, and cavernous bodies in two CT scans taken between five to 69 days apart., RESULTS: The measured overlap of the two delineated volumes divided by the maximum possible overlap, was below 50% for the sigmoid in six of 17 patients, for the distal 4 cm of the sigmoid in five of 17 patients, for the rectum in none of 17 patients, for the anal sphincter in three of 17 patients and for the urinary bladder in none of 17 patients. The smaller volume divided by the larger volume was below 50% in three of 17 patients for the sigmoid, in six of 17 patients for the 4 distal cm of the sigmoid, in two of 17 patients for the rectum, in two of 17 patients for the anal sphincter and in seven of 17 patients for the urinary bladder. For the urinary bladder the largest deviation was found cranially, 4.0 cm (SD 2.0 cm), the caudal part being relatively fixed. For the rectum the largest deviation was found in the anterior wall, 1.8 cm (SD 0.7 cm), with maximum documented variation in cranial direction of 3.2 cm (SD 1.8 cm)., CONCLUSIONS: The sigmoid varies considerably in documented position with the largest deviation anteriorly, the urinary bladder change in volume with the extension mainly located cranially and for the rectum the anterior wall is the most mobile with the distension becoming more pronounced cranially.

62,"Stereotactic drainage and Gamma Knife radiosurgery of cystic brain metastasis Object. Treatment options for patients with brain metastasis include tumor resection, whole-brain radiation therapy, and radiosurgery. A single treatment is not useful in cases of multiple tumors, of which at least 1 is a cystic tumor. The purpose of this study was to assess the role of stereotactic drainage and Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) in the treatment of cystic brain metastasis. Methods. Between January 2001 and November 2005, 680 consecutive patients with brain metastases underwent GKS at our hospital, 30 of whom were included in this study (18 males and 12 females, mean age 60.6 +/- 11 years, range 38-75 years). Inclusion criteria were: 1) no prior whole-brain radiation therapy or resection procedure; 2) a maximum of 4 lesions on preoperative MR imaging; 3) at least 1 cystic lesion; 4) a Karnofsky Performance Scale score >= 70; and 5) histological diagnosis of a malignant tumor. Results. Non-small cell lung carcinoma was the primary cancer in most patients (19 patients [63.3%]). A single metastasis was present in 13 patients (43.3%). There was a total of 81 tumors, 33 of which were cystic. Ten patients (33.3%) were in recursive partitioning analysis Class I, and 20 (66.6%) were in Class II. Before drainage the mean tumor volume was 21.8 ml (range 3.8-68 ml); before GKS the mean tumor volume was 10.1 ml (range 1.2-32 ml). The mean prescription dose to the tumor margin was 19.5 Gy (range 12-25 Gy). Overall median patient survival was 15 months. The 1- and 2-year survival rates were 54.7% (95% confidence interval 45.3-64.1%) and 34.2% (95% confidence interval 23.1-45.3%). Local tumor control was achieved in 91.3% of the patients.

870,"Intraoperative radiotherapy as adjuvant treatment for stage II/III rectal carcinoma In recent years, many efforts have focused on combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy as adjuvants to curative surgery in patients with stage II and III (UICC) rectal carcinomas. Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) makes it possible to increase the total irradiation dose in a locally restricted area while sparing normal mobile organs, but it is limited by increased late toxicity. A prospective phase I/II study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of moderate-dose intraoperative and external beam radiotherapy (IO-EBRT), in some cases with concomitant chemotherapy. Sixty-three patients with a stage II or III rectal carcinoma were eligible for analysis (median follow-up 30.6 months). Fifty-four patients had undergone a complete resection (RO). Mean IORT dose was 11.3 Gy and mean EBRT dose 41.4 Gy. In 45 patients (71.4%) concomitant chemotherapy was delivered (5-FU, leucovorin). Two patients suffered local failure. However, overall local tumor control was markedly improved compared to historical controls (96.8% vs 66.2%). Patients treated with IO-EBRT showed a reduced incidence of distant metastases after concomitant chemotherapy (17.6% vs 38.8%). A 4-year actuarial relapse-free survival of 82% was obtained after IO-EBRT plus chemotherapy, and 59% after IO-EBRT alone. The postoperative course was unremarkable in 47.6% of patients.

768,"Ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction: Cumulative effect of cost, radiation, and turnaround time on the patient and the health care system OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to reiterate the predominance of CT in evaluating ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction in terms of cost-effectiveness, reduction of radiation exposure, and turnaround time as the measurement parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS. This retrospective study included patients 18 years and older with a history of ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion who presented to the emergency department with symptoms of shunt malfunction and underwent shunt series radiography and head CT within 12 hours. Shunt revision occurring contemporaneously with imaging was defined as revision within 48 hours of the original imaging report. The effective radiation dose was calculated by multiplying dose-length product from the scanner with the standard conversion coefficient k (k = 0.0021 mSv/mGy x cm). The turnaround time for patients who underwent both head CT and shunt series radiography was calculated from time of the first study to the time of completion of the last study. RESULTS. There were 16 shunt revisions in 239 patients. The sensitivity of CT was 87.5%; specificity, 91.4%; positive predictive value, 42.4%; and negative predictive value, 99%. The sensitivity of shunt series radiography was 18.7%; specificity, 90.9%; positive predictive value, 13%; and negative predictive value, 93.9%. There were 223 observations of CT radiation dose per patient (mean, 1.87 +/- 0.45). There also were 223 observations of shunt radiography radiation dose per patient (mean, 1.57 +/- 0.60). The median turnaround time among patients undergoing CT and shunt radiography was 109 +/- 84 minutes. CONCLUSION. Shunt series radiography is a low-yield diagnostic imaging modality for identifying shunt malfunction and prolongs turnaround time, increases medical cost, and exposes patients to unnecessary radiation. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded

974,"Long-term outcome and patterns of failure in primary ocular adnexal MALT lymphoma treated with radiotherapy Purpose/Objective(s): MALT lymphomas have generally been believed to follow a relatively indolent course and show a tendency to remain localized within their original environment for a long period of time. Therefore, there has been no consensus regarding the initial management of primary ocular adnexal MALT lymphoma (POAML) so far; radiotherapy has been generally considered the most effective treatment for localized disease. Although results from local control by radiotherapy were satisfying, disease progression occurred in a fraction of the patients. There have been few analyses on its behavior of progression and death that focused on patients with POAML. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term treatment outcome and disease behavior of POAML. Materials/Methods: Seventy-eight patients (42 male and 36 female) diagnosed with POAML between 1991 and 2010 at Kobe University Hospital were included. The median age was 60-years old (range: 22 - 85). The median radiation dose administered was 30.6 Gy. Survival data were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): The median follow-up duration was 65 months. Major tumor sites were conjunctivas in 37 (47%), orbita in 29 (37%), and lacrimal glands in 12 (15%) patients. The 5- and 10-year local control (LC) rates were both 100%, and the 5- and 10-year recurrence- free survival (RFS) rates were 88.5% and 75.9%, respectively. The 5- and 10-year overall survival (OS) rates were 98.1% and 95.3%, respectively. Patients treated with a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy had a trend for a better RFS compared to those treated with radiotherapy alone (p = 0.114). None developed greater than G2 acute morbidity. For late morbidities, retinal disorders occurred in 7 patients (9%), glaucoma in 1 (1%), dry eye in 4 (5%), and cataracts in 37 (47%). Conclusion(s): Radiotherapy for POAML was shown to be highly effective and safe for local control and overall survival based on long-term observation.

The activity values in the liver, spleen, and kidneys were calculated from the 2D WB scans, and also from the 3D SPECT images reconstructed, using quantitative image processing. Absorbed doses after the administration of (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan were calculated from the (111)In WB activity values combined with reference organ masses and also from the SPECT activity values and organ masses as estimated from the patient CT scan. To assess the quantitative accuracy of the WB and SPECT scans, an abdominal phantom was also studied., RESULTS: The differences between organ masses estimated from the patient CT and from the reference MIRD models were between -10% and +98%. Using the phantom, errors in organ and tumor activity estimates were between -86% and 10% for the WB protocol and between -43% and -6% for the SPECT protocol. Patient liver, spleen, and kidney activity values determined from SPECT were systematically less than those from the WB scans.

520,"Cephalometry without complex dedicated postprocessing in an oriented magnetic resonance imaging dataset: a pilot study OBJECTIVES: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables a 3D-volume-imaging without ionizing radiation. Therefore, it was the aim of this study to present a post-processing-free method for cephalometric analysis of a MRI-dataset and to examine whether there is a significant difference between cephalometric analysis of conventional 2D cephalograms and MRI scans. METHOD(S): One MRI scan each was performed on three cadaver heads using a 3T-MR-scanner. Cephalometric analysis was conducted directly on the 3D dataset. All reference points were projected onto a virtual sagittal plane that was perpendicular to the Frankfort horizontal plane. Double-sided points were averaged. Cephalometric angles were measured from the projected points. Results were compared with cephalometric measurements on conventional lateral cephalometric radiographs (LCRs). The cephalometric analysis was performed by five raters. RESULT(S): 390-angle measurements were obtained. The inter-rater reliability was high [intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) >= 0.74 for all angles]. Differences between the measurements on the cephalograms and MRI scans ranged between -0.91degree (-1.88degree, 0.07degree) and 0.97degree (-0.63degree, 2.57degree) on average and were equivalent with respect to a margin of [-2degree, 2degree] in all angles except L1-Me-Tgo (Bonferroni-Holm-corrected P < 0.05 in all angles except L1-Me-Tgo). The best match was found for the SNA angle. CONCLUSION(S): The clinical comparability of the MRI- and LCR-based cephalometry could be stated. Using MRI in orthodontics would reduce radiation exposure and the risk of stochastic radiation damage, which is of importance especially in younger patients.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

51,"Effects of different gamma exposure regimes on reproduction in the earthworm Eisenia fetida (Oligochaeta) Ecological risk assessment of ionising radiation requires knowledge about the responses of individuals and populations to chronic exposures, including situations when exposure levels change over time. The present study investigated processes such as recovery and the adaptive response with respect to reproduction endpoints in the earthworm Eisenia fetida exposed to (60)Co gamma-radiation. Furthermore, a crossed experiment was performed to investigate the influence of F0 parental and F1 embryonic irradiation history on the response of irradiated or non-irradiated F1 offspring. Recovery: The sterility induced by sub-chronic exposure at 17 m Gy/h (accumulated dose: 25 Gy) was temporary, and 8 weeks after irradiation the worms had regained their reproductive capacity (number of viable offspring produced per adult per week). Adaptive response: Adult worms were continuously exposed at a low priming dose rate of 0.14 mGy/h for 12 weeks (accumulated dose: 0.24 Gy), followed by 14 weeks exposure at a challenge dose rate of 11 mGy/h. The results suggest a lack of adaptive response, since there were no significant differences in the effects on reproduction capacity between the primed and the unprimed groups after challenge doses ranging from 7.6 to 27 Gy. Crossed experiment: The effects of exposure at 11 mGy/h for 21 weeks on growth, sexual maturation and reproduction of offspring, derived either from parent worms and cocoons both exposed at 11 mGy/h, or from non-irradiated parents and cocoons (total accumulated dose 44 and 38 Gy, respectively) were compared. There were no significant differences between the two exposed offspring groups for any of the endpoints. The reproduction capacity was very low for both groups compared to the controls, but the reproduction seemed to be maintained at the reduced level, which could indicate acclimatisation or stabilisation. Finally, parental and embryonic exposures at 11 mGy/h did not affect reproduction in the F1 offspring as adults. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Materials: The medical charts of 17 patients with paranasal or nasal cavity malignancies treated by robotic radiosurgery (RRS)+/- external beam radiotherapy were assessed in this retrospective study. Robotic radiosurgery was given with CyberKnife (Accuray Inc., Sunnyvale, CAl. There were 9 male and 8 female patients. Primary site was maxillary sinus in 6 patients, ethmoid sinus in 5 patients, nasal cavity in 3 patients and sphenoid sinus in 1 patient. Histopatholigal diagnosis was mostly squamous cell cancer (7 cases), as other pathologies were soft tissue sarcoma (4 cases), malignant melanoma (3 cases), adenocarcinoma (1 case), and adenoid cystic carcinoma (2 cases). RRS was given as re-Irradiation in 4 patients with recurrent disease, whereas it was primary treatment modality in 13 patients (RRS alone in 7 cases with 28.5-37.5 Gy in 3-5 fractions, and boost dose after EBRT in 6 cases with 1535 Gy in 35 fractions). The median prescription isodose was 81% (range, 75-85%). Seven patients received chemotherapy either prior to RRS (3 patients), or concurrent with EBRT (3 patients), or adjuvant (1 patient). Two cases with T4 tumors received elective neck EBRT. Result(s): Median follow-up time was 21 months (7-32 months). Complete response, partial response and stabile response was obtained in 7, 3 and 2 patients respectively. Overall response rate was 59% (Complete and partial response). Progression at primary site was observed in 3 cases, as one of them died of disease and two of them died of distant metastasis. RRS was generally well tolerated. There were no grade III-IV acute RTOG toxicity. Osteoradionecrosis was detected in 2 patients (one case receiving re-irradiat ion, other case receiving 30 Gy RRS alone in 3 fractions). Those 2 patients had also serious ipsilate ral facial pain requiring narcotic analgesics, and they also received hyperbaric oxygen therapy and antibiotic therapy with no need of surgical debridement. No visual acuity loss was observed during follow-up. Minor bleeding, which was spontaneously stopped, was seen in one patient.

In Group A, cisplatin (CDDP) (50 mg/m2) was given by intravenous infusion on days 1 and 15, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (300 mg/m2) was given daily by continuous intravenous infusion for 5 weeks. In Group B, in addition to the same chemotherapeutic regimen of Group A, 50 Gy of radiotherapy was given to the mediastinum over 5 weeks. The immunohistochemical staining of tumoral p53 and microvessel density was undertaken to correlate to the radio/chemosensitivity. Result(s): There were no significant differences in the clinicopathologic characteristics between the two groups. The median dose of 5-FU and CDDP administered were not significantly different between the two groups. The mean (SD) dose of radiotherapy in Group B was 42 + 10 Gy. The 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates in Group A were 100, 63 and 38% and those in Group B were 80, 58 and 50%, respectively (P = 0.97). In each group, four patients succumbed to locoregional recurrences. Tumoral p53 was immunohistochemically negative in 43% in Group A and 77% in Group B (P = 0.03), indicating that many patients in Group B might be potentially sensitive to radiochemotherapy. The 3- and 5-year survival rates (75 and 64%) of patients with p53 negative expression (n = 18) were significantly (P = 0.03) better than those with p53 positive expression {n = 27, 44 and 26%). The long-term survival was better for patients with p53 negative tumours than those with p53 positive tumours in Group B (P = 0.06 by long-rank test, P < 0.05 by Generalized-Wilcoxon test). However, the long-term survival was not different between the patients who had p53 negative and positive tumours in Group A (P = 0.19). These data suggest that there were no survival advantage for patients receiving radiotherapy in Group B, instead p53 negative tumours appeared to have a favorable prognosis. Conclusion(s): Postoperative radiotherapy administered concurrently with chemotherapy does not provide a survival benefit compared with chemotherapy alone. Tumoral p53 expression has a predictive value for survival in patients treated with postoperative radio/chemotherapy. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
951,"Clinical trial of post-chemotherapy consolidation thoracic radiotherapy for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer Background and purpose: To define the rate of development of symptomatic chest failures in extensive stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) after undergoing post-chemotherapy chest radiotherapy (RT). Material(s) and Method(s): Patients had ES-SCLC, attained an objective response to chemotherapy and signed study consent. Target accrual was 33 patients. Patients were offered prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) as per department policy. PCI (25 Gy/10 fractions) and chest RT (40 Gy/15 fractions) were given simultaneously 4-8 weeks after chemotherapy completion. Thoracic target volume was the post-chemotherapy residual chest disease plus margin. Patients were evaluated for RT toxicities, local control, disease-free and overall survival. Result(s): Thirty-two patients were evaluable. Twenty-nine patients completed RT without delay. There were 4 complete responses and 28 partial responses to chemotherapy. All study patients received PCI. Maximal acute RT toxicity was grade 2 esophagitis (18 patients). There were no RT-related deaths. Median time to disease progression and overall survival were 4.2 and 8.3 months, respectively (median follow-up = 21.8 months). Of 16 chest recurrences, 7 were in the irradiated region and 5 were symptomatic. Conclusion(s): Post-chemotherapy consolidation chest RT for ES-SCLC patients on this trial was well tolerated and associated with symptomatic chest recurrences in only 5/32 treated patients. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

These are: (i) relatively high radiation dose to patients, (ii) the long time required for completion of the scan. To solve these problems, 123I-labeled 6 beta-iodomethyl-19-norcholesterol (NCL-6-123I) was synthesized and was used for adrenal scintigraphy in 6 cases. Successful images were obtained with 185 MBq (5 mCi)-260 MBq (7 mCi) of NCL-6-123I, and optimal time required for the satisfactory scan was 2-3 days after the administration. The estimate radiation dose was reduced by using 185 MBq (5 mCi) of NCL-6-123I instead of 18.5 MBq (0.5 mCi) of NCL-6-131I. From the result of this clinical study, NCL-6-123I was preferred for the adrenal scintigraphy.",Excluded
1117,"Effectiveness of Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography as a Guide for Palliative Radiation Therapy for Spinal Metastases Objective: As back pain is the presenting symptom in 95% of patients with epidural spinal metastases, appropriately identifying and treating the most symptomatic levels can provide significant palliation. The purpose of this study was to analyze the ability of combined positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) to identify spinal metastases with high metabolic activity and guide radiotherapy. We sought to correlate improvement in back pain with reduction in standard uptake value (SUV) after treatment. Method(s): Retrospective review was performed of 72 patients with spinal metastases treated with stereotactic ablative radiation therapy at a single center between 2002 and 2014. PET/CT was used to calculate SUVs for spinal metastases, and treatment planning was based on PET/CT results. Preoperative and postoperative pain levels were assessed in all patients. Result(s): Reduction in pain scores was found in 78% of treated patients. A significant reduction in pain was identified in patients with >5 metastases compared with fewer lesions (P < 0.05). Degree of change in SUV did not correlate significantly with pain relief. However, comparing pretreatment and posttreatment PET/CT, patients with improved pain consistently displayed decreased SUV. Conclusion(s): PET/CT was shown to be a useful adjunct in radiation treatment planning with change in SUV correlating with symptomatic improvement. This study paves the way for future prospective studies to further assess utility and cost-effectiveness of this imaging modality in radiation treatment planning for spinal metastases.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1141,"Irradiated laboratory animal diets: dominant lethal studies in the mouse In 4 separate dominant lethal experiments groups of mice of either Charles River CD1 or Alderley Park strains were fed laboratory diets (Oakes, 41B, PRD, BP nutrition rat and mouse maintenance diet No. 1). The diets were either untreated (negative control diets) or irradiated at 1, 2.5 and 5 megarad and were freshly irradiated, or stored. The animals were fed their test diets for a period of 3 weeks prior to mating. Groups of mice given a single intraperitoneal injection of 200 mg cyclophosphamide per kg body weight served as the positive controls. Freshly irradiated PRD diet fed to male mice of both strains caused an increase in early deaths in females mated to the males in week 7 and to a lesser extent in week 4. The increase due to irradiation was small by comparison with that produced by the positive control compound. The responses for the other irradiated diets showed no significant increases in early deaths although some values for Oakes diet were high. The effect of storage was examined with PRD and BPN diet on one occasion and produced conflicting results. Thus there was some evidence that irradiated PRD diet has weak mutagenic activity in the meiotic and/or pre-meiotic phase of the spermatogenic cycle which appeared to be lessened on storage; the inclusion of such a diet in toxicological studies would therefore need to be carefully considered.",Excluded
711,"Detectability of radiation-induced changes in magnetic resonance biomarkers following stereotactic radiosurgery: A pilot study Our objective was to investigate direct voxel-wise relationship between dose and early MR biomarker changes both within and in the high-dose region surrounding brain metastases following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Specifically, we examined the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) from diffusion-weighted imaging and the contrast transfer coefficient (Ktrans) and volume of extracellular extravascular space (ve) derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI data. We investigated 29 brain metastases in 18 patients using 3 T MRI to collect imaging data at day 0, day 3 and day 20 following SRS. The ADC maps were generated by the scanner and Ktrans and ve maps were generated using in-house software for dynamic tracer-kinetic analysis. To enable spatially-correlated voxel-wise analysis, we developed a registration pipeline to register all ADC, Ktrans and ve maps to the planning MRI scan. To interrogate longitudinal changes, we computed absolute DELTAADC, DELTAKtrans and DELTAve for day 3 and 20 post-SRS relative to day 0. We performed a Kruskall-Wallice test on each biomarker between time points and investigated dose correlations within the gross tumour volume (GTV) and surrounding high dose region > 12 Gy via Spearman's rho. Only ve exhibited significant differences between day 0 and 20 (p < 0.005) and day 3 and 20 (p < 0.05) within the GTV following SRS. Strongest dose correlations were observed for ADC within the GTV (rho = 0.17 to 0.20) and weak correlations were observed for ADC and Ktrans in the surrounding > 12 Gy region. Both DELTAKtrans and DELTAve showed a trend with dose at day 20 within the GTV and > 12 Gy region (rho = -0.04 to -0.16). Weak dose-related decreases in Ktrans and ve within the GTV and high dose region at day 20 most likely reflect underlying vascular responses to radiation. Our study also provides a voxel-wise analysis schema for future MR biomarker studies with the goal of elucidating surrogates for radionecrosis.",Excluded

Cytological examinations of these cases with regard to the vaginal epithelium had the following results: Group I:6 times; group II: 37 times; group IIW:8 times; group IIId: once; group IVa:twice. The cytological tests were carried out according to the method of papanicolaou as modified by Soost. Furthermore, we could state the following degrees of purity: Degree I: 8 times; degree II:16 times; degree III: 30 times. The cytological examinations of the urethral epithelium demonstrated, in 52 cases, an increased appearance of nude"" completely exposed epithelial cell nuclei--a fact corresponding to a degenerative autolysis (according to Wied). In the 26 women with missing atypical germ flora within the region of the exterior genitals, exclusively groups I (according to Papanicolaou and Soost) and degrees of purity I were stated. These persons also demonstrated remarkably grave psychical disturbances, especially in the intimate regions. In the cases of positive microbiological evidence, the following measures have proved satisfactory: Vaginal hygienization combined with a directly aimed antibacterial therapy, and the prescription of preparations containing lactic acid. A transitory discontinuation of contraceptives is being discussed. Our examination results are emphasizing the necessity of an analysis of the germ flora in cases of complaints arising from urethritis. Also psychical disturbances must be taken into consideration in cases of missing urological and gynaecological criteria of evidence.""",Excluded
304,"Comparison between percutaneous and traditional fixation of lumbar spine fracture: Intraoperative radiation exposure levels and outcomes Objective: To compare radiation exposure doses and clinical and radiological outcomes between percutaneous pedicular screwing (closed reduction internal fixation [CRIF]) and classical open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) in lumbar spine fracture without neurologic deficit. Material(s) and Method(s): Sixty patients (mean age, 42.5. years) were divided into two treatment groups: (Percutaneous) CRIF versus (traditional) ORIF. Screw position and anatomic vertebral reconstruction were checked on routine control X-ray and postoperative CT scan. Study parameters comprised: surgery time, radiation exposure time, radiation dose level for X-ray (DAP) and for CT (DLP),blood loss, length of hospital stay and postoperative pain (VAS). Result(s): At a mean 25.5. months' follow-up, there were no significant inter-group differences on the epidemiological parameters: age, gender, fracture level, fracture type on the Magerl classification, preoperative local vertebral kyphosis angle, or fracture-to-surgery interval. Effective radiation dose was 3-fold higher in CRIF than in ORIF, but 6-fold lower than for the postoperative CT scan. Postoperative pain on VAS was significantly lower after CRIF, allowing earlier gait resumption and return to work and daily activity. There were no significant differences in length of hospital stay, patient satisfaction, screw malpositioning or postoperative or end-of-follow-up kyphosis angle. Conclusion(s): Percutaneous surgery provided clinical and radiological outcomes strictly comparable to those of open surgery, but with a higher effective radiation exposure dose, including for the medical team and especially for the surgeon. This higher exposure dose, however, is to be relativized by comparison to that of the postoperative CT scan, which involved a much higher exposure dose for the patient. Level of Evidence: Level IV.

905,"Weight Loss After RYGB Is Associated with an Increase in Serum Vitamin D in a Population with Low Prevalence of Hypovitaminosis D at Low Latitude PURPOSE: In Brazil and worldwide, few studies have investigated vitamin D deficiency in patients with severe obesity who underwent bariatric surgery associated with latitude and level of solar radiation. The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and the predictive factors of serum level changes after 12 months of RYGB in a low latitude region., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 50 patients from a low-latitude city (10degree 10' 8 S) in the north of Brazil. We collected data before surgery and after 3 and 12 months of surgery. The level of vitamin D was classified as deficiency (< 20 ng/ml), insufficiency (20-30 ng/ml), and sufficiency (>= 30 ng/ml)., RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 38.7 +/- 8.9 years, 69% were women, and percent excess weight loss (% EWL) was 83% after 1 year of surgery. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in the preoperative period was 14%, and after 3 and 12 months of surgery, it decreased to 4% and 6%, respectively. The variation in vitamin D after 12 months of surgery was positively associated with changes in BMI, body fat, and % EWL., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is low in patients undergoing bariatric surgery in the northern region of Brazil, which is possibly related to low latitude.

411,"Parkinson's disease: a test of the multifactorial etiologic hypothesis We studied the relative etiologic importance upon the development of Parkinson's disease (PD) of occupational exposure to herbicides and other compounds, ionizing radiation exposure, family history of PD and essential tremor, smoking, and history of various viral and other medical conditions. We identified patients (n = 130) with neurologist-confirmed idiopathic PD through contacts with Calgary general hospitals, long-term care facilities, neurologists, the Movement Disorder Clinic, and the Parkinson's Society of Southern Alberta, and selected two matched (by sex and age +/- 2.5 years) community controls for each case by random digit dialing. We obtained lifetime work, chemical, radiation, medical, and smoking exposure histories and family histories of PD and essential tremor by personal interviews, and analyzed the data using conditional logistic regression for matched sets. After controlling for potential confounding and interaction between the exposure variables, using multivariate statistical methods, having a family history of PD was the strongest predictor of PD risk, followed by head trauma and then occupational herbicide use. Cases and controls did not differ in their previous exposures to smoking or ionizing radiation; family history of essential tremor; work-related contact with aluminum, carbon monoxide, cyanide, manganese, mercury, or mineral oils; or history of arteriosclerosis, chicken pox, encephalitis, hypertension, hypotension, measles, mumps, rubella, or Spanish flu. These results support the hypothesis of a multifactorial etiology for PD, probably involving genetic, environmental, trauma, and possibly other factors.",Excluded
462,"Subclinical carotid atherosclerosis and early vascular aging from long-term low-dose ionizing radiation exposure: a genetic, telomere, and vascular ultrasound study in cardiac catheterization laboratory staff OBJECTIVES: This study sought to assess the association between long-term radiation exposure in the catheterization laboratory (cath lab) and early signs of subclinical atherosclerosis. BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence of an excess risk of cardiovascular disease at low-dose levels of ionizing radiation exposure. METHODS: Left and right carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) was measured in 223 cath lab personnel (141 male; age, 45 +/- 8 years) and 222 unexposed subjects (113 male; age, 44+/-10 years). Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) was evaluated by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The DNA repair gene XRCC3 Thr241Met polymorphism was also analyzed to explore the possible interaction with radiation exposure. The occupational radiological risk score (ORRS) was computed for each subject on the basis of the length of employment, individual caseload, and proximity to the radiation source. A complete lifetime effective dose (mSv) was recorded for 57 workers. RESULTS: Left, right, and averaged CIMTs were significantly increased in high-exposure workers compared with both control subjects and low-exposure workers (all p values<0.04). On the left side, but not on the right, there was a significant correlation between CIMT and ORRS (p=0.001) as well as lifetime dose (p=0.006). LTL was significantly reduced in exposed workers compared with control subjects (p=0.008). There was a significant correlation between LTL and both ORRS (p=0.002) and lifetime dose (p=0.03). The XRCC3 Met241 allele presented a significant interaction with high exposure for right side (pinteraction=0.002), left side (pinteraction<0.0001), and averaged (pinteraction<0.0001) CIMTs. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term radiation exposure in a cath lab may be associated with increased subclinical CIMT and telomere length shortening, suggesting evidence of accelerated vascular aging and early atherosclerosis.",Included

No difference in survival was identified between the two arms. This secondary analysis was performed to examine the relationship between patient age and outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred forty-six patients were randomized to receive etoposide plus cisplatin and either RT qd or split-course RT bid. This retrospective study compared the outcomes of patients aged >/=70 years (elderly patients"") with those of younger individuals. Of the 244 assessable patients, 63 (26%) were elderly, and 181 (74%) were younger individuals. RESULT(S): The 2-year and 5-year survival rates were 39% and 18%, respectively, in patients younger than 70 years, compared with 36% and 13%, respectively, in elderly patients (P =.4). Grade 4+ toxicity occurred in 62% of patients younger than 70 years compared with 81% of elderly patients (P =.007). Grade 4+ hematologic toxicity occurred in 56% of patients younger than 70 years, compared with 78% of elderly patients (P =.003). Grade 4+ pneumonitis occurred in 1% of those younger than 70 years, compared with 6% of elderly patients (P =.02). CONCLUSION(S): Toxicity, especially myelosuppression and pneumonitis, was more pronounced in the elderly patients receiving combined-modality therapy for locally advanced NSCLC. Despite increased toxicity, elderly patients have survival rates equivalent to younger individuals. Therefore, fit, elderly patients with locally advanced NSCLC should be encouraged to receive combined-modality therapy, preferably on clinical trials with cautious, judicious monitoring. Future studies should explore ways to decrease toxicity of therapy in elderly patients.""",Excluded

The ability to comfortably secure the applicator over the upper torso relative to the CW target throughout treatment is assessed on volunteers. Male and postmastectomy female volunteers were enrolled to evaluate applicator secure fit to CW. Female subjects with intact breast were also enrolled to assess the ability to treat challenging cases. Magnetic resonance (MR) images of volunteers wearing a TBSA over the upper torso were acquired once every 15 minutes for 90 minutes. Applicator displacement over this time period required for treatment preplanning and delivery was assessed using MR visible markers. Applicator comfort and tolerability were assessed using a questionnaire. Probability estimates of applicator displacements were used to investigate dosimetric impact for the worst-case variation in radiation source-to-skin distance for 5 and 10 mm deep targets spread 17 x 13 cm on a torso phantom. Average and median displacements along lateral and radial directions were less than 1.2 mm over 90 minutes for all volunteers. Maximum lateral and radial displacements were measured to be less than 1 and 1.5 mm, respectively, for all CW volunteers and less than 2 mm for intact breast volunteers, excluding outliers. No complaint of pain or discomfort was reported. Phantom treatment planning for the maximum displacement of 2 mm indicated < 10% increase in skin dose with < 5% loss of homogeneity index (HI) for -2 mm uniform HDR source displacement. For +2 mm uniform displacement, skin dose decreased and HI increased by 20%. The volunteer study demonstrated that such large and uniform displacements should be rare for CW subjects, and the measured variation is expected to be low for multifraction conformal brachytherapy treatment.",Excluded

Alternative IMRT and SFUD plans were constructed. The IMRT plans were created using a setup with beams incident from 5 to 6 different angles. For the SFUD plans, a field-specific planning target volume (PTV) was created for each patient and a clinical target volume (CTV)-based robust optimization was performed. A robustness evaluation was performed for the CTV for all SFUD plans. A dosimetric evaluation was conducted for the doses to the CTV and organs at risk (OARs) for all plans. The normal tissue complication probability (NTCP), for different endpoints, was calculated using the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman (LKB)-model and compared between plans., RESULTS: SFUD was associated with significantly lower mean doses to the oesophagus, the heart, the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), lungs and breasts compared to 3D-CRT and IMRT. The maximum dose given to the spinal cord was significantly lower with SFUD. The risks for pneumonitis, esophagitis and myelopathy were significantly reduced in the SFUD plans., CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed dosimetric advantages of using scanned-beam PBT for the treatment of thymic tumours, as compared to 3D-CRT and IMRT, especially in regard to lower doses to the oesophagus and lungs.

1041,"Effect of gamma radiation on the biology of the flesh fly, Parasarcophaga argyrostoma. I. Following larval exposure One and seven days old larvae of the flesh fly, Parasarcophaga argyrostoma were exposed to doses ranging from 1-90 Gy. Lower doses ranging from 1-9 Gy applied to young larvae accelerate larval development whereas old larvae responded to doses from 10-90 Gy by a remarkable retardation of the larval and pupal development. Reduction in percentage pupation and adult emergence were noticed with increment in the radiation doses applied. This reduction was higher for irradiated seven days old larvae than the one day old larvae at all doses applied, indicating that young larvae were more susceptible to gamma radiation than the older one. At higher doses (30-70 Gy) the pupae could not continue their development and died within 17 days after pupation. The longevity of adults resulted from irradiated larvae was decreased by increasing the radiation dosage and it was found that adults emerging from irradiated young larvae lived shorter than those from irradiated young ones, the fecundity of adults resulted from irradiated larvae was also decreased by gamma irradiation exposures. The percentage reduction of larviposition was 100% for irradiated females with 8 Gy while that of irradiated males was 97.5% indicating that females were more sensitive to radiation than males.",Excluded
228,"Adaptation to motion sickness from torso rotation affects symptoms from supine head nodding INTRODUCTION: Space motion sickness affects more than 50% of astronauts. Adaptation to one kind of nauseogenic motion can affect the response to another. We hypothesized that repeated exposure to torso rotation (TR) would diminish motion sickness (MS) due to supine head nodding (HN), a ground-based analogue for space sickness., METHODS: During TR, standing subjects swept their gaze back and forth between two targets located 135 degrees to either side of straight ahead. For HN, the subject lay supine on a platform with his/her head and neck hanging over the edge. The head was pitched back and forth between the horizontal position and rotated back as far as possible. MS was quantified in 5 male and 20 female subjects using numerical estimates of discomfort and a more detailed questionnaire. Susceptibility to TR and HN was determined on three occasions for each stimulus. At least 1 mo separated any two tests. Subjects were exposed to TR once a day for 7 consecutive days 1 mo after the final control session. Within 24 h of the seventh session, and 1 mo later, susceptibility to HN was evaluated again., RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in MS susceptibility during repeated exposure to TR (time to stop 17.7 min on Day 1, 31.8 min on Day 7). In contrast, there was a significant increase in MS susceptibility to HN after repeated exposure to TR (mean time to stop 11.7 min before TR, 9.5 min after). Susceptibility to HN was back to normal (time to stop 11.4 min) 1 mo later., DISCUSSION: Subjects can adapt to TR by repeated exposure. At the same time, susceptibility to HN increases. Strategies for pre-adaptation to space motion sickness need to be chosen carefully as they could actually be counterproductive.",Excluded
887,"3D Printed Personalized Guide Plate in the Femoral Head Core Decompression Objective. To investigate the feasibility of using 3D printed personalized guide plates in core decompression procedures for the treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). Methods. The clinical data of 8 patients undergoing femoral head core decompression from January to December 2019 were analyzed retrospectively. Three-dimensional (3D) images of the patients were reconstructed from the CT scan data taken preoperatively. From the data obtained, puncture position, drill hole, and depth were evaluated, and individualized 3D puncture guide plates were designed using Mimics 21.0 software. During the operation, the needle went through the hole of the guide plate, the depth of the drill was controlled, and the obtained bone tissues were sent for pathological evaluation. Intraoperative X-ray and postoperative pathological results were used to evaluate the success of the puncture. Results. The individualized guide plates used for core compression on the 8 patients were well fitted with the anatomic structure of the puncture site, and the direction and depth of the needle insertion were consistent with the preoperative design. The operation time was about 15-22 mins. The position of the decompression tunnel was the same as the designed plate. The postoperative pathology showed necrotic bone tissue. There were no postoperative complications such as infection, bleeding, and fracture. Conclusion. The 3D printed individualized guide plate can simplify core decompression and would make this procedure more accurate, safe, and quick, in addition to obtaining necrotic tissues for pathological examination.Copyright © 2020 Liangliang Cheng et al.",Excluded
637,"Multiple shifts to different pollinators fuelled rapid diversification in sexually deceptive Ophrys orchids Episodes of rapid speciation provide unique insights into evolutionary processes underlying species radiations and patterns of biodiversity. Here we investigated the radiation of sexually deceptive bee orchids (Ophrys). Based on a time-calibrated phylogeny and by means of ancestral character reconstruction and divergence time estimation, we estimated the tempo and mode of this radiation within a state-dependent evolutionary framework. It appears that, in the Pleistocene, the evolution of Ophrys was marked by episodes of rapid diversification coinciding with shifts to different pollinator types: from wasps to Eucera bees to Andrena and other bees. An abrupt increase in net diversification rate was detected in three clades. Among these, two phylogenetically distant lineages switched from Eucera to Andrena and other bees in a parallel fashion and at about the same time in their evolutionary history. Lack of early radiation associated with the evolution of the key innovation of sexual deception suggests that Ophrys diversification was mainly driven by subsequent ecological opportunities provided by the exploitation of novel pollinator groups, encompassing many bee species slightly differing in their sex pheromone communication systems, and by spatiotemporal fluctuations in the pollinator mosaic.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): Computed tomography (CT) images with retrospective electrocardiographic gating of 17 eligible patients were obtained. All images were reconstructed automatically for the end-diastolic and end-systolic phases. CT scanning without contrast at a random phase and a selected vertebral body were used as references to measure three-dimensionaldisplacements of the cardiac substructures. Result(s): The displacement between the end-diastolic and end-systolic phases (Dd-s) was greater than that between the end-systolic and random phases and between the end-diastolic and random cardiac phases. The largest displacements for the heart were in the left, posterior, and inferior directions with an average Dd-s of approximately 4-6 mm. The average Dd-s for the AMT and left ventricle was 1.2-2.7 mm in the anterior and right directions, 4.3-7.8 mm in left and posterior directions, and 4.9-6.3 mm in superior and inferior directions. For the coronary arteries, the average Dd-s was 2.8-5.9 mm in the anterior-posterior direction, 3.5-6.6 mm in left-right direction, and 3.8-5.3 mm in the superior-inferior direction. Inter-observer agreement was excellent for the heart, AMT, and left ventricle (kappa coefficient, >0.75 for all) and good for most coronary arteries in three dimensions (kappa coefficient, 0.511-0.687). The Dd-s did not differ significantly between men and women. Conclusion(s): Most average displacements of the cardiac substructures and coronary arteries were 3-8 mm in three dimensions. These findings will be useful to accurately estimate the radiation dose to cardiac substructures during thoracic radiation and to evaluate the risk of radiation-related heart disease. © 2013 Tan et al.

949,"A new diagnosis standard for enterovesical fistula in crohn's disease by intracavitary contrast-enhanced ultrasound Enterovesical fistula is a relatively rare condition complicating Crohn's disease (CD), often requiring surgical treatment [1]. Ascertaining the presence of fistula and visualization of its anatomy are important for undertaking a decision for surgery and may impact the operative strategy. However, conventional x-ray studies often fail to demonstrate the fistula tract. Ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging have a high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of intra-abdominal fistulas, with similar diagnostic accuracies [2]. However, these methods may still fall short of detection of occult and complex fistulas and/or delineating their tracts. Intra-cavitary contrast-enhanced ultrasound (IC-CEUS) was recently proved useful for detecting biliary tract and perianal fistula by locally-injected contrast agent [3-4]. Compared with CT and MR, IC-CEUS has the advantages of non-ionizing radiation and cost-efficacy. We describe the feasibility of IC-CEUS for detection of entero-vesical fistula in a patient with CD using surgery as reference standard. Our center is one of the starting area of the first domestic CD bowel ultrasound unit, has accumulated more than 600 cases, this paper reviews the literature at home and abroad, and combined with the ultrasonic diagnosis and the experience with abdominal abscess on CD interventional therapy - catheter drainage in 30 cases is discussed.",Excluded
138,"Distributed interactive communication in simulated space-dwelling groups This report describes the development and preliminary application of an experimental test bed for modeling human behavior in the context of a computer generated environment to analyze the effects of variations in communication modalities, incentives and stressful conditions. In addition to detailing the methodological development of a simulated task environment that provides for electronic monitoring and recording of individual and group behavior, the initial substantive findings from an experimental analysis of distributed interactive communication in simulated space dwelling groups are described. Crews of three members each (male and female) participated in simulated planetary missions"" based upon a synthetic scenario task that required identification, collection, and analysis of geologic specimens with a range of grade values. The results of these preliminary studies showed clearly that cooperative and productive interactions were maintained between individually isolated and distributed individuals communicating and problem-solving effectively in a computer-generated ""planetary"" environment over extended time intervals without benefit of one another's physical presence. Studies on communication channel constraints confirmed the functional interchangeability between available modalities with the highest degree of interchangeability occurring between Audio and Text modes of communication. The effects of task-related incentives were determined by the conditions under which they were available with Positive Incentives effectively attenuating decrements in performance under stressful time pressure. c2003 Elsevier Ltd.

1,"Modifying Effect of Chronic Atrophic Gastritis on Radiation Risk for Noncardia Gastric Cancer According to Histological Type The findings from previously published studies have suggested that radiation exposure is associated with increased mortality and incidence of gastric cancer. However, few cohort studies have incorporated risk factors such as Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection or chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG). The current study is aimed at evaluating the modifying effect of CAG on radiation risk of noncardia gastric cancer by histological type, by reanalyzing data from a nested case-control study conducted within the longitudinal clinical cohort of atomic bomb survivors. The analysis was restricted to 297 intestinal- or diffuse-type noncardia cases and 873 controls rematched to the cases on gender, age, city, and time and type of serum storage, and countermatched on radiation dose. Multivariable-adjusted relative risks [95% confidence interval (CI)] of noncardia gastric cancer were 3.9 (2.1-7.2) for H. pylori IgG seropositivity with cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) IgG low titer, 2.6 (1.9-3.6) for CAG, 1.9 (1.3-2.8) for current smoking, and 1.4 (1.1-1.9) for 1 Gy irradiation. Among subjects without CAG, the relative risk (95% CI) of noncardia gastric cancer at 1 Gy was 2.3 (1.4-3.7), whereas relative risk (95% CI) at 1 Gy was 1.1 (0.8-1.5) among subjects with CAG (for the overall interaction, P = 0.012). By histological type, the risk at 1 Gy was high for diffuse type without CAG, with adjusted relative risk (95% CI) of 3.8 (2.0-7.6), but was not high for diffuse type with CAG or for intestinal-type irrespective of CAG status. The results indicate that radiation exposure is associated with increased risk of diffuse-type noncardia gastric cancer without CAG, and this association exists despite adjustment for H. pylori infection and smoking habit.

467,"Single-arm phase II study of multiagent concurrent chemoradiotherapy and gefitinib in locoregionally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck Background. This phase II study tested the addition of the oral epidermal growth factor receptor gefitinib to multiagent concurrent chemoradiotherapy regimen in head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC). Methods. Patients with stage III-IV HNSCC received hyperfractionated radiation (72-74.4 Gy at 120 cGy twice daily), with concurrent 96-hour infusions of cisplatin 20 mg/m 2/day and fluorouracil 1000 mg/m2/day given during weeks 1 and 4. Daily gefitinib 250 mg was started on day 1 of radiation and continued for 2 years. Results. were retrospectively compared with our previous study using identical chemoradiotherapy without gefitinib. Results. Sixty patients were enrolled in the study; 80% had stage IV disease and 68% had oropharyngeal primary tumors. The full course of gefitinib was not tolerated by 42%; there were 5 treatment-related deaths (8%). With a median follow-up of 54 months, 2- and 3-year overall survival estimates were 80% and 71%, respectively. Projected distant metastatic control at 2 and 3 years was 88%. When compared with our historical cohort, acute toxicities including renal dysfunction and unplanned rehospitalization were worse in the study patients. Projected outcome estimates did not differ between the 2 cohorts. Conclusions. Addition of gefitinib to concurrent chemoradiotherapy was difficult to complete, did not improve outcomes, and increased toxicity. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
241,"Towards the control of chikungunya vector in la Reunion using the sterile insect technique: Sexual competitiveness and mating success of sterilized males Aedes albopictus The sterile insect technique (SIT) is widely used as part of area-wide integrated pest management programs for insects such as fruit fies, screw-worm fies and tsetse fies. It is based on the releases of large numbers of sterile males, which transfer their sterile sperm to wild females for the fertilization of the eggs, resulting in embryonic death. The lack of offspring could then lead to a decrease of the wild population density. The SIT is currently being developed at the FAO/IAEA in Vienna and on La Reunion, France, for the potential control of Aedes albopictus, vector of Chikungunya and secondary vector of Dengue viruses. In this context, we investigated the impact of the sterilisation process on male mating success and sexual competitiveness in the laboratory and under semi-feld conditions. Males from a young laboratory colony (F4) were irradiated as pupae (>20h old) with gamma-rays at 35 or 40 Gy. In the laboratory, the time for male sexual maturation was not affected by the irradiation, neither was the insemination rate of 4 days old males as compared to un-irradiated ones. The daily individual mating success of sterile males during 15 days was reduced as compared to un-irradiated males; however the differences were signifcant only during the second week. Sterility was maintained over successive matings and after a resting period. Under semi-feld conditions, sterile males competed well against wild males, though a resting period of 5 days in the laboratory before release greatly improved their effciency. A ratio of fve sterile to one wild male resulted in a two-fold reduction of the wild females' mean fertility. Valuable information on the effects of the sterilization process was collected and it is suggested that an effcient reduction of a wild population might be achieved by releasing sterile males as adults. Moreover, the results indicate that a resting period allows a recovery from radiation-induced somatic damages which improved the biological quality of the males.",Excluded
483,"Occupational risk factors and reproductive health of women BACKGROUND: This in-depth review summarizes and interprets the available recent epidemiologic evidence on the relationship between occupational exposures and negative reproductive outcome among women workers. METHODS: The studies examined by the review include those published in the international scientific literature since 1990, and were identified through the search of relevant data banks using selected keywords. RESULTS: From the examination of studies dealing with exposures of women to chemical agents, pesticides, physical agents, ergonomic factors and stress, it appears that at present the evidence is sufficient to warrant the maximum protection of pregnant women to several well-documented occupational risk factors. These include exposures to anaesthetic gases, antineoplastic drugs, heavy metals, solvents, heavy physical work and irregular work schedules. For other work risks, such as exposure to non-ionizing radiation and psychosocial work stress, the evidence is often suggestive but not conclusive. CONCLUSIONS: Policy makers and health professionals should advise women and employers to avoid exposure to the well-known occupational risk factors, while epidemiologic research should pursue methodological improvements and provide more insight into the magnitude of exposures responsible for detrimental effects.

994,"Dose conversion coefficients for neutron external exposures with five postures: walking, sitting, bending, kneeling, and squatting In a previous study, posture-dependent dose coefficients (DCs) for photon external exposures were calculated using the adult male and female mesh-type reference computational phantoms (MRCPs) of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) that had been transformed into five non-standing postures (i.e. walking, sitting, bending, kneeling, and squatting). As an extension, the present study was conducted to establish another DC dataset for external exposures to neutrons by performing Monte Carlo radiation transport simulations with the adult male and female MRCPs in the five non-standing postures. The resulting dataset included the DCs for absorbed doses (i.e., organ/tissue-averaged absorbed doses) delivered to 29 individual organs/tissues, and for effective doses for neutron energies ranging from 10-9 to 104 MeV in six irradiation geometries: antero-posterior (AP), posteroanterior (PA), left-lateral (LLAT), right-lateral (RLAT), rotational (ROT), and isotropic (ISO) geometries. The comparison of DCs for the non-standing MRCPs with those of the standing MRCPs showed significant differences. In the lateral irradiation geometries, for example, the standing MRCPs overestimate the breast DCs of the squatting MRCPs by up to a factor of 4 due to the different arm positions but underestimate the gonad DCs by up to about 17 times due to the different leg positions. The impact of different postures on effective doses was generally less than that on organ doses but still significant; for example, the standing MRCPs overestimate the effective doses of the bending MRCPs only by 20% in the AP geometry at neutron energies less than 50 MeV, but underestimate those of the kneeling MRCPs by up to 40% in the lateral geometries at energies less than 0.1 MeV.",Excluded
779,"S-R difference in V1-V2 is a novel criterion for differentiating the left from right ventricular outflow tract arrhythmias AIM: The correct estimation of the VA origin as RVOT or LVOT results in reduced ablation duration reduced radiation exposure and decreased number of vascular access. In our study, we aimed to detect the predictive value of S-R difference in V1-V2 for differentiating the left from right ventricular outflow tract arrhythmias., METHODS: We included 123 patients with symptomatic frequent premature ventricular outflow tract contractions who underwent successful catheter ablation (70 male, 53 female; mean age 46.2 +/- 13.9 years, 61 RVOT, 62 LVOT origins). S-R difference in V1-V2 was calculated with this formula on the 12-lead surface ECG: (V1S + V2S) - (V1R + V2R). Conventional ablation was performed in 101 (82.1%) patients, CARTO electroanatomic mapping system was used in 22 (17.9%) patients., RESULTS: V1-2 SRd was found to be significantly lower for LVOT origins than RVOT origins (p < .001). The cutoff value of V1-2 SRd obtained by ROC curve analysis was 1.625 mV for prediction of RVOT origin (sensitivity: 95.1%, specificity: 85.5%, positive predictive value: 86.5%, negative predictive value: 94.5%). The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.929 (p < .001)., CONCLUSION: S-R difference in V1-V2 is a novel and simple electrocardiographic criterion for accurately differentiating RVOT from LVOT sites of ventricular arrhythmia origins. The use of this simple ECG measurement could improve the accuracy of OTVA localization, could be beneficial for decreasing ablation duration and radiation exposure. Further studies with larger patient population are needed to verify the results of this study. Copyright © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): One hundred fifty-five patients with SCLC (limited stage, LSCLC, and extensive stage, ESCLC) participated in four phase II or III trials. Ninety-one patients received PCI (30. Gy/15 or 25. Gy/10) and 64 patients did not receive PCI. Survival was compared in a landmark analysis that included only patients who had stable disease or better in response to primary therapy. Result(s): Patients who received PCI had better survival than patients who did not receive PCI (median survival 12.0. months vs. 7.6. months, 3-year overall survival 13.2% vs. 3.1%, HR. =. 0.53 [95% CI 0.36-0.78], p=. 0.001). On multivariate analysis of the entire cohort, the only factor that remained significant for survival was stage (ESCLC vs. LSCLC, p=. 0.0072). In contrast, the multivariate analysis of patients who had ESCLC revealed that PCI was the sole factor associated with a survival advantage (HR. =. 0.47 [95% CI 0.24-0.93], p=. 0.03). Grade 3 or higher adverse events (AEs) were significantly greater in patients who received PCI (71.4% vs. 47.5%, p=. 0.0031), with non-neuro and non-heme being the specific AE categories most strongly correlated with PCI delivery. Conclusion(s): PCI was associated with a significant improvement in survival for our entire elderly SCLC patient cohort on univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis suggested that the survival advantage remained significant in patients with ESCLC. PCI was also associated with a modest increase in grade 3 or higher AEs.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

419,"Radiation pneumonitis in breast cancer patients treated with taxanes: does sequential radiation therapy lower the risk? Taxanes are now routinely used in conjunction with radiation therapy (RT) as adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. Recent publications have reported several cases of radiation pneumonitis (RP) in patients receiving RT and taxane chemotherapy, thus raising concern as to the safety of this combination. To decrease the potential risk of RP, we sequenced RT after taxane chemotherapy with a target interval of 3-4 weeks in two consecutive institutional breast protocols. Forty patients were treated on two adjuvant systemic protocols consisting of modified radical mastectomy (n = 9) or breast-conserving surgery (n = 31), followed by adjuvant doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and a sequential taxane (ACT), followed by RT. All patients had either node-positive or high-risk node-negative breast cancer and were treated between October 2000 and September 2002. Postmastectomy, a median dose of 5040 cGy was delivered to the chest wall. After breast-conserving surgery, a median dose of 4680 cGy was delivered to the breast plus a 1400 cGy boost to the surgical cavity. Information regarding RP was gathered retrospectively by reviewing patient records. With a median follow-up of 28 months (range 6-42 months), no cases of clinical RP were identified and no local failures had occurred. The median time interval for all patients between the completion of chemotherapy and the initiation of RT was 34 days (range 5-70 days). At the latest follow-up, 2 patients were diagnosed with metastatic disease and 38 patients were without evidence of disease. Sequencing of RT after taxane therapy with a target interval of 3-4 weeks does not appear to result in increased pulmonary toxicity and is associated with good local control.",Excluded

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term GKRS outcomes of bilateral TN at our institution and compare with our published treatment outcomes of unilateral TN. Copyright:, Methods: Between 2000 and 2006, eight patients with bilateral TN were treated with GKRS. Data available on seven patients were collected. Facial pain outcomes were defined using the Barrow Neurological Institute pain intensity scale. Outcomes and toxicities were compared to published outcomes of unilateral TN patients treated with GKRS at our institution., Results: The incidence of bilateral TN in our series is 2.3%. Treatment outcomes were excellent in 5/14, good in 1/14, and poor in 8/14. Median follow-up time was 58 months. Median time-to-failure was 38 months. Pain control rate was 80% at 12 months and 65% at 36 months. Bothersome side effects were seen in 4/14 nerves treated. Compared with our long-term unilateral TN cohort, there was no statistically significant difference in outcome, time-to-failure, or rate of toxicity., Conclusion: Bilateral TN is rare, and effective treatment is crucial to improve the quality of life of those afflicted.

Keloids that occurred at a different site in the same patient and keloids that recurred later at the same site were deemed to be different keloids. Those keloids were surgically removed, and the patients were treated postoperatively with 15-Gy electron-beam irradiation and followed for more than 18 months. The therapeutic outcomes were evaluated. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher's exact probability test or chi-square test. Recurrence occurred in two sites on 14 earlobes (14.3 percent), in two sites on 12 necks (16.7 percent), in 22 sites on 51 anterior chest walls (43.1 percent), in 13 sites in 33 scapular regions (39.4 percent), in four sites on 15 upper limbs (26.7 percent), in four sites in 11 suprapubic regions (36.4 percent), and in one site on 11 lower limbs (9.1 percent). The overall recurrence rate was 32.7 percent. Analysis of the therapeutic outcomes showed that the recurrence rates in the sites with high stretch tension, such as the chest wall, and the scapular and suprapubic regions were statistically higher than in sites without high tension, such as the neck, earlobes, and lower limbs (41.1 percent versus 13.5 percent, p = 0.0017).

590,"Upregulation of VEGF and FGF2 in normal rat brain after experimental intraoperative radiation therapy The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)2 in the irradiated brain was examined to test how a single high dose radiation, similar to that used for intraoperative radiation therapy given to the normal cerebrum, can affect the vascular endothelium. After a burr hole trephination in the rat skull, the cerebral hemisphere was exposed to a single 10 Gy dose of gamma rays, and the radiation effect was assessed at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after irradiation. Histological changes, such as reactive gliosis, inflammation, vascular proliferation and necrosis, were correlated with the duration after irradiation. Significant VEGF and FGF2 expression in the 2- and 8-week were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay quantification in the radiation group. Immunohistochemical study for VEGF was done and the number of positive cells gradually increased over time, compared with the sham operation group. In conclusion, the radiation injuries consisted of radiation necrosis associated with the expression of VEGF and FGF2. These findings indicate that VEGF and FGF2 may play a role in the radiation injuries after intraoperative single high-dose irradiation.",Included
730,"Estimating the burden of lung cancer and the efficiency of home radon mitigation systems in some Canadian provinces Lung cancer (LC) is the leading cause of death of cancer in Canada in both men and women, and indoor radon is the second leading cause of LC after tobacco smoking. The Population Attributable Risk (PAR) is used to assess radon exposure risk. In this work we estimate the burden of LC in some Canadian provinces. We use the PAR to identify the radon levels responsible for most LC cases. Finally, we use the PAR function of the two variables, radon action and target levels, to search for a possible optimal mitigation program., METHODS: The LC burden for Ontario, Alberta, Manitoba, Quebec and British Columbia was estimated using provincial radon and mortality data. Then the PAR and LC cases for these provinces were estimated over the period 2006-2009 at different given indoor radon exposure levels. Finally, the PAR function when radon action levels and radon target levels are variables was analyzed., RESULTS: The highest burden of LC in 2006-2009 was in Ontario and Quebec. During the period 2006-2009, 6% of houses in Ontario, 9% of houses in Alberta, 19% of houses in Manitoba, 7% of houses in Quebec, and 5% of houses in British Columbia had radon levels higher than 200Bq/m3 and were responsible about 913, 211, 260, 972, and 258 lives, respectively. Radon mitigation programs could have prevented these LC cases. The BEIR VI assumption for the United States (US) population, 95% of LC deaths in men and 90% of LC deaths in women are Ever-Smokers (ES), can be applied to the Canadian population. The PAR is a linear function in the target radon value with an estimated slope of 0.0001 for Ontario, Alberta, Quebec and British Columbia, and 0.0004 for Manitoba. The PAR is almost a square root function in the radon action level. The PAR is sensitive to changes in the radon mitigation program and as such, any improvement is a worthwhile investment.

158,"Repeated ultraviolet exposure affords the same protection against DNA photodamage and erythema in human skin types II and IV but is associated with faster DNA repair in skin type IV We have investigated the photoprotective properties of induced pigmentation using erythema and epidermal DNA photodamage as endpoints. Previously unexposed buttock skin of 12 young, healthy adults (six skin type II and six skin type IV) was exposed daily (Monday to Friday) for 2 wk (days 1-12) with 0.65 minimal erythema dose of solar simulated radiation. Mean skin type IV minimal erythema dose was 1.8-fold greater than for skin type II. Compared to skin type II, solar simulated radiation treatments produced less erythema and more tanning in skin type IV. To assess DNA photodamage, biopsies were taken and prepared for paraffin sections that were stained with a monoclonal antibody for thymine dimers. Thymine dimers were quantified by image analysis. The single exposure data (0.65 and 2 minimal erythema dose) showed that DNA damage was related to physical dose (J per cm2) independent of skin type. Our data also showed that DNA photo-damage accumulates in both skin types with repeated, suberythemal doses of solar simulated radiation. On day 12, there were more thymine dimers in skin type IV than skin type II, again indicating that physical rather than biologic dose determines the level of DNA damage. Comparisons on days 12 and 19, however, showed a much greater loss of thymine dimers in skin type IV, suggesting better thymine dimer repair. Protection factors for erythema and thymine dimers were calculated and shown to be about 2 in both skin types. This provides further indirect evidence that DNA is a chromophore for erythema, but also suggests that a tan may not be the major factor in natural photoprotection.",Excluded

There have been no formal trials of treatment for haemorrhagic radiation proctopathy and a variety of methods are currently used., AIM: In a retrospective study of 20 patients treated at a single centre, we assessed the efficacy of small volume topical formalin instillation to control bleeding from radiation proctopathy., METHOD: Patients were treated by a single operator using 20 mL of a 5% solution of formalin instilled into the rectum via a flexible sigmoidoscope for 3 min. Patients were followed up for an average of 22.7 months (range: 2-69)., RESULTS: A single session of formalin treatment was effective in 13 of 20 (65%) patients and a further four (20%) patients responded to a second treatment. No complications of the treatment was identified., CONCLUSION: Small volume formalin instillation therapy appears to be safe and effective in the context of haemorrhagic radiation proctopathy. The technique is simple, inexpensive, quick and requires no sedation. We suggest that it should be considered as a first line for patients presenting with this distressing condition.",Excluded

Posttreatment tumor response was assessed by cross-sectional imaging using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and tumor-marker levels. Laboratory and clinical toxicities and clinical symptoms were monitored., RESULTS: The median activity delivered was 1.63 GBq (range 0.63-2.36). Imaging follow-up using RECIST at 3-month follow-up demonstrated partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease in 22.5, 75.0, and 2.5% of patients, respectively. In 97.5% of patients, the liver lesions appeared hypovascular or partially necrotic. The mean follow-up was 16.2 months with 40 patients (95.2%) remaining alive. The median decrease in tumor-marker levels at 3 months was 54.8% (chromogranin A) and 37.3% (serotonin), respectively. There were no acute or delayed toxicities greater than grade 2 according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE (v3.0)]. No radiation-induced liver disease was noted. Improvement of clinical symptoms 3 months after treatment was observed in 36 of 38 symptomatic patients., CONCLUSION: Radioembolization with (90)Y-microspheres is a safe and effective treatment option in patients with otherwise treatment-refractory NETLMs. Antitumoral effect is supported by good local tumor control, decreased tumor-marker levels, and improved clinical symptoms. Further investigation is warranted to define the role of radioembolization in the treatment paradigm for NETLMs.",Excluded

There was no significant difference in 201T1 SPECT indices between radiation necrosis and tumor recurrence, but the ratio of the differential absorption ratio of tumor tissue to that of the homologous contralateral gray matter in PET of recurrent glioma was significantly higher than that of radiation necrosis. 11C-MET PET is superior to 201T1 SPECT for the differentiation of tumor recurrence from radiation necrosis and delineation of the extent of the tumor.",Excluded
487,"Radioprotection of hematopoietic stem cells by interleukin-1 Radioprotective agents such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), when given prior to irradiation, protect animals from radiation damage. However, in vivo administration of these cytokines does not allow one to determine whether the protective effects act directly on the hematopoietic system. In the present study, we subjected male bone marrow cells to in vitro treatment with IL-1 prior to irradiation and bone marrow transplantation. We found that male bone marrow cells pretreated with IL-1 prior to irradiation increased the survival of irradiated female recipient mice when compared with nontreated irradiated marrow cells. In addition, irradiated female recipients that received IL-1-pretreated male donor bone marrow cells displayed an increased presence of male donor cells in their bone marrow, spleen, and thymus for up to 3 months posttransplant. Furthermore, serial transplantation studies revealed that male cells could only be detected in tertiary female recipients who received bone marrow from mice transplanted with IL-1-treated cells. These results indicate that IL-1 pretreatment protects both short-term and long-term repopulating stem cells from an irradiation insult and that these cells are capable of reconstituting the myeloid and lymphoid organs of recipient mice.",Excluded
210,"Intracranial germ cell tumors: A singleinstitution experience BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Intracranial germ cell tumors (GCTs) are not a common disease. We reviewed the experience of a single institution to determine the variables that affect treatment outcome. DESIGN AND SETTING: A retrospective review of patients with the diagnosis of intracranial germ cell tumors treated in a single institution (KFSHRC) during the period from March 1985 to December 2007. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with the diagnosis of intracranial GCT were recorded in the KFSHRC Tumor Registry during the period from 1985 to 2007. Seven patients with a pineal region tumor treated as germinomas in the earlier years without a tissue diagnosis were excluded. This retrospective study was restricted to the remaining 50 patients with a tissue or marker diagnosis: 31 germinomas and 19 non-germinomatous germ cell tumors (NGGCTs). RESULT(S): The 10-year overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) were 87%, 88% and 96% for patients with germinoma, with a median follow-up of 4.5 (range 2-17) years, compared with 26%, 29% and 46% for patients with NGGCT with a median follow-up of 3 (range 1.5-13) years. For NGGCT, variables favorably influencing OS were younger age (< 16 y vs >=16 y, P=.01), higher radiation dose (>50 Gy vs <=50 Gy; P=.03) and later year of diagnosis (>1990 vs <1990 P=.002). CONCLUSION(S): Tissue diagnosis of GCTs is mandatory prior to treatment except for patients with elevated markers. In germinoma, localized radiotherapy (RT) for M0 patients may be adequate. Long-term follow-up is needed to define the benefit of adding chemotherapy. For NGGCT, the use of combined modality treatment and RT dose >50 Gy are important factors that influence the outcome. Second-look surgery and resection of residual/ refractory tumors is always recommended.",Excluded
718,"Radiation or chemotherapy cystitis with pseudocarcinomatous"" features"" BACKGROUND: The features of radiation or chemotherapy cystitis mimicking invasive urothelial cancer are not widely known., DESIGN: A search of the consultation files from our institution between January 1996 and September 2003 identified 20 patients with bladder biopsies showing cystitis mimicking invasive urothelial cancer., RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis was 69 years (range, 40-85 years); 80% were males. Complete history was not available in 1 patient. Seventeen patients had a history of pelvic irradiation (15 prostate cancer and 2 endometrial cancer). Two patients had systemic chemotherapy (1 metastatic colon cancer and 1 mixed connective tissue disease). All patients presented with hematuria. The mean time from radiation and/or chemotherapy to presentation was 27 months (range, 0-84 months). All cases showed epithelial proliferation that mimicked invasive cancer within the lamina propria, with marked proliferation seen in 45% of cases. Mild to moderate nuclear pleomorphism was seen in all cases. A characteristic feature was the presence of pseudoinvasive urothelial nests wrapping around the vessels associated with fibrin deposition. Most cases did not show any mitoses (75%). Ulceration was seen in 39% of cases. All cases showed some degree of hemorrhage, fibrin deposition and fibrin thrombi, fibrosis, and acute and chronic inflammation, with hemosiderin identified in 60% of cases. Edema and vascular congestion were common features (95% and 80%, respectively). Thickened vessels and vascular changes associated with radiation injury were identified in 75% of cases. Seventeen patients were followed for a mean of 9 months (range, 0.25-37 months), and none developed bladder cancer., CONCLUSIONS: Radiation or chemotherapy cystitis can show epithelial proliferations that may be confused with invasive urothelial carcinomas. Other findings characteristic of radiation or chemotherapy cystitis, such as hemorrhage, fibrin, and vascular changes, are often seen in association with the epithelial proliferations and are helpful in distinguishing it from invasive cancer. Pathologists must be aware that these changes may be seen with a remote radiation or chemotherapy history, where this information may not be provided or known at the time of the biopsy evaluation.",Excluded
449,"Capecitabine in postoperative radiochemotherapy for gastric adenocarcinoma Background: More than 50% of new gastric cancer patients are diagnosed with unresectable disease. In 50-80% of patients who underwent radical resection, locoregional recurrence is observed. It has been proved that postoperative radiochemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin significantly improves the treatment outcome. The treatment with oral fluoropyrimidines, such as capecitabine, appears to be more comfortable for patients, because there is no need for any invasive procedures. Method(s): In the period from October 2006 to December 2009, 95 patients (64 males, 31 females; aged 26-78 years, mean age 58.9 years) were treated for adenocarcinoma of non-cardial gastric cancer with postoperative chemoradiation with capecitabine. All patients had locally and/or regionally advanced disease, stages Ib-IIIc. Distal subtotal resection of the stomach was performed in 46.3%, total resection in 50.5% and multivisceral resection in 3.2% of patients. Radical (R0) resection was performed in 95.8% of patients and 4.2% of patients underwent non-radical (R1) surgery. In 44.2% patients, the tumor was staged as pT3 or pT4, and 77.9% patients had N+ disease. Chemotherapy included peroral capecitabine in the dose of 1250 mg/m2 bid on days 1-14 followed by a one week break. During irradiation patients took capecitabine in the dose of 825 mg/m2 bid. After radiotherapy was completed the patients received three more cycles of capecitabine in the dose of 1250 mg/m2 bid on days 1-14 with a one week break between each cycle. 3-D conformal radiotherapy at a daily dose of 1.8 Gy and total irradiation dose of 45 Gy was delivered on linear accelerator with 15MV photon beams for 5 days per week. The main endpoints of this study were loco-regional control, disease-free survival, disease-specific survival and overall survival. The rates of acute side-effects were also estimated. Result(s): Seventy-six percent of patients completed the treatment according to the protocol. In 4% of the patients the total irradiation dose was lower than intended and 24% of patients did not receive all cycles of chemotherapy. No death occurred due to the therapy. Acute toxicity, such as nausea and vomiting, stomatitis, diarrhea, hand-foot syndrome and infections of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 5.3%, 1.1%, 2.1%, 7.4% and 19% of patients, respectively. Despite intensive nutritional support during the treatment the weight loss was observed in 58.4% of patients. The median follow-up time for all 95 patients was 4 years (range: 0.4-6.3 years), whereas in survivors it was 4.8 years (range: 3.4-6.3 years). On the close-out date, 63% patients were still alive, all of them without any signs of the disease. Thirty percent of patients died from gastric carcinoma, 5% died from other causes and in 2% the cause of death could not be determined. After adjuvant radiochemotherapy, recurrence was observed in 31.6% of patients: local and/or regional recurrence in 4.2% of patients and systemic disease alone in 27.4% of patients. The 5 years LRC, DFS, DSS and OS were 93.1%, 67%, 68.6%, and 62.2%, respectively. Conclusion(s): Postoperative radiochemotherapy with capecitabine is feasible, with low toxicity and the results of such treatment are good.",Excluded
395,"Simulation of Tracer Dose Reduction in 18F-FDG PET/MRI: Effects on Oncologic Reading, Image Quality, and Artifacts The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of stepwise-reduced doses on objective and subjective image parameters and on oncologic readings in whole-body 18F-FDG PET/MRI. Methods: We retrospectively simulated the stepwise reduction of 18F-FDG doses of 19 patients (mean age +/- SD, 50.9 +/- 11.7 y; mean body mass index +/- SD, 22.8 +/- 3.2 kg/m2) who received a whole-body PET/MRI examination from 3 to 0.5 MBq/kg of body weight (kgBW) in intervals of 0.25. Objective imaging parameters were assessed by measuring the SUV and coefficient of variation in different regions (aorta, liver, spleen, kidney, small bowel, lumbar vertebra, psoas muscle, urinary bladder) as well as the noise-equivalent counting rates in each bed position. Subjective image quality was evaluated with a masked reading of each simulated PET compared with the dose of 2 MBq/kgBW. Oncologic reading was performed first according to PERCIST in each dose and second by defining malignant lesions in doses of 2 MBq/kgBW and the maximum dose image (gold standard). The diagnostic confidence of each lesion was measured using a Likert scale. Results: With decreasing doses, regions in the mid abdomen showed a stronger decrease of SUVmean and noise-equivalent counting rates than regions in the upper abdomen (SUVmean, -45% and -15% on average in the small bowel and the liver, respectively). The coefficient of variation showed a nonlinear increase, pronounced below 1.5 MBq/kgBW. Subjective image quality was stable over a range between 1.25 and 2.75 MBq/kgBW compared with 2 MBq/kgBW. However, large photopenic areas in the mid abdomen were observed in 2 patients. In the PERCIST reading, target lesions were above the liver threshold with a stable SUVpeak in all cases down to 2 MBq/kgBW. Eighty-six of 90 lesions were identified correctly with a dose of 2 MBq/kgBW; Likert scores did not differ significantly. Conclusion: A reduction of doses in 18F-FDG PET/MRI might be possible down to 2 MBq/kgBW in oncologic whole-body examinations. The image quality in the mid abdomen seems to be more affected by lower doses than in the upper abdomen, and in single cases large photopenic areas can occur. Therefore, we do not recommend reducing doses below 3 MBq/kgBW in adults at this time. Copyright © 2017 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging.",Excluded
473,"Image quality and required radiation dose for coronary computed tomography angiography using an automatic tube potential selection technique To investigate the image quality and the minimum required radiation dose for automatic tube potential selection (ATPS) in dual-source computed tomography (DSCT) coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). Three hundred twenty-five consecutive patients (153 men and 172 women) undergoing CCTA were assigned to either the ATPS group (n = 172) or the control group (n = 153); the control group underwent imaging at a constant current of 120 kV. All patients were scanned in either prospectively ECG-triggered high-pitch helical mode or sequential mode. The subjective image quality score, attenuation, image noise, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), volume CT dose index (CTDIvol), and effective dose (ED) were compared between the two groups with the Student t test or Mann-Whitney U test. The subjective image quality score was not significantly different between the two groups. Imaging noise and attenuation were both significantly higher in the ATPS group than in the control group (imaging noise: 25.6 +/- 7.6 versus 15.8 +/- 4.0 HU, P < 0.001; attenuation: 559.6 +/- 142.0 versus 412.5 +/- 64.3 HU, P < 0.001). SNR and CNR were significantly lower in the ATPS group than in the control group (SNR: 23.21 +/- 7.40 versus 27.71 +/- 8.25, P < 0.001; CNR: 27.81 +/- 8.44 versus 33.94 +/- 9.69, P < 0.001). ED was significantly lower in the ATPS group than in the control group (ED: 1.25 +/- 1.24 versus 2.19 +/- 1.77 mSv, P < 0.001). For both groups, ED was significantly lower in the high-pitch mode than in the sequential mode. The use of ATPS for CCTA significantly reduced the radiation dose while maintaining image quality.Copyright © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Excluded
1115,"Magnitude of luminance modulation specifies amplitude of perceived movement A compelling impression of movement, which is perceptually indistinguishable from a real displacement, can be elicited by patterns containing no spatially displaced elements. An apparent oscillation, w-movement, was generated by a stationary pattern containing a large number of horizontal pairs of spatially adjacent dots modulated in brightness. The observer's task was to adjust the perceived amplitude of the w-motion to match the amplitude of a real oscillation. All of the data can be accounted for by a simple rule: If the relative change in the luminance, W = delta L/L, between two adjacent stationary dots is kept constant, the distance over which these dots appeared to travel in space comprises a fixed fraction of the total distance by which they are separated. The apparent amplitude of the w-motion increases strictly in proportion with luminance contrast, provided that the contrast is represented in the motion-encoding system by a rapidly saturating compressive Weibull transformation. These findings can be explained in terms of bilocal motion encoders comparing two luminance modulations occurring at two different locations.",Excluded
177,"Effect of irradiation, asbestos and chemical cocarcinogens on incidence of sarcoma on implants An implant can act as a physical carcinogen. Chemicals applied to its surface can augment that. To explore if cocarcinogenesis would affect the incidence of tumour on implants, we tested several physical (asbestos, beta irradiation) and chemical (acridine orange, phorbol methyl ester, cigarette smoke tar, extract of Agaricus bisporus mushroom) carcinogens on 25 mm diameter nitrocellulose filters implanted in groups of BALB/c mice in 9 experiments. Saline was applied in 287 concurrent controls. Irradiation by 540 kBq I-125 fibrinogen on foreign bodies of surface area 20sq cm induced tumour in 6/6 pilot animals (expected 2/6) and in 25/36 animals (controls 13/29; p < 0.04). The mean dose (beta and gamma) to cells within 20 mum of the filter surface was estimated to be 782 mGy. Exposures to 270kBq or less were not significantly cocarcinogenic with single implants. Radiation from the paired implants was detectible up to 80 weeks. Asbestos, however, 2.3 or 4.6 mgm on implants did not in 3 trials increase sarcoma yield significantly, but did induce mesothelial-type growths in the peritoneum. Asbestos (2.3 mg) injected without an implant provoked no tumour at the site. The chemical carcinogen acridine orange gave ambiguous results, and the others reduced tumour incidence insignificantly. The irradiation history may be germane in the human cases that arise.",Excluded

With a median follow-up of 30.1 months, 2-year overall survival was 73.3% and 62.2%, respectively (P=0.37). Toxicities in both arms were comparable and manageable. Through univariate and multivariate analysis, PS of 2, Stage II(E) and elevated LDH level were identified to be adverse prognostic factors. A new prognostic index categorized three groups of patients (low risk, no adverse factors; intermediate risk, one factor; and high risk, 2 or 3 factors) with highly significant difference of prognosis. Two-year overall survival was 87.5%, 60.6% and 30%, respectively (P=0.0002)., CONCLUSIONS: The addition of semustine to CEOP regimen was not associated with improved efficacy.

613,"Does Exposure to Computed Tomography Contrast Media Increase Risk of End-Stage Renal Disease? BACKGROUND There are many studies on acute kidney injury (AKI) after exposure to contrast media in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, whether the risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) increases after exposure to contrast media in the long term, regardless of development of AKI after such exposure, has not been studied. MATERIAL AND METHODS The electronic health records of patients diagnosed with CKD and followed up from 2014 to 2018 at a tertiary university hospital were retrospectively collected. Patients were divided into patients who progressed to ESRD (ESRD group) and those who did not (non-ESRD group). Patients in the non-ESRD group were matched 1: 1 to those in the ESRD group by using disease risk score generation and matching. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the effect of contrast media exposure on progression to ESRD. RESULTS In total, 179 patients were enrolled per group; 178 (99.4%) were in CKD stage 3 or above in both groups. Average serum creatinine was 4.31+/-3.02 mg/dl and 3.64+/-2.55 mg/dl in the ESRD and non-ESRD groups, respectively (p=0.242). Other baseline characteristics were not statistically significant, except for the number of times contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) was performed (0.00 [Interquartile range (IQR) 0.00-2.00] in the ESRD group and 0.00 [IQR 0.00-1.00] in the non-ESRD group [p=0.006]); in multivariate logistic regression, this number (OR=1.24, 95% CI=1.08-1.47, p=0.006) was significantly related to progression to ESRD. CONCLUSIONS The use of CECT increased the risk of ESRD 1.2-fold in advanced and stable CKD outpatients after 5-year follow-up.",Excluded

Two experienced observers independently evaluated coronary CTA datasets from 50 consecutive patients undergoing two 128-slice dual source CT scans within 12 days. Mean (+/-SD) estimated radiation exposure was 1.5 +/- 0.2 mSv per scan. Observers recorded the presence and characterization of coronary plaques as non-calcified or calcified. A segment involvement score"" (SIS) was computed by summing the numbers of segments with any coronary plaque per patient. Reproducibility was assessed using kappa (kappa) statistics, paired t test and Bland-Altman analyses. Interscan, interobserver, and intraobserver agreement (kappa-values) for detection of any or calcified plaques were 83-94% (kappa-values 0.57-0.85), and 67-84% (0.31-0.67) for non-calcified plaques on a patient level. No significant difference was observed in mean interscan or interobserver SIS. Mean (95% CI) intraobserver SIS difference was -0.88 (-1.25; -0.51), P < 0.001, with limits of agreement from -4.7 to 2.9.

Longitudinal evidence is limited and this is yet to be examined among community-dwelling adults with anxiety. We aimed to investigate the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between anxiety and depressive symptoms and BMD. Method(s): This study examined data from the second Nord-Trondelag Health Study (1995-1997; 1194 men and 7842 women) and a follow-up conducted in 2001 (697 men and 2751 women). Symptomatology was ascertained using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and BMD was measured at the forearm using single-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Information on medication use and lifestyle was self-reported, and these, together with anthropometric measures were tested in multivariate analyses. Result(s): In men, adjusted BMD was 2.6% lower at the ultradistal forearm for those with depressive symptoms and 2.6% lower at the ultradistal and 2.0% lower at the distal forearm for those with anxiety symptoms. In women, adjusted BMD at the distal and ultradistal forearm was lower for heavier women with depressive symptoms but this relationship diminished with decreasing weight. Forearm BMD was similar for women with or without anxiety symptoms. Longitudinally, neither depressive nor anxiety symptoms were associated with bone loss over 4.6 years. Limitation(s): Findings cannot be generalised to other skeletal sites and a longer follow-up period may be necessary to detect differences in bone loss.

309,"Treatment outcomes of T4 locally advanced head and neck cancers with soft tissue invasion or bone and cartilage invasion PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE(S):: T4 locally advanced squamous cell cancers of the head and neck (SCCHN) with bone and cartilage invasion (BCI) traditionally have been treated with resection followed up with chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Because the organ preservation trials, more patients with BCI, as well as those with soft tissue invasion (STI), have been treated with definitive CRT. This is a review of our experience. MATERIALS/METHODS:: We performed a retrospective review of patients who underwent definitive CRT or radical resection followed up with postoperative CRT for T4N0-3M0 locally advanced SCCHN. We analyzed outcomes based on STI/BCI and types of treatment. Radiotherapy doses ranged from 59.4 to 72 Gy. Concurrent chemotherapy was platinum based in all CRT patients. RESULT(S):: From 1995 to 2006, 101 patients with locally advanced SCCHN were treated definitively. Of these, 51 had STI and 50 had BCI. Of the 51 patients with STI, 42 were treated with CRT, 5 patients were treated with resection followed by CRT, and 4 patients were treated with radiotherapy alone. Of the 50 patients with BCI, 26 patients were treated with CRT, 20 patients were treated with radical resection followed by radiotherapy or CRT, and 4 patients were treated with radiotherapy alone. Five-year local-regional control was 51% and 43% for STI and BCI patients treated with CRT, respectively, and 44% for BCI treated with radical resection. Five-year overall survival was 23%, 51%, and 28% for STI treated with CRT, BCI treated with CRT, and BCI treated with radical resection. Outcomes were not statistically different between these groups. CONCLUSION(S):: This study suggests similar outcomes for CRT or resection followed up with chemoradiotherapy for patients with locally advanced SCCHN with BCI. Concurrent CRT may be viable alternative to upfront resection in these patients. Further studies should be performed to validate these provocative findings.

842,"Joint echinococcosis: A report of three new cases Background Joint hydatidosis is defined as the development within the joint of multiple cysts that are the larval form of the tapeworm echinococcus granulosus. Bone and joint cysts account for less than 0.5% of all hydatid cysts in human. We report three cases of joint hydatidosis. Results Case 1: A 63-year-old woman, who was operated 4 times for lung and liver cyst hydatidosis, was complaining of right inflammatory lumbosciatica S1. Examination revealed pain when pressing the sacral region. X-rays revealed a heterogeneous lesion of the right sacrum. Computed tomography showed an eleven-mm diameter cyst in the right buttock joint with an anterior development into the pelvic cavity. Muscles were not involved. Surgical enucleation of the cysts was performed. Histopathologic examination showed germinative membranes of the hydatid cyst confirming the diagnosis. Case 2: A 35 year old man with history of right hip pain for the past 5 years and a progressive loss of motion range. Examination found a painful and restricted right hip movement in all directions. X-rays and computed tomography scan showed bone destruction of the hip, multiple cysts and ectopic calcifications around the joint. Serological test for hydatid disease was positive (1/280), confirming the diagnosis of hip hydatidosis. Case 3: A 39 year old women with history of liver hydatid cyst treated with surgery 14 years ago, was complaining of right shoulder pain for the past year. Examination revealed diffuse swelling of right shoulder with painful and restricted movement in all directions. X-rays showed multiple cysts of the shoulder with pathological fracture of the humerus diaphysis. MRI and hydatid serological test confirmed the diagnosis. Conclusions Hydatid cysts still occur in Tunisia despite prevention programs. The liver and the lung are the most frequent targets. The joint involvement is uncommon but severe. Joint contamination is usually local from bone lesion and rarely by blood or lymph vessels. Surgical excision of cysts is the main treatment but recurrence is possible particularly at proximal joint that are difficult to access.",Excluded

Design and method: A total of 126 HD patients (74m 52w; average age 61.5+/-15.8) were enrolled. All patients were dialysed by European and KDIGO guidelines. ABPM (24-hours) was performed with SpaceLab 90207 after mid-week dialysis; pulse wave velocity (PWV) and aortic augmentation index (AIx) were measured using Arteriograph after mid-week dialysis. Malnutritioninflammation score (MIS) and protein energy wasting (PEW) score were calculated in all enrolled patients. There were 67.6% of patients without prior CV disease, and prior coronary heart disease, valvular disease, atrial fibrillation, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease were diagnosed in 7.1%, 5,6%, 4.7%, 8.7%, 3.9% patients, respectively. Prior diabetes and prior hypertension were diagnosed in 26.2% and 92.4%, respectively. Result(s): There were 74.6% of non-dippers, while white coat hypertension and masked hypertension were diagnosed in 25.4% and 7.9%, respectively. During the follow up period of 48 months 69 patients died from all-cause and 53 from CV mortality. Diurnal variations of blood pressure were not associated with all-cause mortality. Neither white-coat nor masked hypertension were associated with all-cause mortality. Patients with arterio-venous fistula showed significantly better survival when compared to patients with permanent dialysis catheters and in the linear regression model MIS/PEW and PWV were the only predictors of longer survival (b =-0.371, p = 0.001; b =-0.249, p = 0.009). Conclusion(s): Blood pressure characteristics (ABPM) were not predictors of allcause mortality in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis. On contrary, arterial stiffness and malnutrition were associated with shorter survival. Observed better survival of patients with A-V fistula compared to patients with permanent catheter is very probably reverse epidemiology.
