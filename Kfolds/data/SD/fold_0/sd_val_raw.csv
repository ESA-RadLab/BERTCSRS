219,"Electron beam radiation for conjunctival squamous carcinoma PURPOSE: To describe the authors' technique and preliminary results using electron beam radiation as rescue therapy for recalcitrant squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva and cornea.
METHODS: A retrospective review comprised of an interventional case series of patients with pathologically confirmed diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva and cornea, who had failed multiple standard treatments and underwent electron beam radiation therapy. Outcomes, radiation-related complications, and adverse effects were documented. Mortality and local control rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier survival probability method.
RESULTS: Eight patients met the inclusion criteria; of these, 6 (75%) were men and 2 (25%) were women, with ages ranging from 38 to 65 years (mean 50 years). One tumor (12.5%) was classified as T2N0M0, 6 (75%) were classified as T3N0M0, and one (12.5%) was classified as T4N0M0. Follow up from electron beam radiation therapy ranged from 3 to 72 months (mean 30.25 months). The most common side effect was erythema and edema of the eyelids with diffuse transient eyelash loss, seen in all patients. Tumor local control and regression after electron beam radiation therapy were noted in 6 patients (75%); recurrence was noted in 2. There was neither metastatic spread nor tumor-related deaths.
CONCLUSIONS: The authors report a small case series where local tumor control was achieved with electron beam radiation therapy for recalcitrant squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva and cornea. This approach may be considered for patients who fail conventional therapy.",Excluded
1039,"Stereotactic body radiotherapy for pulmonary oligometastasis from colorectal cancer Background/Aim: A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for pulmonary oligometastasis from colorectal cancer (CRC). Patients and Methods: Patients with pulmonary oligometastasis from CRC who were treated with SBRT between April 2010 and October 2018 were enrolled in this study. All patients underwent SBRT using Cyberknife with a dose of 54-60 Gy in 3 fractions to 99% of the clinical target volume. The treatment efficacy was evaluated by the local control (LC) and overall survival (OS) rates. The toxicity was evaluated using the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. Result(s): Twenty-six lesions in 20 patients were treated with SBRT. The median followup duration was 19 months (range=6-98 months). Local recurrence occurred in 6 of 26 lesions with a median followup of 12 months. The 2-year LC and OS rates were 65.8% and 88.6%, respectively. No patient developed = grade 2 toxicity in the lung and other sites. Conclusion(s): Although very high doses were delivered to the tumors with SBRT, the LC of pulmonary metastasis from CRC was not satisfactory when compared to that for stage I primary non-small cell lung cancer reported in the literature.Copyright © 2020 International Institute of Anticancer Research.

148,"Internal target volume definition using four-dimensional CT and dosimetric evaluation for hepatocellular carcinoma BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Accurate definition of target volume is difficult in three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D CRT) for liver tumors because of the wide moving extent of tumors with respiration. This study was to define individualized internal target volume (ITV) using four-dimensional computed tomography (4D-CT), and compare planning target volumes (PTVs) and dose distribution of 3D planning with 4D planning for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHOD(S): Seven primary HCC patients received 4D-CT scanning. Gross tumor volumes (GTVs) and clinical target volumes (CTVs) were contoured on all 10 respiratory phases of CT images. The 3D and 4D treatment plans were made for each patient using different PTVs, namely, PTV-3D derived from a single CTV plus conventional margins; PTV-4D derived from ITV-4D which encompassing all 10 CTVs plus setup margins (SM). The two plans were designed at the 20% respiratory phase CT images using 3D treatment planning system and compared with respect to PTVs, dose distribution to normal tissues, normal tissue complication probability. The prescription dose and design of irradiating fields were identical for both plans. RESULT(S): The average PTV was (417.6+/-197.7) cm(3) in 3D plan and (331.9+/-183.1) cm(3) in 4D plan, decreased by 20.50% (12.60%-34.40%). PTV coverage and dose uniformity were similar in the 2 plans. 4D plans spared more normal liver, kidney, stomach, and small intestine than 3D plans, especially for the liver. The V30 and V40 of the liver were lower in 4D plans than in 3D plans (33.59% vs. 38.77%, 22.62% vs. 27.32%); the mean dose to normal liver was decreased from 24.13 Gy to 21.5 Gy; liver complication probability was decreased from 21.57% to 15.86%. Without increasing the normal tissue complication probability, the prescription dose was higher in 4D plans than in 3D plans [(54.86+/-2.79) Gy vs. (50.57+/-1.51) Gy], increased by 9.72% (4%-16%). CONCLUSION(S):The 3D plans have pitfalls of geometric miss or over coverage of target volume. The 4D plans can accurately definite target volume to spare more normal tissues and make dose escalation as compared with 3D CRT.",Excluded
827,"The effects of radioactive iodine therapy on olfactory function PURPOSE: To determine the possible adverse effects of radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment on the olfactory functions of patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective clinical study included 63 Turkish patients who had been diagnosed with papillary thyroid carcinoma only to ensure homogeneity. The Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center olfactory test was administered at 1 week before treatment and at the third week and the first year after treatment. Triiodothyronine, thyroxine, thyroid stimulating hormone, thyroglobulin, and antithyroglobulin levels were measured 1 week before treatment and 2 weeks after treatment., RESULTS: The smell threshold test, smell identification test, and total smell scores showed statistically significant decreases after treatment when compared with the pretreatment scores (p = 0.000). No significant differences were noted between the late term and early term after RAI for either the identification score (p = 0.502) or the total score (p = 0.051). The Spearman correlation analysis indicated a significant correlation between age and RAI before and after treatment for the smell threshold test, smell identification test, and total smell scores (p < 0.05). A total of 54% of the patients displayed normosmia in the posttreatment period. A few patients had mild hyposmia before RAI, 27% had mild hyposmia in the early stage after RAI, and 29% had mild hyposmia in the late stage., CONCLUSION: The olfactory function deteriorated in almost half of the patients in the early stage after RAI. Mild and moderate hyposmia in particular occurred in the first year after RAI.",Excluded
93,"Cervical lymphatic metastases from occult primary tumor. A nation-wide 20-year study from the Danish society of head and neck oncology INTRODUCTION: The management of patients with cervical lymph node metastases from unknown primary tumours is a major challenge in oncology. This study presents data collected from all five oncology centres in Denmark. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of the 352 consecutive patients with squamous cell or undifferentiated tumours seen from 1975 to 1995, a total of 277 (79%) were treated with radical intent. Most patients received radiotherapy to both sides of the neck as well as elective irradiation of the mucosal sites in nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx and larynx (81%). Irradiation of the ipsilateral neck only was done in 26 patients (10%). Radical surgery was the only treatment in 23 N1-N2 patients (9%). RESULT(S): The five-year estimates of neck control, disease-specific survival and overall survival for radically treated patients were 51%, 48% and 36%, respectively. The emergence of the occult primary was observed in 66 patients (19%). About half of the emerging primaries were within the head and neck region with oropharynx, hypopharynx and oral cavity being the most common sites. Emerging primaries outside the head and neck region were primarily located in the lung (19 patients) and oesophagus (five patients). The most important factor for neck control was nodal stage (5-year estimates 69% [N1], 58% [N2] and 30% [N3]). Other important parameters for neck control and disease-specific survival included haemoglobin, gender and overall treatment time. Patients treated with ipsilateral radiotherapy had a relative risk of recurrence in the head and neck region of 1.9 compared to patients treated at both neck and mucosa. At five years, the estimated control rates were 27% (ipsilateral) and 51% (bilateral; p = 0.05). The 5-year disease-specific survival estimates were 28% and 45%, respectively (p = 0.10). DISCUSSION: Extensive irradiation to both sides of the neck and the mucosa in the entire pharyngeal axis and larynx resulted in significantly fewer loco-regional failures compared to patients treated with ipsilateral techniques, but only a trend towards better survival. Determination of the optimal strategy in terms of loco-regional control, survival and morbidity requires a prospective randomized trial.",Excluded
1054,"Third-generation iterative reconstruction on a dual-source, high-pitch, low-dose chest CT protocol with tin filter for spectral shaping at 100 kV: a study on a small series of COVID-19 patients OBJECTIVES: To investigate the role of third-generation iterative reconstruction (ADMIRE) in dual-source, high-pitch chest CT protocol with spectral shaping at 100 kVp in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHOD(S): Confirmed COVID-19 inpatients undergoing to unenhanced chest CT were scanned with a dual-energy acquisition (DECT, 90/150Sn kV) and a dual-source, high-pitch acquisition with tin-filtered 100 kVp (LDCT). On the DECT with ADMIRE 3 (DECT3) were evaluated the pulmonary findings and their extension (25-point score). Two radiologists in consensus evaluated with 5-point scales the overall image quality, the anatomical structures, and the elementary findings on LDCT reconstructed with filtered backprojection (LDCT0), with ADMIRE 3 (LDCT3) and 5 (LDCT5), and on DECT3. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the body mass index, the exposure times, and the radiation doses were recorded. RESULT(S): Seventy-five patients (57 M/18F; median age: 63 y.o.) were included, with median pulmonary extension of 13/25 points. The imaging findings were detected in proportion comparable to the available literature. The ADMIRE significantly improved the SNR in LDCT (p<0.00001) with almost no significant differences in overweight patients. The LDCT had median effective dose of 0.39 mSv and acquisition time of 0.71 s with significantly less motion artifacts than DECT (p<0.00001). The DECT3 and LDCT3 provided the best image quality and depiction of pulmonary anatomy and imaging findings, with significant differences among all the series (p<0.00001). CONCLUSION(S): The LDCT with spectral shaping and ADMIRE3 provided acceptable image quality in the evaluation of patients with COVID-19, with significantly reduced radiation dose and motion artifacts.",Excluded
565,"Temporal evolution of administered activity in cardiac gated SPECT and patients' effective dose: analysis of an historical series PURPOSE: Myocardial perfusion imaging contributes >20 % of the average medical radiation exposure to the population in the USA. Imaging protocols able to achieve a radiation exposure <=9 mSv in 50 % of the studies by 2014 have been recommended. The aim of this study was to analyse the temporal evolution of administered activities in patients scheduled for dual-day (99m)Tc tracer gated single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and to compare different dose administration protocols in terms of patients' effective dose., METHODS: Patients evaluated from 1 July 2002 to 31 January 2012 were allocated according to the protocol adopted: group 1: fixed activity according to diagnostic reference level: 740 MBq up to 80 kg (adapted for weight <60 kg); 900 MBq 80-100 kg, 1,110 MBq >100 kg, standard filtered back-projection (FBP) reconstruction; group 2: weight-adjusted activity: 8 MBq/kg up to 1,110 MBq, standard FBP reconstruction; and group 3: 4 MBq/kg, UltraSPECT wide beam reconstruction (WBR) reconstruction. A dual-head Anger camera (GE Helix) was used., RESULTS: A total of 9,060 patients were allocated to different groups: 4,751 in group 1, 2,844 in group 2 and 1,465 in group 3. The stress + rest administered activity was 1,617 +/- 180 in group 1, 1,136 +/- 260 in group 2 and 682 +/- 164 MBq in group 3 (all p < 0.001). Patients' effective dose was 13.7 +/- 3 in group 1, 9.5 +/- 2.8 in group 2 and 5.7 +/- 1.6 mSv in group 3 (all p < 0.001). The 50th percentile was 12.6 in group 1, 9.1 in group 2 and 5.3 mSv in group 3. The effective dose received by the dedicated cardiologists was 2.1, 1.5 and 1.0 muSv/exam in group 1, group 2 and group 3 periods, respectively (all p < 0.001)., CONCLUSION: A significant reduction over time in the administered activity for gated SPECT was achieved; accordingly, a significant reduction in patients' exposure was obtained. A simple weight-adjusted strategy with 8 MBq/kg immediately fulfils the recommendations to limit exposure. In selected group 3 patients, a stress-only strategy allows for studies with <3 mSv exposure. Thus, at least the adoption of a new reconstruction algorithm is strongly encouraged, and suggested tracer activities for cardiac gated SPECT are to be revised.",Excluded
1157,"Flattening filter free vs. flattened beams for lung stereotactic body radiation therapy Background/Aim: To assess the clinical impact of high dose rate stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in patients with lung neoplastic lesions. Patients and Methods: From January 2014 to June 2016, a single-center retrospective analysis was performed including all patients treated by either flattening filter free (FFF) beams or flattening filter beams (FF) three-dimensional (3D) SBRT for lung neoplastic lesions. Result(s): A total of 99 SBRT were performed on 75 patients. Among these, 29 SBRT were performed using a FFF technique while 70 other SBRT were done using a FF technique. Median follow-up time was 12.9 months. Overall, no difference between the two groups was found except for the mean beam on time which was reduced by 3.3 to 0.9 minutes in the FFF group (p<0.001). Conclusion(s): We report a low toxicity rate and a shortened beam on time in patients treated with 3D FFF SBRT for lung neoplastic lesions.",Excluded
1007,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for the treatment of symptomatic brainstem cavernous malformations OBJECT: The authors performed a retrospective review of prospectively collected data to evaluate the safety and efficacy of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for the treatment of patients harboring symptomatic solitary cavernous malformations (CMs) of the brainstem that bleed repeatedly and are high risk for resection. METHOD(S): Between 1988 and 2005, 68 patients (34 males and 34 females) with solitary, symptomatic CMs of the brainstem underwent Gamma Knife surgery. The mean patient age was 41.2 years, and all patients had suffered at least 2 symptomatic hemorrhages (range 2-12 events) before radiosurgery. Prior to SRS, 15 patients (22.1%) had undergone attempted resection. The mean volume of the malformation treated was 1.19 ml, and the mean prescribed marginal radiation dose was 16 Gy. RESULT(S): The mean follow-up period was 5.2 years (range 0.6-12.4 years). The pre-SRS annual hemorrhage rate was 32.38%, or 125 hemorrhages, excluding the first hemorrhage, over a total of 386 patient-years. Following SRS, 11 hemorrhages were observed within the first 2 years of follow-up (8.22% annual hemorrhage rate) and 3 hemorrhages were observed in the period after the first 2 years of follow-up (1.37% annual hemorrhage rate). A significant reduction (p < 0.0001) in the risk of brainstem CM hemorrhages was observed following radiosurgical treatment, as well as in latency period of 2 years after SRS (p < 0.0447). Eight patients (11.8%) experienced new neurological deficits as a result of adverse radiation effects following SRS. CONCLUSION(S): The results of this study support a role for the use of SRS for symptomatic CMs of the brainstem, as it is relatively safe and appears to reduce rebleeding rates in this high-surgical-risk location.",Excluded
365,"Refining the criteria for immediate total-body CT after severe trauma OBJECTIVES: Initial trauma care could potentially be improved when conventional imaging and selective CT scanning is omitted and replaced by immediate total-body CT (iTBCT) scanning. Because of the potentially increased radiation exposure by this diagnostic approach, proper selection of the severely injured patients is mandatory., METHODS: In the REACT-2 trial, severe trauma patients were randomized to iTBCT or conventional imaging and selective CT based on predefined criteria regarding compromised vital parameters, clinical suspicion of severe injuries, or high-risk trauma mechanisms in five trauma centers. By logistic regression analysis with backward selection on the 15 study inclusion criteria, a revised set of criteria was derived and subsequently tested for prediction of severe injury and shifts in radiation exposure., RESULTS: In total, 1083 patients were enrolled with median ISS of 20 (IQR 9-29) and median GCS of 13 (IQR 3-15). Backward logistic regression resulted in a revised set consisting of nine original and one adjusted criteria. Positive predictive value improved from 76% (95% CI 74-79%) to 82% (95% CI 80-85%). Sensitivity decreased by 9% (95% CI 7-11%). The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve remained equal and was 0.80 (95% CI 0.77-0.83), original set 0.80 (95% CI 0.77-0.83). The revised set retains 8.78 mSv (95% CI 6.01-11.56) for 36% of the non-severely injured patients., CONCLUSIONS: Selection criteria for iTBCT can be reduced from 15 to 10 clinically criteria. This improves the positive predictive value for severe injury and reduces radiation exposure for less severely injured patients., KEY POINTS: * Selection criteria for iTBCT can be reduced to 10 clinically useful criteria. * This reduces radiation exposure in 36% of less severely injured patients. * Overall discriminative capacity for selection of severely injured patients remained equal.",Excluded
839,"Photosensitivity induced by chemotherapy INTRODUCTION: Photosensitivity is a frequent dermatological complication of chemotherapy. It is defined by an inflammatory reaction of the photo-exposed zones at the time of solar exposure. This is related to aberrations induced in porphyrin biosynthesis and triggered by UVB. Photosensitivity is induced by many anticancer agents. Clinically, patients present with a rash that looks like a sunburn with erythema, edema, pain, pruritus. In more severe cases, we can observe bubbles with cutaneous abrasion. This rash predominates in the exposed areas. The treatment is based on emollients, antihistamines, topical corticosteroids and healing creams Objective: we describe the epidemiological, chronological, clinical, therapeutic and evolutionary characteristics of this dermatological toxicity of chemotherapy. Material(s) and Method(s): This is a prospective study spanning a period of 24 months, including patients followed in medical oncology for solid cancers under chemotherapy in an adjuvant or metastatic situation, addressed for dermatological complications of chemotherapy. Result(s): 350 patients were collected, photosensitivity was objectified in 150 patients, 20% of our patients had a severe form, 50% a moderate form and 30% a mild form. 60% of the patients were put on topical corticosteroids and 30% under healing creams. Chemical photoprotection was instituted in all patients. The evolution was favorable for all our patients. 25% developed secondary hyperpigmentation. Conclusion(s): Photosensitivity is a common and disabling side effect. It can lead, through the secondary hyperpigmentation, an important esthetic damage especially in the patients under chemotherapy. Hence the interest of awareness and photoprotection.",Excluded
622,"Protocol of a thyroid cancer longitudinal study (t-calos): A prospective, clinical and Epidemiological study in Korea Introduction: Thyroid cancer incidence in Korea is the highest in the world and has recently increased steeply. However, factors contributing to this sudden increase have not been fully elucidated, and few studies have explored the postoperative prognosis. The Thyroid Cancer Longitudinal Study (T-CALOS) was initiated with three aims: (1) to identify factors predicting quality of life, recurrence, and incidence of other diseases after thyroid cancer treatments; (2) to investigate environmental exposure to radiation, toxicants and molecular factors in relation to tumour aggressiveness; and (3) to evaluate gene-environment interactions that increase thyroid cancer in comparison with healthy participants from a pool of nationwide population-based healthy examinees. Methods and analysis: T-CALOS enrols patients with incident thyroid cancer from three general hospitals, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital and National Medical Center, Korea. The study is an ongoing project expecting to investigate 5000 patients with thyroid cancer up until 2017. Healthy examinees with a normal thyroid confirmed by sonography have been enrolled at the Healthy Examination Center at Seoul National University Hospital. We are also performing individual matching using two nationwide databases that are open to the public. Follow-up information is obtained at patients' clinical visits and by linkage to the national database. For statistical analysis, we will use conditional logistic regression models and a Cox proportional hazard regression model. A number of stratifications and sensitivity analyses will be performed to confirm the results. Ethics and dissemination: Based on a large sample size, a prospective study design, comprehensive data collection and biobank, T-CALOS has been independently peer-reviewed and approved by the three hospitals and two funding sources (National Research Foundation of Korea and Korean Foundation for Cancer Research). The results of T-CALOS will be published according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) criteria.",Excluded
419,"Radiation pneumonitis in breast cancer patients treated with taxanes: does sequential radiation therapy lower the risk? Taxanes are now routinely used in conjunction with radiation therapy (RT) as adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. Recent publications have reported several cases of radiation pneumonitis (RP) in patients receiving RT and taxane chemotherapy, thus raising concern as to the safety of this combination. To decrease the potential risk of RP, we sequenced RT after taxane chemotherapy with a target interval of 3-4 weeks in two consecutive institutional breast protocols. Forty patients were treated on two adjuvant systemic protocols consisting of modified radical mastectomy (n = 9) or breast-conserving surgery (n = 31), followed by adjuvant doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and a sequential taxane (ACT), followed by RT. All patients had either node-positive or high-risk node-negative breast cancer and were treated between October 2000 and September 2002. Postmastectomy, a median dose of 5040 cGy was delivered to the chest wall. After breast-conserving surgery, a median dose of 4680 cGy was delivered to the breast plus a 1400 cGy boost to the surgical cavity. Information regarding RP was gathered retrospectively by reviewing patient records. With a median follow-up of 28 months (range 6-42 months), no cases of clinical RP were identified and no local failures had occurred. The median time interval for all patients between the completion of chemotherapy and the initiation of RT was 34 days (range 5-70 days). At the latest follow-up, 2 patients were diagnosed with metastatic disease and 38 patients were without evidence of disease. Sequencing of RT after taxane therapy with a target interval of 3-4 weeks does not appear to result in increased pulmonary toxicity and is associated with good local control.",Excluded

595,"Evaluation of delivered dose for a clinical daily adaptive plan selection strategy for bladder cancer radiotherapy PURPOSE: To account for variable bladder size during bladder cancer radiotherapy, a daily plan selection strategy was implemented. The aim of this study was to calculate the actually delivered dose using an adaptive strategy, compared to a non-adaptive approach., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ten patients were treated to the bladder and lymph nodes with an adaptive full bladder strategy. Interpolated delineations of bladder and tumor on a full and empty bladder CT scan resulted in five PTVs for which VMAT plans were created. Daily cone beam CT (CBCT) scans were used for plan selection. Bowel, rectum and target volumes were delineated on these CBCTs, and delivered dose for these was calculated using both the adaptive plan, and a non-adaptive plan., RESULTS: Target coverage for lymph nodes improved using an adaptive strategy. The full bladder strategy spared the healthy part of the bladder from a high dose. Average bowel cavity V30Gy and V40Gy significantly reduced with 60 and 69ml, respectively (p<0.01). Other parameters for bowel and rectum remained unchanged., CONCLUSIONS: Daily plan selection compared to a non-adaptive strategy yielded similar bladder coverage and improved coverage for lymph nodes, with a significant reduction in bowel cavity V30Gy and V40Gy only, while other sparing was limited.

899,"Pretreatment with a single, low dose of recombinant human thyrotropin allows dose reduction of radioiodine therapy in patients with nodular goiter In patients with nodular goiter, radioiodine ((131)I) therapy results in a mean reduction in thyroid volume (TV) of approximately 40% after 1 yr. We have demonstrated that pretreatment with a single, low dose of recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) doubles 24-h radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) in these patients. We have now studied the safety and efficacy of therapy with a reduced dose of (131)I after pretreatment with rhTSH. Twenty-two patients with nodular goiter received (131)I therapy, 24 h after im administration of 0.01 (n = 12) or 0.03 (n = 10) mg rhTSH. In preceding diagnostic studies using tracer doses of (131)I, 24-h RAIU without and with rhTSH pretreatment (either 0.01 or 0.03 mg) were compared. Therapeutic doses of (131)I were adjusted to the rhTSH-induced increases in 24-h RAIU and were aimed at 100 micro Ci/g thyroid tissue retained at 24 h. Pretreatment with rhTSH allowed dose reduction of (131)I therapy by a factor of 1.9 +/- 0.5 in the 0.01-mg and by a factor of 2.4 +/- 0.4 in the 0.03-mg rhTSH group (P < 0.05, 0.01 vs. 0.03 mg rhTSH). Before and 1 yr after therapy, TV and the smallest cross-sectional area of the tracheal lumen were measured with magnetic resonance imaging. During the year of follow-up, serum TSH, free T(4) (FT(4)), T(3), and TSH receptor antibodies were measured at regular intervals. TV before therapy was 143 +/- 54 ml in the 0.01-mg group and 103 +/- 44 ml in the 0.03-mg rhTSH group. One year after treatment, TV reduction was 35 +/- 14% (0.01 mg rhTSH) and 41 +/- 12% (0.03 mg rhTSH). In both groups, smallest cross-sectional area of the tracheal lumen increased significantly. In the 0.01-mg rhTSH group, serum FT(4) rose, after (131)I treatment, from 15.8 +/- 2.8 to 23.2 +/- 4.4 pM. In the 0.03-mg rhTSH group, serum FT(4) rose from 15.5 +/- 2.5 to 23.5 +/- 5.1 pM. Individual peak FT(4) levels, reached between 1 and 28 d after (131)I treatment, were above the normal range in 12 patients. TSH receptor antibodies were negative in all patients before therapy and became positive in 4 patients. Hyperthyroidism developed in 3 of these 4 patients between 23 and 25 wk after therapy. In conclusion, in patients with nodular goiter pretreatment with a single, low dose of rhTSH allowed approximately 50-60% reduction of the therapeutic dose of radioiodine without compromising the efficacy of TV reduction.",Excluded
672,"Thyroid and parathyroid function in long-term survivors of stem cell transplantation after 10-14Gy total body irradiation Thyroid and parathyroid dysfunction are well described complications of irradiation to the neck. In this study we have evaluated the incidence of thyroid and parathyroid dysfunction in long term survivors of SCT attending a dedicated haematology/ endocrine follow-up clinic. All patients were transplanted for haematological malignancy and had total body irradiation (TBI) as part of their pre-transplant conditioning regimen. 76 patients (37 female) were investigated a median of 18 years post SCT (range 8-29). The median dose of TBI was 12Gy (range 10-14) given in conjunction with cyclophosphamide. 61 patients were treated for CML and 15 patients were treated for acute leukemia. 21 out of 76 patients (28%) developed hypothyroidism and there were no cases of hyperthyroidism. Among male patients the prevalence was 26% compared to <1% in normal populations. Among women the prevalence was 30% compared to a normal prevalence of 0.1-2%. The median time after SCT that hypothyroidism developed was 13 years but the range was wide at 4.5-24 years. None of our patients had laboratory evidence of hypoparathyroidism (low calcium with inappropriately non-elevated PTH). 16 patients had a raised PTH level. Of these, 12/16 had a calcium level in the lower end of the normal range (2.16-2.4 mmol/l) making primary hyperparathyroidism unlikely. The majority (11/12) of these patients had low vitamin D levels making secondary hyperparathyroidism the most likely diagnosis. Of four patients with elevated PTH and calcium levels >2.4 mmol/ l, none had convincing evidence of primary hyperparathyroidism. One patient had renal impairment and secondary/tertiary hyperparathyroidism; a second was taking bendrofluazide; a third was vitamin D deficient. A fourth patient was hypocalciuric with a 24 hour urinary calcium/creatinine ratio <0.01; this excludes primary hyperparathyroidism and makes the diagnosis of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia likely. In summary, there was a high prevalence of hypothyroidism (28%) among our patients. Conversely there were no cases of primary hyperparathyroidism or hypoparathyroidism but longer follow up will be necessary to clarify the effect of these doses of TBI on parathyroid function. Secondary hyperparathyroidism was frequent, particularly in association with low vitamin D levels. We conclude that indefinite surveillance is needed to identify thyroid dysfunction after SCT and vitamin D levels should be part of routine annual follow up investigations.",Excluded
388,"An alternative approach to account for patient organ doses from imaging guidance procedures PURPOSE: To investigate the feasibility of an alternative method of accounting for additional organ doses resulting from image guidance procedures during patient treatment planning through tabulated values based on scan protocol and scan site., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patient-specific imaging dose to 30 patients resulting from Varian OBI kV-CBCT scans using the Standard Head (17 patients), Low-dose Thorax (8 patients), and Pelvic (5 patients) scan protocols were retrospectively calculated using Monte Carlo methods. Dose dependence on scan location and patient geometry was explored. Patient organ doses were analyzed by using dose-volume histograms and expressed by the mean, minimum dose delivered to 50% of the organ volume, D50. The reported doses are dose-to-medium instead of dose-to-water., RESULTS: The organ doses from all patient-specific calculations show predictable and limited ranges across patients. For brain isocenters using Standard Head Scans: Bone: 0.7-1.1 cGy, Brain: 0.2-0.3 cGy, Brainstem: 0.2-0.3 cGy, Skin: 0.3-0.4 cGy, Eye: 0.03-0.3 cGy. For head and neck patients using the Standard Head Scan: Bone: 0.3-0.6 cGy, Parotids: 0.3-0.4 cGy, Spinal Cord: 0.15-0.25 cGy, Thyroid: 0.1-0.25 cGy, Skin: 0.2-0.3 cGy, Trachea-Esophagus: 0.1-0.2 cGy. For chest using Thorax Scans: Bone: 1.1-1.8 cGy, Soft tissue organs (Bowel, Lung, Heart, Kidney, Esophagus, and Spinal Cord): 0.3-0.6 cGy. For abdominal site using Pelvic Scans: Bone: 3.2-4.2 cGy. Soft tissue organs (Bladder, Bowel, Rectum, Prostate, and Skin) D50s fell between 1.2 and 2.2 cGy. Femoral Heads: 2.5-3.4 cGy., CONCLUSIONS: It is adequate to estimate and account for organ dose by using tabulated values based on scan procedure and site because organ doses from imaging procedures are only modestly dependent upon scan location and body size. Considering the dose variation and magnitude of dose from each scan protocol in comparison to therapeutic doses, this approach provides a simple alternative to account for additional imaging guidance doses during patient treatment planning. Clinicians can use these tabulated values to make informed decisions in selecting the appropriate imaging procedures and imaging frequency during radiotherapy treatment.

988,"Salvage Gamma Knife Radiosurgery after failed management of bilateral trigeminal neuralgia Background: The incidence of bilateral trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is 1-6% of total number of TN cases. Gamma Knife Radiosurgery (GKRS) is effective in treating unilateral TN; however, outcomes of bilateral TN treated by GKRS have not been well evaluated. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term GKRS outcomes of bilateral TN at our institution and compare with our published treatment outcomes of unilateral TN. Copyright:, Methods: Between 2000 and 2006, eight patients with bilateral TN were treated with GKRS. Data available on seven patients were collected. Facial pain outcomes were defined using the Barrow Neurological Institute pain intensity scale. Outcomes and toxicities were compared to published outcomes of unilateral TN patients treated with GKRS at our institution., Results: The incidence of bilateral TN in our series is 2.3%. Treatment outcomes were excellent in 5/14, good in 1/14, and poor in 8/14. Median follow-up time was 58 months. Median time-to-failure was 38 months. Pain control rate was 80% at 12 months and 65% at 36 months. Bothersome side effects were seen in 4/14 nerves treated. Compared with our long-term unilateral TN cohort, there was no statistically significant difference in outcome, time-to-failure, or rate of toxicity., Conclusion: Bilateral TN is rare, and effective treatment is crucial to improve the quality of life of those afflicted. Salvage GKRS is a reasonable treatment modality for individuals with bilateral TN.Copyright © 2014 Raval AB.",Excluded
139,"Evaluation of external cardiac massage performance during hypogravity simulation Preservation of astronaut crew health during an exploration mission to the Moon or Mars will be crucial to mission success. The likelyhood of a life threatening medical condition occurring during a mission to Mars has been estimated by NASA to be 1% per year. Since basic life support is a vital skill in critical care medicine, plans must be in place for cardiopulmonary resuscitation in both microgravity and hypogravity (i.e. on the surface of the Moon or Mars). Following the design of a body suspension device to simulate a hypogravity environment, subjects performed external chest compressions in 1G, 0.17G (Lunar), 0.38G (Mars) and 0.7G ('Planet X'). Chest compression adequacy was assessed by means of rate and depth. Heart rate immediately before and after 3 minutes of chest compression gave a measure of rescuer fatigue. Elbow flexion was measured using an electrogoniometer in order to assess the use of arm muscles to achieve chest compressions. This study found that depth (Lunar and Mars) and rate (Mars) of chest compression was below American Heart Association recommendations during hypogravity simulation in the female group. Furthermore, elbow flexion proved to be significantly greater during Lunar and Mars hypogravity simulation than that of the 1G control condition, suggesting that upper arm force may be used to counter the loss of body weight in an attempt to maintain adequate chest compression under these conditions.",Excluded
121,"Human dosimetry and preliminary tumor distribution of 18F- fluoropaclitaxel in healthy volunteers and newly diagnosed breast cancer patients using PET/CT 18F-fluoropaclitaxel is a radiolabeled form of paclitaxel, a widely used chemotherapy agent. Preclinical data suggest that 18F-fluoropaclitaxel may be a reasonable surrogate for measuring the uptake of paclitaxel. As a substrate of P-glycoprotein, a drug efflux pump associated with multidrug resistance, 18F-fluoropaclitaxel may also be useful in identifying multidrug resistance and predicting tumor response for drugs other than paclitaxel. Method(s): After informed consent was obtained, 3 healthy volunteers and 3 patients with untreated breast cancer (neoadjuvant chemotherapy candidates, tumor size > 2 cm) received an intravenous infusion of 18F-fluoropaclitaxel and then underwent PET/CT. Healthy volunteers underwent serial whole-body imaging over an approximately 3-h interval, and organ 18F residence times were determined from the time-activity curves uncorrected for decay to determine dosimetry. Radiation dose estimates were calculated using OLINDA/EXM software. For breast cancer patients, dynamic imaging of the primary tumor was performed for 60 min, followed by static whole-body scans at 1 and 2 h after injection. Result(s): Dosimetry calculations showed that the gallbladder received the highest dose (229.50 muGy/MBq [0.849 rad/mCi]), followed by the small and large intestines (161.26 muGy/MBq [0.597 rad/mCi] and 184.59 muGy/MBq [0.683 rad/mCi]). The resultant effective dose was 28.79 muGy/MBq (0.107 rem/mCi). At approximately 1 h after injection, an average of 42% of the decay-corrected activity was in the gastrointestinal system, with a mean of 0.01% in the tumor. All 3 breast cancer patients showed retention of 18F-fluoropaclitaxel and ultimately demonstrated a complete pathologic response (no invasive cancer in the breast or axillary nodes) to chemotherapy that included a taxane (either paclitaxel or docetaxel) at surgical resection. The tumor-to-background ratio increased with time to a maximum of 7.7 at 20 min. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates the feasibility of using 18F-fluoropaclitaxel PET/CT tumor imaging and provides radiation dosimetry measurements in humans. Although further study is needed, it is hoped that the measured intratumoral 18F-fluoropaclitaxel distribution can serve as a surrogate for paclitaxel, and potentially other chemotherapeutic agent retention, in solid tumors.

841,"Imaging for low back pain in the urgent care setting: Does an educational intervention for interns change radiologic management? BACKGROUND: Low back pain (LBP) is among the most common presenting symptoms in a primary care clinic, and up to a quarter of those visits result in imaging. However, imaging for simple lumbago without red flag symptoms has not been shown to provide clinical benefit, and rather increases costs, anxiety, and radiation exposure. As a result, LBP has been a substantial focus in health services research in an effort to reduce waste and expenses, with several guidelines on appropriate image ordering. We sought to determine the patterns of LBP imaging in an academic urgent care setting and assess the impact of an educational intervention on appropriate image ordering practices among internal medicine (IM) residents. METHOD(S): An interactive lecture series (Imaging Wisely"") was developed for the University of Chicago's IM interns for the 2017-2018 academic year. The curriculum aimed to guide evidence-based imaging by introducing the American College of Radiology's (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria through two lectures and interactive, case-based, Radiology-TEACHES assignments between lectures. Previous research found that the program improved knowledge and intention to change imaging practices. The purpose of this study was to assess for behavior change by focusing on rates of radiologic mismanagement of LBP pre- and postintervention. An electronic medical record query was conducted of all urgent care visits with diagnoses related to LBP among interns (n=27) who participated in the Imaging Wisely lectures. Patient encounters were reviewed and coded for diagnosis, red flag symptoms, type of imaging ordered, and appropriateness of imaging ordered. RESULT(S): Atotal of 219 urgent care encounters for LBP were reviewed. Nineteen percent (n=41) of encounters involved a red flag symptom (duration >6 weeks and failed conservative therapy; concern for cancer, infection, cord compression, or fracture; progressive neurologic symptoms; history of lumbar surgery). Among LBP visits, radiologic mismanagement was noted in 10% of cases (n= 22). This mismanagement was equally attributable to over- and under-imaging. Rates of radiologic mismanagement did not change after interns participated in the Imaging Wisely sessions (chi2 p =0.67; 11.3%incorrect imaging pre-intervention vs. 9.5% post-intervention). Controlling for resident and attending fixed effects increased the odds of correct imaging after the intervention but remained statistically insignificant (OR=3.87 [0.77-19.4]). CONCLUSION(S): The Imaging Wisely lecture series did not lead to a statistically or clinically significant decrease in radiologic mismanagement of low back pain in the urgent care setting by the participating interns. Notably, radiologic mismanagement was attributable to equal amounts of under- and over-imaging. This suggests that curricula should not only focus on decreasing excessive image ordering but also reinforce situations in which imaging is indicated.""",Excluded
535,"The value of clinical prognostic factors for survival in patients with invasive urinary bladder cancer The aim of the study was to evaluate the value of clinical prognostic factors for survival of patients with invasive urinary bladder cancer treated with radical cystectomy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Material and methods. A total of 115 patients with invasive urinary bladder cancer were analyzed. Twenty-three patients with invasive urinary bladder cancer (pT2-T4) were treated according to the protocol of a prospective clinical study. In all the cases, transurethral resection was followed by radiation and chemotherapy. A total dose of 54-60 Gy of radiotherapy was delivered by daily fractions of 1.8-2.0 Gy each. Simultaneous chemotherapy was started on the same day as radiotherapy; gemcitabine at a dose of 175-300 mg/m2 was delivered once a week intravenously for 6 weeks. Individual patient data was analyzed in a retrospective part of the study. Radical cystectomy was performed to 46 patients with invasive urinary bladder cancer, and radiotherapy was delivered to 46 patients. Inclusion criteria for patients into a prospective or retrospective trial were equal. We evaluated a prognostic value of various clinical factors for patients treated with radical cystectomy, chemoradiation with gemcitabine, and radiation alone. Results. The 3-year overall survival in the cystectomy group was 51.1%, in the chemoradiation group 38.0%, and in the radiotherapy group 26.9% (P=0.001). In univariate analysis in the chemoradiation group, completion of treatment according to the protocol showed a significant influence on overall survival (P=0.03). In the radiation group, completion of treatment according to the protocol showed a significant influence on overall survival too (P=0.01). In the radical cystectomy group, an important factor was a complete or incomplete TUR (P=0.02). Multivariate analysis showed a significance of hydronephrosis (P=0.03) and T stage (P=0.04) in the radiation therapy group. Comorbidity was found to be an independent prognostic factors in the chemoradiation group (P=0.02). Conclusions. The best 3-year overall survival was in the radical cystectomy group. Chemoradiation with gemcitabine could be offered as an alternative to patients refusing cystectomy. Better overall survival in the chemoradiation group was for patients without comorbidities and when treatment protocol was completed.",Excluded
297,"Effects of medical diagnostic X-rays delivered at 0.01 or 0.05 mGy on human blood cells Background: Low-dose X-rays are commonly used in medical imaging to help in the diagnosis of diseases. However, the deleterious effects of exposure to medical diagnostic low-dose X-rays remain a highly debated topic. The objective was to study the effects of medical diagnostic X-rays on human blood cells. Material(s) and Method(s): We studied the effects of medical diagnostic low-dose X-rays (80 kVp), i.e.,0.01 or 0.05 mGy, after the in vitro exposure of human red blood cells (RBCs) and peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMCs).Cells with no irradiation served as the control group. The biological endpoints that were used to determine the effects of medical diagnostic low-dose X-rays were hemolysis for RBCs and mitochondrial membrane potential, lysosomes, and the cell cycle for PBMCs. Result(s): Our results showed no changes in the hemolysis of RBCs and mitochondrial membrane potential, lysosome, or cell cycle in cells exposed to these low doses of X-rays when compared to the corresponding nonirradiated cells at all harvest timepoints. Conclusion(s): These results suggested that there were no deleterious effects of diagnostic low-dose X-rays when human RBCs and PBMCs were exposed in vitro.Copyright © 2021, Ibn Sina Trust.

626,"Dose-dependent changes in renal (1)H-/(23)Na MRI after adjuvant radiochemotherapy for gastric cancer PURPOSE: Combined radiochemotherapy (RCT) for gastric cancer with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) results in ablative doses to the upper left kidney, while image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IG-IMRT) allows kidney sparing despite improved target coverage. Renal function in long-term gastric cancer survivors was evaluated with 3T functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and (23)Na imaging., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five healthy volunteers and 13 patients after radiotherapy were included: 11xIG-IMRT; 1x3D-CRT; 1x positive control"" with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) of a metastasis between the spleen/left kidney. Radiation doses were documented for the upper/middle/lower kidney subvolumes. Late toxicity was evaluated based on CTC criteria, questionnaire, and creatinine values. Morphological sequences, DWI images, and (23)Na images were acquired using a (1)H/(23)Na-tuned body-coil before/after intravenous water load (WL). Statistics for [(23)Na] (concentration) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were calculated for upper/middle/lower renal subvolumes. Corticomedullary [(23)Na] gradients and [(23)Na] differences after WL were determined., RESULTS: No major morphological alteration was detected in any patient. Minor scars were observed in the cranial subvolume of the left kidney of the 3D-CRT and the whole kidney of the control SBRT patient. All participants presented a corticomedullary [(23)Na] gradient. After WL, a significant physiological [(23)Na] gradient decrease (p < 0.001) was observed in all HV and IG-IMRT patients. In the cranial left kidney of the 3D-CRT patient and the positive control SBRT patient, the decrease was nonsignificant (p = 0.01, p = 0.02). ADC values were altered nonsignificantly in all renal subvolumes (all participants). Renal subvolumes with doses >= 35 Gy showed a reduced change of the [(23)Na] gradient after WL (p = 0.043). No participants showed clinical renal impairment., CONCLUSIONS: Functional parameters of renal (23)Na MRI after gastric IG-IMRT are identical to those of healthy volunteers, in contrast to renal subvolumes after ablative doses in the control and 3D-CRT patient. While kidney doses to the cortex below 20-25 Gy in fractional doses of ~ 1 Gy in IG-IMRT (combined with intensified chemotherapy) do not seem to cause significant MRI morphological or functional alterations, doses of > 35 Gy in 1.5-2 Gy fractions clearly result in impairment.""",Excluded

We have used for the first time a 308-nm monochromatic excimer light, a new kind of xenon-chloride lamp, in the treatment of patch stage IA MF. We treated 7 patch lesions in 4 patients with unequivocal clinicopathologic diagnosis of MF. All lesions achieved clinical and histologic complete remission. The number of weekly sessions varied from 4 to 11 (mean 6. 5; median 5.5). The total UVB 308-nm irradiation dose ranged from 5 to 9.3 J/cm2 (mean 7.1 J/cm2; median 7 J/cm2). All lesions remained in stable complete remission after a follow-up of 3 to 28 months. No remarkable side effects were reported. Our preliminary results suggest that monochromatic excimer light phototherapy is a possibly very useful treatment modality in patch stage IA MF.",Excluded
1142,"Nitric oxide treatment attenuates muscle atrophy during hind limb suspension in mice Debilitating muscle-disuse atrophy in aging or obesity has huge socioeconomic impact. Since nitric oxide (NO) mediates muscle satellite cell activation and induces hypertrophy with exercise in old mice, we tested whether treatment with the NO donor, isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN), during hind limb suspension would reduce atrophy. Mice were suspended 18 days, with or without daily ISDN (66 mg/kg). Muscles were examined for atrophy (weight, fiber diameter); regulatory changes in atrogin-1 (a negative regulator of muscle mass), myostatin (inhibits myogenesis), and satellite cell proliferation; and metabolic responses in myosin heavy chains (MyHCs), liver lipid, and hypothalamic gene expression. Suspension decreased muscle weight and weight relative to body weight between 25-55%, and gastrocnemius fiber diameter vs. controls. In young-adult mice, ISDN attenuated atrophy by half or more. In quadriceps, ISDN completely prevented the suspension-induced rise in atrogin-1 and drop in myostatin precursor, and attenuated the changes in MyHCs 1 and 2b observed in unloaded muscles without treatment. Fatty liver in suspended young-adult mice was also reduced by ISDN; suspended young mice had higher hypothalamic expression of the orexigenic agouti-related protein, Agrp than controls. Notably, a suspension-induced drop in muscle satellite cell proliferation by 25-58% was completely prevented (young mice) or attenuated (halved, in young-adult mice) by ISDN. NO-donor treatment has potential to attenuate atrophy and metabolic changes, and prevent regulatory changes during disuse and offset/prevent wasting in age-related sarcopenia or space travel. Increases in precursor proliferation resulting from NO treatment would also amplify benefits of physical therapy and exercise.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
413,"Soft-tissue allografts terminally sterilized with an electron beam are biomechanically equivalent to aseptic, nonsterilized tendons BACKGROUND: Allograft safety is contingent on effective sterilization. However, current sterilization methods have been associated with decreased biomechanical strength and higher failure rates of soft-tissue allografts. In this study, electron beam (e-beam) sterilization was explored as an alternative sterilization method to preserve biomechanical integrity. We hypothesized that e-beam sterilization would not significantly alter the biomechanical properties of tendon allograft compared with aseptic, nonsterilized controls and gamma-irradiated grafts., METHODS: Separate sets of forty fresh-frozen tibialis tendon allografts (four from each of ten donors) and forty bisected bone-patellar tendon-bone (BTB) allografts (four from each of ten donors) were randomly assigned to four study groups. One group received a 17.1 to 21.0-kGy gamma radiation dose; two other groups were sterilized with an e-beam at either a high (17.1 to 21.0-kGy) or low (9.2 to 12.2-kGy) dose. A fourth group served as nonsterilized controls. Each graft was cyclically loaded to 200 N of tension for 2000 cycles at a frequency of 2 Hz, allowed to relax for five minutes, and then tested in tension until failure at a 100%/sec strain rate. One-way analysis of variance testing was used to identify significant differences., RESULTS: Tibialis tendons sterilized with both e-beam treatments and with gamma irradiation exhibited values for cyclic tendon elongation, maximum load, maximum displacement, stiffness, maximum stress, maximum strain, and elastic modulus that were not significantly different from those of nonsterilized controls. BTB allografts sterilized with the high e-beam dose and with gamma irradiation were not significantly different in cyclic tendon elongation, maximum load, maximum displacement, stiffness, maximum stress, maximum strain, and elastic modulus from nonsterilized controls. BTB allografts sterilized with the e-beam at the lower dose were significantly less stiff than nonsterilized controls (p = 0.014) but did not differ from controls in any other properties. The difference in stiffness likely resulted from variations in tendon size rather than the treatments, as the elastic moduli of the groups were similar., CONCLUSIONS: The biomechanical properties of tibialis and BTB allografts sterilized with use of an e-beam at a dose range of 17.1 to 21.0 kGy were not different from those of aseptic, nonsterilized controls or gamma-irradiated allografts., CLINICAL RELEVANCE: E-beam sterilization can be a viable method to produce safe and biomechanically uncompromised soft-tissue allografts.

810,"MR-guided breast radiotherapy: feasibility and magnetic-field impact on skin dose The UMC Utrecht MRI/linac (MRL) design provides image guidance with high soft-tissue contrast, directly during radiotherapy (RT). Breast cancer patients are a potential group to benefit from better guidance in the MRL. However, due to the electron return effect, the skin dose can be increased in presence of a magnetic field. Since large skin areas are generally involved in breast RT, the purpose of this study is to investigate the effects on the skin dose, for whole-breast irradiation (WBI) and accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI). In ten patients with early-stage breast cancer, targets and organs at risk (OARs) were delineated on postoperative CT scans co-registered with MRI. The OARs included the skin, comprising the first 5 mm of ipsilateral-breast tissue, plus extensions. Three intensity-modulated RT techniques were considered (2x WBI, 1x APBI). Individual beam geometries were used for all patients. Specially developed MRL treatment-planning software was used. Acceptable plans were generated for 0 T, 0.35 T and 1.5 T, using a class solution. The skin dose was augmented in WBI in the presence of a magnetic field, which is a potential drawback, whereas in APBI the induced effects were negligible. This opens possibilities for developing MR-guided partial-breast treatments in the MRL.",Excluded

The responders, 603 of the former and 132 of the latter, completed a questionnaire covering practitioner demographics, pattern of practice, the use of radiographic techniques and the optimization of dose. Chi-squared tests were used to compare groups at the P=0.05 level of significance. For nonparametric data, the Mann-Whitney U-test was employed. Results A response rate of 73% was achieved. Overall, 79.5% of endodontic specialists used film holders compared with 65.9% of GDPs (P=0.001). One hundred and thirty (98.5%) endodontists and 581 (96.3%) GDPs reported that they were well prepared or adequately prepared in radiographically assessing the presence of apical pathosis. The study found significant differences (P<0.001) between the use of digital radiography by specialist endodontists 93 (70.5%) compared with general dental practitioners 167 (27.7%). Significant differences (P=0.004) were also observed in the use of rectangular collimation between endodontic specialists 55 (42%) and GDPs 223 (37%). With regard to the use of film holders in diagnostic radiography, 105 (79.5%) of endodontic specialists employed these devices compared with 396 (65.7%) GDPs; this finding was significant (P=0.005).

680,"Cellular response to an antisense-mediated shift of Bcl-x pre-mRNA splicing and antineoplastic agents Overexpression of Bcl-xL, an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, negatively correlates with the sensitivity of various cancers to chemotherapeutic agents. We show here that high levels of expression of Bcl-xL promoted apoptosis of cells treated with an antisense oligonucleotide (5'Bcl-x AS) that shifts the splicing pattern of Bcl-x pre-mRNA from the anti-apoptotic variant, Bcl-xL, to the pro-apoptotic variant, Bcl-xS. This surprising finding illustrates the advantage of antisense-induced modulation of alternative splicing versus down-regulation of targeted genes. It also suggests a specificity of the oligonucleotide effects since non-cancerous cells with low levels of Bcl-xL should resist the treatment. 5'Bcl-x AS sensitized cells to several antineoplastic agents and radiation and was effective in promoting apoptosis of MCF-7/ADR cells, a breast cancer cell line resistant to doxorubicin via overexpression of the mdr1 gene. Efficacy of 5'Bcl-x AS combined with chemotherapeutic agents in the PC3 prostate cancer cell line may be translated to clinical prostate cancer since recurrent prostate cancer tissue samples expressed higher levels of Bcl-xL than benign prostate tissue. Treatment with 5'Bcl-x AS may enhance the efficacy of standard anti-cancer regimens and should be explored, especially in recurrent prostate cancer.",Excluded
852,"Stricture of the proximal esophagus in head and neck carcinoma patients after radiotherapy BACKGROUND. It is well recognized that many patients with head and neck carcinoma have problems with food intake and malnutrition. The objective of the current study was to determine the clinical pattern of patients with nonneoplastic stricture of the upper esophagus after radiotherapy for head and neck carcinoma. METHODS. A retrospective chart study of 22 patients with stricture of the proximal esophagus diagnosed between 1993 and 1999 at Karolinska Hospital was performed. The dose volume histograms of the first 2 cm and 5 cm, respectively, of the proximal esophagus were calculated. RESULTS. Five of the patients (23%) had total obliteration. The first 2 cm of the esophagus received at least 60 grays (Gy) in > 80% of the volume. Radiation injury was not reported to occur at doses < 60 Gy. There was a correlation found between dysphagia during radiotherapy and the development of proximal esophageal stricture. Stricture was diagnosed 1-60 months (median, 6 months) after radiotherapy. In 18 patients, the stricture was treated with single or repeated endoscopic dilation. These treatments allowed a nearly normal diet in 78% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS. Stricture of the upper esophagus is one deglutition disorder that is reported to occur after radiotherapy for head and neck carcinoma. In the current study, the authors emphasize the importance of knowing the tolerance of the normal esophagus to irradiation as well as early diagnosis of stricture of the proximal esophagus because this condition may lead to physical and emotional distress. © 2003 American Cancer Society.",Excluded
6,"Image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy for patients with locally advanced gastric cancer: a clinical feasibility study BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the medical and technical feasibility of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in high-risk nonmetastatic gastric cancer stage II and III after primary gastrectomy and D2 lymphadenectomy., METHODS AND MATERIALS: A prospective nonrandomized phase II trial was performed on 25 consecutive patients with gastric cancer with high risk (T3-4, N1-3, G2-3, R0-1). The dose delivered was 45 Gy (1.80 Gy per fraction) in IMRT technique. Concurrent 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy at 225 mg/m(2) was administered as a continuous intravenous infusion. Primary endpoints were acute gastrointestinal toxicity (CTC 4.0) and technical feasibility of IMRT in regard to dose planning and radiation delivery., RESULTS: Early acute events were defined as clinical and chemical adverse effects of IMRT and concurrent chemotherapy during treatment. By definition, 90 days after the end of IMRT has been evaluated as acute-phase toxicity. No patient had grade 4 or higher acute adverse events. Clinical grade 3 toxicity occurred in two patients (8%) with diarrhea and in one case (4%) with nausea. Hematological changes with grade 3 occurred in three cases (12%) with hemoglobin decrease, in five cases (25%) as leukopenia, and in one case (4%) with thrombocytopenia. The mean dose for liver was 16 Gy and the percentage volume exceeding 30 Gy (V30) was 21%. Mean dose for right and left kidney was 9 and 13 Gy, respectively, and V20 was 9% and 13%, respectively. Heart received a median dose of 15 Gy and V40 was 17%. The mean dose to the bowel was 11 Gy and V40 was 6%. Spinal cord had at maximum 33 Gy in median. Specifics of dose distribution, including the coverage, for the target region were as follows: minimum was 33 Gy, maximum 48.6 Gy, and mean dose 44.6 Gy. The prescribed dose (45 Gy) covered 99% and 95% of planning target volume (OTV) in 66% and 92% of cases, respectively. Median PTV was 15.77 ml (range, 805-3,604 ml)., CONCLUSIONS: The data support the practical feasibility of IMRT in adjuvant treatment in high-risk gastric cancer in the postoperative setting as a proof of principle. Acute toxicity has been tolerable.",Excluded

As of 2005, all patients received validated questionnaires (i.e., the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer [EORTC] QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ Head and Neck Cancer Module (H&N35), Performance Status Scale): before treatment; at the start of RT treatment; after 46 Gy; at the end of RT treatment; and 2, 4, and 6 weeks and 3, 6, 12, and 18 months after follow-up., RESULTS: On all QoL items, better scores were obtained in patients treated with hyperbaric oxygen. The difference between HBOT vs. non-HBOT was significant for all parameters: EORTC H&N35 Swallowing (p = 0.011), EORTC H&N35 Dry Mouth (p = 0.009), EORTC H&N35, Sticky Saliva (p = 0.01), PSS Eating in Public (p = 0.027), and Pain in Mouth (visual analogue scale; p < 0.0001)., CONCLUSIONS: Patients randomized for receiving hyperbaric oxygen after the RT had better QoL scores for swallowing, sticky saliva, xerostomia, and pain in mouth.",Excluded

Two hundred and sixty two (31.8%) of the diabetics had shoulder calcification compared with 33 (10.3%) of the control group, with a preponderant localisation in the right shoulder. Diabetes of long duration treated with insulin for a long time was associated with a larger percentage of shoulder calcifications. These data and previous laboratory findings suggest a possible pathogenetic correlation between the prevalence of calcific shoulder tendinitis and diabetes.",Excluded
879,"Radiation exposure in total ankle replacement BACKGROUND: Radiation exposure from diagnostic imaging procedures is associated with increased cancer risk. No published data currently exist regarding ionizing radiation exposure in total ankle replacement surgery. This study quantified intraoperative fluoroscopic dose and duration during ankle replacement surgery and examined patient and technical factors affecting the level of exposure., METHODS: Fifty-five patients underwent ankle replacement using STAR, Salto-Talaris, or INBONE total ankles. Intraoperative fluoroscopic dose and duration, patient demographics, implant design, and accompanying additional procedures were documented for each case. The relationship between each relevant variable and radiation dose and time was determined., RESULTS: The mean fluoroscopic dose and duration for all cases were 1.15 +/- 0.84 milliGray per case and 77 +/- 34 seconds per case, respectively. There was a positive correlation between the absorbed radiation dose and the duration of fluoroscopy (r = .50, P < .001). The mean fluoroscopic doses were 1.53 milliGray, 0.99 milliGray, and 0.88 milliGray for INBONE, STAR, and Salto-Talaris prostheses, respectively. Fluoroscopic dose was significantly influenced by implant design (P = .035), with implants using an intramedullary referencing guide associated with higher radiation doses. After excluding cases requiring additional procedures, the fluoroscopic time and radiation dose associated with intramedullary referencing guide implants continued to exceed those of the other implants, but the differences were no longer statistically significant (P = .22, P = .09, respectively)., CONCLUSION: The average patient radiation dose during total ankle replacement was approximately one-fifth the recommended maximum yearly radiation exposure. The radiation dose was positively associated with fluoroscopy duration. Among factors controllable by the surgeon, selection of an implant with an extramedullary alignment system and conscious effort to minimize duration of fluoroscopy can reduce harmful radiation exposure and decrease cancer risk in total ankle replacement patients and associated operating room personnel., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, comparative series.

124,"Accuracy of 128-slice dual-source CT using high-pitch spiral mode for the assessment of coronary stents: First in vivo experience Objective: To investigate the accuracy of 128-slice dual-source CT using high-pitch spiral mode (HPS) for the assessment of coronary stents. Method(s): We conducted a prospective study on patients with previous stent implantation due to recurred suspicious symptoms of angina with positive findings at stress testing scheduled for coronary angiography (CA), while dual source computed tomography (DSCT) examinations were randomly done by one of the three different scan modes [HPS, sequential mode (SEQ), low-pitch spiral mode (LPS)] one week before CA examinations. The image quality, radiation dose and stent patency of DSCT were evaluated blinded to the results of CA. Result(s): 180 patients with total 256 stents were enrolled in this study. There was no significant difference on the image quality of DSCT by HPS (1.4 +/- 0.5), SEQ (1.5 +/- 0.5) and LPS (1.3 +/- 0.6) (P > 0.05). The noise of images reconstructed with B26f kernel in HPS is significantly increased than in SEQ/LPS (P < 0.05), while no significant difference with images reconstructed with B46f kernel (P > 0.05). Heart rate (HR) variability had a slight impact on the image quality for HPS (P < 0.05), not for LPS/SEQ (P > 0.05). In the assessment of stent restenosis compared with CA on per-stent basis, there was no significant difference on sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of DSCT using HPS (100%, 97.1%, 83.3%, 100%), LPS (92.3%, 95.9%, 80%, 98.6%) and SEQ (93.3%, 97.3%, 87.5%, 98.6%) (P > 0.05). The effective dose of DSCT by HPS (1.0 +/- 0.5 mSv) is significant less than that by SEQ (3.0 +/- 1.4 mSv) or LPS (13.0 +/- 5.4 mSv) (P < 0.01). Conclusion(s): DSCT using HPS provides good diagnostic accuracy on coronary stent patency compared with CA, similar to that by SEQ/LPS, whereas with lower effective dose in patients with HR lower than 65 bpm. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

704,"First analysis of cancer incidence and occupational radiation exposure based on the National Dose Registry of Canada A cohort study was conducted to investigate the relation between cancer incidence and occupational exposure to ionizing radiation. Records containing dose information from 1951 to 1988 for 191,333 persons were extracted from the National Dose Registry of Canada. The records were linked to the Canadian Cancer Data Base, with incidence data from 1969 to 1988. Standardized incidence ratios were calculated using Canadian cancer incidence rates stratified by age, sex, and calendar year. Excess relative risks were obtained from internally based dose-response analyses. The following significant results were found for males and females combined: a deficit in the standardized incidence ratio for all cancers combined; elevated standardized incidence ratios for thyroid cancer and melanoma; and elevated excess relative risks for rectum, leukemia, lung, all cancers combined, all except lung, and all except leukemia. For males, cancers of the colon, pancreas, and testis also showed significantly elevated excess relative risks. The specific cancer types listed above have been implicated in previous studies on occupational exposure to ionizing radiation, except for testis, colon, and melanoma, while the findings on thyroid cancer from previous studies are inconclusive. The thyroid standardized incidence ratios in this study are highly significant, but further investigation is needed to assess the possibility of association with occupational radiation exposure.",Included
405,"Efficacy of sucralfate ointment in the prevention of acute proctitis in cancer patients: A randomized controlled clinical trial Background: Acute radiation proctitis (ARP) is a usual adverse effect in patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy. The symptoms include diarrhea, rectal blood or mucus discharge, fecal urgency and tenesmus with pain. Sucralfate, an aluminum-based salt of sucrose octasulfate, is a cytoprotective agent that forms a coating barrier at injured sites by adhering to mucoproteins. It has been used in topical management of a wide variety of local lesion. This study was designed to evaluate the preventive effect of rectal sucralfate on acute radiotherapy induced proctitis. Method(s): Seven percent sucralfate ointment was prepared for topical use. Drug quantification, chemical stability and microbial limit tests were performed carefully. In this randomized double blind placebo controlled trial, fifty-seven patients with pelvic malignancies undergoing radiotherapy were allocated to receive either 1 g of sucralfate or 1 g of placebo, given as a twice daily ointment, one day before and during radiotherapy for six weeks. The eligible patients were evaluated based on RTOG acute toxicity criteria and the following ARP symptoms weekly: Rectal hemorrhage, diarrhea, rectal pain, and fecal urgency. The influence of symptoms on lifestyle was also recorded weekly. Result(s): Acute proctitis was significantly less prevalent in patients in the sucralfate group. The incidence of rectal bleeding (P=0.003), diarrhea (P=0.002), rectal pain (P=<0.001) and fecal urgency (P=0.002) was significantly less common in the sucralfate group. No statistical significant difference was observed for radiotherapy induced cystitis in the placebo and sucralfate groups (P=0.27). Conclusion(s): This study suggests that sucralfate7% ointment reduces the incidence of symptoms associated with acute radiation proctitis.Copyright © 2020, Babol University of Medical Sciences.",Excluded

740,"Serum cystatin C and risk of hip and nonvertebral fractures in older men Serum cystatin C is a biomarker of renal function; higher levels indicate poorer function. Previous studies have reported an increased risk of hip fracture among postmenopausal women with higher cystatin C, but there is a paucity of data in men and it is uncertain whether the association persists after adjustment for BMD. To test the hypothesis that older community-dwelling men with higher cystatin C are at increased risk of fracture, we conducted a case-cohort analysis in MrOS, a prospective study of 5994 men aged 65 years and older. We measured serum cystatin C in baseline serum specimens from all 435 men who experienced any non-vertebral fracture from baseline until February 2007 (average follow-up 4.7 years), all 168 men with first hip fracture from baseline until August 2010 (average follow-up 7.6 years), and a sample of 1602 men randomly selected from the cohort. Cystatin C was measured using a particle-enhanced immunonepholometric assay (inter- and intra-assay CV 3.1% and 2.8%, respectively). Fractures were confirmed with x-ray reports. Modified proportional hazards models were used to estimate the relative hazards (RH) of fracture in men across quartiles of cystatin C (cutpoints 0.80, 0.90, 1.03 mg/L). In a model adjusted for age, race, site and body mass index, higher cystatin C was not related to risk of nonvertebral fracture (p-trend 0.88), but was associated with an increased risk of hip fracture (RH (95% CI): 1.0 [Q1, referent group]; 0.9 (0.5-1.7) [Q2]; 1.1 (0.6-1.9) [Q3]; and 1.6 (0.9-2.8) [Q4]; p-trend 0.04). The majority of the effect of cystatin C on hip fracture was observed among men in Q4 who had a 1.6-fold (95% CI 1.1-2.3) increase in risk compared with men in Q1-3 (Table). Adding potential confounders (including fall history, prior fracture, prevalent cardiovascular disease, frailty status and total hip BMD) one at a time to the base model modestly attenuated the association, with frailty status having the greatest impact. After simultaneous adjustment for multiple confounders, the association no longer reached significance (RH (95% CI) Q4 versus Q1-3: 1.3 (0.9-1.9)). In conclusion, older men with higher serum cystatin C are at increased risk of hip (but not any nonvertebral) fracture. The association between cystatin C and hip fracture is due at least in part to the greater prevalence of frailty among men with higher cystatin C levels.",Excluded
212,"Detection of coronary artery stenoses by low-dose, prospectively ECG-triggered, high-pitch spiral coronary CT angiography Objectives: We sought to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a new prospectively electrocardiogram (ECG)-triggered high-pitch scan mode for coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA), which allows an effective dose of less than 1 mSv. Background(s): Coronary CTA provides increasingly reliable image quality, but the associated radiation exposure can be high. Method(s): Seventy-five patients with suspected coronary artery disease and in sinus rhythm were screened for participation. After exclusion of 25 patients for body weight >100 kg or failure to lower heart rate to <=60 beats/min, 50 patients were studied by prospectively ECG-triggered high-pitch spiral computed tomography (CT). Coronary CTA was performed using a dual-source CT system with 2 x 128 x 0.6-mm collimation, 0.28-s rotation time, a pitch of 3.4, 100-kVp tube voltage, and current of 320 mA. Data acquisition was prospectively triggered at 60% of the R-R interval and completed within 1 cardiac cycle. Diagnostic accuracy for detection of coronary artery stenoses <50% diameter stenosis was determined by comparison to invasive coronary angiography. Per-patient diagnostic performance was the primary form of analysis. Result(s): In all 50 patients (34 males, 59 +/- 12 years of age), imaging was successful. For the detection of 16 patients with at least 1 coronary artery stenosis, CT demonstrated a sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 79% to 100%) and specificity of 82% (95% CI: 65% to 93%). The positive predictive value was 72% (95% CI: 49% to 89%) and the negative predictive value was 100% (95% CI: 87% to 100%). Sensitivity was 100% (95% CI: 88% to 100%) and specificity was 94% (95% CI: 89% to 97%) on a per-vessel basis. Per-segment sensitivity was 92% (95% CI: 80% to 97%), and specificity was 98% (95% CI: 96% to 98%). Mean dose-length product for coronary CTA was 54 +/- 6 mGy . cm, the effective dose was 0.76 +/- 0.08 mSv (0.64 to 0.95 mSv).

Twelve of 23 patients had surgery as definitive treatment and the tumor recurred locally in all; seven of these 12 patients were subsequently salvaged by further surgery plus postoperative radiotherapy or by radiotherapy alone, with 58% ultimate local control. The remaining three patients had unresectable tumors at diagnosis and received radiation alone, with a local tumor control rate of 33%.

262,"Oxygen consumption during walking and running under fractional weight bearing conditions INTRODUCTION: Knowledge of changes in oxygen consumption during reduced body weight loading at different speed levels is important, in particular in astronauts who may lose aerobic fitness as well as in clinical patients (e.g., in obese individuals at walking speeds or in injured athletes at running speeds). Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze oxygen consumption during unloaded walking and running., METHODS: Oxygen consumption (Vo2), heart rate (HR), and Borg rating of perceived exertion (Borg RPE) were quantified in 10 healthy young female and male volunteers at 3 body weight (BW) conditions (100%, 66%, and 33% BW) and 4 treadmill speeds (slow walking at 0.4 m x s(-1), comfortable walking at 1.3 m x s(-1), slow running at 2.2 m x s(-1), and moderately fast running at 3.1 m x s(-1)). Unloading was achieved in a waist-high chamber with increased pressure called Lower Body Positive Pressure (LBPP)., RESULTS: All parameters (Vo2, HR, and Borg RPE) decreased during unloaded walking and running. Interestingly, our findings confirm a specific linear relationship between each parameter and treadmill speed for each BW condition with smaller slope angles at higher levels of unloading (e.g., for Vo2, the slope angle decreased from 11.9 at 100% BW to 4.4 at 33% BW)., DISCUSSION: Oxygen consumption, heart rate, and Borg rating of perceived exertion are reduced during unloaded exercise with a relatively greater decline at higher treadmill speeds. That is, the higher the treadmill's speed in unloaded conditions, the relatively easier"" it is to exercise.""",Excluded
360,"Factors associated with presence and extent of coronary calcium in those predicted to be at low risk according to Framingham risk score (from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) Even among asymptomatic persons at low risk (<10%) according to the Framingham risk score, high coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores signify a greater predicted risk of coronary heart disease events. We sought to determine the noninvasive factors (without radiation exposure) significantly associated with CAC in low-risk, asymptomatic persons. In a cross-sectional analysis, we studied 3,046 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis at a low 10-year predicted risk (Framingham risk score <10%) of coronary heart disease events. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association of novel markers with the presence of any CAC (CAC >0) and advanced CAC (CAC >= 300). A CAC level of >0 and of >= 300 was present in 30% and 3.5% of participants, respectively. Factor VIIIc, fibrinogen, and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule were each associated with the presence of CAC (p <= 0.02), and C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and the carotid intima-media thickness with advanced CAC (p <= 0.03). The base model combining the traditional risk factors had excellent discrimination for advanced CAC (C-statistic 0.808). The addition of the 2 best-fit models combining the biomarkers with or without carotid intima-media thickness improved the c-statistic to 0.822 and 0.820, respectively. All 3 models calibrated well but were similar in estimating the individual risk probabilities for advanced CAC (prevalence 9.97%, 10.63%, and 10.10% in the greatest quartiles of predicted probabilities vs 0.26%, 0.26%, and 0.26% in the lowest quartiles, respectively). In conclusion, in low-risk persons, the traditional risk factors alone predicted advanced CAC with high discrimination and calibration. The biomarker combinations with and without carotid intima-media thickness were also significantly associated with advanced CAC; however, the improvement in the prediction and estimation of the clinical risk were modest compared to the traditional risk factors alone.

381,"Molecular model T6: C60 bulk-heterojunction solar cells Organic photovoltaic devices offer a large technological potential as a renewable source of electrical energy because of their low cost and ease of processing. For the last few years, the interest in such devices has grown rapidly, allowing multiplication of the solar conversion efficiency by 5 within about 10 years. The highest conversion efficiency obtained is now close to 5% with a spin-coated polythiophene-fullerene blend. For a better understanding of those polymer blend systems, we have fabricated a coevaporated solar cell from model molecules. The molecular blend was composed of sexithiophene (, -dihexylsexithiophene, T6) as a donor and fullerene C60 as an acceptor. The influence of the T6: C60 proportion was studied for an active layer of 100 nm thickness. The conversion efficiency obtained with the optimal proportion of T6: C60 (40-60) is 0.7%. Reverse bias annealing effect was studied by measuring the current-voltage characteristics after each postprocessing step. The conversion efficiency reached 1% but still remained much less than for the polymer bulk heterojunction. This major difference may come from the spontaneous phase separation which takes place in polymers to form an interpenetrated network. 2006 American Vacuum Society.",Excluded

This trial aimed to investigate whether sodium alginate has preventative effects on esophagitis in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Method(s): Patients with untreated stage III NSCLC who were eligible for concurrent CRT were randomly assigned at a 1:1:1 ratio to receive one of the following treatments: initial or late use of oral sodium alginate (arms A and B) or water as control (arm C). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients developing G3 or worse esophagitis. Result(s): Overall, 94 patients were randomly assigned between February 2014 and September 2018. The study was prematurely terminated because of slow accrual. The proportions of patients with G3 or worse esophagitis were 12.5%, 9.8%, and 19.4% in arms A, B, and C, respectively. Patients receiving sodium alginate had fewer onsets of G3 esophagitis; however, differences compared with arm C were not significant (A vs. C: p = 0.46; B vs. C: p = 0.28). The rates of grade 3 or worse non-hematologic toxicities besides esophagitis were 29%, 26%, and 43% in arms A, B, and C, respectively. Interestingly, compared with arm C, a low rate of febrile neutropenia was observed in arm A (3.1% vs. 19.4%: p = 0.04).

924,"UV dose determines key characteristics of nonmelanoma skin cancer Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), known as nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC), are the most common cancers worldwide. Although many factors are involved in the pathogenesis of NMSC, UV radiation is an important risk factor. A fundamental question in skin cancer research is whether varying doses of total UV radiation influence key characteristics of NMSC. The hypothesis that differences in UV doses influence the BCC/ SCC ratio, number of tumors, and anatomic location of the tumor was investigated in 311 participants having 326 tumors and with exposure to a broad range of UV doses. An epidemiologic questionnaire was given to each participant soliciting detailed information on exposure to solar radiation. Environmental UVA and UVB doses were measured continually for 6 years at a permanent UV monitoring station. The total ratio of BCC/SCC was 3.5. Participants who received low and high UV doses had a BCC/SCC ratio of 4.2. Those who received very high UV doses had a ratio of 2.1. A very high UV dose was also associated with the doubling of the total number of tumors per person and a significantly increased risk of having SCC, a more aggressive malignancy. Tumors in sun-exposed areas (on the body) were more common in participants who received high and very high UV doses. The tumors in sun-protected areas were associated with exposure to lower levels of UV. This large-scale population study provides evidence that varying doses of UV radiation have a profound influence on key characteristics of NMSC.",Excluded

After a long experience with the Dynesys in treatment of degenerative instability of lumbar spine authors report their experience and preliminary results of a new hybrid system of dynamic stabilization and fusion which has two solutions with a single online system, the Dynesys system to Optima (DTO Zimmer Spine). Material(s) and Method(s): At the Department of Orthopedic A.S.U.S. Giovanni Battista Molinette of Turin since 3-2008 to 12-2009 17 patients with lumbosacral degenerative pathology were surgically treated, 7 males, 10 females, mean age 51 (35-69). All complained of low back pain (VAS 8) with radicular pain in 9 (VAS 7) and claudicazio in 8, ODI 53 %, in 9 patients imaging showed instability in adjacent segments of lumbar stenosis, in 6 junctional dynamic stenosis results of instrumented L4-L5 fusion, one case with 2degree grade L5-S1 isthmic spondylolisthesis had degenerative changes at higher levels, one case of pseudoarthrosis in fusion of L5-S1 isthmic spondylolisthesis had junctional instability. Dynamic synthesis has always included a single proximal segment of the instrumented fusion area which extended distally in S1 in 15 cases, in L5 in 2 cases (L5 sacralised). In 11 cases direct decompression was performed within the stenosis area (3 revisions of previous decompression), in 6 cases with functional stenosis indirect decompression was performed by disc-ligament tension with Dynesys. All patients have worn a lumbar corset for 2 months. One case needed revision surgery for a misplaced screw after 7 days. Result(s): For an average f. up 32 months (43-12), back pain almost improved in all patients a VAS 3 (2-6), 12 % ODI. The neurological impairment resolved in all patients (VAS 1). Patients with spondylolisthesis concerned of pain in the iliac crest donor side and higher back pain for insufficient proximal extension of the dynamic synthesis. Good fusion was observed on the X-ray in all cases of the instrumented area, we have not seen any hardware failure nor pedicular screws mobilisation or periprosthetic osteolysis and junctional disorders. Conclusion(s): The experience is short and requires a longer f. up but good clinical results encourage the application of the system in selected cases, often in young adults. This hybrid synthesis does not lengthen the operative time for ease assembly and provides the benefits of limiting the extent of fusion which is coupled to a dynamic system of proven efficacy on adjacent levels reducing the probability of occurrence of future junctional diseases.",Excluded

Method(s): We obtained patient demographics and weights of 54 consecutive patients with lymphoma who each underwent a18F-FDG PET study. The administered activity was converted into an effective dose using the patient size dependent dosimetry data provided in ICRP Publication 80. Patient effective doses were converted into estimates of the lifetime attributable risk of cancer incidence and cancer mortality using age and sex dependent risk factors provided in BEIR VII. Result(s): The average patient age/weight in this study was 43 years/68 kg for males and 33 years/61 kg for females. Patient effective dose are proportional to patient weight(-0.784) (r2 >0.99). The average administered activity was 410 MBq, which resulted in an average effective dose of 8.5 mSv for males and 8.9 mSv for females. The average cancer incidence was 0.71/1,000 cases for males, and 1.27/1,000 cases for females, with cancer mortality being about half the incidence. Cancer rates for the youngest patients were an order of magnitude higher than those for the oldest patients. Conclusion(s): Average lifetime attributable cancer risks to lymphoma patients from a single FDG-PET study is approximately 1 per 1,000, but are strongly influenced by patient age, gender and weight. Cancer risk in younger patients is a magnitude of order greater.",Excluded
949,"A new diagnosis standard for enterovesical fistula in crohn's disease by intracavitary contrast-enhanced ultrasound Enterovesical fistula is a relatively rare condition complicating Crohn's disease (CD), often requiring surgical treatment [1]. Ascertaining the presence of fistula and visualization of its anatomy are important for undertaking a decision for surgery and may impact the operative strategy. However, conventional x-ray studies often fail to demonstrate the fistula tract. Ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging have a high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of intra-abdominal fistulas, with similar diagnostic accuracies [2]. However, these methods may still fall short of detection of occult and complex fistulas and/or delineating their tracts. Intra-cavitary contrast-enhanced ultrasound (IC-CEUS) was recently proved useful for detecting biliary tract and perianal fistula by locally-injected contrast agent [3-4]. Compared with CT and MR, IC-CEUS has the advantages of non-ionizing radiation and cost-efficacy.

617,"The generation of vibrotactile patterns on a linear array: influences of body site, time, and presentation mode In order to provide information regarding orientation or direction, a convenient code employs vectors (lines) because they have both length and direction. Potential users of such information, encoded tactually, could include persons who are blind, as well as pilots, astronauts, and scuba divers, all of whom need to maintain spatial awareness in their respective unusual environments. In these situations, a tactile display can enhance environmental awareness. In this study, optimal parameters were explored for lines presented dynamically to the skin with vibrotactile arrays on three body sites, with veridical and saltatory presentation modes. Perceived length, straightness, spatial distribution, and smoothness were judged while the durations of the discrete taps making up the drawn"" dotted lines and the times between them were varied. The results indicate that the two modes produce equivalent sensations and that similar sets of timing parameters, within the ranges tested, result in ""good"" lines at each site.""",Excluded
875,"Feasibility of omitting clinical target volume for limited-disease small cell lung cancer treated with chemotherapy and intensity-modulated radiotherapy PURPOSE: To analyze the feasibility of omitting clinical target volume (CTV) for limited small cell lung cancer treated with chemotherapy and intensity modulated radiotherapy., METHODS AND MATERIALS: 89 patients were treated from January 1, 2008 to August 31, 2011, 54 cases were irradiated with target volume without CTV, and 35 cases were irradiated with CTV. Both arms were irradiated post chemotherapy tumor extent and omitted elective nodal irradiation; dose prescription was 95% PTV56-63 Gy/28-35 F/5.6-7 weeks., RESULTS: In the arm without CTV and arm with CTV, the local relapse rates were 16.7% and 17.1% (p=0.586) respectively. In the arm without CTV, of the 9 patients with local relapse, 6 recurred in-field, 2 recurred in margin, 1 recurred out of field. In the arm with CTV, of the 6 patients with local relapse, 4 recurred in-field, 1 recurred in margin, 1 recurred out of field. The distant metastases rates were 42.6% and 51.4% (p=0.274) respectively. Grade 3-4 hematological toxicity and radiation esophagitis had no statistically significant, but grade 3-4 radiation pneumonia was observed in only 7.4% in the arm without CTV, compared 22.9% in the arm with CTV (p=0.040). The median survival in the arm without CTV had not reached, compared with 38 months in the with CTV arm. The l- years, 2- years, 3- years survival rates of the arm without CTV and the arm with CTV were 81.0%, 66.2%, 61.5% and 88.6%, 61.7%, 56.6% (p=0.517). The multivariate analysis indicated that the distant metastases (p=0.000) and PCI factor (p=0.004) were significantly related to overall survival., CONCLUSIONS: Target delineation omitting CTV for limited-disease small cell lung cancer received IMRT was feasible. The distant metastases and PCI factor were significantly related to overall survival.",Excluded
816,"Impact of age on the selection of nuclear cardiology stress protocols: The INCAPS (IAEA nuclear cardiology protocols) study BACKGROUND: There is growing concern about radiation exposure from nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI), particularly among younger patients who are more prone to develop untoward effects of ionizing radiation, and hence US and European professional society guidelines recommend age as a consideration in weighing radiation risk from MPI. We aimed to determine how patient radiation doses from MPI vary across age groups in a large contemporary international cohort. METHODS: Data were collected as part of a global cross-sectional study of centers performing MPI coordinated by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Sites provided information on each MPI study completed during a single week in March-April 2013. We compared across age groups laboratory adherence to pre-specified radiation-related best practices, radiation effective dose (ED; a whole-body measure reflecting the amount of radiation to each organ and its relative sensitivity to radiation's deleterious effects), and the proportion of patients with ED<=9mSv, a target level specified in guidelines. RESULTS: Among 7911 patients undergoing MPI in 308 laboratories in 65 countries, mean ED was 10.0+/-4.5mSv with slightly higher exposure among younger age groups (trend p value<0.001). There was no difference in the proportion of patients with ED<=9mSv across age groups, or in adherence to best practices based on the median age of patients in a laboratory. CONCLUSIONS: In contemporary nuclear cardiology practice, the age of the patient appears not to impact protocol selection and radiation dose, contrary to professional society guidelines.",Excluded
1067,"Environmental radioactivity and high incidence rates of stomach and esophagus cancer in the Van Lake Region: A causal relationship? This study examined the incidence rates of cancer cases (averages for 2006-2010) and relationships with environmental radioactivity levels. Soil and water samples were collected from provincial and district centers of Van city and the outdoor gamma doses were determined using a portable gamma scintillation detector. Gross alpha and beta, (226)Ra, (232)Th, and (40)K activities were measured in both tap water and soil samples. Although high rates of stomach and esophagus cancers have been reported previously in Van the underlying reasons have not hitherto been defined. Incidences of cancers were highest in the Gurpinar (326.0) and Ozalp (377.1) counties (p<0.001). As to the results of the gross alpha and gross beta radioactivity measurements in the drinking water, these two counties also had high beta radionuclide levels: Gurpinar (140 mBq/dm3) and Ozalp (206 mBq/dm3). Even if within the normal range, a relation between the higher rate of the incidence of stomach and esophagus cancers with that of the higher rate of beta radionuclide activity was clear. On Spearman correlation analysis, the relation between higher beta radionuclide levels and cancer incidence was found to be statistically significant (p<0.01). According to the results of the analysis, Van residents receive an average 1.86 mSv/y annual dose from outdoor gamma radiation, ingestion of radionuclides in the drinking water, and indoor 222Rn activity. Moreover, gross alpha and beta activities were found to be extremely high in all of the lakes around the city of Van, Turkey. Further investigations with long-term detailed environmental radiation measurements are needed regarding the relationship between cancer cases and environmental radioactivity in the city of Van.",Excluded
236,"Radiation dose and image quality of prospective triggering with dual-source cardiac computed tomography Prospectively triggered (PT) cardiac computed tomography (CT), whereby radiation is administered only at a predefined phase of the cardiac cycle, has been shown to substantially decrease radiation dose. The aim of our study was to assess the use of this technique in a clinical population using dual-source cardiac CT. Of 312 consecutive patients referred for a dual-source cardiac computed tomographic examination, PT was used in 42 patients for whom, based on physician judgment, it was decided to minimize radiation, whereas retrospective gating was used for 188 patients (coronary artery bypass grafting and pulmonary vein studies were excluded). Kilovolt and milliampere per second were chosen for each patient based on assessment of body habitus and effective radiation dose was calculated. Analysis of nonevaluable vessels was based on clinical readings. For each study, image quality (IQ) was rated on a subjective IQ score and contrast-to-noise and signal-to-noise ratios were calculated. Of the 42 PT examinations (mean age 44.3 years, body mass index 27.8 kg/m(2), 62% men), 28 were referred for coronary evaluation, 11 for aortic disease with/without coronaries, and 3 for other reasons (i.e., suspected mass and congenital disease). Average heart rate was 64.5 beats/min. Average radiation dose of all 42 PT scans was 3.2 +/- 1.6 vs 13.4 +/- 7.8 mSv for the 188 non-PT scans. There was no significant difference in IQ score and contrast-to-noise and signal-to-noise ratios between the 2 groups. Furthermore, the incidence of limited right coronary artery evaluation and of limitations related to right coronary artery motion did not differ between PT and non-PT scans. In conclusion, in selected patients, prospective triggering with dual-source cardiac CT is feasible and results in a dramatic decrease of radiation dose without compromising IQ. Future advances in cardiac CT may further improve this technique, thus allowing for wider use.",Excluded

Alcohol-based swabs were used to obtain a sample from participants' arm at 20 minutes, and hourly from 1 to 6 hours post-application. Absorption readings were analyzed using an UV-visible spectrophotometer., RESULTS: The swabbing technique was consistently able to distinguish the sunscreen from control swabs for up to 6 hours. The absorption readings between 20 minutes and 6 hours were significantly higher than control swabs. There were no differences between the group that had sunscreen reapplied and the group that did not., CONCLUSION: The sunscreen swabbing technique is an effective noninvasive method for detecting a variety of sunscreen products in adults over a 6-hour period. No differences in absorption readings were found with sunscreen reapplication.

943,"State-of-the-art MR Imaging for Thoracic Diseases Since thoracic MR imaging was first used in a clinical setting, it has been suggested that MR imaging has limited clinical utility for thoracic diseases, especially lung diseases, in comparison with x-ray CT and positron emission tomography (PET)/CT. However, in many countries and states and for specific indications, MR imaging has recently become practicable. In addition, recently developed pulmonary MR imaging with ultra-short TE (UTE) and zero TE (ZTE) has enhanced the utility of MR imaging for thoracic diseases in routine clinical practice. Furthermore, MR imaging has been introduced as being capable of assessing pulmonary function. It should be borne in mind, however, that these applications have so far been academically and clinically used only for healthy volunteers, but not for patients with various pulmonary diseases in Japan or other countries. In 2020, the Fleischner Society published a new report, which provides consensus expert opinions regarding appropriate clinical indications of pulmonary MR imaging for not only oncologic but also pulmonary diseases. This review article presents a brief history of MR imaging for thoracic diseases regarding its technical aspects and major clinical indications in Japan 1) in terms of what is currently available, 2) promising but requiring further validation or evaluation, and 3) developments warranting research investigations in preclinical or patient studies. State-of-the-art MR imaging can non-invasively visualize lung structural and functional abnormalities without ionizing radiation and thus provide an alternative to CT. MR imaging is considered as a tool for providing unique information. Moreover, prospective, randomized, and multi-center trials should be conducted to directly compare MR imaging with conventional methods to determine whether the former has equal or superior clinical relevance. The results of these trials together with continued improvements are expected to update or modify recommendations for the use of MRI in near future.",Excluded
735,"Waiting times for radiotherapy: variation over time and between cancer networks in southeast England The aim of this study was to investigate variations in the length of time that patients with cancer wait from diagnosis to treatment with radiotherapy. A total of 57,426 men and 71,018 women diagnosed with cancer between 1992 and 2001 and receiving radiotherapy within 6 months of diagnosis were identified from the Thames Cancer Registry database. In total, 12 sites were identified for which a substantial number or proportion of patients received radiotherapy: head and neck, oesophagus, colon, rectum, lung, nonmelanoma skin cancer, breast, uterus, prostate, bladder, brain and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Median waiting times from diagnosis to radiotherapy were calculated, together with the proportion of patients who received radiotherapy within 60 days of diagnosis, and analysed by year of diagnosis, cancer site, deprivation quintile, age at diagnosis, sex and cancer network of either residence or treatment. Logistic regression was used to adjust the proportion receiving treatment within 60 days for the effects of the other factors. There were significant differences in the proportions receiving radiotherapy within 60 days between different networks and different cancer sites, which remained after adjustment. Median waiting times varied from 42 to 65 days across networks of residence, with the adjusted proportion treated within 60 days ranging from 44 to 71%. There was no difference between male and female patients after adjustment for the other factors, particularly site. There was a highly significant trend over time: the median wait increased from 45 days in 1992 to 76 days in 2001, while the adjusted proportion being treated within 60 days declined by almost a half, from 64 to 35%, over the same period.",Excluded
695,"Analysis of the relationship between tumor dose inhomogeneity and local control in patients with skull base chordoma PURPOSE: When irradiating a tumor that abuts or displaces any normal structures, the dose constraints to those structures (if lower than the prescribed dose) may cause dose inhomogeneity in the tumor volume at the tumor-critical structure interface. The low-dose region in the tumor volume may be one of the reasons for local failure. The aim of this study is to quantitate the effect of tumor dose inhomogeneity on local control and recurrence-free survival in patients with skull base chordoma., METHODS AND MATERIALS: 132 patients with skull base chordoma were treated with combined photon and proton irradiation between 1978 and 1993. This study reviews 115 patients whose dose-volume data and follow-up data are available. The prescribed doses ranged from 66.6 Cobalt-Gray-Equivalent (CGE) to 79.2 CGE (median of 68.9 CGE). The dose to the optic structures (optic nerves and chiasm), the brain stem surface, and the brain stem center was limited to 60, 64, and 53 CGE, respectively. We used the dose-volume histogram data derived with the three-dimensional treatment planning system to evaluate several dose-volume parameters including the Equivalent Uniform Dose (EUD). We also analyzed several other patient and treatment factors in relation to local control and recurrence-free survival., RESULTS: Local failure developed in 42 of 115 patients, with the actuarial local control rates at 5 and 10 years being 59% and 44%. Gender was a significant predictor for local control with the prognosis in males being significantly better than that in females (P = 0.004, hazard ratio = 2.3). In a Cox univariate analysis, with stratification by gender, the significant predictors for local control (at the probability level of 0.05) were EUD, the target volume, the minimum dose, and the D5cc dose. The prescribed dose, histology, age, the maximum dose, the mean dose, the median dose, the D90% dose, and the overall treatment time were not significant factors. In a Cox multivariate analysis, the models including gender and EUD, or gender and the target volume, or gender and the minimum target dose were significant. The more biologically meaningful of these models is that of gender and EUD., CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the probability of recurrence of skull base chordomas depends on gender, target volume, and the level of target dose inhomogeneity. EUD was shown to be a useful parameter to evaluate dose distribution for the target volume.",Excluded
739,"Radioembolization of hepatocarcinoma with 90Y glass microspheres: treatment optimization using the dose-toxicity relationship Aim: Transarterial radioembolization (TARE) is, by all standards, a radiation therapy. As such, according to Euratom Directive 2013/59, it should be optimized by a thorough treatment plan based on the distinct evaluation of absorbed dose to the lesions and to the non-tumoural liver (two-compartment dosimetry). Since the dosimetric prediction with 99mTc albumin macro-aggregates (MAA) of non-tumoural liver is much more accurate than the same prediction on lesions, treatment planning should focus on non-tumoural liver rather than on lesion dosimetry. The aim of this study was to determine a safety limit through the analysis of pre-treatment dosimetry with 99mTc-MAA single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT/CT), in order to deliver the maximum tolerable absorbed dose to non-tumoural liver. Method(s): Data from intermediate/advanced hepato-cellular carcinoma (HCC) patients treated with 90Y glass microspheres were collected in this single-arm retrospective study. Injection was always lobar, even in case of bilobar disease, to avoid treating the whole liver in a single session. A three-level definition of liver decompensation (LD) was introduced, considering toxicity only in cases of liver decompensation requiring medical action (LD type C, LDC). We report LDC rates, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis between LDC and NO LDC absorbed dose distributions, normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) curves and uni- and multivariate analysis of risk factors associated with toxicity. Result(s): A 6-month timeline was defined as necessary to capture all treatment-related toxicity events. Previous transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), presence or extension of portal vein tumoural thrombosis (PVTT) and tumour pattern (nodular versus infiltrative) were not associated with tolerance to TARE. On the contrary, at the multivariate analysis, the absorbed dose averaged over the whole non-tumoural liver (including the non-injected lobe) was a prognostic indicator correlated with liver decompensation (odds ratio = 4.24). Basal bilirubin > 1.1 mg/dL was a second even more significant risk factor (odds ratio = 6.35). NTCP analysis stratified with this bilirubin cut-off determined a 15% liver decompensation risk at 50 Gy/90 Gy for bilirubin >/< 1.1 mg/dL. These results are valid for a 90Y glass microsphere administration 4 days after the reference time. Conclusion(s): Given the low predictive accuracy of 99mTc-MAA on lesion absorbed dose reported by several authors, an optimized TARE with 90Y glass microspheres with lobar injection 4 days after reference time should aim at an absorbed dose averaged over the whole non-tumoural liver of 50 Gy/90 Gy for basal bilirubin higher/lower than 1.1 mg/dL, respectively.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded

Alkaline phosphatase activity appeared in the male only. The intestinal metaplasia induced by stomach antigen injection in the male persisted longer than in the female. Moreover, the incidence of intestinal metaplasia caused by whole body irradiation in ovariectomized rats was significantly higher than in the sham-ovariectomized ones. Therefore, it is likely that male sex hormones are promoting while female sex hormones are inhibiting the development of intestinal metaplasia.",Included
1033,"Platelet-rich plasma as a potential therapeutic approach against lead nitrate- and/or gamma radiation-induced hepatotoxicity Because of the potential regenerative and cytoprotective effects of its content of numerous bioactive growth factors and cytokines, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) became an attractive biomaterial for therapeutic purposes. Therefore, the current study was designed to investigate the potential therapeutic effect of PRP against lead nitrate- and/or gamma-radiation-induced hepatotoxicity. To do so, hepatotoxicity was induced in rats by intraperitoneal administration of lead nitrate (7.5 mg/kg) thrice weekly for two consecutive weeks and/or a whole-body gamma-irradiation at a single dose of 6 Gy. Activated PRP (0.5 ml/kg) was injected subcutaneously 24 h after the last dose of lead nitrate and/or gamma-irradiation and continued twice weekly for three successive weeks. Lead nitrate intoxication and/or gamma-irradiation resulted in a significant elevation of serum alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase activities accompanied with a significant decrease in serum levels of total protein and albumin. Further, a significant increase in malondialdehyde level and nitric oxide content accompanied with a significant decrease in the reduced glutathione content and the enzyme activities of glutathione-S-transferase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase were observed. Additionally, hepatic extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt signaling pathways were stimulated. PRP treatment notably ameliorated the induced cell injury, reduced the intracellular oxidative and interestingly increased the upregulation of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and Akt. Moreover, PRP treatment relieved lead nitrate and/or gamma-radiation-induced hepatic histological damages. In conclusion, this study sheds the light on a probable therapeutic role of PRP against lead nitrate- and/or gamma-radiation-induced hepatotoxicity which might attribute to its ability to activate ERK and Akt signaling pathways.",Excluded

The aim of the present study was to ascertain whether radiotherapy (RT) administered early in the course of the disease prevents the manifestation of HO and whether in patients, whose HO have been resected, recurrence can be avoided. Method(s): Thirty-six patients (46 joints) were irradiated; 33 patients were evaluable. Mean follow up was 23.6 months. In 27 patients RT was performed as primary treatment in the inflammatory phase of soft tissue swelling that precedes manifest HO. Eleven patients were treated after resection of manifest HO, while two had primary and postoperative RT in different joints. The dose was 10 Gy in fractions of 2-2.5 Gy in 25 patients. Four patients were treated with total doses between 7.5 and 20 Gy. Seven patients received single dose irradiation with 8 Gy. RT was performed with 8 MV photons after simulation on the basis of CT scans. Result(s): The mean duration of follow up was 23.6 months. Thirty of the 36 irradiated patients showed no progression of HO. In three patients reossifications after therapy caused a moderate decrease in joint mobility. No relevant adverse effects were observed. Conclusion(s): These results suggest that RT is a safe and effective local treatment option for spinal cord injury patients with HO.",Excluded
660,"A little to a lot or a lot to a little? An analysis of pneumonitis risk from dose-volume histogram parameters of the lung in patients with lung cancer treated with 3-D conformal radiotherapy PURPOSE: To determine whether a little dose to a large normal lung volume or a high dose to a small lung volume is more critical for induction of clinical pneumonitis. The second question is if dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters are more reliable, if the lungs are analyzed as separate organs or as a whole organ., PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed the clinical and DVH data from 49 patients treated for a thoracic malignancy using 3-D conformal treatment plans. 18 patients had developed a clinical pneumonitis (CTC II or III). The majority of patients (n = 48) received radiochemotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin. Patients were generally treated 5 fx/week, single dose 2 Gy, using a two-series approach (shrinking field) up to a total dose of 60-70 Gy. For every individual patient, the overall dose distribution was recalculated in the Helax-TMS by means of adding dose plans according to the total dose applied in each series. The lungs were defined both as separate organs and as a whole organ. Low-dose volume ( 10-40 Gy, Vmod) and high-dose volume (> 40 Gy, Vhigh), as well as V10-V40 and mean lung dose (MLD) were defined from the cumulative DVH. Dose-effect relationships were fitted with a logistic regression model., RESULTS: Manifestation of clinical pneumonitis was within 3 months from termination of irradiation in all cases. For the ipsilateral lung, the incidence of pneumonitis was closely correlated to Vhigh. The pneumonitis rate increased from 13% up to 60%. By contrast, with increasing Vlow the pneumonitis rate dropped to < 10%. A similar but less pronounced effect was seen for the total lung. The lung volumes Vlow, Vmod and Vhigh of the ipsilateral, contralateral and whole lung were significantly correlated to the corresponding MLD. The incidence of pneumonitis increased with increasing MLD for the ipsilateral lung with a D50 of 32 Gy and a gamma 50 of 0.98. For the whole lung, the observed increase was less steep. MLD showed a close correlation to NTCP calculated by the Kutcher model. However, NTCP calculation overestimated the pneumonitis risk for the ipsilateral lung and underestimated the risk for the whole lung due to the steeper gradient. The logistic regression curve for the DVH parameters V10-V40 showed an increase of steepness toward higher doses. From the logistic regression curves, a DVH template indicating critical borders of V10-V40 was generated for the ipsilateral as well as for the total lung., CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that it is reasonable to disperse the dose outside the target volume over large areas in order to reduce the volumes of lung receiving > 40 Gy. Reducing the high-dose volume reduces the pneumonitis rate more than a corresponding reduction in the low-dose regions of the DVH. Landmarks for DVH optimization as defined in this analysis may serve as a basis for DVH contrains in IMRT planning. Separate organ analysis produced more reliable results and should be preferred to whole-organ analysis, if techniques mainly involving one side of the lung are applied. Further validation of these constraints is necessary prior to general recommendation.",Excluded
200,"X-ray induced sex-chromosome loss, when ring-X chromosome males are irradiated and mated to females carrying mei-9, mei-41 or mei-218 Radiation damage induced in the sperm nucleus is repaired after this nucleus has entered the oocyte. The yield of induced genetic damage is known to be dependent on maternal genotype and can also be modified by treatment of the females with metabolic inhibitors. The experiments reported here were designed to find out whether a more specific analysis of the interaction between male gamete and oocyte cytoplasm can be carried out using mutants that are known to affect repair processes. Males carrying ring-X chromosomes were exposed to X-ray doses up to 1000 R and mated to females homozygous for a repair-deficient mutant. The mutants used were mei-9a, mei-9L1, mei-41A10, and mei-41D5. In addition a yellow (y) X chromosome was used as a control and an attempt was made to obtain data using mei-21815, a mutant at a locus not thought to affect repair. With mei-9 mutants there is an enhancement of the spontaneous and induced rates of paternal sex-chromosome loss. The mei-41 mutants did not affect the rates of paternal sex-chromosome loss. Mei-218 females were difficult to work with because they gave very few progeny. From these data it can be argued that repair-deficient mutants will indeed be useful for an analysis of the fixation of radiation-induced genetic damage.",Excluded
451,"Radiation protection value to the operator from augmented reality smart glasses in interventional fluoroscopy procedures using phantoms INTRODUCTION: Smart glasses can be adapted to display radiographic images to allow clinician's gaze not to be directionally fixed or predetermined by computer monitor location. This study presents an analysis of eye lens dose during interventional fluoroscopy guided procedures, comparing fixed monitor positions against the use of smart glasses., METHODS: Using a head phantom (simulating the clinician), thermoluminescent dosimeters and lead shielded glasses, the dose to the eye was measured for different head 'rotations and tilts' for: gaze directed towards the main scattering source (patient/primary beam) to represent potential gaze direction if smart glasses are used; gaze directed to a range of potential computer monitor positions. An anthropomorphic pelvis phantom was utilised to simulate the patient. Accumulated dose rates (muGy s-1) from five 10-second exposures at 75 kV 25.2 mAs were recorded., RESULTS: An average DAP reading of 758.84 cGy cm2 was measured during each 10 second exposure. Whilst wearing lead shielded glasses a 6.10 - fold reduction in dose rate to the lens is possible (p < 0.05). Influence of the direction of gaze by the clinician demonstrated a wide range of dose rate reduction from 3.13% (p = 0.16) to 143.69% (p < 0.05) when the clinician's gaze was towards the main scattering source. Increased dose rate to the clinician's eyes was received despite wearing lead shielded glasses, as the angle of gaze moved 45degree and 90degree from 0degree., CONCLUSION: If the clinician's gaze is directed towards the main scattering source a potential exists for reducing eye lens dose compared with fixed location computer monitors. Introduction of lead lined smart glasses into interventional radiology may lead to improvements in patient care, reducing the need for the clinician to look away from the patient to observe a radiographic image.

431,"Studies on mutagen-sensitive strains of Drosophila melanogaster, VIII. Further data on differences between Canton-S and ebony strains with respect to maternal effects for the X-ray induction of autosomal translocations and ring-X chromosome losses in mature spermatozoa The influence of the maternal genotype (Canton-S, proficient in the repair of X-ray-induced chromosome breaks and ebony, less proficient in this regard) on the recovery of X-ray-induced autosomal (II-III) translocations and ring-X chromosome losses in mature spermatozoa was studied. In the first series of experiments, males carrying appropriate markers on their second and third chromosomes were irradiated and mated to Canton-S or ebony females and the frequencies of II-III translocations were determined. In the second series of experiments, males carrying ring-X chromosomes were irradiated in N2 or in O2, mated to Canton-S or ebony females and the frequencies of XO males were determined; additionally, under similar gas-treatment and radiation conditions, the pattern of egg-mortality was also assessed. The data on translocations show that the yields are higher with ebony than with Canton-S females; these and earlier results on dominant lethals and sex-linked recessive lethals support the interpretation that the maternal repair system in the ebony strain is less proficient and more error-prone than that of the Canton-S strain. Those on the losses of ring-X chromosomes demonstrate that (i) the absolute yields of XO males are lower with ebony than with Canton-S females irrespective of whether the parental males are irradiated in N2 or in O2; (ii) the exposure-frequency relationships are all linear, but the slopes are higher when the males are irradiated in O2 and are consistent with an oxygen-enhancement-ratio of about 1.5 and (iii) the relationships between the logarithm of egg-survival and XO male frequency are also linear, but the slopes for the O2 groups are lower than those for the N2 groups (slope ratios of 0.86-0.87). The finding that at given survival levels, the XO frequencies are lower in the O2 than in the N2 groups of both the Canton-S and ebony series viewed in the context of the mechanisms that have been postulated to explain the loss of ring-X chromosomes in irradiated mature spermatozoa permits the following interpretation for the observed results: (i) a higher proportion of potential XO zygotes is lost through dominant lethality in the O2 groups than in the N2 ones presumably because the chromosome breaks induced in O2 are qualitatively different in the sense that they have a higher probability to undergo reunions relative to restitution, compared with breaks induced under anoxia and (ii) this leads to lower than expected oxygen-enhancement ratios (i.e., expected on the basis of published data on sex-linked recessive lethals, another kind of genetic damage which shows a linear exposure-frequency relationship.",Excluded
835,"Do non-thermal electromagnetic fields cause nitrosative stress in male and female rats? Nitrosative stress occurs when the generations of highly Reactive Nitrogen Species (RNS) such as nitric oxide (NO) exceed the ability of the human body to neutralize and eliminate them. It may lead to nitrosylation reactions that can alter protein structure by inhibiting normal body functions. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether RF Fields at non - thermal level can affect total NO (NOx) and antioxidant levels in plasma thus cause nitrosative stress. Twenty-four male and female Wistar rats were divided into four groups: Group I and Group II: male (n=6) and female (n=6) control groups, Group III and Group IV: male (n=6) and female (n=6) RF radiation exposed groups. The exposed groups of rats were exposed to non - thermal RF radiation 20 min/day for a month. NOx (nitrite/nitrate) levels were measured by Griess assay using Elisa reader. The total sulfhydryl (RSH) levels were determined spectrophotometrically by Kurtel method. The exposure to RF Radiation for a month caused significant increase in NOx plasma levels in male and female rats (p < 0.05). Conversely RSH levels were significantly lower in exposed rats compared to control rats (p < 0.05). No statistically significant difference was observed in the rectal temperature between control and RF - irradiated rats (p > 0.05). In the present study, we showed that plasma NOx level may be increased in both male and female rats due to RF radiation exposure.

It is estimated that 30-40 % of rectal cancer occurs in patients aged 75 years or more. Data on adherence to neoadjuvant CRT and its safety remain poor owing to the under-representation of older patients in randomized clinical trials and the discordance in the results from retrospective studies. The aim of this study was to assess adherence with preoperative CRT and tolerability in older patients with a stage II/III unresectable rectal cancer., METHODS: Patients aged 75 years or more with stage II/III rectal cancer treated with preoperative CRT at the University Hospital of Besancon from 1993 to 2011 were included. Feasibility, toxicities, overall survival, and local recurrence rates were studied., RESULTS: Fifty-six patients with a Charlson score from 2 to 6 were included. The mean age was 78 years. The compliance rates for RT and chemotherapy were 91 and 41.1 %, respectively. Two patients stopped CRT; one for hemostatic surgery, and one for severe sepsis. For CRT, the rate of grade >=3 toxicity was 14.29 %, mainly the digestive type. Fifty-two patients underwent tumor resection, including 76.79 % total mesorectal excision resection with 84.6 % complete resection, and a rate of postoperative complications of 39.6 %. At 2 years, the overall survival and local recurrences rates were 87.3 and 7.8 %, respectively., CONCLUSION: In older patients, selected preoperative CRT, with an adapted chemotherapy dose, is well tolerated. The main toxicity was gastrointestinal. Adherence to RT is comparable to that of younger patients.",Excluded
594,"Myocardial infarction mortality risk after treatment for hodgkin disease: A collaborative British cohort study Background Myocardial infarction is a major cause of excess long-term mortality in survivors of Hodgkin disease, but limited information exists on the effects of specific chemotherapy regimens used to treat these patients on their risk of death from myocardial infarction. Methods We followed a cohort of 7033 Hodgkin disease patients who were treated in Britain from November 1, 1967, through September 30, 2000, and compared their risk of myocardial infarction mortality with that in the general population of England and Wales. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results A total of 166 deaths from myocardial infarction occurred in the cohort, statistically significantly more than expected(standardized mortality ratio[SMR] = 2.5, 95% confidence interval[CI] = 2.1 to 2.9), with an absolute excess risk of 125.8 per 100000 person-years. Standardized mortality ratios decreased sharply with older age at first treatment, but absolute excess risks of death from myocardial infarction increased with older age up to age 65 years at first treatment. The statistically significantly increased risk of myocardial infarction mortality persisted through to 25 years after first treatment. Risks were increased statistically significantly and independently for patients who had been treated with supradiaphragmatic radiotherapy, anthracyclines, or vincristine. Risk was particularly high for patients treated with the doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine regimen(SMR = 9.5, 95% CI = 3.5 to 20.6). Risk at 20 or more years after first treatment was particularly great for patients who had received supradiaphragmatic radiotherapy and vincristine without anthracylines(SMR = 14.8, 95% CI = 4.8 to 34.5). Conclusions The risk of death from myocardial infarction after treatment for Hodgkin disease remains high for at least 25 years. The increased risks are related to supradiaphragmatic radiotherapy but may also be related to anthracycline and vincristine treatment.",Excluded
316,"Meningiomas with rhabdoid or papillary components: Prognosis and comparison with anaplastic meningiomas Papillary and rhabdoid meningiomas are pathologically World Health Organization (WHO) grade III. Any correlation between clinical prognosis and pathologic component is not clear. We analyzed the prognoses of patients with meningiomas with a rhabdoid or papillary component compared to those of patients with anaplastic meningiomas. From 1994 to June 2013, 14 anaplastic meningiomas, 6 meningiomas with a rhabdoid component, and 5 meningiomas with papillary component were pathologically diagnosed. We analyzed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, extent of removal, adjuvant treatment, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and pathologic features of 14 anaplastic meningiomas (group A), 5 meningiomas with a predominant (>=50%) papillary or rhabdoid component (group B1), and 6 meningiomas without a predominant (<50%) rhabdoid or papillary component (group B2). Homogeneous enhancement on MRI was associated with improved PFS compared to heterogeneous enhancement (p=0.025). Depending on pathology, the mean PFS was 134.9+/-31.6 months for group A, 46.6+/-13.4 months for group B1, and 118.7+/-19.2 months for group B2. The mean OS was 138.5+/-24.6 months for group A and 59.7+/-16.8 months for group B1. All recurrent tumors were of the previously diagnosed pathology, except for one tumor from group B1, which recurred as an atypical meningioma without a papillary component. Group B1 tumors showed a more aggressive behavior than group B2 tumors. In group B2 cases, the pathologic findings of non-rhabdoid/papillary portion could be considered for further adjuvant treatment.Copyright © 2016 The Korean Neurosurgical Society.",Excluded
514,"Hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for the treatment of brain metastases BACKGROUND: This retrospective review evaluated the efficacy and toxicity profiles of various dose fractionations using hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT) in the treatment of brain metastases. METHOD(S): Between 2004 and 2007, 36 patients with 66 brain metastases were treated with HSRT. Nine of these subjects were excluded because of the absence of post-treatment magnetic resonance imaging scans, resulting in 27 patients with a total of 52 lesions. Of these 52 lesions, 45 lesions were treated with whole-brain radiotherapy plus a HSRT boost and 7 lesions were treated with HSRT as the primary treatment. The median prescribed dose was 25 grays (Gy) (range, 20 Gy-36 Gy) with a median of 5 fractions (range, 4 fractions-6 fractions) to a median 85% isodose line (range, 50%-100%). The median follow-up interval was 6.6 months (range, 0.9 months-26.8 months). RESULT(S): The median overall survival time was 10.8 months, and 66.7% of patients died of disease progression. After HSRT treatment of 52 brain lesions, 13 lesions demonstrated complete responses, 12 lesions demonstrated partial responses, 22 lesions demonstrated stable disease, and 5 lesions demonstrated progressive disease. Actuarial local tumor control rates at 6 months and 1 year were 93.9% and 68.2%, respectively. Maximum tumor dimension, concurrent chemotherapy, and a tumor volume <1 cc were found to be statistically significant factors for local tumor control. One patient had a grade 3 toxicity (according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events). CONCLUSION(S): HSRT provides a high level of tumor control with minimal toxicity comparable to single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). The results of the current study warrant a prospective randomized study comparing single-fraction SRS with HSRT in this patient population. © 2009 American Cancer Society.",Excluded

165,"Abscopal effect of boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT): proof of principle in an experimental model of colon cancer The aim of the present study was to evaluate, for the first time, the abscopal effect of boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). Twenty-six BDIX rats were inoculated subcutaneously with 1 x 106 DHD/K12/TRb syngeneic colon cancer cells in the right hind flank. Three weeks post-inoculation, the right leg of 12 rats bearing the tumor nodule was treated with BPA-BNCT (BPA-Boronophenylalanine) at the RA-3 nuclear reactor located in Buenos Aires, Argentina, at an absorbed dose of 7.5 Gy to skin as the dose-limiting tissue. The remaining group of 14 tumor-bearing rats were left untreated and used as control. Two weeks post-BNCT, 1 x 106 DHD/K12/TRb cells were injected subcutaneously in the contralateral left hind flank of each of the 26 BDIX rats. Tumor volume in both legs was measured weekly for 7 weeks to determine response to BNCT in the right leg and to assess a potential influence of BNCT in the right leg on tumor development in the left leg. Within the BNCT group, a statistically significant reduction was observed in contralateral left tumor volume in animals whose right leg tumor responded to BNCT (post-treatment/pre-treatment tumor volume <1) versus animals who failed to respond (post/pre >=1), i.e., 13 +/- 15 vs 271 +/- 128 mm3. In addition, a statistically significant reduction in contralateral left leg tumor volume was observed in BNCT-responsive animals (post/pre <1) vs untreated animals, i.e., 13 +/- 15 vs 254 +/- 251 mm3. The present study performed in a simple animal model provides proof of principle that the positive response of a tumor to BNCT is capable of inducing an abscopal effect.",Excluded
122,"Synthesis of D-mannose capped silicon nanoparticles and their interactions with MCF-7 human breast cancerous cells Silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs) hold prominent interest in various aspects of biomedical applications. For this purpose, surface functionalization of the NPs is essential to stabilize them, target them to specific disease area, and allow them to selectively bind to the cells or the bio-molecules present on the surface of the cells. However, no such functionalization has been explored with Si nanoparticles. Carbohydrates play a critical role in cell recognition. Here, we report the first synthesis of silicon nanoparticles functionalized with carbohydrates. In this study, stable and brightly luminescent d-Mannose (Man) capped SiNPs have been synthesized from amine terminated SiNPs and d-mannopyranoside acid. The surface functionalization is confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) studies. The mean diameter of the crystal core is 5.5 nm, as measured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), while the hydrodynamic diameter obtained by dynamic light scattering (DLS) is 16 nm. The quantum yield (QY) of photoluminescence emission is found to be 11.5%, and the nanoparticles exhibit an exceptional stability over two weeks. The Man-capped SiNPs may prove to be valuable tools for further investigating glycobiological, biomedical, and material science fields. Experiments are carried out using Concanavalin A (ConA) as a target protein in order to prove the hypothesis. When Man functionalized SiNPs are treated with ConA, cross-linked aggregates are formed, as shown in TEM images as well as monitored by photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL). Man functionalized SiNPs can target cancerous cells. Visualization imaging of SiNPs in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells shows the fluorescence is distributed throughout the cytoplasm of these cells.",Excluded
578,"High dose stereotactic body radiotherapy using three fractions for colorectal oligometastases Background and Objectives: This study evaluated the treatment result of high dose stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for colorectal oligometastases. Method(s): Between 2003 and 2009, 41 patients with 50 lesions confined to one organ from colorectal cancer (CRC) and treated with high dose SBRT <=45 Gy were retrospectively reviewed. Lymph nodes (LNs) (18 patients) were the most frequent sites followed in order by lung (12) and liver (11). SBRT doses ranged from 45 to 60 Gy in three fractions (median 48 Gy). The cumulative gross tumor volume (GTV) ranged from 2 to 123 ml (median 13 ml). Result(s): The median follow-up period from the SBRT date was 28 months (range, 6-65 months). The 3-year local control and overall survival rates were 64 and 60%, and the respective 5-year rates were 57 and 38%. Cumulative GTV and SBRT dose were statistically significant prognostic factors for local control. The grade 3 or 4 complications occurred in three patients (7%). Conclusion(s): High dose SBRT for colorectal oligometastases was found to produce results comparable with surgical series. To improve local control, dose higher than 48 Gy are recommend when possible, but further study will be required to define the optimal normal tissue constraints and acceptable toxicity.

802,"Sex-specific differences in fetal germ cell apoptosis induced by ionizing radiation BACKGROUND: We have previously shown that male human fetal germ cells are highly radiosensitive and that their death depends on p53 activation. Male germ cell apoptosis was initiated with doses as low as 0.1 Gy and was prevented by pifithrin alpha, a p53 inhibitor. In this study, we investigated the radiosensitivity of early female and male fetal proliferating germ cells.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Both male and female fetal germ cells displayed a similar number of gamma H2AX foci in response to ionizing radiation (IR). In organ culture of human fetal ovaries, the germ cells underwent apoptosis only when exposed to high doses of IR (1.5 Gy and above). Accumulation of p53 was detected in irradiated male human fetal germ cells but not in female ones. Inhibition of p53 with pifithrin alpha did not affect oogonia apoptosis following irradiation. IR induced apoptosis similarly in mouse fetal ovaries in organ culture and in vivo during oogonial proliferation. Germ cell survival in testes from p53 knockout or p63 knockout mice exposed to IR was better than wild-type, whereas female germ cell survival was unaffected by p53 or p63 knockout.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that pre-meiotic male and female fetal germ cells behave differently in response to a genotoxic stress--irradiation--with oogonia being less sensitive and undergoing p53-independent apoptosis.",Excluded
724,"Active cutaneous leishmaniasis associated with invasive squamous cell carcinoma coexistent in the same lesion: A case report Background: Cutaneous leishmaniasis is an infectious disease caused by a parasitic protozoan belonging to the genus Leishmania. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the second most common type of malignant neoplasm of the skin, usually caused by chronic solar exposure. Malignant degeneration of chronic healed or unhealed ulcers is an uncommon event called Marjolin's ulcer and mostly refers to SCC. Infectious diseases are one of the causes of chronic wounds and it has been described, although rare, cases of development of SCC on scar tissue of previous cutaneous leishmaniasis, but not in recent and active lesion. We present a case not yet reported in the literature of a cutaneous lesion of SCC and cutaneous leishmaniasis associated and diagnosed at the same time. Observation: A 72-year-old. man, black, came for his first consultation with a cervical lesion with seven months history, with progressive growth for the last 2 months, associated with local burning sensation. On dermatological examination, an ulcerated nodule with infiltrated and elevated borders with 4.5 x 5.0 cm was found in the posterior cervical region. The differential diagnosis were SCC, BCC, cutaneous metastasis and cutaneous leishmaniasis. A punch biopsy was performed and histopathological examination revealed a moderately differentiated invasive squamous cell carcinoma on the epidermis with an ulcerated area on the surface of the tumor, showing parasitic structures compatible with Leishmania sp and focal cell marking for leishmaniasis by immunohistochemistry. After the treatment of the leishmaniasis with liposomal amphotericin, the patient was referred for surgical treatment of the SCC. Key message: The rarity of the case presented is evident by the lack of publication available, and to our knowledge, none with such short evolution and associated diagnosis. Thus here we should question if the SCC has evolved in a leishmaniasis ulcer or whether leishmaniasis has developed in a pre-existing SCC.",Excluded

Despite several factors such as ionizing radiation exposure or rare genetic syndromes have been associated with the development of glioblastoma, no underlying cause has been identified for the majority of cases. We thus aimed to investigate the role of DNA repair polymorphisms in modulating glioblastoma risk., METHODS: Genotypic and allelic frequencies of seven common polymorphisms in DNA repair genes involved in nucleotide excision repair (ERCC1 rs11615, ERCC2 rs13181, ERCC6 rs4253079), base excision repair (APEX1 rs1130409, XRCC1 rs25487), double-strand break repair (XRCC3 rs861539) and mismatch repair (MLH1 rs1800734) pathways were analyzed in 115 glioblastoma patients and 200 healthy controls. Haplotype analysis was also performed for ERCC1 rs11615 and ERCC2 rs13181 polymorphisms, located on the same chromosomal region (19q13.32)., RESULTS: Our results indicated that carriers of the ERCC2 Gln/Gln genotype were associated with a lower glioblastoma risk (OR=0.32, 95% CI 0.12-0.89; P=0.028), whereas carriers of the MLH1 AA genotype were associated with an increased risk of glioblastoma (OR=3.14, 95% CI 1.09-9.06; P=0.034). Furthermore, the haplotype containing the C allele of ERCC2 rs13181 polymorphism and the T allele of ERCC1 rs11615 polymorphism was significantly associated with a protective effect of developing glioblastoma (OR=0.34, 95% CI 0.16-0.71; P=0.004)., CONCLUSIONS: These results pointed out that MLH1 rs1800734 and ERCC2 rs13181 polymorphisms might constitute glioblastoma susceptibility factors, and also suggested that the chromosomal region 19q could be important in glioblastoma pathogenesis.

80,"Fat mass and fracture risk in elderly men and women: A prospective study Background and Aim: The relationship between body fat mass and fracture risk is controversial, due primarily to lack of prospective data. The present study sought to examine the association between whole body and abdominal fat mass and fracture risk in postmenopausal women and elderly men. Materials and Methods : The present study was part of the ongoing Dubbo Osteoporosis Epidemiology Study (DOES), in which a random sample of more than 2000 men and women aged 60+ years has been continuously followed up for 21 years. The present study was based on a cohort of 1129 participants (361 men and 768 women), whose total body BMD scans were available. BMD at the femoral neck and lumbar spine, total body fat mass and abdominal fat mass were measured by DXA (GE-LUNAR Corp, Madison, WI). Baseline characteristics of participants including age, height, physical activity, history of falls, smoking and prior fracture were ascertained at the initial visit. The incidence of lowtrauma and nonpathological fractures was ascertained from x-ray reports. The Cox's proportional hazards regression was used to evaluate the association between fat mass and fracture risk, with adjustment for baseline covariates. Result(s): During the median 5 years of follow-up, 19 (5%) men and 107 (14%) women had sustained a fragility fracture. Women with fracture had lower BMD, lower body fat mass and body weight than those without a fracture. In women, increased risk of fracture was associated with lower abdominal fat mass (hazard ratio/ standard deviation[HR/SD]: 1.33; 95% CI: 1.07-1.65), after adjusting for age (HR/SD: 1.32; 1.08-1.63), femoral neck BMD (HR/SD:1.26; 1.03-1.56), and prior fracture (HR/SD:1.41; 1.15-1.73). Compared with women in the highest tertile of abdominal fat, those in the lowest tertile had a 2.1-fold (95% CI: 1.25-3.55) increase in fracture risk. Further analyses revealed that lower body fat mass was also associated with increased fracture risk, but the association was not independent of BMD. The magnitude of association between fat mass and fracture risk (HR/ SD: 1.32; 1.08-1.63) was greater than that of body weight and fracture risk (HR/SD: 1.15; 0.94-1.41). Approximately 27% of fracture liability was attributable to abdominal fat mass. Conclusion(s): Lower total body fat mass, particular lower abdominal fat, was significantly associated with increased fracture risk in women, not in men. These results suggest that the incorporation of fat mass into existing fracture prognostic models may enhance their predictive accuracy.",Excluded

859,"The effect of vertical and horizontal symmetry on memory for tactile patterns in late blind individuals Visual stimuli that exhibit vertical symmetry are easier to remember than stimuli symmetric along other axes, an advantage that extends to the haptic modality as well. Critically, the vertical symmetry memory advantage has not been found in early blind individuals, despite their overall superior memory, as compared with sighted individuals, and the presence of an overall advantage for identifying symmetric over asymmetric patterns. The absence of the vertical axis memory advantage in the early blind may depend on their total lack of visual experience or on the effect of prolonged visual deprivation. To disentangle this issue, in this study, we measured the ability of late blind individuals to remember tactile spatial patterns that were either vertically or horizontally symmetric or asymmetric. Late blind participants showed better memory performance for symmetric patterns. An additional advantage for the vertical axis of symmetry over the horizontal one was reported, but only for patterns presented in the frontal plane. In the horizontal plane, no difference was observed between vertical and horizontal symmetric patterns, due to the latter being recalled particularly well. These results are discussed in terms of the influence of the spatial reference frame adopted during exploration. Overall, our data suggest that prior visual experience is sufficient to drive the vertical symmetry memory advantage, at least when an external reference frame based on geocentric cues (i.e., gravity) is adopted.",Excluded
295,"Long-term local control achieved after hypofractionated stereotactic body radiotherapy for adrenal gland metastases: A retrospective analysis of 34 patients Aims and background. To describe feasibility, tolerability and clinical outcomes of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in the treatment of adrenal metastases in 34 consecutive cancer patients. Material and methods. Between March 2004 and July 2010, a total of 34 consecutive patients, accounting for 36 adrenal metastatic lesions, were treated with SBRT. SBRT treatments were delivered by a Linac Varian 600 with microMLC (3DLine, Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden) and a Linac ELEKTA Precise (Elekta). All 34 patients were clinically and radiologically evaluated during and after completion of SBRT. Following outcomes were taken into account: best clinical response at any time, local control, time to systemic progression, time to local progression, overall survival and toxicity. Survival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and factor potentially affecting outcomes were analyzed with Cox regression analysis. Results. Total RT doses ranged from 20 Gy in 4 fractions to 45 Gy in 18 fractions (median dose: 32 Gy; median number of fractions: 4). All doses were prescribed to the 95% isodose line. No cases of Grade >= 3 toxicity were recorded. At a median follow-up time of 41 months (range, 1275) 22 patients were alive. Three of 28 lesions (11%) showed complete response, 13/28 (46%) partial response, 10/28 (36%) stable disease and 2/28 (7%) progressed in the treated area. Local failure was observed in 13 cases. Actuarial local control rates at one and two years were 66% and 32%, respectively. Median time to local progression was 19 months. Median survival was 22 months. Conclusion. SBRT in adrenal gland metastasis is feasible without significant acute and late toxicities, with a good rate of local control. New SBRT fractionation schemes and the possibility to combine new systemic approaches should be investigated in order to further increase local control and reduce systemic disease progression. © 2012 Informa Healthcare.",Excluded
181,"Intramedullary Nailing of Femoral Diaphyseal Metastases: Is it Necessary to Protect the Femoral Neck? Background : Intramedullary nailing is the accepted form of treatment for impending or pathologic fractures of the femoral diaphysis. Traditional teaching promotes the use of a cephalomedullary nail so that stabilization is provided for the femoral neck in the event that a future femoral neck metastasis develops. However, that approach may add cost, surgical time, blood loss, and added radiation exposure to staff members, and there is limited evidence in the literature that supports this practice. Questions/purposes: The purpose of our study was to evaluate the incidence of femoral neck metastases in patients who underwent femoral nailing of diaphyseal metastases. Patients and Methods: Retrospective analysis of our Musculoskeletal Oncology database identified 145 femoral nailings performed for metastatic disease, myeloma, or lymphoma of the femoral diaphysis between 2001 and 2011. Average patient age was 59 years. One hundred forty-one patients underwent 145 femoral nailings (four were bilateral). One hundred forty-four of the nails used were cephalomedullary implants and one was a flexible nail. Thirty-six (25%) femurs had sustained a pathologic fracture and 109 (75%) femurs were treated as impending fractures. Eighty-four patients received either preoperative or postoperative radiation therapy. Average radiographic followup was 13 months and average postoperative survival was 16 months. Of the 141 patients in this series, 121 (86%) are known to have died at a median of 9 months (range, 0.1-133 months) after surgery. The latest followup radiographs were obtained at a median of 5 months after the femoral nailing (range, 0-119 months). Of the 90 patients with documented dates of death and radiographic followup greater than zero months, 76 (84%) had radiographs available within a year of death. Thirty-one patients had zero months radiographic followup. The median survival for this group of patients was only 0.9 months (range, 0.1-12 months). Results : No patients (0%) in this series had femoral neck metastases develop postoperatively. Conclusion : Despite traditional teaching that supports the use of cephalomedullary implants when treating metastatic disease of the femur, we were unable to identify a single patient who had femoral neck metastasis after surgery on the femur. Our findings do not support the use of cephalomedullary implants in this patient population for the sole purpose of prophylactic femoral neck stabilization; however, this series was relatively small, and the experiences of other centers will be needed to come to a more-complete sense of the frequency of what in all likelihood is a rare event.

375,"LED photoprevention: reduced MED response following multiple LED exposures BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: As photoprotection with traditional sunscreen presents some limitations, the use of non-traditional treatments to increase skin resistance to ultraviolet (UV) induced damage would prove particularly appealing. The purpose of this pilot study was to test the potential of non-thermal pulsed light-emitting diode (LED) treatments (660 nm) prior to UV exposure in the induction of a state of cellular resistance against UV-induced erythema., STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen healthy subjects and two patients with polymorphous light eruption (PLE) were exposed to 5, 6, or 10 LED treatments (660 nm) on an EXPERIMENTAL anterior thigh region. Individual baseline minimal erythema doses (MED) were then determined. UV radiation was thereafter performed on the LED EXPERIMENTAL and CONTROL anterior thigh areas. Finally, 24 hours post-UV irradiation, LED pre-treated MED responses were compared to the non-treated sites., RESULTS: Reduction of erythema was considered significant when erythema was reduced by >50% on the LED-treated side as opposed to CONTROL side. A significant LED treatment reduction in UV-B induced erythema reaction was observed in at least one occasion in 85% of subjects, including patients suffering from PLE. Moreover, there was evidence of a dose-related pattern in results. Finally, a sun protection factor SPF-15-like effect and a reduction in post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation were observed on the LED pre-treated side., CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that LED based therapy prior to UV exposure provided significant protection against UV-B induced erythema. The induction of cellular resistance to UV insults may possibly be explained by the induction of a state a natural resistance to the skin via specific cell signaling pathways and without the drawbacks and limitations of traditional sunscreens. These results represent an encouraging step towards expanding the potential applications of LED therapy and could be useful in the treatment of patients with anomalous reactions to sunlight.",Excluded
287,"Expanded Characterization of a Hemi-Body Shielded Gottingen Minipig Model of Radiation-induced Gastrointestinal Injury Incorporating Oral Dosing Procedures In collaboration with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), the authors recently conducted a pilot study in a hemi-body shielded model of radiation-induced gastrointestinal (GI) injury in Gottingen minipigs following exposure to radiation dose levels between 8-16 Gy. Herein, the impact of oral dosing procedures is assessed, as well as the specific causes of death in animals exposed to radiation doses of 14 and 16 Gy (n = 64; 32 male, 32 female, between 6 and 8 mo of age). Oral dosing using a 2-tablet placebo system comprised of both immediate release and enteric-coated tablets starting 24 h post-irradiation resulted in inhibited gastric emptying of the enteric-coated tablets, which were found to be retained in the stomach and/or regurgitated. This finding appears to be species-specific, as similar findings have not been reported for other large animal species (e.g., non-human primates). Mortality was primarily dictated by decreased activity, body weight loss (>35%), and/or respiratory distress, despite shielding of the lung. The cause of respiratory distress in animals that were pre-terminally euthanized varied according to the timing of death, with interstitial inflammation and extensive fibrosis observed >20 days post-irradiation. Kidney damage was also identified in most animals after day 10. Changes in the GI tract were consistent with previous studies and included collagen deposition/fibrosis. Observations of inflammatory infiltrates and interstitial inflammation/fibrosis in both shielded and unshielded organs support a strong secondary inflammatory syndrome post-irradiation.",Included

3,"New radiosensitization treatment (KORTUC-SC) for chemo-resistant supra-clavicular lymph nodes metastasis Purpose/Objective: Linear accelerator-based radiotherapy has little effect on most of locally-advanced neoplasmas that have grown to several centimeters or more. Such tumors contain numerous hypoxic cancer cells and/or large amounts of anti-oxidative enzymes, and are therefore resistant to low linear energy transfer (LET) radiation such as X-rays and electrons from linear accelerators (Linac). We have developed a new radiosensitizer containing hydrogen peroxide & sodium hyaluronate for topical tumor injection for various types of tumors which are not superficially exposed, and the method was named 'KORTUC II'. Safety and effectiveness of the method have already been successfully performed by our clinical trials for patients with unresectable and/or recurrent neoplasms. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of KORTUC II specifically for patients with chemotherapy-resistant supra-clavicular lymph nodes metastasis, and the method was named as KORTUC-SC (KORTUC for supra-clavicular lymph nodes metastasis). For these lesions, curative resection is impossible because of the direct invasion of neoplasms to surrounding cervical great vessels. Therefore new strategies for better local control have been needed. Material(s) and Method(s): This study was performed at Kochi Medical School Hospital between September 2006 and March 2010. Twelve patients (2 men,10 women) with chemotherapy-resistant supraclavicular lymph node metastasis were enrolled into the study after providing fully informed written consent. All the patients underwent PET-CT examinations prior to and at 3 ~ 6 months after KORTUC-SC. We compared these two examination results. Patients were 58 to 77 years old (average age was 65).The radiotherapy regimen was 4 Gy/time, 3 times/week, for 4 weeks, and total dose was 48 Gy. The appropriate energy level of electron beams was selected for individual patients in terms of depth of the target lesion. The injection of 3 to 6 ml of the agent was started from the 5th session of radiotherapy, and was performed twice a week under ultrasonographic guidance. Result(s): The numbers of the patients were 12. Therapeutic effects were evaluated by the FDG-PET performed prior to and following the KORTUC-SC treatment. Treatment was well tolerated, with minimal adverse effects. Of the 12 patients, 6 (50%) showed complete response (CR), 1 (8.3%) showed partial response (PR), 3 (25%) showed stable disease(SD), and another 2 (16.6%) showed progressive disease (PD). Overall survival rate was 83% at 1 year (10/12 patients) and 75% at 2 years (9/12 patients). The mean duration of follow-up at the end of February 2011 was 35.1 months. Conclusion(s): Based on the findings of FDG-PET study, remarkable therapeutic effects of the KORTUC II treatment for chemotherapyresistant supra-clavicular lymph nodes metastasis (KORTUC-SC) were clearly identified. The treatment was well tolerated, with minimal adverse effects such as local pain at the injection site. The treatment outcomes were satisfactory and the adverse events were within the permissible range. This therapy is much less expensive than molecular-targeted therapies in current use, such as Cetuximab. Some well designed prospective randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm the therapeutic efficacy of KORTUC-SC.",Excluded
41,"Effects of simultaneous bilateral tDCS of the human motor cortex BACKGROUND: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive technique that has been investigated as a therapeutic tool for different neurologic disorders. Neuronal excitability can be modified by application of DC in a polarity-specific manner: anodal tDCS increases excitability, while cathodal tDCS decreases excitability. Previous research has shown that simultaneous bilateral tDCS of the human motor cortex facilitates motor performance in the anodal stimulated hemisphere much more than when the same hemisphere is stimulated using unilateral anodal motor cortex tDCS., OBJECTIVE: The main purpose of this study was to determine whether simultaneous bilateral tDCS is able to increase cortical excitability in one hemisphere whereas decreasing cortical excitability in the contralateral hemisphere. To test our hypothesis, cortical excitability before and after bilateral motor cortex tDCS was evaluated. Moreover, the effects of bilateral tDCS were compared with those of unilateral motor cortex tDCS., METHODS: We evaluated cortical excitability in healthy volunteers before and after unilateral or bilateral tDCS using transcranial magnetic stimulation., RESULTS: We demonstrated that simultaneous application of anodal tDCS over the motor cortex and cathodal tDCS over the contralateral motor cortex induces an increase in cortical excitability on the anodal-stimulated side and a decrease in the cathodal stimulated side. We also used the electrode montage (motor cortex-contralateral orbit) method to compare the bilateral tDCS montage with unilateral tDCS montage. The simultaneous bilateral tDCS induced similar effects to the unilateral montage on the cathode-stimulated side. On the anodal tDCS side, the simultaneous bilateral tDCS seems to be a slightly less robust electrode arrangement compared with the placement of electrodes in the motor cortex-contralateral orbit montage. We also found that intersubject variability of the excitability changes that were induced by the anodal motor cortex tDCS using the bilateral montage was lower than that with the unilateral montage., CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study in which cortical excitability before and after bilateral motor cortex tDCS was extensively evaluated, and the effects of bilateral tDCS were compared with unilateral motor cortex tDCS. Simultaneous bilateral tDCS seems to be a useful tool to obtain increases in cortical excitability of one hemisphere whereas causing decreases of cortical excitability in the contralateral hemisphere (e.g.,to treat stroke).

102,"Location of Disease on Imaging may Predict Radiation Exposure During Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is performed for various diseases. The aim of this study is to evaluate the difference of dose-area product (DAP) during the ERCP procedures according to location of the lesion. We performed a retrospective study of consecutive 217 therapeutic ERCP examinations performed between November 2014 and April 2015 at a tertiary care center. ERCP procedures divided into two groups according to location of the lesion identified on imaging: lesions in the common hepatic duct (CHD) or the common bile duct (CBD) and lesions in the hepatic hilum or the intrahepatic duct (IHD). The mean DAP of the hilum-IHD group (48.7 Gy cm2) was significantly higher than that of the CBD-CHD group (34.9 Gy cm2) (P = 0.003). Radiation exposure during ERCP was significantly different according to location of bile duct lesion. Copyright © The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

743,"Vitamin D receptor gene polymorphisms in multiple sclerosis patients in northwest Greece Background: Polymorphisms of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene have been linked to both multiple sclerosis (MS) and osteoporosis. We examined the frequency of the Taq-I and Bsm-I polymorphisms of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene in 69 patients with MS and 81 age and sex-matched healthy individuals. Genotyping of Taq-I (rs731236) and Bsm-I (rs1544410) was performed using TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay. All patients and controls had determination of body mass index (BMI), bone mineral density (BMD) and smoking history. Result(s): The mean age of patients was 39 +/- 10.5 years compared to 38.7 +/- 10.7 years of the controls (p = 0.86), the BMI was 24.8 +/-4.2 kg/m2 compared to 25.7 4.8 kg/m2 of the controls (p = 0.23), the BMD in the lumbar spine 0.981 0.15 compared to 1.025 +/- 013 of the controls (p = 0.06) and the total hip BMD was 0.875 +/- 0.14 compared to 0.969 +/- 0.12 of the controls (p < 0.001). There were no differences of the Taq-I (TT, CT, CC) and Bsm-I genotypes (GG, GA, AA) and allelic frequencies between MS and control individuals. Multivariate analysis also failed to show any association of the Taq-I and Bsm-I polymorphisms and MS or sex, BMI, BMD and smoking history. Conclusion(s): This study suggests that the Taq-I and Bsm-I polymorphisms of the VDR gene are not associated with MS risk, BMI or BMD in the Greek population studied. © 2011 Sioka et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
641,"Estimation of skeletal muscle mass by dual-energy X-ray absorptionmetry appendicular lean soft mass in chinese adult Objective We studied whether total body skeletal muscle (SM) mass could be accurately estimated from appendicular lean soft tissue (ALST) mass measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptionmetry (DXA), and investigated the validity of equations of prediction reported previously and derived from the data of the present study. (Table Presented) Methods We measured body composition by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and DXA in 194 Chinese stratified for sex, age and body mass index. The equation of prediction was generated by linear regression. The agreement between measured and predicted SM mass was assessed by the use of intraclass correlation analysis, paired t test, Bland-Altman plot. Results The total body SM mass measured by MRI (18.1 +/- 4.8 kg) was closely correlated with ALST mass (19.4 +/- 4.7 kg), with a correlation coefficient of 0.95, 0.84 and 0.89 in all subjects, men and women, respectively. If the previously published equations were used, the difference of SM mass measured by MRI and estimated from ALST was 3.37 +/- 1.75 kg and 3.25 +/- 1.70 kg in the absence and presence of age in the equation, respectively. On the basis of our own data, we generated 2 equations without or with age: SM = 0.98*ALST-0.99 (R2 = 0.91, P < 0.0001) and SM = 0.97* ALST-0.03*Age 0.66 (R2 = 0.92, P < 0.0001). By the application of these equations, the difference between measured and estimated SM mass decreased to -0.05 +/- 1.46 kg and -0.03 +/- 1.39 kg, respectively. (Figure Presented) Conclusions Estimation of SM mass by ALST is plausible, but requires population-specific equations of prediction. Our equations should be validated in other studies in Chinese.",Excluded
1100,"Genetic damage at specific gene loci in Drosophila with betatron X-rays The mutation rate was determined for mature sperm at eight specific gene loci on the third chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster using the low ion density radiations of 22 Mev betatron X-rays. A dose of 3000 rads of betatron X-rays produced a mutation rate of 4.36 X 10(-8) per rad/locus. Among the mutations observed, 66% were recessive lethals and 34% viable when homozygous. Only one of the 24 viable mutations was associated with a chromosome aberration. Among the 47 recessive lethals, no two-break aberrations were detected in 48.9% of the lethals, deletions were associated with 42.2%, inversions with 6.7% and translocations with 2.2%.-When these genetic results are compared to those for 250 KV X-rays, the mutation rate for betatron treatments was slightly lower (.76), the recessive lethal rate among induced mutations was higher, and the chromosome aberrations among lethal mutations were slightly lower than with 250 KV X-rays. Although the two types of irradiations differ by an ion density of approximately ten, the amount and types of inheritable genetic damage induced by the two radiations in mature sperm were not significantly different.",Excluded
98,"Prospective quality of life assessment between treatment groups for oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma Background. Postoperative radiation therapy (PORT) is frequently recommended to improve survival outcome. The effect of PORT-associated morbidity on patients' quality of life (QOL) is, however, not well established. This study assessed the effect of PORT on medium-term (ie, at 6 months) QOL in patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Methods. Patients completed the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and Quality of Life Questionnaire Core Head and Neck 35 (QLQ-HN35) at initial presentation, and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. Baseline QOL scores were adjusted for using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Results. Global health status (mean difference = 13.3; p =.042) and xerostomia (mean difference = 35.4; p =.003) were significantly worse at 6 months in patients who received PORT compared to those treated with surgery alone. Conclusion. The survival advantage needs to be balanced against increased treatment toxicity. PORT is associated with reduced global health status, increased xerostomia, and marginally increased levels of fatigue at 6 months posttreatment for oral cavity cancer. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
283,"Irradiated male tsetse from a 40-year-old colony are still competitive in a Riparian forest in Burkina Faso BACKGROUND: Tsetse flies are the cyclical vectors of African trypanosomosis that constitute a major constraint to development in Africa. Their control is an important component of the integrated management of these diseases, and among the techniques available, the sterile insect technique (SIT) is the sole that is efficient at low densities. The government of Burkina Faso has embarked on a tsetse eradication programme in the framework of the PATTEC, where SIT is an important component. The project plans to use flies from a Glossina palpalis gambiensis colony that has been maintained for about 40 years at the Centre International de Recherche-Developpement sur l'Elevage en zone Subhumide (CIRDES). It was thus necessary to test the competitiveness of the sterile males originating from this colony., METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: During the period January-February 2010, 16,000 sterile male G. p. gambiensis were released along a tributary of the Mouhoun river. The study revealed that with a mean sterile to wild male ratio of 1.16 (s.d. 0.38), the abortion rate of the wild female flies was significantly higher than before (p = 0.026) and after (p = 0.019) the release period. The estimated competitiveness of the sterile males (Fried index) was 0.07 (s.d. 0.02), indicating that a sterile to wild male ratio of 14.4 would be necessary to obtain nearly complete induced sterility in the female population. The aggregation patterns of sterile and wild male flies were similar. The survival rate of the released sterile male flies was similar to that observed in 1983-1985 for the same colony., CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We conclude that gamma sterilised male G. p. gambiensis derived from the CIRDES colony have a competitiveness that is comparable to their competitiveness obtained 35 years ago and can still be used for an area-wide integrated pest management campaign with a sterile insect component in Burkina Faso.",Excluded
474,"Functional MR urography for assessment of obstructive and reflux uropathies Purpose - Objective. In congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) the role of MRI for classification is expanded by obtaining functional data. MAG3 scintigraphy is considered gold standard for functional analysis. Material and methods. From 04/2010 to 01/2012 20 patients from one university hospital were examined by a standardised MR urography (MRU) in a 1.5 Tesla scanner after i.v. hydration and furosemide i.v. The data was processed by a dedicated software (CHOP-fMRU). Results were compared with Tc99m MAG3 scintigraphy. Results. Twenty patients (5 female, 15 male; age 5 weeks to 18.4 years) had both MR urography and MAG3 scintigraphy (1 to 484; average 48 days). All patients had isolated or combined CAKUT (6 duplex kidneys; 7 proximal, 11 distal ureteral stenoses; 8 subvesical obstructions; 10 VUR). Split renal function values differed by an average 8.2 % (min 1 %, max 18 %). Curve types after O' Reilly were available in 36 kidneys (4 kidneys were multicystic dysplastic with no residual organ function). There was a relevant discrepancy in one case only (norml in scintigraphy, relevant obstruction in MRU). Discussion and conclusions. X-ray excretion urography was replaced by earlier MRU. The CHOP-fMRU examination protocol is very robust and reliable and able to give as much information as MAG3 scintigraphy. It is now possible to receive information on morphology, excretion, and split renal function with one examination.",Excluded
853,"Spin echo functional MRI in bilateral auditory cortices at 7T: An application of B1 shimming Ultra high fields (UHF) permit unprecedented explorations of functional organizations and insight into basic neuronal processes. Increases in the signal and contrast to noise ratios have allowed increases in the spatial resolution of T2* weighted gradient echo (GE) echo planar imaging (EPI). Furthermore, while the use of T2 weighted imaging methods at UHF (e.g. spin echo (SE) EPI, gradient and spin echo (GRASE) EPI) can also permit higher resolution images, they in addition allow for increased spatial specificity of functional responses, permitting the in-vivo study of functional organizations down to the columnar level of the cortex. The study of the visual cortex has, thus far, benefitted the most from higher resolution T2 weighted studies as achieving the required transmit B1 magnitude at 7T is more challenging in other brain regions, such as the auditory cortex. As such, auditory fMRI studies at UHF have been limited to T2* weighted GE sequences. Recent advances in multi-channel RF transmission (e.g. B1 shimming) have enabled procedures to efficiently address deficiencies in transmit B1 profiles. However, these techniques, shown to be advantageous in anatomical imaging at UHF, are not generally utilized to facilitate T2 weighted fMRI studies.Here we investigate the feasibility of applying B1 shimming to achieve efficient RF transmission in the human auditory cortex. We demonstrate that, with B1 shimming, functional responses to simple tones and to complex sounds (i.e. voices, speech, animal cries, tools and nature) can be efficiently measured with T2 weighted SE-EPI in the bilateral human auditory cortex at 7T without exceeding specific absorption rate (SAR) limits. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
694,"Postoperative chemotherapy vs. chemoradiotherapy for thoracic esophageal cancer: A prospective randomized clinical trial Background: Neither postoperative radiotherapy nor chemotherapy alone provided a survival benefit after curative esophagectomy for esophageal squamous carcinoma. Material(s) and Method(s): Of 103 consecutive patients who underwent potentially curative esophagectomy for esophageal squamous carcinoma, 45 patients with advanced cancers without preoperative adjuvant treatments were prospectively randomized to two groups; postoperative chemotherapy alone (Group A, n = 23) and postoperative radio/chemotherapy (Group B,n = 22). In Group A, cisplatin (CDDP) (50 mg/m2) was given by intravenous infusion on days 1 and 15, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (300 mg/m2) was given daily by continuous intravenous infusion for 5 weeks. In Group B, in addition to the same chemotherapeutic regimen of Group A, 50 Gy of radiotherapy was given to the mediastinum over 5 weeks. The immunohistochemical staining of tumoral p53 and microvessel density was undertaken to correlate to the radio/chemosensitivity. Result(s): There were no significant differences in the clinicopathologic characteristics between the two groups. The median dose of 5-FU and CDDP administered were not significantly different between the two groups. The mean (SD) dose of radiotherapy in Group B was 42 + 10 Gy. The 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates in Group A were 100, 63 and 38% and those in Group B were 80, 58 and 50%, respectively (P = 0.97). In each group, four patients succumbed to locoregional recurrences. Tumoral p53 was immunohistochemically negative in 43% in Group A and 77% in Group B (P = 0.03), indicating that many patients in Group B might be potentially sensitive to radiochemotherapy. The 3- and 5-year survival rates (75 and 64%) of patients with p53 negative expression (n = 18) were significantly (P = 0.03) better than those with p53 positive expression {n = 27, 44 and 26%). The long-term survival was better for patients with p53 negative tumours than those with p53 positive tumours in Group B (P = 0.06 by long-rank test, P < 0.05 by Generalized-Wilcoxon test). However, the long-term survival was not different between the patients who had p53 negative and positive tumours in Group A (P = 0.19). These data suggest that there were no survival advantage for patients receiving radiotherapy in Group B, instead p53 negative tumours appeared to have a favorable prognosis. Conclusion(s): Postoperative radiotherapy administered concurrently with chemotherapy does not provide a survival benefit compared with chemotherapy alone. Tumoral p53 expression has a predictive value for survival in patients treated with postoperative radio/chemotherapy. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
277,"Intestinal and colonic motor alterations associated with irradiation-induced diarrhoea in rats Localized application of ionizing radiation to the gastrointestinal tract frequently elicits responses, which include diarrhoea. The origin of this symptom is not clear but has been attributed to loss of epithelial integrity, together with alterations in motility and increased secretion. The purpose of this study was to examine whether a 10 Gy abdominal gamma irradiation leads to an inflammatory reaction, and to compare intestinal and colonic motility in controls and abdominally irradiated rats 1, 3 and 7 days after irradiation, using an electromyographic technique. The motility parameters analysed were the frequency and velocity of propagation of migrating myoelectric complexes (MMC) in the jejunum and colonic spike activity (long spike bursts; LSB) per 10 min in fasted rats. The MMC frequency was significantly reduced on days 1 and 7 after irradiation and the MMC pattern was markedly disrupted on day 3. The frequency of colonic LSB was significantly reduced on days 1, 3 and 7. Mouth to anus transit was significantly accelerated on day 3 only and diarrhoea was observed at this time. Myeloperoxidase activity in the jejunum and colon was also increased on this day only. It is concluded that irradiation-induced diarrhoea occurs contemporaneously with disruption of MMC in the small intestine.",Included
490,"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy in 16 patients with locally advanced papillary thyroid carcinoma-a phase 1 study Background and Objectives: It is believed that chemotherapy (ChT) is ineffective in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). The aim of our retrospective chart review was to find out if neodjuvant ChT before thyroid surgery had any effect on the size of primary tumor in patients with PTC. Method(s): In the period 1976-2006, 1,207 patients were treated for PTC at our Institute. The study included 16 patients (13 women, 3 men; mean age 63.5 years) with PTC, who were treated with neoadjuvant ChT from 1988-2005. Poorly differentiated PTC, classical PTC, follicular variant of PTC and Hurthle cell variant of PTC was diagnosed in five cases, five, three and three cases, respectively. A mean tumor diameter was 9.9 cm (range 5-22 cm). Seven patients had pT4 tumor. Regional metastases were detected in ten patients and distant metastases in seven patients. ChT consisted of Vinblastine in eleven cases, Vinblastine with Adriamyin in two cases and other schedules in three cases. Three patients were treated also with preoperative external irradiation. Result(s): Altogether, 40 cycles of ChT were given. After ChT tumor size decreased in all 16 patients: for more than 50% in seven (= 44%) patients and for less than 50% in nine patients. R0, R1 and R2 resection was performed in two, ten and four cases, respectively. Median survival of our patients was 92 (range 11-240) months. Six patients are still alive (median survival 157 months) and two of them have no evidence of disease. Two patients died of causes not related to carcinoma, while eight patients died of PTC (five of distant metastases, one of locoregional disease, two of distant metastases and locoregional disease). Conclusion(s): Neoadjuvant ChT before thyroid surgery may be effective in patients with locally advanced PTC. After neoadjuvant ChT, in 44% of our patients the tumor size decreased for more than 50%.",Excluded
472,"Synovial sarcoma presenting as soft tissue rheumatic syndrome: A challenge for the clinician Purpose: Despite of its name, synovial sarcoma (SS) does not have synovial origin; it arises from the primitive mesenchyme of the tendon sheath and fascial aponeurosis. SS is frequently misdiagnosed as a benign soft tissue condition. Will be described clinical and histopathological features of patients with diagnosis of SS, emphasizing those manifestations that may lead to misdiagnosis of soft tissue rheumatism. Method(s): A retrospective chart, imaging and pathological review of consecutive histopathological proved cases of SS, registered between January 2000 to December 2008 at Pathology department. Result(s): 27 patients (17 male 63%; 10 female, 37%). The average age at diagnosis was 28 years (11 - 63 years). Anatomical regions involved were, lower limb in 93% (foot 11, 41%; ankle 4, 15%; knee 4, 15%; thigh 4, 15%; inguinal region 2, 7%) and upper limb in 2, 7%; arm and forearm,). Signs and symptoms at presentation were: pain in all cases, palpable deep-seated swelling or periarticular mass in 22 (81%), decrease range of joint motion in 44%, weight loss in 18%, skin color changes in 7%, and muscle weakness in 4%. Eleven (34%) were initially diagnosed as benign rheumatologic conditions: synovitis in 3 (11%); fasciitis in 2 (7%); Mortonxs neuroma; arthrofibrosis; chronic bursitis, synovial cyst, bunionette, and tarsal tunnel syndrome 1 (4%) instance each. The time elapsed since onset of symptoms to diagnosis was 40 months (1 - 156 months). The more advantageos imaging studies that helped defining the presence of a soft-tissue tumor were MRI, CT-scan, scintigraphy and X-rays. In all cases a biopsy was necessary to confirm diagnosis. Surgical treatment was: amputation in 11 patients (41%), block resection in 6 (22%) and marginal resection in 5 (18.5%). Five patients (18.5%) refused surgical treatment. The size of the tumors ranged from 1-to 12 cm. Histological subtype was identified as monophasic (24/89%) and biphasic (3/11%). Patients were classified according to the TNM system as follows: T1N0M0 19(70%), T2N0M0 2(7%) T2N1M0 1(4%) and T2N1M1 5(19%). They also were categorized according to the IRSG classification as type I in 18 patients (67%), type II in 2 (7%), type III in 6 (22%) and type IV in 1 case (4%). Ten (37%) patients underwent adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The average follow-up was 51 months (6-96), local recurrences and metastases were in 7 patients (26%). Fifteen (55.5%) patients were alive and disease free. Conclusion(s): It is essential that the Rheumatologist retain awarness of SS, particularly in young male patients presenting with slow growth, palpable, deep-seated soft tissue swelling or mass in close proximity to joints of the lower extremities. SS should be included in the differential diagnosis of soft tissue rheumatic syndromes.",Excluded

It has been shown that the higher is the stock radioresistance, the higher are repair capacity of the stock. However, it has been revealed that relatively independent combining of radioresistance and repair intensity is possible, excluding one, forbidden"" combination: there are no organisms which are sensitive to radiation and have a high repair level. The last law appears to have a general biological nature, it is characteristic for microorganisms (Escherichia coli), plants (Vicia faba) and insects (D. melanogaster).""",Excluded
716,"Diagnostic accuracy of 320-row computed tomography as compared with invasive coronary angiography in unselected, consecutive patients with suspected coronary artery disease Noninvasive coronary angiography with multislice computed tomography (CT) scanners is feasible with high sensitivity and negative predictive value. The radiation exposure associated with this technique, however, is high and concerns in the widespread use of CT have arisen. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of coronary angiography using 320-row CT, which avoids exposure-intensive overscanning and overranging. We prospectively studied 118 unselected consecutive patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) referred for invasive coronary angiography (ICA). All patients had 320-row CT within 1 week of ICA, which, together with quantitative analysis, served as the reference standard. Of the 65 out of 118 patients who were diagnosed as having CAD by ICA, 64 (98 %) were correctly identified at 320-row CT. Noteworthy, 320-row CT correctly detected CAD in 3 patients with atrial fibrillation and ruled out the disease in the other 8 patients. From 151 significant coronary stenoses detected on ICA, 137 (91 %) were correctly identified with 320-row CT. In the per-patient analysis, sensitivity and specificity of 320-row CT were 98 and 91 %, respectively. In the per-vessel analysis, sensitivity and specificity of 320-row CT were 93 and 95 %, respectively. In the per segment analysis, sensitivity and specificity of 320-row CT were 91 and 99 %, respectively. Diameter stenosis determined with the use of CT showed good correlation with ICA (P < 0.001, R = 0.81) without significant underestimation or overestimation (-3.1 +/- 24.4 %; P = 0.08). Comparison of CT with ICA revealed a significantly smaller effective radiation dose (3.1 +/- 2.3 vs. 6.5 +/- 4.2 mSv; P < 0.05) and amount of contrast agent required (99 +/- 51 vs. 65 +/- 42 ml, P < 0.05) for 320 row CT. The present study in an unselected population including patients with atrial fibrillation demonstrates that 320-row CT may significantly reduce the radiation dose and amount of contrast agent required compared with ICA while maintaining a very high diagnostic accuracy. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.",Excluded
330,"Experienced Mindfulness Meditators Exhibit Higher Parietal-Occipital EEG Gamma Activity during NREM Sleep Over the past several years meditation practice has gained increasing attention as a non-pharmacological intervention to provide health related benefits, from promoting general wellness to alleviating the symptoms of a variety of medical conditions. However, the effects of meditation training on brain activity still need to be fully characterized. Sleep provides a unique approach to explore the meditation-related plastic changes in brain function. In this study we performed sleep high-density electroencephalographic (hdEEG) recordings in long-term meditators (LTM) of Buddhist meditation practices (approximately 8700 mean hours of life practice) and meditation naive individuals. We found that LTM had increased parietal-occipital EEG gamma power during NREM sleep. This increase was specific for the gamma range (25-40 Hz), was not related to the level of spontaneous arousal during NREM and was positively correlated with the length of lifetime daily meditation practice. Altogether, these findings indicate that meditation practice produces measurable changes in spontaneous brain activity, and suggest that EEG gamma activity during sleep represents a sensitive measure of the long-lasting, plastic effects of meditative training on brain function. © 2013 Ferrarelli et al.",Excluded

371,"Effect of proton pump inhibitors on hepatic regeneration INTRODUCTION: The liver is critical in multiple processes, including the clearance of endogenous compounds, the synthesis of macromolecules, and organ-specific biotransformation processes. Therefore, the liver's regenerating capacity is of vital importance. Multiple pathways are activated in the complex process that leads to hepatic regeneration. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of proton pump inhibitors omeprozole, lansoprazole, and pantoprazole on hepatic regeneration following partial hepatectomy., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four groups were formed with 32 rats in each. Partial liver resections were performed for all animals. Omeprazole (71.4 microg/day), lansoprazole (107 microg/day), pantoprazole (143 microg/day) and placebo (0.5 cm(3)) were administered to the groups respectively. A quarter of the rats in each group were sacrificed on the 1st postoperative day. The rest were sacrificed on the 3rd, 5th and 7th postoperative days. The remnant regenerating liver mass was removed and weighed, and Ki-67 monoclonal antibody levels were measured., RESULTS: There was no statistical difference between the four groups on the first day in evaluating the weight of the liver mass (p = 0.09) and Ki-67 (p = 0.268) levels. Only the omeprazole group showed a difference; the Ki-67 level was lower in the omeprazole group on the 3rd (p = 0.003, p = 0.0001, p = 0.003), 5th (p = 0.017, p = 0.001, p = 0.0001) and 7th (p = 0.0001) days compared to the other groups. Also the weight of the remnant liver mass was lower in the omeprazole group on the 3rd, 5th and 7th (p = 0.0001) days., CONCLUSION: We figured out that lansoprazole and pantoprazole have no effects on liver regeneration, whereas omeprazole showed a negative effect on hepatic regeneration.",Excluded
1125,"Effects of glutamine for prevention of radiation-induced esophagitis: a double-blind placebo-controlled trial Purpose Acute radiation-induced esophagitis (ARIE) leads to treatment delays, decreased quality of life (QOL), and secondary adverse events such as weight loss. Grade 3 ARIE occurs in 15%-30% of patients undergoing radiotherapy to the esophagus, leading to disruption or discontinuation of treatment. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of glutamine, a common nutritional supplement, on ARIE in patients with thoracic malignancies. Patients and methods This double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled patients with advanced thoracic malignancies receiving concurrent chemotherapy/radiotherapy or radiotherapy alone, with radiation doses to the esophagus >=45 Gy. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive 4 g of glutamine or glycine placebo twice daily. The primary objective was to determine whether glutamine decreases the severity of ARIE in these patients. Secondary objectives included assessment of the effects of glutamine on other measures of ARIE, weight, symptom burden measure assessed by the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI-HN) questionnaire and the toxicity profile of glutamine. Results At the time of interim analysis, 53 patients were enrolled: 27 in the glutamine arm and 26 in the placebo arm. There was no difference in the incidence of esophagitis in the first 6 weeks of radiotherapy between the glutamine and placebo arms (74% versus 68%; P = 1.00). There were no significant differences between the two arms for time to onset of esophagitis. The duration of ARIE was shorter (6.3 versus 7.1 weeks; P = 0.54) and median weight loss was lower (0.9 kg versus 2.8 kg; p = 0.83) in the glutamine arm versus the placebo arm. The groups differ significantly in core symptom severity (2.1 vs 1.5, p <.03) but not in head and neck specific symptom severity (1.2 vs 1.1, p <.60) nor in symptom interference (2.1 vs 1.7, p <.22). There was no grade 3 or higher adverse event at least possibly related to glutamine. The study was terminated for futility following interim analysis. Conclusion Oral glutamine was not associated with significant improvement in severity of ARIE, weight loss, head and neck specific symptoms or symptom interference compared with placebo in patients with advanced thoracic malignancies receiving radiotherapy to the esophagus.

697,"Multidisciplinary therapy consisting of minimally invasive resection, irradiation, and intra-arterial infusion of 5-fluorouracil for maxillary sinus carcinomas Background Current goals for the treatment of maxillary sinus carcinoma include the preservation of vision, eating, communication, and appearance, as well as the achievement of a cure. Methods Japanese patients (n = 121) with maxillary sinus carcinoma were analyzed retrospectively. All patients underwent multidisciplinary therapy including minimally invasive resection, 20 Gy irradiation, and intra-arterial infusion of 5-fluorouracil. Results The 5- and 10-year overall survival rates were 73% and 68%, respectively. In 97 patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), the 5- and 10-year overall survival rates were 76% and 70%, respectively. All 29 patients with orbital invasion retained the orbital contents, and 21 of these patients demonstrated adequate visual acuity. There were 16 complications, including trismus (5 patients), double vision (5 patients), fistula formation (3 patients), and cataract (3 patients). Conclusion A multidisciplinary therapy, consisting of minimally invasive resection, irradiation, and regional chemotherapy, can yield good patient prognosis and quality of life after treatment. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
499,"The Impact of Radiation Dose and Fractionation on Outcomes for Limited-Stage Small-Cell Lung Cancer Purpose: To review the treatment outcomes of limited-stage small-cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) patients and to compare the outcomes among three groups in which the total radiation doses were 45 Gy with accelerated hyperfractionation (AHF), <54 Gy with standard fractionation (SF), and >=54 Gy with SF. Methods and Materials: LS-SCLC patients that had been treated with chemoradiotherapy between 1997 and 2007 at Aichi Cancer Center Hospital were reviewed in this study. Of the 127 eligible patients, there were 37 patients in the AHF group, 29 in the SF <54 Gy group, and 61 in the SF >=54 Gy group. Result(s): Fifty-five patients (43%) were alive at the time of this analysis, and the median follow-up time of the surviving patients was 33 months. The median survival times were 30.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 16.3-43.7) for the AHF group, 14.0 months (CI 6.6-21.4) for the SF <54 Gy group, and 41.0 months (CI 33.9-48.1) for the SF >= 54 Gy group. As for the local control rates, and the overall and progression-free survival rates, all outcomes were significantly lower in the SF <54 Gy group than in the other two groups, although no significant difference was found between the AHF and SF >=54 Gy groups. Conclusion(s): These results suggest the importance of a high dose of radiation when using once-daily regimen. This study will support future prospective studies to establish optimal radiation doses and fractionation. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1008,"Cytogenetic and molecular characterization of plutonium-induced rat osteosarcomas The association between ionizing radiation and the subsequent development of osteosarcoma has been well described, but little is known about the cytogenetic and molecular events, which could be involved in the formation of radiation-induced osteosarcomas. Here, we performed comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to detect chromosomal copy number changes in a series of 16 rat osteosarcomas induced by injection of plutonium-238. Recurrent gains/amplifications were observed at chromosomal regions 3p12-q12, 3q41-qter, 4q41-qter, 6q12-q16, 7q22-q34, 8q11-q23, 9q11-q22, 10q32.1-qter, and 12q, whereas recurrent losses were observed at 1p, 1q, 3q23-q35, 5q21-q33, 8q24-q31, 10q22-q25, 15p, 15q, and 18q. The gained region at 7q22-q34 was homologous to human chromosome bands 12q13-q15/8q24/22q11-q13, including the loci of Mdm2, Cdk4, c-Myc and Pdgf-b genes. The lost regions at 5q21-q33, 10q22-q25 and 15q contained tumor suppressor genes such as p16INK4a/p19ARF, Tp53 and Rb1. To identify potential target gene(s) for the chromosomal aberrations, we compared the expression levels of several candidate genes, located within the regions of frequent chromosomal aberrations, between the tumors and normal osteoblasts by using quantitative RT-PCR analysis. The Cdk4, c-Myc, Pdgf-b and p57KIP2 genes were thought to be possible target genes for the frequent chromosomal gain at 7q22-34 and loss at 1q in the tumors, respectively. In addition, mutations of the Tp53 gene were found in 27% (4 of 15) osteosarcomas. Our data may contribute to further understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying osteosarcomas induced by ionizing radiation in human.",Excluded
649,"Pre-apoptotic response to therapeutic DNA damage involves protein modulation of Mcl-1, Hdm2 and Flt3 in acute myeloid leukemia cells Background: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells are characterized by non-mutated TP53, high levels of Hdm2, and frequent mutation of the Flt3 receptor tyrosine kinase. The juxtamembrane mutation of FLT3 is the strongest independent marker for disease relapse and is associated with elevated Bcl-2 protein and p53 hyper-phosphorylation in AML. DNA damage forms the basic mechanism of cancer cell eradication in current therapy of AML. Hdm2 and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 members are among the most intensely induced genes immediately after chemotherapy and Hdm2 is proposed a role in receptor tyrosine kinase regulation. Thus we examined the DNA damage related modulation of these proteins in relation to FLT3 mutational status and induction of apoptosis. Result(s): Within one hour after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR), the AML cells (NB4, MV4-11, HL-60, primary AML cells) showed an increase in Flt3 protein independent of mRNA levels, while the Hdm2 protein decreased. The FLT3 mutant MV4-11 cells were resistant to IR accompanied by presence of both Mcl-1 and Hdm2 protein three hours after IR. In contrast, the FLT3 wild type NB4 cells responded to IR with apoptosis and pre-apoptotic Mcl-1 down regulation. Daunorubicin (DNR) induced continuing down regulation of Hdm2 and Mcl-1 in both cell lines followed by apoptosis. Conclusion(s): Both IR and DNR treatment resulted in concerted protein modulations of Mcl-1, Hdm2 and Flt3. Cell death induction was associated with persistent attenuation of Mcl-1 and Hdm2. These observations suggest that defining the pathway(s) modulating Flt3, Hdm2 and Mcl-1 may propose new strategies to optimize therapy for the relapse prone FLT3 mutated AML patients. © 2007 Wergeland et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Included
