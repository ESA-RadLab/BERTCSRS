27,"Modifying Effect of Chronic Atrophic Gastritis on Radiation Risk for Noncardia Gastric Cancer According to Histological Type. The findings from previously published studies have suggested that radiation exposure is associated with increased mortality and incidence of gastric cancer. However, few cohort studies have incorporated risk factors such as Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection or chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG). The current study is aimed at evaluating the modifying effect of CAG on radiation risk of noncardia gastric cancer by histological type, by reanalyzing data from a nested case-control study conducted within the longitudinal clinical cohort of atomic bomb survivors. The analysis was restricted to 297 intestinal- or diffuse-type noncardia cases and 873 controls rematched to the cases on gender, age, city, and time and type of serum storage, and countermatched on radiation dose. Multivariable-adjusted relative risks [95% confidence interval (CI)] of noncardia gastric cancer were 3.9 (2.1-7.2) for H. pylori IgG seropositivity with cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) IgG low titer, 2.6 (1.9-3.6) for CAG, 1.9 (1.3-2.8) for current smoking, and 1.4 (1.1-1.9) for 1 Gy irradiation. Among subjects without CAG, the relative risk (95% CI) of noncardia gastric cancer at 1 Gy was 2.3 (1.4-3.7), whereas relative risk (95% CI) at 1 Gy was 1.1 (0.8-1.5) among subjects with CAG (for the overall interaction, P = 0.012). By histological type, the risk at 1 Gy was high for diffuse type without CAG, with adjusted relative risk (95% CI) of 3.8 (2.0-7.6), but was not high for diffuse type with CAG or for intestinal-type irrespective of CAG status. The results indicate that radiation exposure is associated with increased risk of diffuse-type noncardia gastric cancer without CAG, and this association exists despite adjustment for H. pylori infection and smoking habit.

31,"Expression changes of ERK1/2, STAT3 and SHP-2 in bone marrow cells from gamma-ray induced leukemia mice. The aim is to clarify expression changes of ERK1/2, STAT3 and SHP-2 in bone marrow cells from gamma-ray induced leukemia mice. A mouse model of gamma-ray induced leukemia was produced, and by means of quantitative real-time PCR, immunoprecipitation, Western blotting and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), the expression of mRNA and protein, phosphorylation level, and protein activity of ERK1/2, STAT3 and SHP-2 in bone marrow cells were investigated in these mice. The results indicated that mRNA and protein expressions of ERK1/2 were upregulated, with significant increase of phosphorylation level and protein activity, but with insignificant differences in mRNA and protein expressions, phosphorylation level and protein activity of STAT3 and SHP-2 in bone marrow cells from gamma-ray induced leukemia mice compared to the radiation/tumor-free or control mice. It is concluded that in the pathogenesis of gamma-ray induced leukemia in Balb/C mice, activated ERK1/2 pathway may play a role, without involving STAT3 pathway; meanwhile, SHP-2 exerts no regulative effect on pathways of Ras-ERK1/2 and JAK-STAT.",Included
39,"Multilocus inheritance determines predisposition to alpha-radiation induced bone tumourigenesis in mice. In a recent study, we presented evidence for genetic predisposition governing radiation osteosarcomagenesis in mice. Following the incorporation of the bone-seeking alpha emitter 227Th, approximately 25% of the variance in osteosarcoma incidence was determined by inherited genetic factors. We have now mapped 5 susceptibility loci in crosses between the more susceptible BALB/c and the more resistant CBA/Ca strains. The major QTL on chromosome 14 overlaps with a locus that was already found in our previous study, using different strains of mice. Here, we investigate the effect by which the major susceptibility locus and 4 minor modifier loci interact to influence osteosarcoma predisposition. Following incorporation of the bone-seeking isotope, 100% of mice that harbour high-risk genotypes at all 5 susceptibility loci develop osteosarcoma with an average of 472 days latency times. In 10 mice inheriting exclusively low-risk genotypes only 1 osteosarcoma was found, arising after 733 days latency time. Inheritance of distinct combinations of BALB/c and CBA/Ca alleles at the susceptibility loci confer more extreme phenotypes in terms of susceptibility or resistance than observed in either of the two parental inbred strains. From the present study, we demonstrate that additive effects of multiple alleles, each making only a minor phenotypic contribution, can combine and significantly alter tumour risk. This mechanism can be of particular importance in genetically heterogeneous populations such as man. Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Included
42,"[Phosphorylation of histone H2AX in human lymphocytes as a possible marker of effective cellular response to ionizing radiation]. DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) which occurs in cells after ionizing radiation (IR) or chemical agents are the most dangerous lesions in eukariotic cells, which leads to cell death or chromosome abberations and cancer. One of the earliest response of cells to DSBs formation is phosphorylation by 139 serine of core variant histone H2AX in megabase chromatin domains around DSB (gamma-H2AX), which amplify signal and makes it possible to identify even one DSB in genome. Effective formation of gamma-H2AX is very important for maintenance of genome stability. Here, using immunofluorescent and Western blotting techniques, we studied dynamics of gamma-H2AX formation in human lymphocytes of various individuals irradiated ex vivo. We have found that dynamics of gamma-H2AX formation in lymphocytes differ between individuals but have similar kinetics and statistically is independent on people age.",Included
44,"Multidrug resistance determinants in acute myeloid leukemia developed in persons exposed to ionizing radiation due to the Chernobyl accident. The results of multidrug resistance determinants expression analysis on leukemic cells of 56 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients by immunophenotyping are presented. Of these, there were 21 persons exposed to ionizing radiation due to the Chemobyl accident with radiation-associated AML and 35 patients with spontaneous leukemia. The aim of this study was to determine if transport proteins (P-glycoprotein, LRP, and MDR1), apoptosis-related proteins (Fas, Bcl-2, Bax, p53, and Bcl-X(L)), and topoisomerase IIalpha expression in AML patients with the history of radiation exposure differed from those in spontaneous AML cases. Leukemic cells in patients with radiation-associated diseases compared to spontaneous AML more often overexpressed antiapoptotic oncoprotein Bcl-2 (12/21 vs. 6/35, p < 0.005) and less often demonstrated expression of Fas receptor (12/21 vs. 30/35, p < 0.05). Moreover, leukemic cells were simultaneously Fas negative and Bcl-2 positive in 4 out of 21 patients exposed to ionizing radiation but none of spontaneous cases had similar phenotype (p < 0.05). Leukemic cells in patients with radiation-associated AML compared to spontaneous cases more often were P-glycoprotein positive (12/20 vs 9/31, p < 0.05). P-glycoprotein overexpression significantly correlated with resistant disease in patients with radiation-associated AML (r = 0.47, p < 0.05), but was not a prognostic variable for the treatment outcome in terms of overall survival. Defects in pathways of drug-induced apoptosis and function of pump, that actively effluxes drugs could contribute significantly to developing drug resistance in radiation-associated AML.",Included
55,"Lifetime cancer risks from occupational radiation exposure among workers at interventional radiology departments. PURPOSE: Interventional medical radiation workers represent an under-studied population worldwide, although they receive relatively high occupational radiation doses. This study aimed to estimate the lifetime cancer risk from occupational radiation exposure among workers at interventional radiology departments. METHOD(S): A field survey of interventional medical workers in nationwide branches of the Korean Society of Interventional Radiology was conducted in 2017. Organ-specific radiation doses were estimated using national dose registry data and conversion coefficients provided by the International Commission on Radiological Protection. Lifetime attributable risk (LAR) and lifetime fractional risk (LFR) were calculated based on realistic exposure scenarios using a radiation risk assessment tool. RESULT(S): LARs from occupational radiation exposure until the age of retirement for all cancers combined were 338 (90.3-796.1), 121 (33.5-288.7), and 156 (41.1-390.6) per 100,000 individuals for male radiologists, male radiologic technologists, and female nurses, respectively. LFR for all cancers combined ranged from 0.22% (0.06-0.53) to 0.63% (0.17-1.47). Regarding the organ site, the highest LAR and LFR among all groups were observed for thyroid cancer. CONCLUSION(S): This study provides timely evidence of potential cancer burden from the current levels of occupational radiation exposure among workers at interventional radiology departments. The risks varied by occupational groups, and workers, particularly interventional radiologists, need to be carefully monitored for radiation.",Included

88,"Cohort study of occupational cosmic radiation dose and cancer mortality in German aircrew, 1960-2014. Objectives To determine cancer mortality compared with the general population and to examine dose-response relationships between cumulative occupational radiation dose and specific cancer outcomes in the German aircrew cohort. Methods For a cohort of 26 846 aircrew personnel, standardised mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated. Dose-response analyses were carried out using Poisson regression to assess dose-related cancer risks for the period 1960-2014. Exposure assessment comprises recently available dose register data for all cohort members and newly estimated retrospective cabin crew doses for 1960-2003. Results SMR for all-cause, specific cancer groups and most individual cancers were reduced in all aircrew groups. The only increases were seen for brain cancer in pilots (n=23, SMR 2.01, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.28) and for malignant melanoma (n=10, SMR 1.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 3.85). Breast cancer mortality among female cabin crew was similar to the general population (n=71, SMR 1.06, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.44). Overall median cumulative effective dose was 34.2 mSv (max: 116 mSv) for 1960-2014. No dose-response associations were seen in any of the models. For brain cancer, relative risks were elevated across dose categories. An indicative negative trend with increasing dose category was seen for large intestine cancer in female cabin crew (n=23). Conclusions There was no evidence for significant dose-response patterns for the considered cancer types. Interpretation of results remains difficult as cumulative dose is closely related to age. Future work should focus on investigating radiation jointly with other risk factors that may contribute to risks for specific cancers among aircrew.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

100,"Late side effects of radioactive iodine on salivary gland function in patients with thyroid cancer. BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess the late side effects of radioiodine therapy (RIT) on salivary gland function. One hundred eighty two patients were evaluated., METHODS: Assessment of salivary gland function was performed with salivary gland scintigraphy (SGS), sialometry, and subjective open questions to determine common side effects of RIT on salivary gland function., RESULTS: RIT had a strong association with decreased elimination counts by SGS. Patient age was the only variable associated with sialometry; age and the use of xerostomic drugs were strongly associated with decreased mean values of salivary flow. Dysphagia was strongly associated with RIT. Using multiple logistic regression analysis, age was determined to be an important factor associated with salivary gland dysfunction, and RIT was associated with impairment of saliva excretion., CONCLUSION: These results show that patients subjected to RIT have more difficulty in draining saliva, mainly from the parotid glands, which is associated with clinical dysphagia in this subset of patients.

110,"Sex and tissue-specific differences in low-dose radiation-induced oncogenic signaling. PURPOSE: The possible adverse health effects of low-dose radiation (LDR) exposure constitute a growing concern. Clinically and environmentally relevant exposures occur predominantly under chronic conditions, notwithstanding that most studies of LDR effects have been performed using a single acute exposure. Sex- and tissue-specificity of the LDR-induced changes have not been considered before. We investigated LDR-related expression patterns in muscle, liver and spleen of male and female mice subjected to acute and chronic LDR exposure. Genes involved in oncogenic signaling were of specific interest, as radiation is a well-known carcinogen., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the expression pattern of genes coding for growth factors and growth-factor receptors, cytoplasmic serine/threonine protein kinases, G-proteins and nuclear DNA-binding proteins, and other important components of oncogenic signaling., RESULTS: We found sex- and tissue-specific changes in the expression of Ras superfamily members (Nras, Rab2, Rab34, Vav2), protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms (PKCbeta, PKCmu), AP-1 factor components (Jun, JunB and FosB), Wnt signaling pathway members as well as in a variety of other cellular proto-oncogenes and oncogenes. Importantly, Western blot analysis of JunB, PKCmu and Rab2 proteins supported the transcriptomic data., CONCLUSIONS: Substantially different protein levels were observed in all three tissues (muscle, spleen and liver) of acutely and chronically irradiated female and male animals. Based on the obtained data and available literature, we discuss several possible mechanisms that may contribute to radiation-induced carcinogenesis in various tissues of males and females. From our results we could identify the genes that may serve as sex- and tissue-specific biomarkers of the LDR exposure.",Included
116,"Segmental Differences in Radiation-Induced Alterations of Tight Junction-Related Proteins in Non-Human Primate Jejunum, Ileum and Colon. Dysfunction of the intestinal epithelial barrier and leakage of luminal antigens and bacteria across the barrier have been linked to various human diseases. Intestinal permeability is regulated by intercellular structures, termed ""tight junction"" (Tj), which are disrupted after total-body irradiation (TBI). In this study, we investigated radiation-induced alterations in Tj-related proteins in the jejunum, ileum and colon of a non-human primate (NHP) model. NHPs were total-body irradiated with 6.7 and 7.4 Gy and intestines were procured at day 4, 7 and 12. Radiation exposure was found to induce significant increases in claudin-10 mRNA early (day 4) in all three gut segments and claudin-4 mRNA levels were repressed through day 12. TNF-alpha was highly induced in the jejunum and colon at early time points, but little induction was found in the ileum. Claudin-1 was induced only in the colon on day 4 postirradiation. Unlike the colon and jejunum, the ileum levels of claudin-7 were significantly downregulated through day 12 postirradiation. Western blot analysis revealed increased levels of claudin-2 on day 4 and of JAM-1 on day 7 postirradiation in all three gut segments. E-cadherin was downregulated on day 4 postirradiation in all segments, but remained reduced in the jejunum only until day 12. Taken together, these data suggest that exposure to radiation causes segment-specific alterations in the expression of Tj-related proteins. Interruption of Tjs may be a key factor contributing to injury to the intestinal mucosal barrier and increased intestinal permeability.",Included
156,"Gender difference in the development of ischemic heart disease in emergency workers of the Chernobyl accident. Objectives: Since women accounted for only 8.7% of the total number of Chernobyl emergency workers (EW), the radiation effect on cardiovascular system was previously studied mainly in men. So the goal of current investigation was to determine the development of ischemic heart disease (IHD) in men and women exposed to ionizing radiation. Method(s): The study included 598 EW of 1986 year (472 men and 126 women) who had no signs of cardiac pathology during they took part in elimination of consequences caused by the Chernobyl accident. For that time women's age was 41+/-6.9 years, but men 37.8+/-8.5 years (p=0.011). The female group was also significantly older than the male at the time of the examination (69.1+/-7.2 versus 63.7+/-10.4, p=0). Patients of both groups in 2012-2016 after admission in our hospital had cardiologist examination, electrocardiography, daily monitoring of electrocardiogram, echocardiography. Result(s): At the time of examination IHD in women was more often combined with arterial hypertension (94.4% compared to 87.7% in men, p=0.001), diabetes mellitus (27.0% vs. 23.9% in men, p=0.828), alimentary obesity (57.1% vs. 39.2%, p=0) and hypercholesterolemia (66.7% versus 60.4%, p=0.239). In both groups, the portion of patients with stroke was practically equal (9.5% and 9.7%) as well as with blockade (2.4% and 2.3%), atrial fibrillation (16.7% and 16.5%), and ventricular extrasystoles (7.9% and 7%). Men were more likely to have supraventricular arrhythmias (13.3% and 1.6%, p=0.042) and higher number of smokers (40.9% and 1.6%, p=0). It was shown that 25% of all male EW developed IHD in 11.7+/-0.5 years after irradiation, while the same number of EW-women after 15.5+/-1.3 years. Exactly half of male group had the diagnosis of IHD after 18.7+/-0.8 years while women after 21.6+/-0.7 years. After 24.7+/-0.4 and 26.8+/-0.5 years, IHD developed in 75% of men and women, respectively. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed high reliability of differences in the development of IHD in two examined groups (logrank test: chi<sup>2</sup> = 10.001, p=0,001). The median survival rate fell on the age of 57+/-0.6 years for men and 61.4+/-0.9 years of women. Conclusion(s): The gender specific features of IHD development in EW consisted in its earlier term of onset after irradiation in men than in women. Men developed IHD at younger age than women despite the presence of a greater number of people with risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia and obesity.",Included

164,"Do radiation-induced bystander effects correlate to the intrinsic radiosensitivity of individuals and have clinical significance?. It is well known that patients can vary in their normal tissue response to radiotherapy, and this can be problematic. As a result, radiobiologists have been using in vitro models to assess variation in response and elucidate the genetic determinants of this variation. However, the clinical relevance of these models is currently unknown. In this study, blood samples from healthy controls (n 20) and colorectal carcinoma patients (n 60) were cultured in vitro to assess two radiobiological end points in parallel: intrinsic radiosensitivity assayed by chromosomal aberrations (G2 scores) and radiation-induced bystander effects assayed by viability testing. Increased intrinsic radiosensitivity was observed in colorectal carcinoma donors (55) compared to the healthy donors (5) (P < 0.005). Similarly, more pronounced radiation-induced bystander effects were observed in the colorectal carcinoma donors compared to the healthy donors after 24 h exposure but not after 96 h exposure to donor irradiated cell conditioned medium (ICCM) (P < 0.05). All scores were tested for correlation with the age, sex and clinical stage of the colorectal carcinoma patients. The only statistically significant correlation was found in samples from severe Dukes D patients (P < 0.005), which had low/radioresistant G2 scores. No correlation was found between radiation-induced intrinsic sensitivity and bystander effects, which suggests that they may have separate underlying molecular mechanisms, but they both show clinical relevance in individual patient samples. © 2009 The Radiation Research Society.",Included

245,"Sequence variants in cell cycle control pathway, X-ray exposure, and lung cancer risk: a multicenter case-control study in Central Europe. Exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) results in various types of DNA damage and is a suspected cause of lung cancer. An essential cellular machinery against DNA damage is cell cycle control, which is regulated by several genes, including TP53, CCND1, and CDKN2A. Therefore, we hypothesized that the genetic variants in these three genes influence the predisposition of lung cancer (i.e., CCND1 G870A, CDKN2A Ala(148)Thr, TP53 Arg(72)Pro, and 16-bp repeat in intron 3) and that the effect of X-ray on lung cancer risk can be modified by the presence of these genetic variations. The study was conducted in 15 centers in 6 countries of Central Europe between 1998 and 2002. A total of 2,238 cases and 2,289 controls were recruited and provided DNA samples. Cases with positive family history were analyzed separately. The joint effect of X-ray and previous risk genotypes was assessed, and modification by sequence variants on X-ray dose-response relationship with lung cancer risk was evaluated. We found an overall effect of TP53 intron 3 16-bp repeats [odds ratio (OR), 1.99; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.27-3.13], which was stronger among cases with family history of lung cancer (OR, 2.98; 95% CI, 1.29-6.87). In addition, our results suggested an interaction that was greater than multiplicativity between TP53 intron 3 16-bp repeats and multiple X-ray exposures (interaction OR, 5.69; 95% CI, 1.33-24.3). We did not observe a main effect of CCND1 G870A polymorphism; however, the dose-response relationship between lung cancer risk and X-ray exposures was modified by CCND1 genotype with no risk from X-ray exposures among subjects who carried G/G genotype, intermediate risk [trend OR for X-ray, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.05-1.27) among subjects with G/A genotype, and highest risk [trend OR for X-ray, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.12-1.49) among subjects with A/A genotype. Sequence variants in cell cycle control pathway may increase the risk of lung cancer and modify the risk conferred by multiple X-ray exposures. However, a definite conclusion can only be drawn on replication by different studies among individuals who are highly exposed to IR.",Included

276,"Gamma irradiation. An effective procedure for bone banks, but does it make sense from an osteobiological perspective?. BACKGROUND: Bone grafts promote bone healing by supplying a three-dimensional structure that supports bone ingrowth. Autologous bone therefore still remains the ""gold standard"" for grafts. Unfortunately, autologous bone grafts are associated with an increased morbidity. In order to avoid such problems, intensive research has been carried out on alternative materials such as allogeneic bone. However, its use is dependent on bone banks and its availability is limited. Gamma irradiation is now becoming established as a procedure for inactivating bacteria, fungal spores and viruses. Its effects on the biomechanical properties of bone have been analyzed in numerous studies. However, the current literature provides little information as to the effects of gamma sterilization on the osteobiology of allogeneic bone grafts., PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of gamma-sterilized bone grafts on immunocompetent cells by an in vitro model (a culture of human bone marrow cells)., METHODS: We decided to use the model of human bone marrow cells in culture for the in vitro analysis because the physiological conditions in the human body can best be simulated in this model and the observed reactions are applicable to humans., RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION: In sum, we found a maximum immune response in gamma-irradiated bone grafts, which, interpreted as a sole result, must be seen as a negative biological effect. However, in view of the good clinical results for gamma-sterilized bone grafts other influences would seem to be the determining factors in clinical outcome. Further research is needed to gain a more exact understanding of these factors.",Included

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To study the distribution, extent and sonographic characterisation of radiation-induced carotid artery stenosis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients., METHODS: The distribution of plaques, the extent of stenosis, and the sonographic characterisation of the plaque at maximum stenosis were recorded in 71 NPC patients. The results were compared with the ultrasound results of a control group of 142 patients presenting with symptoms of cerebrovascular disease or carotid bruit., RESULTS: NPC patients had a higher incidence of carotid stenosis (77 vs. 50.7%). The common carotid arteries were most commonly affected by radiation-induced stenosis (93/142 vs. 37/284 in the control group), whereas the carotid bulb was the most commonly affected (56/284) site in the control group. Significantly more NPC patients had moderate-to-severe stenosis (21/71 vs. 27/142). Analysis of the sonographic appearance of radiation-induced and atherosclerotic plaques showed more diffuse involvement in the post-radiation group. Non-calcified plaques and intraplaque hypoechoic foci were also more frequent in the post-radiation group., CONCLUSIONS: Radiation-induced carotid stenosis is more diffuse in distribution, is associated with more severe luminal stenosis and has different sonographic plaque characterisation compared with carotid stenosis without radiation exposure.

328,"Increased radiation from Chernobyl decreases the expression of red colouration in natural populations of bank voles (Myodes glareolus). Pheomelanin is a pink to red version of melanin pigment deposited in skin and hair. Due to its bright colour, pheomelanin plays a crucial function in signalling, in particular sexual signalling. However, production of pheomelanin, as opposed to its dark alternative, eumelanin, bears costs in terms of consumption of antioxidants important for protection of DNA against naturally produced reactive oxidative species. Therefore, decreased expression of pheomelanin is expected in organisms exposed to severe oxidative stress such as that caused by exposure to chronic ionizing radiation. We tested if variable exposure to radiation among natural populations of bank voles Myodes glareolus in Chernobyl affected expression of red colouration in their dorsal fur. The relative redness of dorsal fur was positively correlated with weight, but also negatively correlated with the level of background radiation. These results suggest that the development of the natural red colouration in adult bank voles is affected by ionizing background radiation, and potentially causing elevated levels of oxidative stress. Reduced production of pheomelanin allows more antioxidants to mitigate the oxidative stress caused by radiation. However, changing natural animal colouration for physiological reasons can have ecological costs, if e.g. it causes mismatch with habitat colouration and conspicuousness for predators.",Included

In this paper, some final results of 25-year investigations carried out in Scientific Centre for Radiation Medicine and Burns MH RA (SCRMB) on the Armenian cohort of the Chernobyl accident consequences liquidators are shown. These results show that health conditions of the liquidators became worse during the whole observation period. A considerable development of both pathological states atypical of radiation damages and diseases, which may be considered as radiation-induced ones, was determined. Rise of the sickness rate of almost all organism systems, first of all, nervous, cardiovascular, respiratory and digestive ones, was observed. In 70% of liquidators the main disease was primarily detected after working on CNPP. In the intervening years, the average number of diagnoses per 1 liquidator increased from 1.5 in 1987 to 7-8 in the recent time. In addition to the detected diseases, particular functional shifts in neuropsychological and vegetative status of the liquidators were observed. The overwhelming majority of them have increased tonicity of the sympathetic vegetative nervous system, asthenic and depressive syndromes occurring in the form of weakness, somnolence, mood instability, mental capacity decrease, and memory defects. In the paper, the results of investigations aimed at clarification of changes in biological aging processes of the liquidators and assessment of their ""life quality"" features in terms of physical, psychical and social welfare are considered. Biological aged-related passportization in a definite part of liquidators elucidated an accelerated aging rate. The studies were performed with the help of SF-36 inquirer and indicated that health status aggravation of the liquidators also affected their life satisfaction. The ""life quality"" indices of the liquidators significantly concede the overall average standards by both physical health and psychical and social welfare scales.",Included

410,"Increased lung cancer risk due to residential radon in a pooled and extended analysis of studies in Germany. Residential radon has been shown to be a risk factor for lung cancer in several studies-but with limited power in each single study. The data of two case-control studies performed during 1990-1997 in Germany and used for previous publications have been extended and pooled. Both studies have identical study designs. In total, data of 2,963 incident lung cancer cases and 4,232 population controls are analyzed here. One-year radon measurements were performed in houses occupied during the 5-35 y prior to the interview. Conditional logistic and linear relative risk regression was used for the analysis. Measurements covered on average 70% of the exposure time window, with an average radon exposure of 61 Bq m(-3). The smoking and asbestos-adjusted ORs were 0.97 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 1.11] for 50-80 Bq m(-3), 1.06 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.30) for 80-140 Bq m(-3) and 1.40 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.89) for radon concentrations above 140 Bq m(-3), compared to the reference category <50 Bq m(-3). The linear increase in the odds ratio per 100 Bq m(-3) was 0.10 (95% CI -0.02 to 0.30) for all subjects and 0.14 (95% CI -0.03 to 0.55) for less mobile subjects who lived in only one home in the last 5-35 y. The risk coefficients generally were higher when measurement error in the radon concentrations was reduced by restricting the population. With respect to histopathology, the risk for small cell carcinoma was higher than for other subtypes. This analysis strengthens the evidence that residential radon is a relevant risk factor for lung cancer.",Included
430,"Sex- and APOE isoform-dependent effects of radiation on cognitive function. Clinical irradiation of the brain induces hippocampus-dependent cognitive impairments in some but not all individuals, suggesting the involvement of genetic risk factors. Deficiency of apolipoprotein E (APOE), which is important for the metabolism and redistribution of lipoproteins and cholesterol, increases behavioral impairments after irradiation, supporting a protective role for APOE against radiation-induced cognitive injury. Compared to APOE3, APOE4 increases while APOE2 decreases the risk of developing age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease, particularly in women. To determine the potential effects of APOE isoform and sex on radiation-induced cognitive impairments, we irradiated 2-month-old male and female APOE2, APOE3 and APOE4 mice and assessed their cognitive performance 3 months later. When hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory were assessed in the water maze, sham-irradiated female APOE2, APOE3 and APOE4 and irradiated female APOE2 mice showed spatial memory retention, but irradiated female APOE3 and APOE4 mice did not. Compared to sham-irradiated female APOE4 mice, irradiated female APOE4 mice also required more trials to reach criterion in the hippocampus-dependent passive avoidance test. Radiation had no effects on water maze or passive avoidance learning and memory of male APOE2, APOE3 or APOE4 mice, indicating that the effects of radiation on cognitive performance are dependent on sex- and APOE isoform.",Included

Beagle dogs were exposed once or repeatedly to 0.75-microns-diameter monodisperse aerosols of 239PuO2 by pernasal inhalation. The dogs that were exposed once received alveolar depositions (+/- standard deviation) of 3.9 +/- 1.9 kBq/kg body mass and accumulated doses of 23 +/- 8 Gy to the lung before death at 5.4 +/- 1.7 years after exposure. Dogs exposed repeatedly received a total alveolar deposition of 5.3 +/- 0.9 kBq/kg body mass during 7 to 10 semiannual exposures and accumulated doses of 22 +/- 5 Gy to the lung before death at 4.9 +/- 0.7 years after first exposure. Clearance of the plutonium from the lung in the dogs exposed repeatedly was slower than in the dogs exposed once. All dogs in the repeated-exposure study and all but one dog in the single-exposure study died from radiation effects. Pulmonary fibrosis accounted for 72% of the radiation-related deaths in the single-exposure study and 87% in the repeated-exposure study. The remaining dogs died with pulmonary cancer. Based on total cumulative radiation dose, the times after exposure to death from radiation pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis were not significantly different for single and repeated exposures. Thus dose rate does not appear to be an important factor in predicting death from radiation pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis for dogs inhaling 239PuO2.",Included
449,"Different trend for changing of mammalian plasma (serum) antioxidant activity after irradiation at large and low-doses. One of the path for research of antioxidant status in vivo is the determination of blood plasma (serum) antioxidant activity (AOA). AOA is an integral parameter for the contribution of different antiradical defense components which particular nomenclature is determined by a used method of definition. In the present work AOA is studied with usage of a system of suppression in vitro by blood plasma (serum) of a Fe(2+)-induced oxidation of a substrate from egg yolk lipoproteins. The contribution of separate components of a blood plasma to an integral index of AOA for human blood serum is studied. Urine acid, albumin, reduced glutathione, ascorbat, heparin, peroxidase and catalase had no activity. Apo-beta-lipoprotein, vitamin E, ceruloplasmin and transferring are introduce, possibly, the main contribution to AOA. The significant decrease of AOA was revealed after acute irradiation by gamma-rays of dogs (4.05 Gy) and mice (6 Gy). The irradiation of mice at low-dose (0.2 Gy), vice-versa, result to stimulation of AOA with clear peak value on 5 day.

475,"The lack of cytotoxic effect and radioadaptive response in splenocytes of mice exposed to low level internal beta-particle irradiation through tritiated drinking water in vivo. Health effects of tritium, a beta-emitter and a by-product of the nuclear industry, is a subject of significant controversy. This mouse in vivo study was undertaken to monitor biological effects of low level tritium exposure. Mice were exposed to tritiated drinking water (HTO) at 10 KBq/L, 1 MBq/L and 20 MBq/L concentrations for one month. The treatment did not result in a significant increase of apoptosis in splenocytes. To examine if this low level tritium exposure alters radiosensitivity, the extracted splenocytes were challenged in vitro with 2 Gy gamma-radiation, and apoptotic responses at 1 and 24 h were measured. No alterations in the radiosensitivity were detected in cells from mice exposed to tritium compared to sham-treated mice. In contrast, low dose gamma-irradiation at 20 or 100 mGy, resulted in a significant increase in resistance to apoptotic cell death after 2 Gy irradiation; an indication of the radioadaptive response. Overall, our data suggest that low concentrations of tritium given to mice as HTO in drinking water do not exert cytotoxic effect in splenocytes, nor do they change cellular sensitivity to additional high dose gamma-radiation. The latter may be considered as the lack of a radioadaptive response, typically observed after low dose gamma-irradiation. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Included

The authors conducted a study of an aboriginal community to determine if kidney func-tion had been affected by the chronic ingestion of uranium in drinking water from the community's drilled wells. Uranium concentrations in drinking water varied from < 1 to 845 ppb. This nonin-vasive study relied on the measurement of a combination of urinary indicators of kidney function and markers for cell toxicity. In all, 54 individuals (12-73 years old) participated in the study. Correlation of uranium excreted in urine with bio-indicators at p <=.05 indicated interference with the kidney's reabsorptive function. Because of the community's concerns regarding cancer incidence, the authors also calculated cumulative radiation doses using uranium intake in drinking water over the preceding 15-year period. The highest total uranium intake over this period was 1,761 mg. The risk of cancer from the highest dose, 2.1 mSv, is 13 in 100,000, which would be difficult to detect in the community studied (population size = 1,480). This study indicates that at the observed levels of uranium intake, chemical toxicity would be a greater health concern than would radiation dose. © 2009 Heldref Publications.",Included

BACKGROUND: Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy and stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) are both used for early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer. We carried out a propensity score-matched analysis to compare locoregional control (LRC).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: VATS lobectomy data from six hospitals were retrospectively accessed; SABR data were obtained from a single institution database. Patients were matched using propensity scores based on cTNM stage, age, gender, Charlson comorbidity score, lung function and performance score. Eighty-six VATS and 527 SABR patients were matched blinded to outcome (1:1 ratio, caliper distance 0.025). Locoregional failure was defined as recurrence in/adjacent to the planning target volume/surgical margins, ipsilateral hilum or mediastinum. Recurrences were either biopsy-confirmed or had to be PET-positive and reviewed by a tumor board.
RESULTS: The matched cohort consisted of 64 SABR and 64 VATS patients with the median follow-up of 30 and 16 months, respectively. Post-SABR LRC rates were superior at 1 and 3 years (96.8% and 93.3% versus 86.9% and 82.6%, respectively, P = 0.04). Distant recurrences and overall survival (OS) were not significantly different.
CONCLUSION: This retrospective analysis found a superior LRC after SABR compared with VATS lobectomy, but OS did not differ. Our findings support the need to compare both treatments in a randomized, controlled trial.",Included

BACKGROUND: Orthopedic strain and radiation exposure are recognized risk factors in personnel staff performing fluoroscopically guided cardiovascular procedures. However, the potential occupational health effects are still unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of health problems among personnel staff working in interventional cardiology/cardiac electrophysiology and correlate them with the length of occupational radiation exposure., METHODS AND RESULTS: We used a self-administered questionnaire to collect demographic information, work-related information, lifestyle-confounding factors, all current medications, and health status. A total number of 746 questionnaires were properly filled comprising 466 exposed staff (281 males; 44+/-9 years) and 280 unexposed subjects (179 males; 43+/-7years). Exposed personnel included 218 interventional cardiologists and electrophysiologists (168 males; 46+/-9 years); 191 nurses (76 males; 42+/-7 years), and 57 technicians (37 males; 40+/-12 years) working for a median of 10 years (quartiles: 5-24 years). Skin lesions (P=0.002), orthopedic illness (P<0.001), cataract (P=0.003), hypertension (P=0.02), and hypercholesterolemia (P<0.001) were all significantly higher in exposed versus nonexposed group, with a clear gradient unfavorable for physicians over technicians and nurses and for longer history of work (>16 years). In highly exposed physicians, adjusted odds ratio ranged from 1.7 for hypertension (95% confidence interval: 1-3; P=0.05), 2.9 for hypercholesterolemia (95% confidence interval: 1-5; P=0.004), 4.5 for cancer (95% confidence interval: 0.9-25; P=0.06), to 9 for cataract (95% confidence interval: 2-41; P=0.004)., CONCLUSIONS: Health problems are more frequently observed in workers performing fluoroscopically guided cardiovascular procedures than in unexposed controls, raising the need to spread the culture of safety in the cath laboratory.

Phenacoccus solenopsis is an aggressively invasive species that targets agricultural and ornamental plants, thereby threatening the world cotton industry and other crops. P. solenopsis has been listed as a quarantine insect in Europe and China. The utilization of phytosanitary irradiation as a potential treatment for disinfesting agricultural commodities in trade has expanded rapidly in recent years. A reasonable dose of radiation to eliminate P. solenopsis needs to be determined, taking into account the side effects of radiation on agricultural products and the species-specific tolerance of the insect to radiation. We applied radiation ranging from 50 to 200. Gy to P. solenopsis to determine the optimal dose. Both the radiation dose and the developmental stage of the insect were independent variables. Higher doses of radiation or lesser mature insect stages provided more effective treatment. In nymphs, a radiation dose of 100. Gy caused extinction of the irradiated population by disrupting ovary development, while 150. Gy caused 100% mortality. In adults, all tested doses of irradiation did not affect longevity, but we were able to prevent reproduction with high (150 and 200. Gy) doses. In P. solenopsis, a 100. Gy dose of radiation could eliminate the irradiated population in two generations. The mortality curve showed a steep slope beyond 150. Gy; thus, if killing all of the insects in a shorter amount of time is necessary, 200. Gy may be a reasonable dose for the quarantine treatment of the solenopsis mealybug. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Included
695,"Sex-Specific Effects of a Wartime-Like Radiation Exposure on Cognitive Function. Evaluating the risk for central nervous system (CNS) effects after whole-body or partial-body irradiation presents challenges due in part to the varied exposure scenarios in the context of occupational, accidental or wartime releases. Risk estimations are further complicated by the fact that robust changes in brain function are unlikely to manifest until significantly late post exposure times. Collectively, the current data regarding CNS radiation risk are conflicting in humans and a survey of the animal model data shows that it is similarly inconsistent. Due to the sparseness of such data, the current study was conducted using male and female mice to evaluate the brain for the delayed effects of a 2 Gy whole-body exposure to c rays starting six months postirradiation. Behavioral testing indicated sex-specific differences in the induction of anxiety-like behaviors and in the ability to abolish fear memories. Molecular analyses showed alterations in post-synaptic protein levels that might affect synaptic plasticity and increased levels of global DNA methylation, suggesting a potential epigenetic mechanism that might contribute to radiation-induced cognitive dysfunction. These data add to the understanding of the CNS response to whole-body irradiation and may lead to improved risk assessment and provide guidance in the development of effective radiation countermeasures to protect military personnel and civilians alike.",Included

The goal of this prospective case-control study was to determine whether repeated CT exposure is associated with increased frequency in chromosomal translocations. Two cohorts, comprised of case patients with a history of repeated CT exposure and age- and sex-matched CT-naive control patients (n = 48 per cohort), were consecutively enrolled in this single-institution study. CT-radiation exposure was estimated using dose-length products, and translocation frequencies of peripheral blood lymphocytes were assessed using whole chromosome paints by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Comparison of translocation frequencies between cases and controls was performed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test (paired samples), and the relationship between cumulative radiation exposure and translocation frequency was assessed using a partial correlation analysis. Translocation frequencies were significantly different between cases and controls (P = 0.0003). The median translocation frequency was 7 [95% confidence interval (CI): 6, 8] for cases and 4 (95% CI: 3, 6) for controls. By using cumulative radiation exposure as the effect variable and translocation frequency as the response variable, we found a significant correlation between cumulative radiation exposure and translocation frequency (r = 0.6579, P < 0.0001).

However, the deleterious effects of exposure to medical diagnostic low-dose X-rays remain a highly debated topic. The objective was to study the effects of medical diagnostic X-rays on human blood cells. Material(s) and Method(s): We studied the effects of medical diagnostic low-dose X-rays (80 kVp), i.e.,0.01 or 0.05 mGy, after the in vitro exposure of human red blood cells (RBCs) and peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMCs).Cells with no irradiation served as the control group. The biological endpoints that were used to determine the effects of medical diagnostic low-dose X-rays were hemolysis for RBCs and mitochondrial membrane potential, lysosomes, and the cell cycle for PBMCs. Result(s): Our results showed no changes in the hemolysis of RBCs and mitochondrial membrane potential, lysosome, or cell cycle in cells exposed to these low doses of X-rays when compared to the corresponding nonirradiated cells at all harvest timepoints. Conclusion(s): These results suggested that there were no deleterious effects of diagnostic low-dose X-rays when human RBCs and PBMCs were exposed in vitro.Copyright © 2021, Ibn Sina Trust.

Also a genetic association analysis was carried out in a sample of 149 cancer patients and 908 healthy controls occupationally exposed to gamma-radiation (153.2 +/- 204.6 mSv and 150.5 +/- 211.2 mSv, respectively). Eight SNPs of genes of DNA excision repair were genotyped (rs13181, rs1052133 , rs1042522, rs2305427, rs4244285, rs1045642, rs1805419 and rs1801133). The mutation profiles in heterozygous loci for selected SNP were different between sporadic tumors and tumors in patients exposed to radiation. In sporadic tumors, heterozygous genotype Arg/Pro of the rs1042522 SNP mutated into Arg/0 in 15 cases (9.6%) and 0/Pro in 14 cases (8.9%). The genotype Lys/Gln of the rs13181 SNP mutated into Lys/0 and 0/Gln in 9 and 4 cases, respectively. In tumors of patients exposed to low-level radiation, the rs1042522 Arg/0 mutated genotype was found in 12 cases (12.1%), while in 2 cases (2%) 0/Pro mutation was observed. Finally, the rs13181 0/Gln mutated genotype was observed in 15 cases (16,5%) Thus, our study showed the difference in patterns of allelic imbalance in tumors appeared under low-level radiation exposure and spontaneous tumors for selected SNPs. This suggests different mechanisms of inactivation of heterozygous genotypes in sporadic and radiation-induced tumors.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Included

860,"Multilocus inheritance determines predisposition to alpha-radiation induced bone tumourigenesis in mice. In a recent study, we presented evidence for genetic predisposition governing radiation osteosarcomagenesis in mice. Following the incorporation of the bone-seeking alpha emitter 227Th, ~25% of the variance in osteosarcoma incidence was determined by inherited genetic factors. We have now mapped 5 susceptibility loci in crosses between the more susceptible BALB/c and the more resistant CBA/Ca strains. The major QTL on chromosome 14 overlaps with a locus that was already found in our previous study, using different strains of mice. Here, we investigate the effect by which the major susceptibility locus and 4 minor modifier loci interact to influence osteosarcoma predisposition. Following incorporation of the bone-seeking isotope, 100% of mice that harbour high-risk genotypes at all 5 susceptibility loci develop osteosarcoma with an average of 472 days latency times. In 10 mice inheriting exclusively low-risk genotypes only 1 osteosarcoma was found, arising after 733 days latency time. Inheritance of distinct combinations of BALB/c and CBA/Ca alleles at the susceptibility loci confer more extreme phenotypes in terms of susceptibility or resistance than observed in either of the two parental inbred strains. From the present study, we demonstrate that additive effects of multiple alleles, each making only a minor phenotypic contribution, can combine and significantly alter tumour risk.

876,"Irradiation-resistance conferred by superoxide dismutase: possible adaptive role of a natural polymorphism in Drosophila melanogaster. The toxic effects of ionizing radiation to DNA are thought to be due to the generation of the superoxide radical, 02-. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), which scavenges 02-., has been invoked as a protecting enzyme against ionizing radiation in viruses, bacteria, mammalian cells in culture, and live mice. We now demonstrate that SOD is involved in the resistance of Drosophila melanogaster against irradiation. The protection is greatest when flies carry the S form of the enzyme (which exhibits highest in vitro specific activity), intermediate when they carry the F form of the enzyme, and lowest when they are homozygous for N, an allele that reduces the amount of the enzyme to 3.5% of the normal level. Natural selection experiments show that the fitness of the high-activity S allele is increased in an irradiated population relative to the nonirradiated control. These results point towards a possible adaptive function of the S/F polymorphism found in natural populations of D. melanogaster.",Included

Worms were exposed to 0, 10, 25, 45, 75, and 105 krad of gamma radiation from a 137cesium source and cultured in vitro for 10 days. Irradiation reduced production of microfilariae in a dose-dependent manner. Embryograms of irradiated female worms showed dose-related abnormalities with arrested development at the early embryo stage. Irradiation reduced the viability of adult worms in a dose-dependent manner, but no lethal effect was observed. Electron microscopy studies showed that irradiation cleared Wolbachia from worm tissues. Real-time polymerase chain reaction studies demonstrated greatly reduced Wolbachia DNA in irradiated worms. These effects are essentially the same as those observed in adult worms treated with doxycycline. These studies suggest that effects of irradiation on reproduction in Brugia malayi may be caused by effects of irradiation on Wolbachia.",Included

There were no observed age-related changes in SOD activities, although male rats had higher SOD activity than females. Female rats had the highest CAT activities in the 4 Gy group, while male rats had the highest CAT activities in the 6 Gy group. CAT activities in the 8 Gy group were lower than those of the 2 Gy group for each gender and age. While MDA levels were decreased and CAT activities increased by GSH, SOD activities remained unchanged. The results indicate that gamma-ray radiation affects gender- and age-dependent MDA levels, SOD and CAT activities. Administration of GSH appears to be a useful approach to reduce radiation injury by reducing MDA levels and increasing CAT activities.",Included

Differences in dose homogeneity and irradiated volumes of target and surrounding normal tissues between 3D conformal radiation treatment planning and simulated non-graphic manual treatment planning were evaluated in 18 dogs with apocrine gland adenocarcinoma of the anal sac. Overall, 3D conformal treatment planning resulted in more homogenous dose distribution to target tissues with lower hot spots and dose ranges. Dose homogeneity and guarantee of not under-dosing target tissues with 3D conformal planning came at the cost, however, of delivering greater mean doses of radiation and of irradiating greater volumes of surrounding normal tissue structures.

930,"Comparative evaluation of the in vitro micronucleus test and the comet assay for the detection of genotoxic effects of X-ray radiation. The genotoxic effects of X-ray radiation on human lymphocytes were measured using the single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assay (comet assay) and the cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus (CBMN) test; both were carried out in vitro on isolated human lymphocytes in order to compare the relationship and sensitivity of these two detecting methods. The radiation-doses were 0.00, 0.02, 0.05, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 1.00 and 2.00 Gy. In the comet assay, the average comet length (38.6+/-0.8 microm) of 0.05 Gy was significantly longer than that (29.4+/-1.1 microm) of 0 Gy (P<0.01), moreover, the average comet length increased with the dose of X-ray radiation. In the CBMN, both the average micronucleus rate (MN) and micronucleated cell rate (MNC) of 0.05 Gy were 11.5+/-4.5 per thousand, which showed no difference with that (7.5+/-0.5 per thousand) of 0 Gy (P>0.05). The lowest dose, which induced significant increase of average MN and MNC, was 0.25 Gy. The average MN and MNC rates increased with radiation-dose. The results showed that there was correlation between SCGE and CBMN, and the sensitivity of SCGE was significantly higher than that of CBMN.",Included
947,"Antisense oligonucleotide targeting p53 increased apoptosis of MCF-7 cells induced by ionizing radiation. AIM: To investigate the effect of antisense compounds (AS) targeting human p53 mRNA on radiosensitivity of MCF-7 cells., METHODS: Western blotting and RTPCR were used to analyze the protein content and mRNA level. Additionally, cell proliferation, cell cycle and cell apoptosis were all analyzed in irradiated or sham-irradiated cells., RESULTS: Among the five antisense compounds (AS), AS3 was identified to efficiently inhibit p53 mRNA level and protein content. Interestingly, AS3 transfer has little effect on cell proliferation in DU-145 cells (mutant p53) after ionizing radiation (IR). In contrast, a marked increase of cell apoptosis and growth inhibition were observed in MCF-7 cells (wild-type p53), suggesting that AS3 can increase radiosensitivity of MCF-7 cells. Additionally, it was also observed that the transfection of AS3 decreased the fraction of G1 phase cells, and increased the proportion of S phase cells compared to untreated cells 24 h after IR in MCF-7 cell lines., CONCLUSION: AS3 transfection increases MCF-7 cell apoptosis induced by 5 Gy-radiation, and this mechanism may be closely associated with abrogation of G1 phase arrest.",Included
960,"Effects of X-rays and cigarette smoking on leukocyte, lymphocyte and mitotic index values and SCE rates: the relationship between mitotic index and lymphocyte count. Many previous studies revealed that smoking increases leukocyte and lymphocyte counts while exposure to X-rays decreases these counts. However the relationships between lymphocyte life span and smoking as well as X-rays were not well documented. The primary aim of this study was to determine relationships between smoking X-rays (in combination and individually) and life span of lymphocytes. Blood samples from 200 healthy individuals, half of which were X-ray exposed individuals, were collected. Half of X-ray exposed and of non-X-ray exposed individuals were smokers. There were equal numbers of male and female participants. Two lymphocyte cultures, one for the sister chromatid exchange (SCE) analysis and the other for the determination of mitotic index values were prepared using one part of the blood samples collected from the individuals. From the other part of the blood sample leukocyte and lymphocyte counts were determined with a haemogram device. Evaluation of the findings suggested that leukocyte count, lymphocyte count, mitotic index were relatively lower for the X-ray exposed individuals. In addition these values were higher for smokers than nonsmokers in general. The highest SCE rates were recorded for smoking radiology technicians. The most important finding is that lymphocyte life span is relatively low in smokers and in X-ray exposed males.",Included
1005,"Damage-induced apoptosis in primary human lymphocytes is a genetic program modified by gender and age. Apoptosis is a core pathway deregulated in hematologic and other cancers. Although there are considerable functional and genetic data on the regulation of apoptosis in vitro and in model organisms, little is known about how these pathways are modified in primary cells freshly isolated from people, who are continually subjected to a variety of different and often unquantified environmental stimuli. We hypothesize that these exposures may have important and as yet unappreciated modifying effects on apoptosis that may have implications for cancer risk or response to therapy. To test this, we isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 90 normal healthy individuals and treated them with 5 Gy ionizing radiation (IR). Damage-induced apoptosis was measured at 24 hours after IR by TUNEL. We observed surprising heterogeneity in apoptosis among individuals, ranging from 21-65 percent. To determine whether this diversity in response was programmed or stochastic, we repeated the experiment 3 times in 10 individuals spanning the entire IR-induced apoptotic range and found results to be completely reproducible within individuals, suggesting that it resulted from a genetic program. We then assessed the association with individual characteristics. Whereas neither race nor age was associated with IR-induced apoptosis, gender was significantly associated (Mean: 44.8% vs 32.9%; p = 1.02 x 10-8). Moreover, when stratified by gender, age was significantly associated with IR-induced apoptosis in males (p = 0.026) but not females (p = 0.94). Thus, we conclude that IR-induced apoptosis in freshly isolated human PBMCs results from an intrinsic genetic program modified by age, but only within males. Genetic models to explain this will be discussed.",Included

1043,"Enumeration of circulating microparticles in healthy medical workers occupationally exposed to low doses of ionizing radiation. Background: Strong evidence suggests microparticles (MP) as a biomarker of vascular injury. It may also contribute to the initiation and the development of atherosclerosis. In fact, several biological mechanisms might be responsible of atherosclerosis caused by radiation exposure even at a low dose. Therefore, the measurement of MP might be of a great potential for providing new insight into low-dose radiation cardiovascular risk. Aim(s): We investigated the effect of long-term medical occupational exposure to low doses of ionizing radiation (LDIR) on MP populations levels. Method(s): The current study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration on 38 healthy medical workers occupationally exposed to LDIR and 29 matched controls by gender, age, and smoking habits. The measured MP by flow cytometry were classified as positive or negative phosphatidylserine (PS+ or PS-), and phenotyped according to their cellular origin. Result(s): Total MP (PS-/PS+), regardless of phenotype, were significantly higher in workers occupationally exposed to LDIR than controls (p=0.0004). In medical exposed workers, PS- MP predominated (68%) and were approximately three times more common than PS+ MP. Concerning the measurement of MP according to their cellular origin, we found that MP derived from platelets (CD41a+ PMP), endothelial (CD146+ EMP), leucocytes (CD45+ LMP) and erythrocytes (CD235a+ RMP) are more abundant in exposed workers than those in controls (p< 0.0001). However, no significant difference was found in the proportion of the other blood elements in the peripheral circulation between the two groups. In addition, no association was observed between MP levels and the studied confounding factors. Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that elevated circulating MP populations levels represent an indicator of cellular damage caused by medical exposure to LDIR. By consequence, the quantification of MP seems to a useful biomarker for assessing the negative effects of occupational exposure to ionizing radiation. (Figure Presented) .",Included

These values exceed the permissible levels in residential areas. The annual radiation doses at the site equals 36.4 and 30.1 mSv for the phosphate pile and zoo, respectively and these values pose a significant risk on the nearby population.

Histologicalexamination revealed that Mtg16-/- mice have increasedenterocyte proliferation and goblet cell deficiency. After exposure toradiation, Mtg16-/- mice exhibited increased crypt viability anddecreased apoptosis compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Flow cytometricand immunofluorescence analysis of intestinal epithelial cellsfor phospho-histone H2A.X also indicated decreased DNA damageand apoptosis in Mtg16-/- intestines. To determine if Mtg16 deletionaffected epithelial cells in a cell-autonomous fashion, intestinal cryptswere isolated from Mtg16-/- mice. Mtg16-/-and WT intestinalcrypts showed similar enterosphere forming efficiencies when culturedin the presence of EGF, Noggin, and R-spondin. However, whenMtg16-/- crypts were cultured in the presence of Wnt3a, theydemonstrated higher enterosphere forming efficiencies and delayedprogression to mature enteroids. Mtg16-/- intestinal crypts isolatedfrom irradiated mice exhibited increased survival compared with WTintestinal crypts. Interestingly, Mtg16 expression was reduced in astem cell-enriched population at the time of crypt regeneration. Thisis consistent with MTG16 negatively regulating regeneration in vivo.Taken together, our data demonstrate that MTG16 loss promotesradioresistance and impacts intestinal stem cell function, possibly dueto shifting cellular response away from DNA damage-induced apoptosisand towards DNA repair after injury.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.",Included

The respiratory burst activity of neutrophils was measured fluorometrically using dichlorofluorescein diacetate, the total anti-oxidant status was measured using azinodiethyl-benzthiazoline-sulphonate, and inflammation parameters were determined by routine laboratory assays., RESULTS: Before treatment, the basal neutrophil respiratory burst in patients (n = 20) was 409 +/- 62 fluorescence arbitrary units (AU; mean +/- SEM) and 359 +/- 37 AU in controls (n = 9; p > 0.5); the stimulated respiratory burst (fMet-Leu-Phe, 10(-6) M) was 1,027 +/- 133 AU in patients and 1,152 +/- 218 AU in controls (p > 0.5). After treatment, the basal neutrophil respiratory burst in patients (n = 19) was 137 +/- 16 and in controls it was 174 +/- 35 AU (n = 8; p > 0.1); the stimulated respiratory burst was 670 +/- 66 and 1,305 +/- 82 AU, in patients and controls respectively (p < 0.001). No effects of treatment on the total anti-oxidant status of the plasma or on the parameters of inflammation were detected., CONCLUSION: Combined radon-hyperthermia treatment reduces the respiratory burst activity of the blood circulating neutrophils in patients with AS. If respiratory burst activity from the neutrophils plays a role in the pathophysiology of ankylosing spondylitis, the observed reduction may be related to the beneficial effects of radon-hyperthermia treatment.",Included

The following significant results were found for males and females combined: a deficit in the standardized incidence ratio for all cancers combined; elevated standardized incidence ratios for thyroid cancer and melanoma; and elevated excess relative risks for rectum, leukemia, lung, all cancers combined, all except lung, and all except leukemia. For males, cancers of the colon, pancreas, and testis also showed significantly elevated excess relative risks. The specific cancer types listed above have been implicated in previous studies on occupational exposure to ionizing radiation, except for testis, colon, and melanoma, while the findings on thyroid cancer from previous studies are inconclusive.

Chromosomal aberrations (CA) were evaluated by scoring the presence of chromatid and isochromatid breaks, dicentric and ring chromosomes in lymphocytes with/without 5 mM caffeine plus 3 mM-aminobenzamide (3-AB) treatment during G2. Our results showed that the mean value of basal aberrations in lymphocytes from exposed workers was higher than in control cells (p < 0.001). The chromosomal damage in G2, detected with caffeine plus 3-AB treatment was higher than the basal damage (untreated conditions), both in control and exposed populations (p < 0.05). In the exposed workers group, the mean value of chromosomal abnormalities in G2 was higher than in the control (p < 0.0001). No correlation was found between the frequency of chromosome type of aberrations (basal or in G2), and the absorbed dose. Nevertheless, significant correlation coefficients (p < 0.05) between absorbed dose and basal aberrations yield (r = 0.430) or in G2 (r = 0.448) were detected when chromatid breaks were included in the total aberrations yield. Under this latter condition no significant effect of age, years of employment or smoking habit on the chromosomal aberrations yield was detected. However, analysis of the relationship between basal aberrations yield and the efficiency of G2 repair mechanisms, defined as the percentage of chromosomal lesions repaired in G2, showed a significant correlation coefficient (r = -0.802; p < 0.001). These results suggest that in addition to the absorbed dose, the individual G2 repair efficiency may be another important factor affecting the chromosomal aberrations yield detected in workers exposed to low-level ionizing radiation.",Included

Objective: The aim this study was to estimate the fraction of leukemia incidence in Iran attributable to occupational exposure to benzene, ionizing radiation, and ethylene oxide. Method(s): Nationwide exposure to each of these leukemogens was estimated using workforce data available at the ILO (International Labor Organization) website. The prevalence of exposure to leukemogens in each industry was estimated using exposure data from the CAREX (CARcinogen EXposure) database. The magnitude of the relative risk of leukemia for each leukemogen was from published literature. Using the Levin's population attributable risk (incidence), fractions of leukemia incidences attributed to workplace leukemogens were then estimated. Result(s): The total workforce in Iran according to the 1995 census included 12,488,020 men and 677,469 women. Agriculture was the largest sector with 24.5% of the males and 0.27% of the females, and the electricals-related sector was the smallest with 1.16% of the males and 0.66% of the females. After applying the CAREX exposure estimates to each sector, the proportion exposed to leukemogens was 0.016% for male workers and 0.02% for female workers. Estimating a relative risk of 3.6 (95% CI of 3.2-4.2) for high exposure and 1.9 (95% CI 1.7-2.1) for low exposure and employing the Levin's formula, the fraction of leukemia attributed to leukemogens in the workplaces among females was 3.6% (95% CI of 3.1-4.5) and among males was 7.6% (95% CI of 6.4-9.2). These fractions corresponded to estimated incidences of 0.60 (95% CI of 0.50-0.70) and 0.22 (95% CI of 0.16-0.23) cases of leukemia per 100,000 populations for males and females, respectively.

Within the cohort, mortality and incidence from both leukaemia excluding CLL and the grouping of all malignant neoplasms excluding leukaemia increased to a statistically significant extent with increasing radiation dose. Estimates of the trend in risk with dose were similar to those for the Japanese A-bomb survivors, with 90% confidence intervals that excluded both risks more than 2-3 times greater than the A-bomb values and no raised risk. Some evidence of an increasing trend with dose in mortality from all circulatory diseases may, at least partly, be due to confounding by smoking. This analysis provides the most precise estimates to date of mortality and cancer risks following occupational radiation exposure and strengthens the evidence for raised risks from these exposures. The cancer risk estimates are consistent with values used to set radiation protection standards.",Included

BACKGROUND: Although preoperative radiation followed by wide local excision yields excellent local control in soft tissue sarcomas, the risk of wound complications is reported to be higher compared with the incidence in patients who were administered postoperative radiation therapy. Vacuum (vac)-assisted closure may improve wound healing, but it is unknown whether vac-assisted closure during soft tissue sarcoma resection may reduce the risk of wound complications or impair local disease control., QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Does the use of a wound vac application at the time of soft tissue sarcoma resection reduce the risk of developing wound complications after lower extremity sarcoma resection? (2) Is vac-assisted closure associated with an increased risk of local relapse?, METHODS: From 2000 to 2016, 312 patients with stage I to III soft tissue sarcomas were treated. Of these, 123 were treated with preoperative radiation +/- chemotherapy followed by limb-sparing resection based on tumor location, size, grade, histology, and patient age. There was a minimum followup of 12 months. Radiation was delivered generally based on tumor size, grade, superficial versus deep nature, and proximity to neurovascular structures. Chemotherapy was administered in patients < 70 years old with high-grade tumors and tumors > 5 cm. Patient, demographic, and treatment variables, including incisional vac application and wound outcomes, were retrospectively evaluated. Incisional vac-assisted closure took place at the time of primary resection in 32% (46 of 123) of patients. Vac-assisted closure was considered when there was a concern for risk of external contamination such as instances in which fixation of adhesives would be difficult or regions where there was a high risk of contamination. Vac-assisted closure may have also been used in instances with increased wound tension at closure or with heightened concern for shearing on the wound such as buttock wounds. Ten patients were lost to followup, two in the vac group and eight in the non-vac group. Potential factors associated with wound complications were evaluated using Fisher's exact test for univariate analysis and logistic regression for multivariate analysis. Local recurrence-free survival was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier estimate., RESULTS: After taking into consideration factors such as tumor size, location, age, and patient comorbidities, it was shown that patients who underwent vac-assisted closure were less likely to experience wound complications compared with patients who did not undergo vac-assisted closure (odds ratio, 0.129; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.041-0.398; p = 0.004). The local control incidence in the entire cohort was 98%. With the numbers available, Kaplan-Meier survivorship free from local recurrence did not differ between patients treated with or without the vac (100% [95% CI, 154.09-154.09] versus 96% [95% CI, 152.21-169.16]; p = 0.211), respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Vac-assisted closure at the time of resection of proximal lower extremity soft tissue sarcomas is associated with a lower risk of wound complications, and its use apparently did not compromise local control. We show that the use of vac-assisted closure may be worth considering in surgeons' attempts to reduce the risk of wound complications among patients with soft tissue sarcomas of the proximal lower extremities., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, therapeutic study.",Included

A total of 255 PTC cases (123 Chernobyl radiation-induced and 132 sporadic, all in Caucasians) and 596 healthy controls (198 residents of Chernobyl areas and 398 subjects without history of radiation exposure, all Caucasians) were genotyped. The risk of PTC and SNPs interactions with radiation exposure were assessed by logistic regressions. The ATM G5557A and XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphisms, regardless of radiation exposure, associated with a decreased risk of PTC according to the multiplicative and dominant models of inheritance (odds ratio (OR) = 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45-0.86 and OR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.59-0.93 respectively). The ATM IVS22-77 T > C and TP53 Arg72Pro SNPs interacted with radiation (P = 0.04 and P = 0.01 respectively). ATM IVS22-77 associated with the increased risk of sporadic PTC (OR = 1.84, 95% CI 1.10-3.24) whereas TP53 Arg72Pro correlated with the higher risk of radiogenic PTC (OR = 1.80, 95% CI 1.06-2.36). In the analyses of ATM/TP53 (rs1801516/rs664677/rs609429/rs1042522) combinations, the GG/TC/CG/GC genotype strongly associated with radiation-induced PTC (OR = 2.10, 95% CI 1.17-3.78). The GG/CC/GG/GG genotype displayed a significantly increased risk for sporadic PTC (OR = 3.32, 95% CI 1.57-6.99). The results indicate that polymorphisms of DNA damage response genes may be potential risk modifiers of ionizing radiation-induced or sporadic PTCs.",Included
1363,"[Local recurrence of rectal cancers. Multidimensional analysis by anatomoclinical factors and role of irradiation]. Pre- or postoperative radiation therapy reduces the incidence of local recurrence after surgical treatment of rectal carcinoma. Factors related to local recurrence were analyzed retrospectively by uni- and multivariate analysis. One hundred and fifty-five patients (mean age: 65 years) were operated on with curative intent between 1967 and 1984. Ninety-four patients (46 patients having abdominoperineal resections (APR), and 48 having anterior resections) did not receive radiation therapy. Sixty-one patients had preoperative radiation therapy followed by APR in 59 cases. Univariate analysis showed that the risk of local recurrence increased significantly with male sex (p less than 0.006), positive lymph nodes (p less than 0.01), vascular invasion (p less than 0.02), and Astler-Coller classification (p less than 0.05). Tumor located at less than 5 cm from the anal verge was significantly related to recurrence only in patients not receiving radiation therapy (p less than 0.02). Multivariate analysis including therapeutic modalities showed that local recurrence was significantly related with male sex (p less than 0.02), positive lymph nodes (p less than 0.01), and distance to anal verge (p less than 0.01). The beneficial role of radiation therapy appeared only for tumors located 5 cm or less from the anal verge. Prognostic scores were established using these variables and the effect of irradiation was evaluated according to these scores. Radiation therapy significatively reduced the risk of local recurrence in low-risk patients, i.e., female with low-lying tumor and with negative lymph nodes (p less than 0.03).

1364,"Different patterns of allelic imbalance in sporadic tumors and tumors associated with long-term exposure to gamma-radiation. The study aimed to reveal cancer related mutations in DNA repair and cell cycle genes associated with chronic occupational exposure to gamma-radiation in personnel of the Siberian Group of Chemical Enterprises (SGCE). Mutations were analyzed by comparing genotypes of malignant tumors and matched normal tissues of 255 cancer patients including 98 exposed to external gamma-radiation (mean dose 128.1+/-150.5mSv). Also a genetic association analysis was carried out in a sample of 149 cancer patients and 908 healthy controls occupationally exposed to gamma-radiation (153.2+/-204.6mSv and 150.5+/-211.2mSv, respectively). Eight SNPs of genes of DNA excision repair were genotyped (rs13181, rs1052133, rs1042522, rs2305427, rs4244285, rs1045642, rs1805419 and rs1801133). The mutation profiles in heterozygous loci for selected SNP were different between sporadic tumors and tumors in patients exposed to radiation. In sporadic tumors, heterozygous genotype Arg/Pro of the rs1042522 SNP mutated into Arg/0 in 15 cases (9.6%) and 0/Pro in 14 cases (8.9%). The genotype Lys/Gln of the rs13181 SNP mutated into Lys/0 and 0/Gln in 9 and 4 cases, respectively. In tumors of patients exposed to low-level radiation, the rs1042522 Arg/0 mutated genotype was found in 12 cases (12.1%), while in 2 cases (2%) 0/Pro mutation was observed. Finally, the rs13181 0/Gln mutated genotype was observed in 15 cases (16,5%) . Thus, our study showed the difference in patterns of allelic imbalance in tumors appeared under low-level radiation exposure and spontaneous tumors for selected SNPs. This suggests different mechanisms of inactivation of heterozygous genotypes in sporadic and radiation-induced tumors. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Included
1366,"The effect of chronic low-level exposure on hair damages of radiation workers. According to chronic exposure of radiation workers during their work experience,this study was an attempt to assess the damage caused by radiation on the hair of radiation workers. In this study the total Skin and Hair Analyzing System capable of registering polarized images was used for measuring hair parameters (hair thickness,hair root,hair nutrition,hair status and hair oil). Hair management software ,Skin Management Software and also 150X,700X lenses were used to measure the hair parameters. The study included one questionnaire which it's face validity and content validity was approved by pilot study and some professional experts. The participants were 152 hospital personnel and were divided into radiation exposed group (radiotherapy technicians,nuclear medicine technicians) and control group (nurses) and were homogenized based on age,work situation,work time,work experience and baldness (family history). Results showed that chronic exposure causes the reduction of hair thickness in female radiation workers than nurses. The hair root,hair nutrition,hair status and hair oil in groups showed no significant difference to each other. However,there was no significant difference in hair parameters between male radiation workers and male non radiation workers. Although attention to safety in working with radiation has increased,damage caused by radiation has not yet been reduced to zero. Results of the study showed that chronic exposure may cause damage to the hair of radiation workers. The reason may be inadequate training of technologists and their high workload.Copyright © 2016,International Journal of Pharmacy and Technology. All rights reserved.",Included
1380,"The relationship between occupational radiation exposure and thyroid nodules. Background: Considering that thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer occur more frequently in people chronically exposed to radiation, the aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of thyroid nodules in a population occupationally exposed to radiation in hospitals of Isfahan, Iran. Material(s) and Method(s): In this case-control study, the prevalence of thyroid nodules in staff members occupationally exposed to radiation was determined by ultrasonography. The results were compared with the results of another study among the adult population of Isfahan which selected by cluster random sampling method. The 2 studied groups were matched according to sex and age. Result(s): The case and control groups included 124 and 471 persons, respectively. The prevalence of thyroid nodules in the case and control groups was 22.6% and 24.6%, respectively (p > 0.05). Although thyroid nodules were significantly more prevalent in females in the control group, no such difference was observed between females and males of the case group (p > 0.05). The number of thyroid nodules (single or multiple) and calcification were not different between the two groups (p > 0.05). In addition, hypoechogenicity of thyroid nodules was not different between the two groups for (p > 0.05). Conclusion(s): In our study, there was not any correlation between chronic occupational exposure to low dose of radiation and the risk of developing thyroid nodules.

1381,"Randomized trial addressing risk features and time factors of surgery plus radiotherapy in advanced head-and-neck cancer. Purpose: A multi-institutional, prospective, randomized trial was undertaken in patients with advanced head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma to address (1) the validity of using pathologic risk features, established from a previous study, to determine the need for, and dose of, postoperative radiotherapy (PORT); (2) the impact of accelerating PORT using a concomitant boost schedule; and (3) the importance of the overall combined treatment duration on the treatment outcome. Methods and Materials: Of 288 consecutive patients with advanced disease registered preoperatively, 213 fulfilled the trial criteria and went on to receive therapy predicated on a set of pathologic risk features: no PORT for the low-risk group (n=31); 57.6 Gy during 6.5 weeks for the intermediate-risk group (n=31); and, by random assignment, 63 Gy during 5 weeks (n=76) or 7 weeks (n=75) for the high-risk group. Patients were irradiated with standard techniques appropriate to the site of disease and likely areas of spread. The study end points were locoregional control (LRC), survival, and morbidity. Result(s): Patients with low or intermediate risks had significantly higher LRC and survival rates than those with high-risk features (p=0.003 and p=0.0001, respectively), despite receiving no PORT or lower dose PORT, respectively. For high-risk patients, a trend toward higher LRC and survival rates was noted when PORT was delivered in 5 rather than 7 weeks. A prolonged interval between surgery and PORT in the 7-week schedule was associated with significantly lower LRC (p=0.03) and survival (p=0.01) rates. Consequently, the cumulative duration of combined therapy had a significant impact on the LRC (p=0.005) and survival (p=0.03) rates. A 2-week reduction in the PORT duration by using the concomitant boost technique did not increase the late treatment toxicity. Conclusion(s): This Phase III trial established the power of risk assessment using pathologic features in determining the need for, and dose of, PORT in patients with advanced head-and-neck squamous cell cancer in a prospective, multi-institutional setting. It also revealed the impact of the overall treatment time in the combination of surgery and PORT on the outcome in high-risk patients and showed that PORT acceleration without a reduction in dose by a concomitant boost regimen did not increase the late complication rate. These findings emphasize the importance of coordinated interdisciplinary care in the delivery of combined surgery and RT. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.",Included

Ionizing radiation is an important treatment modality, but it is also a well-known genotoxic agent capable of damaging cells and tissues. Therefore radiation treatment can cause numerous side effects in exposed tissues and organs. Radiotherapy is a part of the front-line treatment regime for brain cancer patients, but can cause severe functional and morphological changes in exposed brain tissues. However, the mechanisms of radiation-induced effects in the brain are not well understood and are under-investigated. Recent data has implicated short RNAs, especially microRNAs, as important in radiation responses, yet nothing is known about radiation-induced changes in the brain microRNAome. We analyzed the effects of X-ray irradiation on microRNA expression in the hippocampus, frontal cortex, and cerebellum of male and female mice. Here, we report tissue-, time-, and sex-specific brain radiation responses, as well as show evidence of an interplay between microRNAs and their targets. Specifically, we show that changes in the expression of the miR-29 family may be linked, at least in part, to altered expression of de novo methyltransferase DNMT3a and changed global DNA methylation levels. Further, these sex-specific epigenetic changes may be correlated to the prevalence of radiation-induced cancers in males. We identified several microRNAs that can potentially serve as biomarkers of brain radiation exposure. In summary, our study may provide an important roadmap for further analysis of microRNA expression in different brain regions of male and female mice and for detailed dissection of radiation-induced brain responses.",Included

The present results refer to cytogenetic assessments in a study cohort of the population of Dolon, a settlement located on the NE boundary of the nuclear weapon test site, which was exposed to elevated doses of ionising radiation primarily due to the first Soviet nuclear test in 1949. Conventional cytogenetic analyses were carried out on 21 blood samples from individuals (more than 50 years old) living in Dolon since the very beginning of nuclear testing. A matched control group included 20 individuals living in non-contaminated areas.

1437,"Increased oxidative stress in barn swallows from the Chernobyl region. The Chernobyl nuclear accident produced the largest unintended release of radionuclides in history, with dramatic consequences for humans and other organisms. Exposure to ionizing radiation is known to reduce circulating and stored levels of specific antioxidants in birds and humans, thus potentially increasing oxidative stress. However, overall effects of radioactive exposure on oxidative status have never been investigated in any free ranging vertebrate. We measured plasma antioxidant capacity and concentration of reactive oxygen metabolites in adult barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) from colonies with variable background radiation levels in the Chernobyl region in Ukraine and Belarus. We predicted that antioxidants would decrease while reactive oxygen metabolites would increase with exposure to increasing levels of radiation at the breeding sites. Consistent with this expectation, radiation level positively predicted plasma concentration of reactive oxygen metabolites, whereas no significant covariation was found with non-enzymatic plasma antioxidant capacity. An index of oxidative stress was also larger in barn swallows exposed to high contamination levels. Thus, radioactive contamination appeared to be responsible for the increased generation of reactive oxygen metabolites and the imbalance between reactive oxygen metabolites and non-enzymatic plasma antioxidant capacity.",Included

To address the question of whether radiation therapy is beneficial in the management of partially resected meningiomas, we reviewed the records of all patients admitted to the University of California, San Francisco, between 1968 and 1978 who had a diagnosis of intracranial meningioma. The patients were divided into three groups: 51 patients had gross total resection and did not receive radiation therapy, 30 patients had subtotal resection and no radiation therapy, and 54 patients had subtotal resection followed by radiation therapy. The subtotal resection groups were similar in average age, male:female ratio, and tumor location, which allowed a valid comparison of the effects of irradiation. The recurrence rate in the total resection group was 4% (2 of 51 patients). Among patients in the subtotal resection groups, 60% of nonirradiated patients had a recurrence, compared with only 32% of the irradiated patients. The median time to recurrence was significantly longer in the irradiated group than in the nonirradiated group (125 vs. 66 months, P less than 0.05). There was no complication related to irradiation.

1505,"Projected lifetime cancer risks from occupational radiation exposure among diagnostic medical radiation workers in South Korea. BACKGROUND: Timely assessment of cancer risk from current radiation exposure among medical radiation workers can contribute to the development of strategies to prevent excessive occupational radiation exposure. The purpose of the present study is to estimate the lifetime risk of cancers induced by occupational radiation exposure among medical radiation workers., METHODS: Using estimated organ doses and the RadRAT risk assessment tool, the lifetime cancer risk was estimated among medical radiation workers who were enrolled in the Korean National Dose Registry from 1996 to 2011. Median doses were used for estimating the risk because of the skewed distribution of radiation doses. Realistic representative exposure scenarios in the study population based on sex, job start year, and occupational group were created for calculating the lifetime attributable risk (LAR) and lifetime fractional risk (LFR)., RESULTS: The mean estimated lifetime cancer risk from occupational radiation exposure varied significantly by sex and occupational group. The highest LAR was observed in male and female radiologic technologists who started work in 1991 (264.4/100,000 and 391.2/100,000, respectively). Female workers had a higher risk of radiation-related excess cancer, although they were exposed to lower radiation doses than male workers. The higher LAR among women was attributable primarily to excess breast and thyroid cancer risks. LARs among men were higher than women in most other cancer sites. With respect to organ sites, LAR of colon cancer (44.3/100,000) was the highest in male radiologic technologists, whereas LAR of thyroid cancer (222.0/100,000) was the highest in female radiologic technologists among workers who started radiologic practice in 1991. Thyroid and bladder cancers had the highest LFR among radiologic technologists., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide an assessment of the potential cancer risk from occupational radiation exposure among medical radiation workers, based on current knowledge about radiation risk. Although the radiation-related risk was small in most cases, it varied widely by sex and occupational group, and the risk would be underestimated due to the use of median, rather than mean, doses. Therefore, careful monitoring is necessary to optimize radiation doses and protect medical radiation workers from potential health risks, particularly female radiologic technologists.",Included
1519,"DNA Damage Baseline Predicts Resilience to Space Radiation and Radiotherapy. Deep space exploration will require real-time, minimally invasive monitoring of astronaut health to mitigate the potential health impairments caused by space radiation and microgravity. Genotoxic stress in humans can be monitored by quantifying the amount of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in immune cells from a simple finger prick. In a cohort of 674 healthy donors, we show that the endogenous level of DSBs increases with age and with latent cytomegalovirus infection. To map the range of human responses to space radiation, we then study DSB induction and repair in immune cells from 319 healthy donors after the cells are exposed to galactic cosmic ray components and lymphocytes from 30 cancer patients after radiotherapy. Individuals with low baseline DSB have fewer clinical complications, enhanced DNA damage repair responses, and a functional dose-dependent cytokine response in healthy donor cells. This supports the use of DSB monitoring for health resilience in space., Pariset et al. find that individuals with a lower baseline level of DNA damage are resilient to clinical complications after radiotherapy and present higher radiation-induced levels of DNA repair foci and inflammatory cytokines. These findings support the use of baseline DNA damage as a biomarker for radiation sensitivity.Copyright © 2020",Included

PURPOSE: To investigate within the framework of a multilaboratory study the suitability of FISH chromosome painting to measure so-called stable translocations in peripheral lymphocytes of Mayak nuclear-industrial workers (from the Southern Urals) and their use for retrospective biodosimetry., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chromosime analyses were carried out from 69 workers who had received protracted occupational radiation exposures (0.012-6.065 Gy) up to approximately 40 years before blood sampling. Twenty-one unexposed people living in the same area were controls. A multicolour FISH-painting protocol with the target chromosomes 1, 4 and 8 simultaneously with a pancentromeric probe was used to score potentially transmissible chromosome-type aberrations (reciprocal translocations 2B and related 'one-way' patterns I-III according to the S&S classification)., RESULTS: Individual biodosimetry estimates were obtained in terms of these potentially long-term surviving aberration types based on the linear component of a low dose-rate gamma-ray calibration curve produced using identical staining and scoring protocols. For comparison, the workers personal and total background doses were converted to red bone marrow doses. The estimated doses were mainly lower than would be predicted by the calibration curve, particularly at accumulated higher dose levels., CONCLUSIONS: Owing to the limited life-time of circulating T-lymphocytes, the long-term persistence of translocations in vivo requires the assumption of a clonal repopulation of these naturally senescing cells from the haemopoietic stem cell compartments. Obviously such a replacement cannot be fully achieved, leading to a temporal decline even of the yield of transmissible aberrations types. Assuming further a highly selective capacity of stem cells against any type of chromosomal damage and the fact that one must rely on partial genome findings, the potential of FISH chromosome painting for retrospective dose reconstruction is probably limited to a decade or so after high-level protracted radiation exposure.",Included

To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms that underlie radiation-associated meningioma (RAM), we characterized the somatic genetic alterations in 16 RAMs by using comparative genomic hybridization and compared the pattern of alterations with 17 nonradiation-associated meningiomas (non-RAM). Most tumors (29/33;87.9%) displayed at least one DNA copy number alteration, and 11 out of 33 (33%) exhibited four or more changes. The mean number of DNA copy number changes was similar in RAMs (2.4+/-1.9) and in non-RAMs (2.5+/-1.9). The most common DNA losses were noted in chromosome 22 (56.2% in RAM, and 47% in non-RAM) and chromosome 1 (37.5% in RAM and 35.3% in non-RAM), with no significant differences between the two groups. Noteworthy, gain in DNA copy number of chromosomes 8 and 12 was detected in two RAM tumors only. In conclusion, no significant differences were noted between RAMs and non-RAMs regarding the number of genetic changes and the extent and frequency of chromosomes 1 and 22 losses.

OBJECTIVE: To determine risk for incident basal cell carcinoma from cumulative low-dose ionising radiation in the US radiologic technologist cohort., METHODS: We analysed 65,719 Caucasian technologists who were cancer-free at baseline (1983-1989 or 1994-1998) and answered a follow-up questionnaire (2003-2005). Absorbed radiation dose to the skin in mGy for estimated cumulative occupational radiation exposure was reconstructed for each technologist based on badge dose measurements, questionnaire-derived work history and protection practices, and literature information. Radiation-associated risk was assessed using Poisson regression and included adjustment for several demographic, lifestyle, host and sun exposure factors., RESULTS: Cumulative mean absorbed skin dose (to head/neck/arms) was 55.8 mGy (range 0-1735 mGy). For lifetime cumulative dose, we did not observe an excess radiation-related risk (excess relative risk/Gy=-0.01 (95% CI -0.43 to 0.52). However, we observed that basal cell carcinoma risk was increased for radiation dose received before age 30 (excess relative risk/Gy=0.59, 95% CI -0.11 to 1.42) and before 1960 (excess relative risk/Gy=2.92, 95% CI 1.39 to 4.45)., CONCLUSIONS: Basal cell carcinoma risk was unrelated to low-dose radiation exposure among radiologic technologists. Because of uncertainties in dosimetry and sensitivity to model specifications, both our null results and our findings of excess risk for dose received before age 30 and exposure before 1960 should be interpreted with caution.

Among the population their frequency made up 51.78%. Features of clinical manifestations of dysfunction ofthe immune system depending on accumulation of 239Pu in the organism are established. Similar dynamics of infectious and infectious and allergic syndromes is revealed when the activity of 239Pu is 40 nCi. AD frequency reliably increased .when the activity of 239Pu is 20 nCi, but if accumulation is higher than 20-40 nCi it decreases and again increases when the activity is over 40 nCi. Pathologies of infectious and allergic genesis are most often observed when the content of 239Pu in an organism is over 40 nCi. Indicators of the immune status (IS) of the personnel at SChP with incorporated 239Pu are analyzed. 59 people--carriers of 239Pu and 408 people without 239Pu accumulated in an organism are examined. In comparison with the control, IS indicators characteristic for all dose loading groups are revealed: increase of lymphocytes, existence of dissociation in indicators of relative and absolute values of the T-cellular link, CD16+56+(-) NK-cells and B-lymphocytes with increase of absolute values, decrease in markers of activation of HLA-DR+ and CD95+, increase of B-lymphocytes and low level of serum IgM. Features of IS in comparison with the group of the personnel with the absence of 239Pu in an organism and indicators of IS which depend on the activity of 239Pu are established. Among them are a decrease in the percentage of persons with increased number of lymphocytes with increased beam loading; increase of NK-T-cells when the activity of 239Pu is 10-20 nCi and the highest value at doses over40 nCi; the dynamics of CD16+56(+)-lymphocytes with the increase of the contents and a percentage of persons with the increase of the activity above 40 nCi; the highest frequenc of a regulatory imbalance with high frequency decrease of CD8(+)-T-lymphocytes at the content of 239Pu > 0-10 nCi; decrease in indicators of B-lymphocytes and serum IgA with an increase in the activity of 239Pu with the lowest values under internal radiation over 40 nCi; decrease in the percentage of persons with a weakening expression of HLA-DR+ with the increase in dose loading.",Included
1657,"The Impact of Dose Rate on DNA Double-Strand Break Formation and Repair in Human Lymphocytes Exposed to Fast Neutron Irradiation. The lack of information on how biological systems respond to low-dose and low dose-rate exposures makes it difficult to accurately assess the carcinogenic risks. This is of critical importance to space radiation, which remains a serious concern for long-term manned space exploration. In this study, the gamma-H2AX foci assay was used to follow DNA double-strand break (DSB) induction and repair following exposure to neutron irradiation, which is produced as secondary radiation in the space environment. Human lymphocytes were exposed to high dose-rate (HDR: 0.400 Gy/min) and low dose-rate (LDR: 0.015 Gy/min) p(66)/Be(40) neutrons. DNA DSB induction was investigated 30 min post exposure to neutron doses ranging from 0.125 to 2 Gy. Repair kinetics was studied at different time points after a 1 Gy neutron dose. Our results indicated that gamma-H2AX foci formation was 40% higher at HDR exposure compared to LDR exposure. The maximum gamma-H2AX foci levels decreased gradually to 1.65 +/- 0.64 foci/cell (LDR) and 1.29 +/- 0.45 (HDR) at 24 h postirradiation, remaining significantly higher than background levels. This illustrates a significant effect of dose rate on neutron-induced DNA damage. While no significant difference was observed in residual DNA damage after 24 h, the DSB repair half-life of LDR exposure was slower than that of HDR exposure. The results give a first indication that the dose rate should be taken into account for cancer risk estimations related to neutrons.",Included
1661,"Changes in symptom clusters in patients undergoing radiation therapy. GOALS OF WORK: The goals of the study were to determine the occurrence rates for and the severity of symptoms at the middle, end, and 1 month after the completion of radiation therapy (RT), to determine the number and types of symptom clusters at these three time points, and to evaluate for changes over time in these symptom clusters., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Symptom occurrence and severity were evaluated using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS) in a sample of patients (n = 160) who underwent RT for breast or prostate cancer. At each time point, an exploratory factor analysis was done to determine the number of symptom clusters (i.e., symptom factors) based on the MSAS symptom severity ratings., MAIN RESULTS: The majority of the patients were male and married with a mean age of 61.1 years. The five symptoms with the highest occurrence rates across all three time points were lack of energy, pain, difficulty sleeping, feeling drowsy, and sweats. Although the number of symptoms and the specific symptoms within each symptom cluster were not identical across the three time points, three relatively similar symptom clusters (i.e., mood-cognitive"" symptom cluster, ""sickness-behavior"" symptom cluster, ""treatment-related"", or ""pain"" symptom cluster) were identified in this sample. The internal consistency coefficients for the mood-cognitive symptom cluster and sickness-behavior symptom cluster were adequate at > or =0.68., CONCLUSIONS: Three relatively stable symptom clusters were found across RT. The majority of the symptom cluster severity scores were significantly higher in patients with breast cancer compared to patients with prostate cancer.""",Included

Aims: To review the outcome of patients diagnosed with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma in British Columbia between January 1985 and December 1999. Material(s) and Method(s): Seventy-five patients were identified. Survival curves were calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimates, and the charts of the 62 patients referred to a British Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA) facility were reviewed. Result(s): All cases: 51 out of 75 patients (68%) were women; median age of all patients was 74 years. The overall- and cancer-specific 5-year survival rates for the whole group were 5%. Non-referred cases: nine out of 13 patients were women; median age at diagnosis 84 years. Eleven of the 13 patients died within 1 month of diagnosis. Referred cases: 42 out of 62 patients were women; median age 72 years; median survival 5.1 months; 1-year survival 19%. Forty-eight patients presented with tumours that extended through the thyroid capsule, 10 presented with distant metastases. Four patients had a total thyroidectomy, nine a partial thyroidectomy, and 49 a biopsy only. Fifty-seven patients received radiotherapy, nine of these had concurrent chemotherapy: Thirty-three patients received less than 40 Gy and 24 patients received 40 Gy or more. Median survival was longer (9 vs 3 months) in patients receiving 40 Gy or more; this group included four patients who had prolonged survival.

1666,"Case-control study of lung cancer risk from residential radon exposure in Worcester county, Massachusetts. A study of lung cancer risk from residential radon exposure and its radioactive progeny was performed with 200 cases (58% male, 42% female) and 397 controls matched on age and sex, all from the same health maintenance organization. Emphasis was placed on accurate and extensive year-long dosimetry with etch-track detectors in conjunction with careful questioning about historic patterns of in-home mobility. Conditional logistic regression was used to model the outcome of cancer on radon exposure, while controlling for years of residency, smoking, education, income, and years of job exposure to known or potential carcinogens. Smoking was accounted for by nine categories: never smokers, four categories of current smokers, and four categories of former smokers. Radon exposure was divided into six categories (model 1) with break points at 25, 50, 75, 150, and 250 Bq m, the lowest being the reference. Surprisingly, the adjusted odds ratios (AORs) were, in order, 1.00, 0.53, 0.31, 0.47, 0.22, and 2.50 with the third category significantly below 1.0 (p < 0.05), and the second, fourth, and fifth categories approaching statistical significance (p < 0.1). An alternate analysis (model 2) using natural cubic splines allowed calculating AORs as a continuous function of radon exposure. That analysis produces AORs that are substantially less than 1.0 with borderline statistical significance (0.048 < or = p < or = 0.05) between approximately 85 and 123 Bq m. College-educated subjects in comparison to high-school dropouts have a significant reduction in cancer risk after controlling for smoking, years of residency, and job exposures with AOR = 0.30 (95% CI: 0.13, 0.69), p = 0.005 (model 1).",Included
1669,"Differential recovery of neural stem cells in the subventricular zone and dentate gyrus after ionizing radiation. Radiation therapy is a widely used treatment for malignant central nervous system tumors. Mature neurons are terminally differentiated, whereas stem and progenitor cells have a prominent proliferative capacity and are therefore highly vulnerable to irradiation. Our aim was to investigate how cranial radiation in young rats would affect stem/progenitor cells in the two niches of adult neurogenesis, the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation. Nine weeks after irradiation we found that in irradiated animals, hippocampal neurogenesis was reduced to 5% of control levels. Similarly, the numbers of actively proliferating cells and radial glia-like stem cells (nestin+/glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]+) in the dentate gyrus were reduced to 10% and 15% of control levels, respectively. In the irradiated olfactory bulb, neurogenesis was reduced to 40% of control levels, and the number of actively proliferating cells in the SVZ was reduced to 53% of control levels. However, the number of nestin+/GFAP+ cells in the SVZ was unchanged compared with controls. To evaluate the immediate response to the radiation injury, we quantified the amount of proliferation in the SVZ and dentate gyrus 1 day after irradiation. We found an equal reduction in proliferating cells both in dentate gyrus and SVZ. In summary, we show an initial response to radiation injury that is similar in both brain stem cell niches. However, the long-term effects on stem cells and neurogenesis in these two areas differ significantly: the dentate gyrus is severely affected long-term, whereas the SVZ appears to recover with time.",Included

The study group consisted of 24 subjects matched with a control population by the number of participants, age, gender ratio, active smoking status, the period of blood sampling, and residence. Based on regular dosimetry using thermoluminiscent dosimeters, our study group occupationally received a dose of 1.82 +/- 3.60 mSv over the last year. The results of the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay and the comet assay showed a higher nuclear buds frequency (4.09 +/- 1.88) and tail length (15.46 +/- 1.47 mum) than in the control group (2.96 +/- 1.67, 14.05 +/- 1.36 mum, respectively).

1704,"Effects of NKG2D haplotypes on the cell-surface expression of NKG2D protein on natural killer and CD8 T cells of peripheral blood among atomic-bomb survivors. NKG2D is a primary activating receptor that triggers cell-mediated cytotoxicity in NK cells against tumor and virus-infected cells. We previously identified the NKG2D haplotypes in the natural killer gene complex region on chromosome 12p. Two major haplotype alleles, LNK1 and HNK1, were closely related to low and high natural cytotoxic activity phenotypes, respectively. Furthermore, the haplotype of HNK1/HNK1 has revealed a decreased risk of cancer compared with LNK1/LNK1. In the present study, using flow cytometry, we evaluated the functional effects of NKG2D haplotypes and five htSNPs in terms of the cell-surface expression of NKG2D protein on NK and CD8 T cells of peripheral blood among 732 atomic-bomb survivors. NKG2D expression on NK cells showed significant increases, in the order of LNK1/LNK1, LNK1/HNK1 and HNK1/HNK1 haplotypes (p for trend = 0.003), or with major homozygous, heterozygous, and minor homozygous genotypes for individual htSNPs (p for trend = 0.02-0.003). The same trend was observed for NKG2D expression on CD8 T cells.

1714,"Reduction of Delayed Homologous Recombination by Induction of Radioadaptive Response in RaDR-GFP Mice (Yonezawa Effect): An Old Player With a New Role. Radiotherapy (RT) treats cancer effectively with high doses of ionizing radiation (IR) to killing cancer cells and shrinking tumors while bearing the risk of developing different side effects, including secondary cancer, which is most concerning for long-term health consequences. Genomic instability (GI) is a characteristic of most cancer cells, and IR-induced GI can manifest as delayed homologous recombination (HR). Radioadaptive response (RAR) is capable of reducing genotoxicity, cell transformation, mutation, and carcinogenesis, but the rational evidence describing its contributions to the reduction of radiation risk, in particular, carcinogenesis, remains fragmented. In this work, to investigate the impact of RAR on high-dose, IR-induced GI measured as delayed HR, the frequency of recombinant cells was comparatively studied under RAR-inducible and -uninducible conditions in the nucleated cells in hematopoietic tissues (bone marrow and spleen) using the Rosa26 Direct Repeat-green fluorescent protein (RaDR-GFP) homozygote mice. Results demonstrated that the frequency of recombinant cells was significantly lower in hematopoietic tissues under RAR-inducible condition. These findings suggest that reduction in delayed HR may be at least a part of the mechanisms underlying decreased carcinogenesis by RAR, and application of RAR would contribute to a more rigorous and scientifically grounded system of radiation protection in RT.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.",Included

The aim of this study was to assess whether there is a dose-dependent relationship between radiation dose and myocardial fibrosis in patients who received neoadjuvant chemoradiation (nCRT) for esophageal cancer (EC). Methods and Materials: Forty patients with EC treated with a transthoracic esophagectomy with (n = 20) or without (n = 20) nCRT (CROSS study regimen) were included. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (1.5 Tesla) for left ventricular (LV) function, late gadolinium enhancement, and T1 mapping were performed. Extracellular volume (ECV), as a surrogate for collagen burden, was measured for all LV segments separately. The dose-response relationship between ECV and mean radiation dose per LV myocardial segment was evaluated using a mixed-model analysis. Result(s): Seventeen nCRT and 16 control patients were suitable for analysis. The mean time after treatment was 67.6 +/- 8.1 (nCRT) and 122 +/- 35 (controls) months (P = .02). In nCRT patients, we found a significantly higher mean global ECV of 28.2% compared with 24.0% in the controls (P < .001). After nCRT, LV myocardial segments with elevated ECV had received significantly higher radiation doses. In addition, a linear dose-effect relation was found with a 0.136% point increase of ECV for each Gy (P < .001). There were no differences in LV function measures and late gadolinium enhancement between both groups. Conclusion(s): Myocardial ECV was significantly higher in long-term EC survivors after nCRT compared with surgery only. Moreover, this ECV increase was linear with the radiation dose per LV segment, indicating radiation-induced myocardial fibrosis.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s)",Included
1735,"The risk of cataractogenesis after gamma knife radiosurgery: a nationwide population based case-control study. BACKGROUND: Medical radiation is considered a factor responsible for cataractogenesis. However, the incidence of this ophthalmologic complication resulting from gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) has not yet been reported. The present study aimed to determine the risk of cataractogenesis associated with radiation exposure from GKRS., METHODS: This study used information from a random sample of one million persons enrolled in the nationally representative Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. The GK group consisted of patients who underwent GKRS between 2000 and 2009. The non-GK group was composed of subjects who had never undergone GKRS, but who were matched with the case group for time of enrollment, age, sex, history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and diabetes., RESULTS: There were 277 patients in the GK group and 2770 matched subjects in the non-GK group. The GK group had a higher overall incidence of cataracts (10.11% vs. 7.26%; crude hazard ratio [cHR], 1.59; 95% CI, 1.07-2.36; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.25; 95% CI, 0.82-1.90) than the non-GK group. Patients who had undergone computed tomography and/or cerebral angiography (CT/angio) studies had a higher risk of developing cataracts than those who did not (10.82% vs. 6.64%; cHR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.31-2.30; aHR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.22-2.23). The age group between 30 and 50 years had the highest risk of cataractogenesis in both the GK and CT/angio groups (cHR, 3.50; 95% CI, 1.58-7.72; aHR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.02-5.81; cHR, 2.96; 95% CI, 1.47-5.99; aHR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.05-4.93, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: Radiation exposure due to GKRS and CT/angio study may be independently associated with increased risk of cataractogenesis. We suggest routine dosimetry measurement of eye lens and proper protection for patients with benign lesions during GKRS. Regular follow-up imaging studies should avoid the use of CT/angio, and particular care should be taken in the 30-50-year-old age group, due to their significantly increased risk of cataract formation.",Included
1736,"Mortality from diseases other than cancer following low doses of ionizing radiation: results from the 15-Country Study of nuclear industry workers. BACKGROUND: Ionizing radiation at very high (radio-therapeutic) dose levels can cause diseases other than cancer, particularly heart diseases. There is increasing evidence that doses of the order of a few sievert (Sv) may also increase the risk of non-cancer diseases. It is not known, however, whether such effects also occur following the lower doses and dose rates of public health concern., METHODS: We used data from an international (15-country) nuclear workers cohort study to evaluate whether mortality from diseases other than cancer is related to low doses of external ionizing radiation. Analyses included 275 312 workers with adequate information on socioeconomic status, over 4 million person-years of follow-up and an average cumulative radiation dose of 20.7 mSv; 11 255 workers had died of non-cancer diseases., RESULTS: The excess relative risk (ERR) per Sv was 0.24 [95% CI (confidence intervals) -0.23, 0.78] for mortality from all non-cancer diseases and 0.09 (95% CI -0.43, 0.70) for circulatory diseases. Higher risk estimates were observed for mortality from respiratory and digestive diseases, but confidence intervals included zero. Increased risks were observed among the younger workers (attained age <50 years, identified post hoc) for all groupings of non-cancer causes of death, including external causes. It is unclear therefore whether these findings reflect real effects of radiation, random variation or residual confounding., CONCLUSIONS: The most informative low-dose radiation study to date provides little evidence for a relationship between mortality from non-malignant diseases and radiation dose. However, we cannot rule out risks per unit dose of the same order of magnitude as found in studies at higher doses.",Included
1739,"Personalized space radiation dosimetry using monte carlo simulations of CT-based geometries exposed to solar particle event radiation. Purpose/Objective(s): A serious concern for space exploration to the Moon or Mars is astronaut exposure to ionizing radiation in a solar particle event (SPE). SPE are unpredictable, variable in intensity and energy spectrum, and are primarily protons with kinetic energies below 100 MeV. The dose from an SPE is highly inhomogeneous and sensitive to physical parameters such as energy spectrum, shielding, and anisotropy. The biological effects of low dose-rate proton radiation are not fully understood. Interpretation of data from ground-based experiments in animal models is complicated by inhomogeneous distribution of dose to sensitive organs. Planning and preparation for space exploration vitally relies on accurate prediction of the health risk associated with exposure to SPE. Materials/Methods: We have developed a Monte Carlo radiation transport tool that incorporates CT scans into dose calculations of radiobiological experiments in animal models and simulated exposure of humans to SPE radiation. This allows accurate predictions of SPE dose and is used to develop dose-toxicity data for pre-clinical animal experiments and for predicting astronaut organ doses from exposure to SPE radiation. Result(s): We validated this tool using phantom measurements and determine organ doses for Yucatan mini-pigs exposed to simulated SPE radiation designed to match 3 historical events with relatively low (October, 1989), intermediate (September, 1989) and high (August, 1972) levels of >100 MeV protons to model toxicity vs dose in critical internal organs. These studies show a paradoxical increase in clinical/systemic toxicity for SPE with lower internal dose that appears to correlate with suppression of leukocyte counts. For astronaut SPE exposures, we applied this tool to 4 different human model (2 male, 2 female) astronauts exposed to the 3 SPE in geometries designed to simulate exposure within a space suit or capsule. The results indicate that not only does an astronaut's dose to specific organs (e.g., skin, eyes, and lungs) differ substantially for different SPE, different astronauts receive significantly different organ doses even with the same SPE exposure. Conclusion(s): These studies clearly show the value of our dosimetry system for two critically interrelated uses: determining the dose to organ systems for SPE exposed astronauts and helping ensure that earth based experiments reproduce appropriate dose distributions in order to maximize the applicability of these findings. Our results suggest that a personalized approach for astronaut dosimetry may be valuable in determining the course of clinical action in the event of an SPE exposure.",Included
1741,"Elevated mortality among birds in Chernobyl as judged from skewed age and sex ratios. BACKGROUND: Radiation has negative effects on survival of animals including humans, although the generality of this claim is poorly documented under low-dose field conditions. Because females may suffer disproportionately from the effects of radiation on survival due to differences in sex roles during reproduction, radiation-induced mortality may result in male-skewed adult sex ratios., METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING: We estimated the effects of low-dose radiation on adult survival rates in birds by determining age ratios of adults captured in mist nets during the breeding season in relation to background radiation levels around Chernobyl and in nearby uncontaminated control areas. Age ratios were skewed towards yearlings, especially in the most contaminated areas, implying that adult survival rates were reduced in contaminated areas, and that populations in such areas could only be maintained through immigration from nearby uncontaminated areas. Differential mortality in females resulted in a strongly male-skewed sex ratio in the most contaminated areas. In addition, males sang disproportionately commonly in the most contaminated areas where the sex ratio was male skewed presumably because males had difficulty finding and acquiring mates when females were rare. The results were not caused by permanent emigration by females from the most contaminated areas because none of the recaptured birds had changed breeding site, and the proportion of individuals with morphological abnormalities did not differ significantly between the sexes for areas with normal and higher levels of contamination., CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the adult survival rate of female birds is particularly susceptible to the effects of low-dose radiation, resulting in male skewed sex ratios at high levels of radiation. Such skewed age ratios towards yearlings in contaminated areas are consistent with the hypothesis that an area exceeding 30,000 km(2) in Chernobyl's surroundings constitutes an ecological trap that causes dramatic excess mortality.",Included

1789,"Evaluating the radioprotective effect of Cimetidine, IMOD, and hybrid radioprotectors agents: An in-vitro study. INTRODUCTION: There are various radioprotective agents with different mechanisms that help to decrease ionizing radiation side effects. The radioprotective effect of Cimetidine and IMOD was assessed individually and compared with the hybrid radioprotectors agents (HRPAs-IMOD and Cimetidine) on human lymphocyte cells., METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers (ten men and ten women) participated in the present study. About 75 mL peripheral blood lymphocytes from each individual were collected, and they were divided into 36 groups. Briefly, the blood samples were treated with different concentrations of Cimetidine (12.6 and 25.2 mug/mL) and IMOD (0.04, 0.08, and 0.12 mg/mL), and also a combination of these agents, namely hybrid radioprotectors agents (HRPAs). Besides, the irradiated groups were exposed to 2 and 4 Gy of Co-60 gamma irradiation. The amount of cellular damage was assessed using the micronucleus assay. The repeated measurements and paired T-test statistical analysis were used to compare the micronucleus frequencies in different groups., RESULTS: The micronucleus frequencies were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) in irradiated groups when the non-toxic concentrations of Cimetidine, IMOD, and HRPAs have been used. The reduction in micronucleus frequency was obtained 5-29% for Cimetidine and 40-51% for IMOD in peripheral blood lymphocytes irradiated with 2 Gy. This reduction in 4 Gy irradiation was 8-17% for Cimetidine and 27-37% for IMOD. The HRPAs resulted in a higher radioprotective effect, in a way that they cause up to 58% and 43% micronucleus frequency reduction in 2 and 4 Gy, respectively., CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the HRPAs showed the highest level of radioprotective. In addition, IMOD was remarkably higher radioprotective than Cimetidine, which may be related to its greater non-toxic concentrations. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Included

The SMRs for all causes of death were significantly lower than expected in both men (SMR 0.45, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.48) and women (SMR 0.49, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.58). No excesses were observed for any specific cause of death. The findings were similar by job title, calendar year of entry and year of birth. However, relative to all causes of death, mortality from all cancers (rSMR 1.60, 95% CI 1.41 to 1.82), leukaemia, colon cancer, stomach cancer and diseases of the circulatory system increased significantly among male workers. The results for female workers were limited due to small number of deaths; however, the rSMR for all cancers was significantly elevated (rSMR 1.70, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.46)., CONCLUSIONS: This cohort showed lower mortality among diagnostic medical radiation workers than in the general population. However, occupational factors may have been involved in the increased relative mortality for several causes of death. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018. No commercial re-use.

1818,"Differential radio-adaptive responses in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice: pivotal role of calcium and nitric oxide signalling. Purpose: Our earlier studies demonstrated that transient radio-adaptive responses (RAR) in BALB/c mice were due to MAPK hyperactivation. The objective of this study was to determine the time duration of this low dose induced MAPK activation in BALB/c mice and to find out if similar adaptive responses are observed in C57BL/6 mice. Materials and methods: Mice were irradiated with 0.1 Gy priming dose (PD), 2 Gy challenge dose (CD) with an interval of 4 h (P + CD) and radiation induced immunosuppression in splenic lymphocytes was monitored as the endpoint for RAR. Results: Time kinetics following 0.1 Gy demonstrated persistence of MAPK hyperactivation till 48 h. Similar experiments in C57BL/6 mice indicated absence of RAR at 24 h following CD, in spite of MAPK activation which was also confirmed by time kinetics. Therefore, upstream activators of MAPK, viz., reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS, RNS) and calcium levels were estimated. There was increased intracellular calcium (Ca2+) and nitric oxide (NO) in BALB/c and an increase in intracellular ROS in C57BL/6 mice 24 h after PD. Inhibition of NO and calcium chelation abrogated RAR in BALB/c mice. In vitro treatment of spleen cells with combination of NO donor and Ca2+ ionophore mimicked the effect of PD and induced adaptive response after 2 Gy not only in BALB/c but also in C57BL/6 mice confirming their crucial role in RAR. Conclusions: These results suggest that low dose induced differential induction of Ca2+ and NO signaling along with MAPK was responsible for contrasting RAR with respect to immune system of BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice.

1820,"Late Effects of Head and Neck Radiotherapy on Pulp Vitality Assessed by Pulse Oximetry. INTRODUCTION: Radiation therapy (RT) of malignant tumors in the head and neck area may have damaging effects on surrounding tissues. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the long-term effects of ionizing radiation on pulp vitality by measuring pulp oxygenation levels (%SpO2) in patients with history of RT of intraoral and oropharyngeal tumors 4-6 years after treatment., METHODS: In an experimental group RT (n = 90, history of RT) and a control group CON (n = 90, no history of RT), pulp vitality was assessed by measuring %SpO2 by using pulse oximetry and pulp sensitivity by cold thermal testing. All anterior teeth without history of endodontic therapy of the participants in group RT were measured (n = 693), regardless of the quadrant and the irradiated area. An equal number of anterior teeth were tested in group CON., RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the %SpO2 levels in group RT (92.7%; standard deviation, +/- 1.83) and group CON (92.6%; standard deviation, +/- 1.80). All teeth in RT and CON groups showed a positive response to the thermal test. All tested teeth were considered vital., CONCLUSIONS: Pulp %SpO2 was found to be within normal limits 4-6 years after RT. This suggests that RT may not have a long-term influence on pulp vitality, and reported short-term changes in pulpal microcirculation because of RT may be temporary.

1856,"Long-term outcomes after radiosurgery for acoustic neuromas. BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiosurgery is the principal alternative to microsurgical resection for acoustic neuromas (vestibular schwannomas). The goals of radiosurgery are the long-term prevention of tumor growth, maintenance of neurologic function, and prevention of new neurologic deficits. Although acceptable short-term outcomes have been reported, long-term outcomes have not been well documented., METHODS: We evaluated 162 consecutive patients who underwent radiosurgery for acoustic neuromas between 1987 and 1992 by means of serial imaging tests, clinical evaluations, and a survey between 5 and 10 years after the procedure. The average dose of radiation to the tumor margin was 16 Gy, and the mean transverse diameter of the tumor was 22 mm (range, 8 to 39). Resection had been performed previously in 42 patients (26 percent); in 13 patients the tumor represented a recurrence of disease after a previous total resection. Facial function was normal in 76 percent of the patients before radiosurgery, and 20 percent had useful hearing., RESULTS: The rate of tumor control (with no resection required) was 98 percent. One hundred tumors (62 percent) became smaller, 53 (33 percent) remained unchanged in size, and 9 (6 percent) became slightly larger. Resection was performed in four patients (2 percent) within four years after radiosurgery. Normal facial function was preserved in 79 percent of the patients after five years (House-Brackmann grade 1), and normal trigeminal function was preserved in 73 percent. Fifty-one percent of the patients had no change in hearing ability. No new neurologic deficits appeared more than 28 months after radiosurgery. An outcomes questionnaire was returned by 115 patients (77 percent of the 149 patients still living). Fifty-four of these patients (47 percent) were employed at the time of radiosurgery, and 37 (69 percent) remained so. Radiosurgery was believed to have been successful by all 30 patients who had undergone surgery previously and by 81 (95 percent) of the 85 who had not. Thirty-six of the 115 patients (31 percent) described at least one complication, which resolved in 56 percent of those cases., CONCLUSIONS: Radiosurgery can provide long-term control of acoustic neuromas while preserving neurologic function.",Included

Systemic and local radiation injuries caused by nuclear power reactor accidents, therapeutic irradiation, or nuclear terrorism should be prevented or properly treated in order to improve wound management and save lives. Currently, regenerative surgical modalities should be attempted with temporal artificial dermis impregnated and sprayed with a local angiogenic factor such as basic fibroblast growth factor, and secondary reconstruction can be a candidate for demarcation and saving the donor morbidity. Human mesenchymal stem cells and adipose-derived stem cells, together with angiogenic and mitogenic factor of basic fibroblast growth factor and an artificial dermis, were applied over the excised irradiated skin defect and were tested for differentiation and local stimulation effects in the radiation-exposed wounds. The perforator flap and artificial dermal template with growth factor were successful for reconstruction in patients who were suffering from complex underlying disease. Patients were uneventfully treated with minimal morbidities. In the experiments, the hMSCs are strongly proliferative even after 20 Gy irradiation in vitro. In vivo, 4 Gy rat whole body irradiation demonstrated that sustained marrow stromal (mesenchymal stem) cells survived in the bone marrow. Immediate artificial dermis application impregnated with cells and the cytokine over the 20 Gy irradiated skin and soft tissues demonstrated the significantly improved fat angiogenesis, architected dermal reconstitution, and less inflammatory epidermal recovery. Detailed understanding of underlying diseases and rational reconstructive procedures brings about good outcomes for difficult irradiated wound healing.

About half the number of the males had terminal ductal-lobular carcinomas and all but 2 of the papillary duct carcinomas also arose in males. Large tumors frequently exhibited squamous, chondromatous, osseous, fatty and myoepitheliomatous types of tissues. In 2 irradiated males and 1 female the tumors metastasized.

All females had cystic ovaries without increase in granulosa cells, 24 (66.6%) had uterine tumors and 13 (34.2%) had adrenal gland tumors; all males had atrophic testes, 5 (16.5%) had testicular and 6 (22.2%) had adrenal gland tumors.",Included
1902,"DNA damage and repair of head and neck cancer cells after radio- and chemotherapy. DNA repair is critical for successful chemo- and radiotherapy of human tumours, because their genotoxic sensitivity may vary in different types of cancer cells. In this study we have compared DNA damage and the efficiency of its repair after genotoxic treatment with hydrogen peroxide, cisplatin and gamma-radiation of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Lymphocytes and tissue cells from biopsies of 37 cancer patients and 35 healthy donors as well as the HTB-43 larynx cancer cell line were employed. The cell sensitivity to genotoxic treatment was estimated by the MTT survival assay. The extent of DNA damage and efficiency of its repair was examined by the alkaline comet assay. Among the examined treatments, we found that HNSCC cells were the most sensitive to gamma-radiation and displayed impaired DNA repair. In particular, DNA damage was repaired less effectively in cells from HNSCC metastasis than healthy controls. In conclusion, our results suggest that the different genotoxic sensitivity of HNSCC cells may depend on their DNA repair capacity what in turn may be connected with the effectiveness of head and neck cancer therapy. © 2009 Verlag der Zeitschrift fur Naturforschung, Tubingen.",Included

As part of an investigation of the responses of optic and proximate tissues to heavy-ion irradiation, the lenses of New Zealand white rabbits were exposed to the Bragg plateau regions of 530 MeV/amu Ar ions and 365 MeV/amu Ne ions and also to 60Co gamma-photons. The linear energy transfers (LET infinity s) for the radiations were 90 +/- 5, 35 +/- 3, and 0.3 keV/micrometer, respectively. After irradiation, lenticular opacities were monitored through their incipient and/or clinical stages (less than or equal to 5 years) by slit-lamp biomicroscopy and scored with subjective, but well-defined, indices. Cataractogenesis, which progressed according to the model proposed by Rubin and Casarett (1968), was modified by radiation quality in the following ways. (1) The rate of development of the early (acute) stage increased with the LET infinity of the incident radiation; (2) at the intermediate (plateau) stage, the values for the relative biological effectiveness (r.b.e.) of the heavy ions were similar to those reported for proliferating cells in culture; (3) for a given intermediate level, the onset of late cataractogenesis occurred earlier the higher the LET affinity of the radiation involved. As with alopecia, the r.b.e.s for cataractogenesis varied with post-irradiation time.",Included
1916,"Increased susceptibility to ionizing radiation in mice with ST6Gal-1 deficiency. Sporadic reports have associated the degree of N-linked alpha2,6 sialylation, mediated by the sialyltransferase ST6Gal-1, with increased chemo-and radio-resistance of tumor cells, therapeutic failures in colorectal cancers, and protection against Fas-mediated apoptosis. Radiation exposure, whether iatrogenic or accidental, is a significant health concern. ST6Gal-1 has been suggested as a candidate biomarker for exposure to ionizing radiation; both enzyme expression and the level of protein sialylation increase following radiation exposure in a dose dependent manner. Here we report a striking sensitivity of animals with non-functional ST6Gal-1 to ionizing radiation. We attempted to rescue st6gal1-KO and wild-type C57BL/6J mice that were subjected to 12 Gy full body irradiation by bone marrow transplantation with congenic wild-type marrow cells. While the wild-type, st6gal1-normal animals uniformly survived the procedure, st6gal1-KO mice suffered 100% morbidity within 8 days of irradiation. There was comparable homing and retention of donor cells to the marrow of st6gal1-KO and wild-type recipients, and failure of hematopoietic cell engraftment was unlikely as a cause for morbidity. However, st6gal1-KO recipients suffered heavy damage to the gastrointestinal tract resulting in an almost complete loss of absorptive tissue and integrity of the gastrointestinal architecture. This damage was far less severe in the wild-type recipients. Damage to the gastrointestinal tract is an especially frequent and detrimental complication of radiation used in cancer therapy. Our data indicate a critical role for ST6Gal-1 in the maintenance of radioresistance in the gastrointestinal tract.",Included

OBJECTIVES: To provide direct estimates of risk of cancer after protracted low doses of ionising radiation and to strengthen the scientific basis of radiation protection standards for environmental, occupational, and medical diagnostic exposures., DESIGN: Multinational retrospective cohort study of cancer mortality., SETTING: Cohorts of workers in the nuclear industry in 15 countries., PARTICIPANTS: 407 391 workers individually monitored for external radiation with a total follow-up of 5.2 million person years., MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Estimates of excess relative risks per sievert (Sv) of radiation dose for mortality from cancers other than leukaemia and from leukaemia excluding chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, the main causes of death considered by radiation protection authorities., RESULTS: The excess relative risk for cancers other than leukaemia was 0.97 per Sv, 95% confidence interval 0.14 to 1.97. Analyses of causes of death related or unrelated to smoking indicate that, although confounding by smoking may be present, it is unlikely to explain all of this increased risk. The excess relative risk for leukaemia excluding chronic lymphocytic leukaemia was 1.93 per Sv (< 0 to 8.47). On the basis of these estimates, 1-2% of deaths from cancer among workers in this cohort may be attributable to radiation., CONCLUSIONS: These estimates, from the largest study of nuclear workers ever conducted, are higher than, but statistically compatible with, the risk estimates used for current radiation protection standards. The results suggest that there is a small excess risk of cancer, even at the low doses and dose rates typically received by nuclear workers in this study.",Included

The Life Span Study (LSS) of Japanese atomic bomb survivors has served as the primary basis for estimates of radiation-related disease risks that inform radiation protection standards. The long-term follow-up of radiation-monitored nuclear workers provides estimates of radiation-cancer associations that complement findings from the LSS. Here, a comparison of radiation-cancer mortality risk estimates derived from the LSS and INWORKS, a large international nuclear worker study, is presented. Restrictions were made, so that the two study populations were similar with respect to ages and periods of exposure, leading to selection of 45,625 A-bomb survivors and 259,350 nuclear workers. For solid cancer, excess relative rates (ERR) per gray (Gy) were 0.28 (90% CI 0.18; 0.38) in the LSS, and 0.29 (90% CI 0.07; 0.53) in INWORKS. A joint analysis of the data allowed for a formal assessment of heterogeneity of the ERR per Gy across the two studies (P=0.909), with minimal evidence of curvature or of a modifying effect of attained age, age at exposure, or sex in either study. There was evidence in both cohorts of modification of the excess absolute risk (EAR) of solid cancer by attained age, with a trend of increasing EAR per Gy with attained age. For leukemia, under a simple linear model, the ERR per Gy was 2.75 (90% CI 1.73; 4.21) in the LSS and 3.15 (90% CI 1.12; 5.72) in INWORKS, with evidence of curvature in the association across the range of dose observed in the LSS but not in INWORKS; the EAR per Gy was 3.54 (90% CI 2.30; 5.05) in the LSS and 2.03 (90% CI 0.36; 4.07) in INWORKS. These findings from different study populations may help understanding of radiation risks, with INWORKS contributing information derived from cohorts of workers with protracted low dose-rate exposures.",Included

Dose-effect curves for the quantal responses of moist desquamation (early epithelial response) and dermal necrosis (late response) were fitted by probit analysis and ED50 values obtained. For a neutron fractionation scheme comprised of 12 fractions in 26 days, and using an unfiltered beam, the ED50 values for moist desquamation and dermal necrosis were 18.67 +/- 2.22 and 22.25 +/- 0.48 Gy, respectively, whereas in the case of the filtered beam, the corresponding ED50 values were 24.78 +/- 1.44 and 23.30 +/- 0.47 Gy.

PURPOSE: In vitro, ionizing radiation of epithelial cells leads to upregulation of wild-type p53 and subsequent induction of p21(waf1). The effect of radiotherapy (RT) on the expression of these proteins in patients is unknown. We assessed the influence of RT on the expression of p53 and p21(waf1) in normal mucosa and rectal carcinomas in vivo., METHODS: Tumor and normal tissue samples were derived from rectal cancer patients randomized in a clinical trial in which the value of preoperative RT was evaluated. p53 and p21(waf1) expression was determined in 51 irradiated and 52 nonirradiated patients using immunohistochemistry., RESULTS: In normal mucosa, both p53 and p21(waf1) were strongly upregulated after RT compared with the expression in unirradiated normal tissue (p <0.001). In tumor cells, no significant difference in the expression of p53 or p21(waf1) was found in the irradiated vs. nonirradiated group. In the few rectal tumors with wild-type p53, induction of p53 after RT did not necessarily lead to upregulation of p21(waf1)., CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that in normal mucosa, a functional p53-p21(waf1) pathway is present, whereas in tumor cells it is defective in almost all cases because of either p53 mutation or down- or upstream disruption in tumors with wild-type p53. Therefore, we believe that the role of p53 expression as a single prognostic marker in rectal cancer needs reconsideration.",Included

Adult human dental pulp contains stem cells (DPSCs) that are capable of differentiation into osteoblasts, odontoblasts, adipocytes, and neuronal-like cells. Because these cells have potential use in tissue regeneration, herein we characterized the response of DPSC lines to ionizing radiation (IR). These DPSC lines have been developed from the extracted molars of healthy donors. DPSCs were cultivated in a unique media supplemented with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Since tissue homeostasis depends on a precise balance among cell proliferation, senescence, and cell death, we explored the effects of IR (2-20 Gy) on the proliferative activity of DPSCs and the molecular pathways involved. Even the highest dose used (20 Gy) did not induce DPSC apoptosis. After irradiation with doses of 6 and 20 Gy, DPSCs accumulated in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. DPSCs responded to IR (20 Gy) with senescence detected as SA-beta-galactosidase positivity, beginning on the third day after irradiation. Twenty-four hours after irradiation, p53 and its serine 15 and 392 phosphorylated forms were detected. At this time, p21 (WAF1) was induced. Increases in protein p16 were observed from the third day following irradiation and continued till the end of the examination (Day 13). We conclude that DPSCs respond to IR-induced damage by permanent cell cycle arrest in the G2 phase and by stress-induced premature senescence. © 2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Included

Objectives: To investigate the salivary anionic changes of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treated by radiotherapy. Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty-eight patients with T1-4, N0-2, M0 NPC received conventional radiotherapy. Stimulated whole saliva was collected at baseline and 2, 6 and 12 months after radiotherapy. Salivary anions levels were measured using ion chromatography. Result(s): A reduction in stimulated saliva flow and salivary pH was accompanied by sustained changes in anionic composition. At 2 months following radiotherapy, there was a significant increase in chloride, sulphate, lactate and formate levels while significant reductions in nitrate and thiocyanate levels were found. No further changes in these anion levels were observed at 6 and 12 months. No significant changes were found in phosphate, acetate, or propionate levels throughout the study period. Conclusion(s): Conventional radiotherapy has a significant and prolonged impact on certain anionic species, likely contributing to increased cariogenic properties and reduced antimicrobial capacities of saliva in NPC patients post-radiotherapy.Copyright © 2016 Pow et al.

We have analyzed recently published data on the effects of low doses of fission neutrons on the mean survival times of mice. The analysis for single-dose exposures was confined to doses of 20 rad or less, while for fractionated exposures only total doses of 80 rad or less were considered. We fitted the data to the frequently used power function model: life shortening = beta D lambda, where D is the radiation dose. We show that, at low doses per fraction, either (1) the effects are not additive or (2) the dose-effect curve for single exposures cannot show a greater negative curvature than about the 0.9 power of dose. Analysis of the data for gamma rays showed that an exponent of 1.0 gave an acceptable fit. Taken together, these findings indicate that the RBE for neutrons cannot change more rapidly with neutron dose than about RBEN approximately = k/D0.1N. This conflicts with the more widely accepted relationship, RBEN approximately = k/D0.5N. Because of the inherent implausibility of exponents less than 1.0 for the neutron dose-effect curves at low doses we conclude that at neutron doses of 20 rad or less the RBE for life shortening is constant and ranges from 13 to 22 depending on mouse strain and sex.",Included

BACKGROUND: We reviewed the disease control and complications of the treatment of sacrococcygeal chordoma from four tertiary cancer centers with emphasis on the effects of radiotherapy in surgically treated patients., METHODS: A total of 193 patients with primary sacrococcygeal chordoma from 1990 to 2015 were reviewed. There were 124 males, with a mean age of 59 +/- 15 years and a mean follow-up of 7 +/- 4 years. Eighty-nine patients received radiotherapy with a mean total dose of 61.8 +/- 10.9 Gy., RESULTS: The 10-year disease-free and disease-specific survival was 58% and 72%, respectively. Radiation was not associated with local recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59-2.17; P = 0.71), metastases (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.45-1.91; P = 0.85) or disease-specific survival (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.46-2.00; P = 0.91). Higher doses (>=70 Gy; HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.20-1.32; P = 0.17) may be associated with reduced local recurrence. Radiotherapy was associated with wound complications (HR, 2.76; 95% CI, 1.64-4.82;, P < 0.001) and sacral stress fractures (HR, 4.73; 95% CI, 1.88-14.38; P < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: In this multicenter review, radiotherapy was not associated with tumor outcome but associated with complications. The routine use of radiotherapy with en-bloc resection of sacrococcygeal chordomas should be reconsidered in favor of a selective, individualized approach with a radiation dose of >=70 Gy.

AIM: The main objective was to delineate the rates and clinical course of sexual function and depression in cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-eight male and 90 female radiotherapy-naive outpatients with breast or pelvic cancer completed the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) or the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), and the Hamilton Depression Scale (HDS) prior to (phase 1), at the end of (phase 2) and 12 months after radiotherapy (phase 3)., RESULTS: Overall, the majority of patients (93.8% of males and 80% of females) experienced intense sexual dysfunction. At presentation, males reported severe erectile dysfunction that was significantly associated with age. However, only in sexual desire was the difference between baseline and phase 3 significant. In females, an improvement was observed in all parameters of FSFI between phase 1 and 3. Females with stage III disease achieved lower scores in almost all parameters of FSFI than those with stage II. Finally, although a quarter of patients reported elevated depression scores, depression was not related to sexual function., CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of cancer patients experience intense levels of sexual dysfunction and depression throughout radiotherapy and the subsequent year. Pelvic radiotherapy affected sexual function to a higher degree than did breast radiotherapy.",Included
2133,"Head and neck radiotherapy does not increase gelatinase (metalloproteinase-2 and -9) expression or activity in teeth irradiated in vivo. OBJECTIVE: Recent studies suggested that head and neck radiotherapy increases active forms of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the dentin-enamel junction (DEJ), leading to enamel delamination and radiation-related caries. This study aimed to assess the expression and activity of the gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the DEJ and dentin-pulp complex tissues of teeth irradiated in vivo., STUDY DESIGN: Thirty-six teeth were studied, including 19 irradiated and 17 non-irradiated controls. In situ zymography was used to investigate the gelatinolytic activity in the micromorphologic components of enamel, DEJ, dentin-pulp complex, and caries. Immunohistochemical analysis was conducted on the demineralized samples to assess MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression levels in the DEJ, dentin-pulp complex components, and caries., RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were detected between groups in gelatinolytic activity or in MMP-2 expression levels (P > .05). Odontoblast MMP-9 expression was reduced in the irradiated group (P = .02)., CONCLUSIONS: The study rejected the hypothesis that MMP-2 and MMP-9 would be overexpressed or more activated in the DEJ and dentin-pulp complex of irradiated teeth. Direct effects of radiation should not be regarded as an independent factor for explaining radiation-related caries onset and progression. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

2144,"Inflammatory disease and C-reactive protein in relation to therapeutic ionising radiation exposure in the US Radiologic Technologists. Chronic inflammation underlies many autoimmune diseases, including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and rheumatoid arthritis, also type-2 diabetes and osteoarthritis. Associations have been suggested of high-dose ionising radiation exposure with type-2 diabetes and elevated levels of C-reactive protein, a marker of chronic inflammation. In this analysis we used a proportional hazards model to assess effects of radiotherapy on risks of subsequent inflammatory disease morbidity in 110,368 US radiologic technologists followed from a baseline survey (1983-1989/1994-1998) through 2008. We used a linear model to assess log-transformed C-reactive protein concentration following radiotherapy in 1326 technologists. Relative risk of diabetes increased following radiotherapy (p < 0.001), and there was a borderline significant increasing trend per treatment (p = 0.092). For osteoarthritis there was increased relative risk associated with prior radiotherapy on all questionnaires (p = 0.005), and a significant increasing trend per previous treatment (p = 0.024). No consistent increases were observed for other types of inflammatory disease (hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis) associated with radiotherapy. There was a borderline significant (p = 0.059) increasing trend with dose for C-reactive protein with numbers of prior radiotherapy treatments. Our results suggest that radiotherapy is associated with subsequent increased risk of certain inflammatory conditions, which is reinforced by our finding of elevated levels of C-reactive protein.",Included
2145,"Occupational ionising radiation and risk of basal cell carcinoma in US radiologic technologists (1983-2005). Objective To determine risk for incident basal cell carcinoma from cumulative low-dose ionising radiation in the US radiologic technologist cohort. Methods We analysed 65 719 Caucasian technologists who were cancer-free at baseline (1983-1989 or 1994-1998) and answered a follow-up questionnaire (2003-2005). Absorbed radiation dose to the skin in mGy for estimated cumulative occupational radiation exposure was reconstructed for each technologist based on badge dose measurements, questionnaire-derived work history and protection practices, and literature information. Radiation-Associated risk was assessed using Poisson regression and included adjustment for several demographic, lifestyle, host and sun exposure factors. Results Cumulative mean absorbed skin dose (to head/ neck/arms) was 55.8 mGy (range 0-1735 mGy). For lifetime cumulative dose, we did not observe an excess radiation-related risk (excess relative risk/Gy=-0.01 (95% CI -0.43 to 0.52). However, we observed that basal cell carcinoma risk was increased for radiation dose received before age 30 (excess relative risk/ Gy=0.59, 95% CI -0.11 to 1.42) and before 1960 (excess relative risk/Gy=2.92, 95% CI 1.39 to 4.45). Conclusions Basal cell carcinoma risk was unrelated to low-dose radiation exposure among radiologic technologists. Because of uncertainties in dosimetry and sensitivity to model specifications, both our null results and our findings of excess risk for dose received before age 30 and exposure before 1960 should be interpreted with caution.",Included

2182,"Cognitive and radiological effects of radiotherapy in patients with low-grade glioma: long-term follow-up. BACKGROUND: Our previous study on cognitive functioning among 195 patients with low-grade glioma (LGG) a mean of 6 years after diagnosis suggested that the tumour itself, rather than the radiotherapy used to treat it, has the most deleterious effect on cognitive functioning; only high fraction dose radiotherapy (>2 Gy) resulted in significant added cognitive deterioration. The present study assesses the radiological and cognitive abnormalities in survivors of LGG at a mean of 12 years after first diagnosis., METHODS: Patients who have had stable disease since the first assessment were invited for follow-up cognitive assessment (letter-digit substitution test, concept shifting test, Stroop colour-word test, visual verbal learning test, memory comparison test, and categoric word fluency). Compound scores in six cognitive domains (attention, executive functioning, verbal memory, working memory, psychomotor functioning, and information processing speed) were calculated to detect differences between patients who had radiotherapy and patients who did not have radiotherapy. White-matter hyperintensities and global cortical atrophy were rated on MRI scans., FINDINGS: 65 patients completed neuropsychological follow-up at a mean of 12 years (range 6-28 years). 32 (49%) patients had received radiotherapy (three had fraction doses >2 Gy). The patients who had radiotherapy had more deficits that affected attentional functioning at the second follow-up, regardless of fraction dose, than those who did not have radiotherapy (-1.6 [SD 2.4] vs -0.1 [1.3], p=0.003; mean difference 1.4, 95% CI 0.5-2.4). The patients who had radiotherapy also did worse in measures of executive functioning (-2.0 [3.7] vs -0.5 [1.2], p=0.03; mean difference 1.5, 0.2-2.9) and information processing speed (-2.0 [3.7] vs -0.6 [1.5], p=0.05; mean difference 0.8, 0.009-1.6]) between the two assessments. Furthermore, attentional functioning deteriorated significantly between the first and second assessments in patients who had radiotherapy (p=0.25). In total, 17 (53%) patients who had radiotherapy developed cognitive disabilities deficits in at least five of 18 neuropsychological test parameters compared with four (27%) patients who were radiotherapy naive. White-matter hyperintensities and global cortical atrophy were associated with worse cognitive functioning in several domains., INTERPRETATION: Long-term survivors of LGG who did not have radiotherapy had stable radiological and cognitive status. By contrast, patients with low-grade glioma who received radiotherapy showed a progressive decline in attentional functioning, even those who received fraction doses that are regarded as safe (</=2 Gy). These cognitive deficits are associated with radiological abnormalities. Our results suggest that the risk of long-term cognitive and radiological compromise that is associated with radiotherapy should be considered when treatment is planned., FUNDING: Kaptein Fonds; Schering Plough.",Included

2203,"Toxicity Related to Radiotherapy Dose and Targeting Strategy: A Pooled Analysis of Cooperative Group Trials of Combined Modality Therapy for Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. OBJECTIVE: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) was the standard treatment for locally advanced NSCLC (LA-NSCLC). This study was performed to examine thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) parameters and their impact on adverse events (AEs)., METHODS: We collected individual patient data from 3600 patients with LA-NSCLC who participated in 16 cooperative group trials of concurrent CRT. The TRT parameters examined included field design strategy (elective nodal irradiation [ENI] versus involved-field [IF] TRT [IF-TRT]) and TRT dose (60 Gy versus >=60 Gy). The primary end point of this analysis was the occurrence of AEs. ORs for AEs were calculated with univariable and multivariable logistic models., RESULTS: TRT doses ranged from 60 to 74 Gy. ENI was not associated with more grade 3 or higher AEs than IF-TRT was (multivariable OR = 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.543-1.102, p = 0.1545). Doses higher than 60 Gy (high-dose TRT) were associated with significantly more grade 3 or higher AEs (multivariable OR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.501-2.203, p < 0.0001). In contrast, ENI was associated with significantly more grade 4 or higher AEs (multivariable OR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.035-1.709, p = 0.0258). Doses higher than 60 Gy were also associated with more grade 4 or higher AEs (multivariate OR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.191-1.700, p = 0.0001). Grade 5 AEs plus treatment-related deaths were more frequent with higher-dose TRT (p = 0.0012) but not ENI (p = 0.099)., CONCLUSIONS: For patients with LA-NSCLC treated with concurrent CRT, IF-TRT was not associated with the overall risk of grade 3 or higher AEs but was associated with significantly fewer grade 4 or higher AEs than ENI TRT. This is likely the result of irradiation of a lesser amount of adjacent critical normal tissue. Higher TRT doses were associated significantly with grade 3 or higher and grade 4 or higher AEs. On the basis of these findings and our prior report on survival, CRT using IF-TRT and 60 Gy (conventionally fractionated) were associated with more favorable patient survival and less toxicity than was the use of ENI or higher radiotherapy doses.

2213,"Validation of the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay for use as a triage biological dosimetry tool. Traditionally, the dicentric chromosome assay (DCA) has been used to derive biological dose estimates for unknown radiological exposures. While sensitive, this assay requires highly trained evaluators and is extremely time consuming. The cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay has been suggested as an alternative to the DCA, as it is much faster to evaluate samples and requires less technical expertise. In order to validate this assay for triage biodosimetry, dose-response curves were generated for six donors at eight doses of gamma-radiation (0-4.0 Gy). Each sample was evaluated by 12 individuals, among three different laboratories and the incidence of micronuclei was determined after counting 50-500 binucleated cells. This study demonstrated that the CBMN assay was capable of detecting radiation doses >or=1 Gy after scoring only 200 binucleated cells. As such, the CBMN assay may provide a sensitive and reliable technique for deployment as an initial screening tool in a large-scale radiological emergency where large numbers of biological dose estimates are required.",Included
2259,"Interventional cardiologists and risk of radiation-induced cataract: results of a French multicenter observational study. BACKGROUND: Interventional cardiologists (ICs) are exposed to X-rays and may be at risk to develop cataract earlier than common senile cataract. Excess risk of posterior subcapsular cataract, known as radiation-induced, was previously observed in samples of ICs from Malaysia, and Latin America. The O'CLOC study (Occupational Cataracts and Lens Opacities in interventional Cardiology) was performed to quantify the risk at the scale of France., METHODS: This cross-sectional multicenter study included an exposed group of ICs from different French centers and an unexposed control group of non-medical workers. Individual information was collected about cataract risk factors and past and present workload in catheterization laboratory. All participants had a clinical eye examination to classify the lens opacities (nuclear, cortical, or posterior subcapsular) with the international standard classification LOCS III., RESULTS: The study included 106 ICs (mean age = 51 +/- 7 years) and 99 unexposed control subjects (mean age = 50 +/- 7 years). The groups did not differ significantly in the prevalence of either nuclear or cortical lens opacities (61% vs. 69% and 23% vs. 29%, respectively). However, posterior subcapsular lens opacities, were significantly more frequent among ICs (17% vs. 5%, p=0.006), for an OR=3.9 [1.3-11.4]. The risk increased with duration of activity but no clear relationship with workload was observed. However, the risk appeared lower for regular users of protective lead glasses (OR=2.2 [0.4-12.8])., CONCLUSIONS: ICs, in France as elsewhere, are at high risk of posterior subcapsular cataracts. Use of protective equipment against X-rays, in particular lead glasses, is strongly recommended to limit this risk. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Included

Chromosome arms 1p, 1q, 7q, and 11p were also significantly more affected. Some bands also showed a special sensitivity to radiation, and band 1q32 was the most affected. This band is proposed as a hot point"" for the clastogenic effect of ionizing radiation. A significant clustering of breakpoints in G bands was also found, especially at the telomeres, as previously described by other authors.

2317,"Histopathologic Analysis of Lung Cancer Incidence Associated with Radon Exposure among Ontario Uranium Miners. Although radon is a well-established contributor to lung cancer mortality among uranium miners, the effects of radon decay products on different histopathologies of lung carcinoma are not well established. Using a retrospective cohort design, this study aims to examine the risks of lung cancer by histological subtypes associated with exposure to radon decay products among the Ontario Uranium Miners cohort. Cases were stratified by histological groups, and associated risks were estimated for cumulative radon exposure after adjustment for attained age and calendar period. Between 1969 and 2005, 1274 incident cases of primary lung cancer were identified. Of these, 1256 diagnoses (99%) contained information on histology. Squamous cell carcinoma was most common (31%), followed by adenocarcinoma (20%), large cells (18%), small cell lung carcinoma (14%), and other or unspecified cell types (17%). Of the histological sub-groups, small cell lung carcinoma had the strongest association with cumulative radon exposure; compared to the reference group (<1 cumulative working level months (WLM)), the highest exposure category (>60 cumulative WLM) had a relative risk (RR) of 2.76 (95% CI: 1.67-4.57). Adenocarcinoma had the lowest risk and was not significantly associated with exposure to radon decay products (RR = 1.49, 95% CI: 0.96-2.31). An increasing, linear trend in relative risk was noted with increasing cumulative WLM across small cell, squamous cell, and large cell lung carcinomas (Ptrend < 0.05). Similarly, the excess relative risk (ERR) per WLM was highest for small cell lung carcinoma (ERR/WLM = 0.15, p < 0.01), followed by squamous cell carcinoma (ERR/WLM = 0.12, p < 0.01). Non-statistically significant excess risk was observed for adenocarcinoma (ERR/WLM = 0.004, p = 0.07). Our analysis of the Ontario Uranium Miners cohort data shows differences in the magnitude of the risks across four histological subtypes of lung carcinoma; the strongest association was noted for small cell lung carcinoma, followed by squamous cell, large cell, and lastly adenocarcinoma, which showed no significant associations with exposure to radon decay products.",Included
2347,"Prior exposure to medical and dental x-rays related to tumors of the parotid gland. Findings from this population-based study in Los Angeles County suggest, for the first time, that tumors of the parotid gland are related to prior exposure to diagnostic medical and dental radiography. Responses to interviews with 408 patients with a parotid tumor (269 benign tumors and 139 malignant tumors) were compared to responses of 408 neighborhood controls. Cumulative exposure of the parotid gland from diagnostic radiography was associated with a dose-related increase in risk of malignant tumors (P for trend less than .05; relative risk for exposure to greater than or equal to 50 rad = 3.4; 95% confidence interval = 1.02-11.46). Benign tumors showed a weaker positive association, and exposure before age 20 to a major diagnostic examination (full-mouth or panoramic dental radiography or medical radiography to the head) increased risk (relative risk = 1.8; confidence interval = 1.13-2.91). This study also confirmed the association of malignant tumors with prior radiation treatment to the head or neck; 28% of these tumors are attributable to exposure of the parotid gland from diagnostic and therapeutic radiation.",Included
2349,"Radiation-induced comet-formation in human skin fibroblasts from radiotherapy patients with different normal tissue reactions. Background: In clinical radiotherapy most patients tolerate the applied dosage with no or moderate side effects. However, 5 to 10% of all individuals show increased acute and/or late reactions. In-vitro test systems are investigated for their suitability for predictive purposes. This paper attempts a correlation between the induction and repair of DNA damage measured in the comet assay and the clinical observed reaction in order to evaluate the suitability of the comet assay for prediction of radiation sensitivity. Patients and Methods: Skin fibroblasts of 30 patients with average tissue reactions or acute and/or late increased side effects and cell lines of 4 individuals carrying the heritable disease ataxia telangiectasia (AT) were irradiated in vitro. The induction and repair of DNA damage was measured at different time points after irradiation in the comet assay (single cell gel electrophoresis). These results were compared to the acute and late clinical reactions classified according to the RTOG grading system. Result(s): The radiation induced DNA damage decreased over time reflecting DNA repair. Cells of the AT individuals showed an elevated damage induction and a reduced repair capacity compared to patients with average tissue reactions. Fibroblasts of patients with increased acute and late side effects exhibited slower DNA repair. In addition to the known lack of cell cycle control, our results indicate that AT cells show reduced DNA repair capacity. Conclusion(s): The comet assay seems to be able to detect some types of increased individual radiation sensitivity. In contrast to other predictive in-vitro tests, the comet assay needs less time and fewer cells, which would be useful in a clinical setting.",Included

Liver cancer mortality risks were evaluated in 11,000 workers who started working at the 'Mayak' Production Association in 1948-1958 and who were exposed to both internally deposited plutonium and external gamma radiation. Comparisons with Russian liver cancer incidence rates indicate excess risk, especially among those with detectable plutonium body burdens and among female workers in the plutonium plant. Comparisons within the Mayak worker cohort which evaluate the role of plutonium body burden with adjustment for cumulative external dose indicate excess risk among workers with burdens estimated to exceed 7.4 kBq (relative risk = 17; 95% CI = 8.0-36) and among workers in the plutonium plant who did not have routine plutonium monitoring data based on urine measurements (relative risk = 2.8; 95% CI = 1.3-6.2). In addition, analyses treating the estimated plutonium body burden as a continuous variable indicate increasing risk with increasing burden (P < 0.001). Relative risks tended to be higher for females than for males, probably because of the lower baseline risk and the higher levels of plutonium measured in females. Because of limitations in current plutonium dosimetry, no attempt was made to quantify liver cancer risks from plutonium in terms of organ dose, and risk from external dose could not be reliably evaluated.

2422,"Deficiency in PER proteins has no effect on the rate of spontaneous and radiation-induced carcinogenesis. There is a growing body of evidence that components of the circadian clock are involved in modulation of numerous signaling pathways, and that clock deregulation due to environmental or genetic factors contributes to the development of various pathologies, including cancer. Previous work performed in tissue culture and in in vivo mouse models defined mammalian PERIOD proteins as tumor suppressors, although some experimental inconsistencies (the use of mice on mixed genetic background, lack of sexual discrimination) did not allow a definitive conclusion. To address this issue in a systematic way, we performed a detailed analysis comparing the incidence of tumor development after low-dose ionizing radiation in male and female wild-type, Per1-/-, and Per2-/- mice. We showed that in contrast to previous reports deficiency in either Per1 or Per2 genes by itself does not make mice more tumor-prone; moreover, some of the long-term effects of ionizing radiation in Per2-deficient mice are reminiscent more of accelerated aging rather than tumor-prone phenotype. Our histopathological analysis also revealed significant sexual dimorphism both in the rate of radiation-induced tumorigenesis and in the spectrum of tumors developed, which underscores the importance of using sex-matched experimental groups for in vivo studies. Based on our results, we suggest that the role of PER proteins as bone fide tumor suppressors needs to be reevaluated. © 2013 Landes Bioscience.",Included

For that purpose, rats were divided into 4 groups. JNJ7777120 and JNJ7777120-irradiated groups received a daily subcutaneous JNJ7777120 injection (10 mg/kg) starting 24 h before irradiation. Irradiated groups received a single dose of 5 Gy on whole-body using Cesium-137 source and were sacrificed 3 or 30 days after irradiation. Tissues were removed, fixed, stained with hematoxylin and eosin or PAS staining and histological characteristics were evaluated. Proliferative and apoptotic markers were studied by immunohistochemistry, while micronucleus assay was performed to evaluate DNA damage. Submandibular gland (SMG) function was evaluated by methacholine-induced salivation. Results indicate that JNJ7777120 treatment diminished mucosal atrophy and preserved villi and the number of crypts after radiation exposure (240+/-8 vs. 165+/-10, P<0.01). This effect was associated to a reduced apoptosis and DNA damage in intestinal crypts. JNJ7777120 reduced radiation-induced aplasia, preserving medullar components and reducing formation of micronucleus and also it accelerated bone marrow repopulation. Furthermore, it reduced micronucleus frequency in peripheral blood (27+/-8 vs. 149+/-22, in 1,000 erythrocytes, P<0.01). JNJ7777120 completely reversed radiation-induced reduced salivation, conserving glandular mass with normal histological appearance and reducing apoptosis and atrophy of SMG. JNJ7777120 exhibits radioprotective effects against radiation-induced cytotoxic and genotoxic damages in small intestine, SMG and hematopoietic tissues and, thus, could be of clinical value for patients undergoing radiotherapy.",Included

2524,"Lung cancer mortality associated with protracted low-dose occupational radiation exposures and smoking behaviors in U.S. radiologic technologists, 1983-2012. In the Japanese atomic bomb survivors, risk of lung cancer has been shown to increase with greater acute exposure to ionizing radiation. Although similar findings have been observed in populations exposed to low-dose, protracted radiation, such studies lack information on cigarette smoking history, a potential confounder. In a cohort of 106 068 U.S. radiologic technologists, we examined the association between estimated cumulative lung absorbed dose from occupational radiation exposure and lung cancer mortality. Poisson regression models, adjusted for attained age, sex, birth cohort, pack-years smoked and years since quitting smoking, were used to calculate linear excess relative risks (ERR) per 100 mGy, using time-dependent cumulative lung absorbed dose, lagged 10 years. Mean cumulative absorbed dose to the lung was 25 mGy (range: 0-810 mGy). During the 1983 to 2012 follow-up, 1090 participants died from lung cancer. Greater occupational radiation lung dose was not associated with lung cancer mortality overall (ERR per 100 mGy: -0.02, 95% CI: <0-0.13). However, significant dose-response relationships were observed for some subgroups, which might be false-positive results given the number of statistical tests performed. As observed in other studies of radiation and smoking, the interaction between radiation and smoking appeared to be sub-multiplicative with an ERR per 100 mGy of 0.41 (95% CI: 0.01-1.15) for those who smoked <20 pack-years and -0.03 (95% CI: <0-0.15) for those who smoked >=20 pack-years.

Ionizing radiation (IR) effects span beyond the area of direct exposure and can be observed in neighboring and distant naive cells and organs. This phenomenon is termed a 'bystander effect'. IR effects in directly exposed tissue in vivo are epigenetically mediated and distinct in males and females. Yet, IR-induced bystander effects have never been explored in a sex-specificity domain. We used an in vivo mouse model, whereby the bystander effects are studied in spleen of male and female animals subjected to head exposure when the rest of the body is protected by a medical-grade lead shield. We analyzed the induction of DNA damage and alterations in global DNA methylation. Molecular parameters were correlated with cellular proliferation and apoptosis levels. The changes observed in bystander organs are compared to the changes in unexposed animals and animals exposed to predicted and measured scatter doses. We have found the selective induction of DNA damage levels, global DNA methylation, cell proliferation and apoptosis in exposed and bystander spleen tissue of male and female mice. Sex differences were significantly diminished in animals subjected to a surgical removal of gonads. These data constitute the first evidence of sex differences in radiation-induced bystander effects in mouse spleen in vivo. We show the role of sex hormones in spleen bystander responses and discuss implications of the observed changes.",Included
2535,"Occupational health hazards of working in the interventional laboratory: a multisite case control study of physicians and allied staff. BACKGROUND: The occupational hazards of working in the interventional laboratory have been inadequately studied for physicians and remain unaddressed for nonphysician personnel., OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine whether the prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal pain, cancer, and other medical conditions is higher among physicians and allied staff who work in interventional laboratories compared with employees who do not., METHODS: Mayo Clinic employees who work in affiliated hospitals with interventional cardiology or interventional radiology laboratories took an electronic survey. Results were stratified on the basis of self-reported occupational exposure to procedures that involve radiation., RESULTS: There were 1,543 employees (mean age 43 +/- 11.3 years, 33% male) who responded to the survey (response rate of 57%), and 1,042 (67.5%) reported being involved with procedures utilizing radiation. These employees reported experiencing work-related pain more often than the control group before (54.7% vs. 44.7%; p < 0.001) and after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, pre-existing musculoskeletal conditions, years in profession, and job description (odds ratio: 1.67; 95% confidence interval: 1.32 to 2.11; p < 0.001). Musculoskeletal pain varied significantly by job description, with the highest incidence reported by technicians (62%) and nurses (60%) followed by attending physicians (44%) and trainees (19%; p < 0.001). There was no difference in cancer prevalence between groups (9% vs. 9%; p = 0.96)., CONCLUSIONS: Musculoskeletal pain is more common among healthcare workers who participate in interventional procedures and is highest in nonphysician employees. The diagnosis of cancer in employees who participate in procedures that utilize radiation was not elevated when compared to controls within the same departments, although any conclusion regarding causality is limited by the cross-sectional nature of the study, as well as the low overall prevalence of malignancy in our study group.

2538,"Cytogenetic responses to G2 phase X-irradiation of cells from retinoblastoma patients. Fibroblast cell lines from 20 retinoblastoma (RB) patients with the hereditary bilateral form of disease compared with 16 lines from normal donors had a significantly higher chromatid aberration frequency (CAF), and more displaced and nondisplaced breaks per 100 metaphase cells after x- irradiation during the G2 phase of the cell cycle. The mean CAF was 39 +/- 1.0, range 30-46, for cells from normal subjects, compared to a mean of 245.6, range 101-506, for cells from hereditary RB patients (p < 10-6). Of fibroblast lines from eight patients with unilateral RB, four had a CAF comparable to that of lines from normal donors (< 60) and four had a high CAF (> 130), resembling that of hereditary forms; two of the latter four lines were from patients with familial or deletion 13 forms of RB. Furthermore, in two families, PHA-stimulated blood lymphocytes from RB patients, one bilateral and one unilateral, and from certain unaffected first-degree relatives after G2 phase X-irradiation had a high CAF (>= 110) compared to a CAF (>= 53) of cells from three normal donors sampled at the same time. These results were shown not to be related to differences in cell cycle progression or initial extent of chromatid damage. The results suggest that the high frequency of chromatid aberrations in the cells from hereditary RB patients results from a genetic deficiency in DNA repair.",Included

2547,"Time-dependence of the effect of X-irradiation on the formation of glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase and other dehydrogenases in the developing rat brain. X-irradiation (100-1500 r) administered to the heads of rats 8-30 days of age inhibited the development of glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase (l-glycerol 3-phosphate-NAD oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.8) in the brain stem and cerebral hemispheres. At 40 days of age and older no effect was observed. This inhibition was a delayed phenomenon, dose-dependent and with no recovery. It is proposed that the inhibition of enzyme formation is related to radiation damage caused to DNA. Actinomycin D inhibited the development of glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase in a manner similar to ionizing radiation. Four other dehydrogenases also showed age-dependent radiosensitivities. ;Malic enzyme' (EC 1.1.1.40), lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27) and malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37) ceased to be radiosensitive at about 8 days of age and isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP) (EC 1.1.1.42) at 16 days. The correlation between developmental increase in enzyme activity and radiosensitivity held closely for glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase and isocitrate dehydrogenase and to a smaller extent for the others.",Included
2561,"Severe radiation-induced liver disease following localized radiation therapy for biliopancreatic carcinoma: activation of hepatic stellate cells as an early event. Radiation-induced liver disease is recorded as a form of veno-occlusive disease. Its pathogenesis remains unclear even if the initial injury likely occurs in the endothelial cells of central veins. The aim of our study was to investigate liver morphological features in relation to alpha-isoform of smooth muscle actin expression in hepatic stellate cells in six patients treated by localized radiotherapy on the biliopancreatic area. Within the month after completion of treatment, an activation of hepatic stellate cells strictly confined to irradiated areas and coinciding with congestive changes was observed. At a later stage, collagen deposition gradually increased, replacing the congestive and destroyed areas. This new fibrotic tissue also contained numerous alpha-smooth muscle positive cells. Our data suggest that early hepatic stellate cells activation coinciding with congestive changes plays an important role in radiation liver injury and ensuing fibrosis.",Included
2563,"Gamma-radiation sensitivity and polymorphisms in RAD51L1 modulate glioma risk. BACKGROUND: DNA strand breaks pose the greatest threat to genomic stability. Genetically determined mutagen sensitivity predisposes individuals to a variety of cancers, including glioma. However, polymorphisms in DNA strand break repair genes that may determine mutagen sensitivity are not well studied in cancer risk, especially in gliomas., METHODS: We correlated genotype data for tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) of DNA strand break repair genes with a gamma-radiation-induced mutagen sensitivity phenotype [expressed as mean breaks per cell (B/C)] in samples from 426 glioma patients. We also conducted analysis to assess joint and haplotype effects of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on mutagen sensitivity. We further validate our results in an independent external control group totaling 662 subjects., RESULTS: Of the 392 tSNPs examined, we found that mutagen sensitivity was modified by one tSNP in the EME2 gene and six tSNPs in the RAD51L1 gene (P < 0.01). Among the six RAD51L1 SNPs tested in the validation set, one (RAD51L1 rs2180611) was significantly associated with mutagen sensitivity (P = 0.025). Moreover, we found a significant dose-response relationship between the mutagen sensitivity and the number of adverse tSNP genotypes. Furthermore, haplotype analysis revealed that RAD51L1 haplotypes F-A (zero adverse allele) and F-E (six adverse alleles) exhibited the lowest (0.42) and highest (0.93) mean B/C values, respectively. A similar dose-response relationship also existed between the mutagen sensitivity and the number of adverse haplotypes., CONCLUSION: These results suggest that polymorphisms in and haplotypes of the RAD51L1 gene, which is involved in the double-strand break repair pathway, modulate gamma-radiation-induced mutagen sensitivity.",Included

2577,"Pre-apoptotic response to therapeutic DNA damage involves protein modulation of Mcl-1, Hdm2 and Flt3 in acute myeloid leukemia cells. Background: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells are characterized by non-mutated TP53, high levels of Hdm2, and frequent mutation of the Flt3 receptor tyrosine kinase. The juxtamembrane mutation of FLT3 is the strongest independent marker for disease relapse and is associated with elevated Bcl-2 protein and p53 hyper-phosphorylation in AML. DNA damage forms the basic mechanism of cancer cell eradication in current therapy of AML. Hdm2 and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 members are among the most intensely induced genes immediately after chemotherapy and Hdm2 is proposed a role in receptor tyrosine kinase regulation. Thus we examined the DNA damage related modulation of these proteins in relation to FLT3 mutational status and induction of apoptosis. Result(s): Within one hour after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR), the AML cells (NB4, MV4-11, HL-60, primary AML cells) showed an increase in Flt3 protein independent of mRNA levels, while the Hdm2 protein decreased. The FLT3 mutant MV4-11 cells were resistant to IR accompanied by presence of both Mcl-1 and Hdm2 protein three hours after IR. In contrast, the FLT3 wild type NB4 cells responded to IR with apoptosis and pre-apoptotic Mcl-1 down regulation. Daunorubicin (DNR) induced continuing down regulation of Hdm2 and Mcl-1 in both cell lines followed by apoptosis. Conclusion(s): Both IR and DNR treatment resulted in concerted protein modulations of Mcl-1, Hdm2 and Flt3. Cell death induction was associated with persistent attenuation of Mcl-1 and Hdm2. These observations suggest that defining the pathway(s) modulating Flt3, Hdm2 and Mcl-1 may propose new strategies to optimize therapy for the relapse prone FLT3 mutated AML patients. © 2007 Wergeland et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Included
2582,"Expanded Characterization of a Hemi-Body Shielded Gottingen Minipig Model of Radiation-induced Gastrointestinal Injury Incorporating Oral Dosing Procedures. In collaboration with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), the authors recently conducted a pilot study in a hemi-body shielded model of radiation-induced gastrointestinal (GI) injury in Gottingen minipigs following exposure to radiation dose levels between 8-16 Gy. Herein, the impact of oral dosing procedures is assessed, as well as the specific causes of death in animals exposed to radiation doses of 14 and 16 Gy (n = 64; 32 male, 32 female, between 6 and 8 mo of age). Oral dosing using a 2-tablet placebo system comprised of both immediate release and enteric-coated tablets starting 24 h post-irradiation resulted in inhibited gastric emptying of the enteric-coated tablets, which were found to be retained in the stomach and/or regurgitated. This finding appears to be species-specific, as similar findings have not been reported for other large animal species (e.g., non-human primates). Mortality was primarily dictated by decreased activity, body weight loss (>35%), and/or respiratory distress, despite shielding of the lung. The cause of respiratory distress in animals that were pre-terminally euthanized varied according to the timing of death, with interstitial inflammation and extensive fibrosis observed >20 days post-irradiation. Kidney damage was also identified in most animals after day 10. Changes in the GI tract were consistent with previous studies and included collagen deposition/fibrosis. Observations of inflammatory infiltrates and interstitial inflammation/fibrosis in both shielded and unshielded organs support a strong secondary inflammatory syndrome post-irradiation.",Included
2588,"Intravascular radiation accelerates atherosclerotic lesion formation of hypercholesteremic rabbits. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the effect of intravascular radiation (IR) on the arterial wall of uninjured vessels in the hypercholesteremic rabbit model., METHODS: Aortas of 24 New Zealand white rabbits were treated with either intravascular 192-Ir gamma-radiation (15 Gy at 2 mm from the center of the source) or were exposed to the source catheter without radiation (sham controls). Following the radiation treatment, the animals were fed a 2% cholesterol diet until euthanasia at 2 (n=8) or 6 (n=16) weeks. Arteries were analyzed using light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM); transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) 1, a promoter of connective tissue deposition, was also monitored., RESULTS: At 2 weeks, SEM analysis showed well-aligned endothelial cells in nonradiated segments, whereas irradiated arteries consistently contained adherent and subendothelial macrophages with focal areas of endothelial disruption. Further radiated segments at 2 weeks showed a 7-fold increase in active TGF beta-1 over nonradiated segments. At 6 weeks, there was a significant increase in plaque and vessel wall area relative to control arteries, however, no differences were noted in the density of actin-positive smooth muscle cells (SMCs) or macrophages. Similarly, no differences were noted in cell proliferation between groups as evidenced by the marker bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). In contrast, nonirradiated segments frequently contained cellular areas with extracellular lipid., CONCLUSION: Exposure of previously uninjured vessels to IR and hypercholesterolemia is associated with increased plaque burden and leads to more advanced plaque types. Special care should be taken to minimize radiation exposure in normal vascular segments in hypercholesterolemic patients undergoing radiation therapy.",Included
2590,"Radiation-induced apoptosis varies among individuals and is modified by sex and age. Purpose: Although there are considerable data on mechanisms of radiation-induced apoptosis in vitro and in animal models, little is known about functional variation in these pathways in humans. We sought to develop a tractable system to evaluate this. Material(s) and Method(s): Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from 90 healthy volunteers, divided into two aliquots, one irradiated with a 5 Gy dose and the other sham-treated (0 Gy), and assessed for damage-induced apoptosis after 24 hours. To investigate reproducibility, 10 individuals spanning the entire radiation-induced apoptotic range were tested three times each, with 3-6 months between replicates. Result(s): We observed surprising heterogeneity in apoptosis among individuals, ranging from 21-62%. Biological replicates from a single individual, however, were completely concordant, suggesting the variability observed across individuals is not the result of stochastic or short-term effects. We found significantly higher radiation-induced apoptosis in males than in females (Mean: 41.0% vs. 30.7%; p < 3.5 x 10<sup>-7</sup>). Moreover, advancing age was associated with decreasing radiation-induced apoptosis in males (p = 0.01) but not females (p = 0.82). Conclusion(s): Our results provide evidence that the function of cellular pathways crucial for stress-induced apoptosis varies by sex and could decline with age in humans.

Design(s): A retrospective cohort study was performed on retinoblastoma survivors who received the diagnosis from 1914 to 1984 and were interviewed in 2000. Lens doses were estimated from radiotherapy records. The cumulative time interval to cataract extraction between dose groups was compared using the log-rank test and Cox regression. Result(s): Seven hundred fifty-three subjects (828 eyes) were available for analysis for an average of 32 years of follow-up. During this period, 51 cataract extractions were reported. One extraction was reported in an eye with no radiotherapy compared with 36 extractions in 306 eyes with 1 course of radiotherapy and 14 among 38 eyes with 2 or 3 treatments. The average time interval to cataract extraction in irradiated eyes was 51 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 48-54) following 1 treatment and 32 years (95% CI, 27-37) after 2 or 3 treatments. Eyes exposed to a therapeutic radiation dose of 5 Gy or more had a 6-fold increased risk (95% CI, 1.3-27.2) of cataract extraction compared with eyes exposed to 2.5 Gy or less. Conclusion(s): The results emphasize the importance of ophthalmologic examination of retinoblastoma survivors who have undergone radiotherapy. The risk of cataract extraction in untreated eyes with retinoblastoma is comparable with the risk of the general population. ©2009 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.",Included

PURPOSE: Different doses of X-ray radiation were tested to assess the developmental inhibition effects on different stages of Drosophila suzukii, spotted wing drosophila (SWD). Efficacy of a potential quarantine treatment dose was evaluated for its practicality by a small scale-up validation test at a commercial facility., MATERIALS AND METHODS: X-ray treatments at different doses of 50, 100, 200, and 300 Gy were carried out with eggs, larvae, pupae and adults of SWD. The trial at the commercial facility was performed with pupae at 150 Gy., RESULTS: X-ray radiation inhibited development of all stages of SWD, and the estimated dose to cause 99% mortality or to prevent emergence (ED99) are reported here. Irradiation to eggs inhibited hatching, pupariation and adult emergence at 1962, 649 and 31 Gy, respectively. The inhibition of irradiated larvae to adult emergence was 66 Gy. Irradiation to pupae could not inhibit adult emergence completely even at 300 Gy. However, irradiation at 100 Gy and above induced complete adult sterility. Irradiation to pupae inhibited hatching of F1 eggs at 73 Gy, while for adults, total inhibition of F1 egg hatching was observed at 822 Gy. In the trial at the commercial facility, radiation at 150 Gy to pupae induced complete adult sterility in all combinations of cross-mating between treated or untreated males and females., CONCLUSION: This study suggests that X-ray radiation can be recommended as an alternative to methyl bromide as phytosanitary treatment for quarantine purpose.",Included

Dreyfuss, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 76: 5910-5913, 1979), the tumor incidence was increased following irradiation (150 rads, 5 times, at weekly intervals), from 22 to 93% in females and from 5 to 59% in males. Experiments here reported suggest that 2 consecutive total-body gamma-irradiations of 150 rads each are sufficient to induce in rats the development of tumors, some malignant; 18 of 19 females (94.7%) developed tumors at an average age of 11.4 mo, and seven of the 14 males in this group (50%) developed tumors at an average age of 10.4 mo. In the second group, which received 3 consecutive gamma-irradiations, 20 of 23 females (86.9%) and 5 of 13 males (38.4%) developed tumors at average ages of 9.1 and 7.5 mo, respectively. In the third group, among rats which received 4 consecutive gamma-irradiations, 17 of 19 females (89.4%) and 4 of 12 males (33.3%) developed tumors at average ages of 9.4 and 10.5 mo, respectively. The etiology of tumors either developing spontaneously or induced by irradiation in rats remains to be clarified. Our attempts to detect virus particles by electron microscopy in such tumors or lymphomas have not been successful. As a working hypothesis, we are tempted to theorize that tumors or lymphomas developing spontaneously or induced by gamma irradiation in rats are caused by latent viral agents which are integrated into the cell genome and are cell associated, i.e., not separable from the rat tumor cells by conventional methods thus far used.",Included

2640,"Rapid detection of radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations in lymphocytes and hematopoietic progenitor cells by mFISH. Structural chromosome aberrations (SCAs) are sensitive indicators of a preceding exposure of the hematopoietic system to ionizing radiation. Cytogenetic investigations have therefore become routine tools for an assessment of absorbed radiation doses and their biological effects after occupational exposure or radiation accidents.Due to its speed and ease of use, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with whole chromosome painting (WCP) probes has become a method of choice to visualize SCAs. Until recently, this technique was limited to a rather small number of chromosomes, which could be tested simultaneously. As a result, only a fraction of the structural aberrations present in a sample could be detected and the overall dose effect had to be calculated by extrapolation. The recent introduction of two genome-wide screening techniques in tumor research, i.e., Spectral Karyotyping (SKY) and multicolor FISH (mFISH) now allows the detection of translocations involving any two non-homologous chromosomes.The present study was prompted by our desire to bring the power of mFISH to bear for the rapid identification of radiation-induced SCAs. We chose two model systems to investigate the utility of mFISH: lymphocytes that were exposed in vitro to 3 Gy photons and single hematopoietic progenitor cell colonies isolated from a Chernobyl victim 9 years after in vivo exposure to 5.4 Sv.In lymphocytes, we found up to 15 different chromosomes involved in rearrangements indicating complex radiation effects. Stable aberrations detected in hematopoietic cell colonies, on the other hand, showed involvement of up to three different chromosomes. These results demonstrated that mFISH is a rapid and powerful approach to detect and characterize radiation-induced SCAs in the hemopoietic system. The application of mFISH is expected to result in a more detailed and, thus, more informative picture of radiation effects. Eventually, this technique will allow researchers to rapidly delineate chromosomal breakpoints and facilitate the identification of the genes involved in radiation tumorigenesis.

2655,"Upregulation of VEGF and FGF2 in normal rat brain after experimental intraoperative radiation therapy. The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)2 in the irradiated brain was examined to test how a single high dose radiation, similar to that used for intraoperative radiation therapy given to the normal cerebrum, can affect the vascular endothelium. After a burr hole trephination in the rat skull, the cerebral hemisphere was exposed to a single 10 Gy dose of gamma rays, and the radiation effect was assessed at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after irradiation. Histological changes, such as reactive gliosis, inflammation, vascular proliferation and necrosis, were correlated with the duration after irradiation. Significant VEGF and FGF2 expression in the 2- and 8-week were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay quantification in the radiation group. Immunohistochemical study for VEGF was done and the number of positive cells gradually increased over time, compared with the sham operation group. In conclusion, the radiation injuries consisted of radiation necrosis associated with the expression of VEGF and FGF2. These findings indicate that VEGF and FGF2 may play a role in the radiation injuries after intraoperative single high-dose irradiation.",Included

Objectives: Xerostomia is a common post-radiotherapy (post-RT) complication in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. This study evaluated the relation of post-RT parotid gland changes with the dose received. Method(s): Data from 18 NPC patients treated by radiotherapy between 1997 and 2001 were collected. Parotid gland volumes were measured and compared between their pre-RT and post-RT CT images; both sets of CT were conducted with the same scanning protocol. Doppler ultrasound was used to assess the haemodynamic condition of the glands after radiotherapy. Doppler ultrasound results were compared against 18 agematched normal participants. A questionnaire was used to evaluate the patients'comments of xerostomia condition. Radiotherapy treatment plans of the participants were retrieved from the Eclipse treatment planning system from which the radiation doses delivered to the parotid glands were estimated. The correlations of parotid gland doses and the post-RT changes were evaluated. Result(s): The post-RT parotid glands were significantly smaller (p<0.001) than the pre-RT ones. They also demonstrated lower vascular velocity, resistive and pulsatility indices (p<0.05) than normal participants. The degree of volume shrinkage and subjective severity of xerostomia demonstrated dose dependence, but such dependence was not definite in the haemodynamic changes. Conclusion(s): It was possible to predict the gland volume change and subjective severity of xerostomia based on the dose to the parotid glands for NPC patients. However, such prediction was not effective for the vascular changes. The damage to the gland was long lasting and had significant effects on the patients' quality of life. © 2011 The British Institute of Radiology.",Included

The possible interaction between X-ray- and transposon-induced chromosome damage was monitored in the P-M system of hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. One- to two-day-old F1 dysgenic males originating from a cross between M strain females and P strain males were irradiated with 5.5 Gy (550 rad) or used as controls to monitor X-Y translocations and transmission ratio distortion. Two 3-day sperm broods were sampled for the former and two 4-day broods for the latter to detect damage induced in the most radiosensitive cells. F1 nondysgenic males derived from M female to M male crosses (controls) were treated identically. X-Y chromosome translocations induced by P element mobility alone declined sharply with a decrease in temperature (18 versus 21 degrees C) and they were significantly reduced with aging of hybrid males from brood 2, 4-8 days of age, to brood 3, 7-11 days of age. No significant increase in translocations was observed when X irradiation and P-M dysgenesis were combined, showing no interaction between damages induced by the two mutator systems. In contrast, interaction was observed in transmission ratio distortion which was significantly increased by X irradiation of hybrid males derived from both reciprocal M X P and P x M crosses. The preferential elimination of P element-bearing autosomes occurred when either spermatocytes or spermatids were irradiated.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also known to be a risk factor for CVD and little is known whether CKD is associated with A-bomb radiation. To examine whether CKD is associated with CVD risk factors or with A-bomb radiation in A-bomb survivors, we classified renal dysfunction in 1,040 A-bomb survivors who were examined in 2004-2007 as normal [n = 121; estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >= 90 ml/min/1.73 m(2)]; mild (n = 686; eGFR 60-89 ml/min/1.73 m(2)); moderate (n = 217; eGFR 30-59 ml/min/1.73 m(2)); or severe (n = 16; eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). Also, we diagnosed subjects in the moderate and severe renal dysfunction groups as having CKD (n = 233; eGFR <59 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). After adjusting for age, gender, and smoking and drinking habits, we looked for an association between renal dysfunction and hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperlipidemia, and metabolic syndrome (MetS), and between renal dysfunction and A-bomb radiation.

Objective: Incidence and mortality from ischaemic heart disease (IHD) was studied in an extended cohort of 22,377 workers first employed at the Mayak Production Association during 1948-82 and followed up to the end of 2008. Method(s): Relative risks and excess relative risks per unit dose (ERR/Gy) were calculated based on the maximum likelihood using Epicure software (Hirosoft International Corporation, Seattle, WA). Dose estimates used in analyses were provided by an updated ""Mayak Worker Dosimetry System-2008"".

The pure quadratic model provided a better fit of the data than did the linear one. No significant association of IHD mortality with total dose from external g-rays after having adjusted for nonradiation factors and dose from internal alpha radiation was observed in the study cohort [ERR/Gy50.06 (95% CI: ,0 to 0.15)]. A significant increasing linear trend was observed in IHD mortality with total absorbed dose from internal alpha radiation to the liver after having adjusted for non-radiation factors and dose from external g-rays in both the whole cohort [ERR/Gy50.21 (95% CI: 0.01 to 0.58)] and the subcohort of workers exposed at alpha dose ,1.00Gy [ERR/Gy51.08 (95% CI: 0.34 to 2.15)]. No association of IHD incidence with total dose from internal alpha radiation to the liver was found in the whole cohort after having adjusted for non-radiation factors and external gamma dose [ERR/Gy50.02 (95% CI: not available to 0.10)]. Statistically significant dose effect was revealed in the subcohort of workers exposed to internal alpha radiation at dose to the liver ,1.00Gy [ERR/Gy50.44 (95% CI: 0.09 to 0.85)]. Conclusion(s): This study provides strong evidence of IHD incidence and mortality association with external g-ray exposure and some evidence of IHDincidence andmortality association with internal alpha-radiation exposure.

Plutonium-induced lung fibrosis was shown to have no association with cumulative lung absorbed dose from external gamma rays as of the date of diagnosis. On the contrary, the plutonium-induced lung fibrosis rate was shown to be associated with cumulative lung absorbed dose from incorporated alpha particles and to increase significantly with increasing dose from internal radiation exposure. This paper discusses potential applications of the registry to scientific investigations in the future.",Included
2711,"[Influence of the dose rate and postradiation hyperthermia on the cytogenetic effect of irradiation of cells in the G0 stage by 252Cf and 60Co sources]. The paper is concerned with the results of a comparative study of radiation injury of chromosomes of human lymphocytes at the G0 stage resulting from the influence of 60Co gamma quanta and high activity 252Cf radiation sources and depending on a dose and dose rate; with the potentialities of modifying a cytogenetic effect of irradiation by postradiation hyperthermia of cells. It has been shown that at the G0 stage of a cell cycle the frequency of chromosome aberrations does not depend on the dose rate of 252Cf radiation within the range of 0.0035-0.35 Gy/min. by the neutron component. Linear correlation between the frequency of induced chromosome aberrations and a dose was observed within a dose range of 0.27-3.1 Gy. Thus, a conclusion is that postradiation hyperthermia at the G0 stage does not almost influence the frequency of chromosome aberrations during 252Cf radiation, and increases it insignificantly during 60Co gamma-radiation.",Included
2713,"Cellular immunity indices in rectal cancer under surgical and combined treatment. The dynamics of cell-mediated immunity indices in 83 patients with rectal tumors who underwent surgery or received combined treatment (preoperative radiation + surgery) was followed. Cellular immunity was assessed on the basis of PHA-induced blastogenic reaction of lymphocytes (BRL) and spontaneous rosette-formation. In rectal tumor patients, particularly at stage IV, the level of PHA-induced BRL and the total number of rosette-forming cells (RFC) were lower than in healthy donors. Surgery did not produce any significant changes in cell-mediated immunity parameters: level of PHA-induced BRL decreased by 16,7%, while total RFC number increased by 17.2% in (mostly low-affinity forms). Preoperative radiation resulted in a significant decrease in lymphocyte ability to undergo PHA-induced blast-transformation (45%) and spontaneous rosette formation, high-affinity lymphocytes being most sensitive to ionizing radiation. Their fraction decreased by half.",Included
2721,"Glaucoma incidence risk in a cohort of Mayak PA workers occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation. Glaucoma is a major cause of visual impairment, and secondary glaucoma manifested as neovascular glaucoma has long been known to occur following high-dose fractionated radiation therapy. In contrast, little is known as to whether ionizing radiation exposure causes primary glaucoma, except that a single study in Japanese atomic bomb survivors has reported a significantly increase risk. Therefore, the effect of lower dose and lower dose rate remains unclear. Here we report that in Russian Mayak Production Association workers occupationally exposed to chronic radiation for prolonged periods, incidence of total primary glaucoma and primary open-angle glaucoma is significantly associated with various non-radiation factors (sex, attained age, and cataract diagnosed prior to glaucoma), but neither with cumulative dose from external gamma-rays nor with cumulative neutron dose nor with the unweighted sum of cumulative gamma and neutron doses. The present results suggest for the first time that chronic radiation exposure does not cause primary glaucoma, although the analyses need to be made in other cohorts exposed at various dose and dose rate.",Included

Localized application of ionizing radiation to the gastrointestinal tract frequently elicits responses, which include diarrhoea. The origin of this symptom is not clear but has been attributed to loss of epithelial integrity, together with alterations in motility and increased secretion. The purpose of this study was to examine whether a 10 Gy abdominal gamma irradiation leads to an inflammatory reaction, and to compare intestinal and colonic motility in controls and abdominally irradiated rats 1, 3 and 7 days after irradiation, using an electromyographic technique. The motility parameters analysed were the frequency and velocity of propagation of migrating myoelectric complexes (MMC) in the jejunum and colonic spike activity (long spike bursts; LSB) per 10 min in fasted rats. The MMC frequency was significantly reduced on days 1 and 7 after irradiation and the MMC pattern was markedly disrupted on day 3. The frequency of colonic LSB was significantly reduced on days 1, 3 and 7. Mouth to anus transit was significantly accelerated on day 3 only and diarrhoea was observed at this time. Myeloperoxidase activity in the jejunum and colon was also increased on this day only. It is concluded that irradiation-induced diarrhoea occurs contemporaneously with disruption of MMC in the small intestine.",Included

Although beneficial effects such as the retardation of tumor growth were evident in these studies, among the seventeen patients who received from 5000--6000 rads for malignant gliomas, four developed ""late delayed"" radiation necrosis. The strong predilection of this tissue response for the white matter adjacent to the neoplasm suggests a local sensitivity which may have been engendered or enhanced by cerebral edema. A fifth case disclosed focal demyelination in the mid-brain suggesting ""early delayed"" radiation necrosis, and an additional case had distinctive foci of necrosis within the brain stem. Changes of diffuse cerebral edema were noted in many of the radiated brains. It is concluded that radiation therapy in commonly employed dosages for malignant gliomas carries a risk of injury to surrounding cerebral tissues.",Included
2750,"Comparative stochastic effects of inhaled alpha- and beta-particle- emitting radionuclides in beagle dogs. The stochastic effects of inhaled, insoluble particles of alpha- or beta- particle-emitting radionuclides were compared in dogs. Male and female beagle dogs were exposed briefly by nasal inhalation to relatively insoluble aerosols of 239PuO2 or 144Ce in fused aluminosilicate particles (FAP) and observed for cancer for their lifetimes. The initial lung burden and retention of each radionuclide was determined by whole-body counting of the emissions from 144Ce-144Pr- or 169Yb-labeled 239PuO2. Lung doses were calculated for each dog from these data. The lung doses ranged from 0.21 to 1200 Gy for 144Ce FAP and 1.6 to 58 Gy for 239PuO2. Dogs with doses to the lung of about 60 Gy or greater from 144Ce or about 2 Gy or greater from 239PuO2 had an increased incidence of lung carcinomas. In dogs exposed to 144Ce FAP, three organs were targets for neoplasia: lung, tracheobronchial lymph nodes, and heart. The insoluble FAP carried to the lymph nodes draining the lung delivered high radiation doses to the nodes and adjacent heart, resulting in hemangiosarcomas of these organs. In the lung, high radiation doses induced hemangiosarcomas and carcinosarcomas. At lower doses, carcinomas of various histological patterns were induced in the lung. In dogs exposed to 239PuO2, the lung was the sole target organ for neoplasia. Nearly all of these neoplasms were carcinomas of various histological patterns. These results indicated that relatively low doses of alpha-particle radiation can induce pulmonary cancers, but relatively large doses of beta-particle radiation are required. In addition, inhaled beta-particle emitters can also induce cancers in lung-associated lymph nodes and heart at these larger absorbed radiation doses.",Included

Purpose To assess the long-term disease control and toxicity outcomes of fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy (FSRT) in patients with pituitary adenomas treated at the BC Cancer Agency. Methods and Materials To ensure a minimum of 5 years of clinical follow-up, this study identified a cohort of 76 patients treated consecutively with FSRT between 1998 and 2007 for pituitary adenomas: 71% (54/76) had nonfunctioning and 29% (22/76) had functioning adenomas (15 adrenocorticotrophic hormone-secreting, 5 growth hormone-secreting, and 2 prolactin-secreting). Surgery was used before FSRT in 96% (73/76) of patients. A median isocenter dose of 50.4 Gy was delivered in 28 fractions, with 100% of the planning target volume covered by the 90% isodose. Patients were followed up clinically by endocrinologists, ophthalmologists, and radiation oncologists. Serial magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess tumor response. Results With a median follow-up time of 6.8 years (range, 0.6 - 13.1 years), the 7-year progression-free survival was 97.1% and disease-specific survival was 100%. Of the 2 patients with tumor progression, both had disease control after salvage surgery. Of the 22 patients with functioning adenomas, 50% (11/22) had complete and 9% (2/22) had partial responses after FSRT. Of the patients with normal pituitary function at baseline, 48% (14/29) experienced 1 or more hormone deficiencies after FSRT. Although 79% (60/76) of optic chiasms were at least partially within the planning target volumes, no patient experienced radiation-induced optic neuropathy. No patient experienced radionecrosis. No secondary malignancy occurred during follow-up.

2770,"The Aftermath of Surviving Acute Radiation Hematopoietic Syndrome and its Mitigation. Intensive research is underway to find new agents that can successfully mitigate the acute effects of radiation exposure. This is primarily in response to potential counterthreats of radiological terrorism and nuclear accidents but there is some hope that they might also be of value for cancer patients treated with radiation therapy. Research into mitigation countermeasures typically employs classic animal models of acute radiation syndromes (ARS) that develop after whole-body irradiation (WBI). While agents are available that successfully mitigate ARS when given after radiation exposure, their success raises questions as to whether they simply delay lethality or unmask potentially lethal radiation pathologies that may appear later in time. Life shortening is a well-known consequence of WBI in humans and experimental animals, but it is not often examined in a mitigation setting and its causes, other than cancer, are not well-defined. This is in large part because delayed effects of acute radiation exposure (DEARE) do not follow the strict time-dose phenomena associated with ARS and present as a diverse range of symptoms and pathologies with low mortality rates that can be evaluated only with the use of large cohorts of subjects, as in this study. Here, we describe chronically increased mortality rates up to 660 days in large numbers of mice given LD70/30 doses of WBI. Systemic myeloid cell activation after WBI persists in some mice and is associated with late immunophenotypic changes and hematopoietic imbalance. Histopathological changes are largely of a chronic inflammatory nature and variable incidence, as are the clinical symptoms, including late diarrhea that correlates temporally with changes in the content of the microbiome. We also describe the acute and long-term consequences of mitigating hematopoietic ARS (H-ARS) lethality after LD70/30 doses of WBI in multiple cohorts of mice treated uniformly with radiation mitigators that have a common 4-nitro-phenylsulfonamide (NPS) pharmacophore. Effective NPS mitigators dramatically decrease ARS mortality. There is slightly increased subacute mortality, but the rate of late mortalities is slowed, allowing some mice to live a normal life span, which is not the case for WBI controls. The study has broad relevance to radiation late effects and their potential mitigation and epitomizes the complex interaction between radiation-damaged tissues and immune homeostasis.Copyright © 2019 by Radiation Research Society.

2781,"Cerebrovascular diseases in nuclear workers first employed at the Mayak PA in 1948-1972. Incidence and mortality from cerebrovascular diseases (CVD) (430-438 ICD-9 codes) have been studied in a cohort of 18,763 workers first employed at the Mayak Production Association (Mayak PA) in 1948-1972 and followed up to the end of 2005. Some of the workers were exposed to external gamma-rays only while others were exposed to a mixture of external gamma-rays and internal alpha-particle radiation due to incorporated (239)Pu. After adjusting for non-radiation factors, there were significantly increasing trends in CVD incidence with total absorbed dose from external gamma-rays and total absorbed dose to liver from internal alpha radiation. The CVD incidence was statistically significantly higher among workers with total absorbed external gamma-ray doses greater than 0.20 Gy compared to those exposed to lower doses; the data were consistent with a linear trend in risk with external dose. The CVD incidence was statistically significantly higher among workers with total absorbed internal alpha-radiation doses to liver from incorporated (239)Pu greater than 0.025 Gy compared to those exposed to lower doses. There was no statistically significant trend in CVD mortality risk with either external gamma-ray dose or internal alpha-radiation dose to liver. The risk estimates obtained are generally compatible with those from other large occupational studies, although the incidence data point to higher risk estimates compared to those from the Japanese A-bomb survivors. Further studies of the unique cohort of Mayak workers chronically exposed to external and internal radiation will allow improving the reliability and validating the radiation safety standards for occupational and public exposure.",Included
2804,"Long term effects of radiation exposure on telomere lengths of leukocytes and its associated biomarkers among atomic-bomb survivors. Ionizing radiation (IR) is a major source of cellular damage and the immediate cellular response to IR has been well characterized. But the long-term impact of IR on cell function and its relationship with aging are not known. Here, we examined the IR effects on telomere length and other biomarkers 50 to 68 years post-exposure (two time points per person) in survivors of the atomic bombing at Hiroshima during WWII. We found that telomere length of leukocytes was inversely correlated with the dose of IR (p=0.008), and this effect was primarily found in survivors who were exposed at younger ages; specifically those <12 years old (p=0.0004). Although a dose-related retardation of telomere shortening with age was observed in the cross-sectional data, longitudinal follow-up after 11 years did not show IR exposure-related alteration of the rate of telomere shortening with age. In addition, IR diminished the associations between telomere length and selected aging biomarkers that were observed in survivors with no dose. These included uric acid metabolism, cytokines, and blood T cell counts. These findings showed long-lasting detrimental effects of IR on telomere length of leukocytes in both dose- and age-at-exposure dependent manner, and on alterations of biomarkers with aging.",Included

To explore the expression level and the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) in radiation-induced heart injury in a rat model, thirty-two Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups (the control group, the 15-Gy irradiation group and the 18-Gy irradiation group). Experimental animals were exposed to radiation generated by a linear accelerator at the chest and killed after 3 months. Heart tissues from these animals were removed for Masson staining, PPAR-gamma immunohistochemical staining, Western blot analysis and real-time polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR). In addition, the protein expression of matrix metalloprotein-1 (MMP-1), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) and transforming growth factor type beta1 (TGF-beta1), all of which are associated with fibrosis, was measured. Masson staining revealed significant myocardial fibrosis, degeneration and necrosis in rats exposed to radiation. The results of immunohistochemical staining and Western blot analysis showed that PPAR-gamma protein expression in hearts of the irradiation groups was significantly higher than in the control group, especially in myocardium and vascular endothelial (p < 0.05). RT-PCR results also showed a parallel increase in PPAR-gamma mRNA expression in the heart of the irradiation groups compared with the control group (p < 0.05). The expression of MMP-1 protein was not significantly different in three groups (p > 0.05). The expression of TIMP-1 and TGF-beta1 proteins was, however, higher in two irradiation groups than in the control group (p < 0.05). These data demonstrate that PPAR-gamma expression is up-regulated on both mRNA and protein levels in heart injured by radiation. PPAR-gamma may play an important role in radiation-induced heart injury.",Included

Time resolved data of DNA damage and repair after radiotherapy elucidates the relation between damage, repair, and cell survival. While well characterized in vitro, little is known about the time-course of DNA damage response in tumors sampled from individual patients. Kinetics of DNA damage after radiotherapy was assessed in eight dogs using repeated in vivo samples of tumor and co-irradiated normal tissue analyzed with comet assay and phosphorylated H2AX (gammaH2AX) immunohistochemistry. In vivo results were then compared (in silico) with a dynamic mathematical model for DNA damage formation and repair. Maximum %DNA in tail was observed at 15-60 min after irradiation, with a rapid decrease. Time-courses of gammaH2AX-foci paralleled these findings with a small time delay and were not influenced by covariates. The evolutionary parameter search based on %DNA in tail revealed a good fit of the DNA repair model to in vivo data for pooled sarcoma time-courses, but fits for individual sarcoma time-courses suffer from the heterogeneous nature of the in vivo data. It was possible to follow dynamics of comet tail intensity and gammaH2AX-foci during a course of radiation using a minimally invasive approach. DNA repair can be quantitatively investigated as time-courses of individual patients by integrating this resulting data into a dynamic mathematical model.Copyright © 2017 by the authors.

Post-radiotherapy (RTx) bone fragility fractures are a late-onset complication occurring in bone within or underlying the radiation field. These fractures are difficult to predict, as patients do not present with local osteopenia. Using a murine hindlimb RTx model, we previously documented decreased mineralized bone strength and fracture toughness, but alterations in material properties of the organic bone matrix are largely unknown. In this study, 4 days of fractionated hindlimb irradiation (4 x 5 Gy) or Sham irradiation was administered in a mouse model (BALB/cJ, end points: 0, 4, 8, and 12 weeks, n = 15/group/end point). Following demineralization, the viscoelastic stress relaxation, and monotonic tensile mechanical properties of tibiae were determined. Irradiated tibiae demonstrated an immediate (day after last radiation fraction) and sustained (4, 8, 12 weeks) increase in stress relaxation compared to the Sham group, with a 4.4% decrease in equilibrium stress (p <.017). While tensile strength was not different between groups, irradiated tibiae had a lower elastic modulus (-5%, p =.027) and energy to failure (-12.2%, p =.012) with monotonic loading. Gel electrophoresis showed that therapeutic irradiation (4 x 5 Gy) does not result in collagen fragmentation, while irradiation at a common sterilization dose (25 kGy) extensively fragmented collagen. These results suggest that altered collagen mechanical behavior has a role in postirradiation bone fragility, but this can occur without detectable collagen fragmentation. Statement of Clinical Significance: Therapeutic irradiation alters bone organic matrix mechanics and which contribute to diminished fatigue strength, but this does not occur via collagen fragmentation.Copyright © 2020 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Spleen cells of (C57BL/6 X C3H/He)F1 mice were assayed for natural killer (NK) cell activity against YAC-1 and FBL-3 lymphoma targets at several intervals after total-body exposure to a high sublethal dose of 137Cs or 60Co gamma-rays. NK cell activity did not decline for the first 12 days but decreased sharply thereafter and remained low until day 24. The recovery of splenic NK cell activity was delayed. Beginning on day 28, the activity was slowly increased, reaching near-normal levels (80% of controls) 41-59 days after irradiation. Suppressor cells detectable during the period of lowest NK cell activity, i.e., on days 17 and 19, may have been responsible for the delayed and slow recovery. These studies indicated that a) mature effectors of natural cytotoxicity are relatively radioresistant renewable cells with a lifespan of about 2 weeks whose progenitors are radiosensitive cells b) the kinetics of decline and especially of recovery of NK cell activity may be influenced by suppressor cells. Should NK cell activity confer resistance to autochthonous lymphomas in vivo, it may be a significant consideration for strategies of tumor therapy by cytotoxic agents that reconstitution of the NK cell pool is a slow process and that suppressor cell function must be overcome for full recovery.",Included

Analysis of the relationship between dose and mortality from cancer and circulation diseases in the cohort of Chernobyl clean-up workers based on the data from the National Radiation and Epidemiological Registry was performed. Medical and dosimetry information on the clean-up workers, males, who got radiation doses from April 26, 1986 to April 26, 1987, which was accumulated from 1992 to 2012, was used for the analysis. The total size of the cohort was 42929 people, 12731 deaths were registered in the cohort, among them 1893 deaths from solid cancers and 5230 deaths were from circulation diseases. An average age of the workers was 39 years in 1992 and the mean dose was 164 mGy. The dose-effect relationship was estimated with the use of non-parametric analysis of survival with regard to concurrence of risks of mortality. The risks were estimated in 6 dose groups of similar size (1-70, 70-130, 130-190, 190-210, 210-230 and.230-1000 mGy). The group ""1-70 mGy"" was used as control. Estimated dose-effect relationship related to cancers and circulation diseases is described approximately with a linear model, coefficient of determination (the proportion of variability explained by the linear model) for cancers was 23-25% and for circulation diseases - 2-13%. The slope coefficient of the dose-effect relationship normalized to 1 Gy for the ratio of risks for cancers in the linear model was 0.47 (95% CI: -0.77, 1.71), and for circulation diseases it was 0.22 (95% CI: -0.58, 1.02).

In the event of a large-scale event leading to acute ionizing radiation exposure, high-throughput methods would be required to assess individual dose estimates for triage purposes. Blood-based gene expression is a broad source of biomarkers of radiation exposure which have great potential for providing rapid dose estimates for a large population. Time is a crucial component in radiological emergencies and the shipment of blood samples to relevant laboratories presents a concern. In this study, we performed nanopore sequencing analysis to determine if the technology can be used to detect radiation-inducible genes in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The technology offers not only long-read sequencing but also a portable device which can overcome issues involving sample shipment, and provide faster results. For this goal, blood from nine healthy volunteers was 2 Gy ex vivo X irradiated. After PBMC isolation, irradiated samples were incubated along with the controls for 24 h at 37degreeC. RNA was extracted, poly(A)+ enriched and reverse-transcribed before sequencing. The data generated was analyzed using a Snakemake pipeline modified to handle paired samples. The sequencing analysis identified a radiation signature consisting of 46 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) which included 41 protein-coding genes, a long non-coding RNA and four pseudogenes, five of which have been identified as radiation-responsive transcripts for the first time. The genes in which transcriptional expression is most significantly modified after radiation exposure were APOBEC3H and FDXR, presenting a 25-and 28-fold change on average, respectively. These levels of transcriptional response were comparable to results we obtained by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis. In vivo exposure analyses showed a transcriptional radioresponse at 24 h postirradiation for both genes together with a strong dose-dependent response in blood irradiated ex vivo. Finally, extrapolating from the data we obtained, the minimum sequencing time required to detect an irradiated sample using APOBEC3H transcripts would be less than 3 min for a total of 50,000 reads. Future improvements, in sample processing and bioinformatic pipeline for specific radiation-responsive transcript identification, will allow the provision of a portable, rapid, real-time biodosimetry platform based on this new sequencing technology. In summary, our data show that nanopore sequencing can identify radiation-responsive genes and can also be used for identification of new transcripts.Copyright © 2020 by Radiation Research Society.

Here, the association between EBV BamH1-A rightward transcript 7 microRNA (ebv-miR-BART7) and the effects on irradiation sensitivity was explored. Methods Tissue ebv-miR-BART7 expression level was quantified using real-time quantitative PCR. The radiosensitivity of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells with ebv-miR-BART7 expression was evaluated by colony formation assay, cell proliferation assay, apoptosis assay, H2AX phosphorylation staining and acridine orange staining. In addition, xenograft model was developed using zebrafish embryo to validate the in vivo radiation sensitivity of the ebv-miR-BART7-expressing NPC.

Purpose: Ionizing radiation damages tissue and provokes inflammatory responses in multiple organ systems. We investigated the effects of high-dose X-ray radiation on the molecular inflammation and mechanical function of the intervertebral disc (IVD). Methods: Functional spine units (FSUs) containing the vertebrae-IVDs-vertebrae structure extracted from 1-month, 6-month, and 16-month-old NFkappaB-luciferase reporter mice and from 6-month-old myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-null mice. After a preconditioning period in culture, the FSUs were subjected a single dose of ionizing X-ray radiation at 20 Gys, and then NFkappaB expression was monitored. The IVDs were then subjected to mechanical testing using dynamic compression, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) quantification, and histological analyses. Results: In the 1-month-old FSUs, the NFkappaB-driven luciferase activity was significantly elevated for 1 day following the exposure to radiation. The 6-month-old FSUs showed increased NFkappaB activity for 3 days, while the 16-month-old FSUs sustained elevated levels of NFkappaB activity throughout the 10-day culture period. All irradiated groups showed significant loss of disc height, GAG content, mechanical function and changes in structure. Ablation of MyD88 blunted the radiation-mediated NFkappaB signaling, and preserved GAG content, and the IVDs' structure and mechanical performance. Conclusions: These results suggest that high-dose radiation affects the IVDs' NFkappaB-dependent inflammatory processes that subsequently lead to functional deterioration. Blocking the transactivation potential of NFkappaB via MyD88 ablation preserved the structure and mechanical function of the FSUs. The long-term effects of radiation on IVD homeostasis should be considered in individuals susceptible to occupational and medical exposure.",Included
3015,"Effect of gamma radiation on resting B lymphocytes. II. Functional characterization of the antigen-presentation defect. The effect of radiation on three discrete Ag-presentation functions in resting B cells was examined: 1) Ag uptake and processing, 2) expression of processed Ag in the context of functional class II molecules, and 3) provision of necessary co-stimulatory, or second,"" signals. Analysis of radiation's effect on B cell presentation of intact vs fragmented Ag or its effect on presentation by Ag-pulsed B cells indicated that damage to Ag uptake and processing could not account for the bulk of the radiation-induced Ag-presentation defect. Experiments with phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis as an indirect measure of TCR occupancy suggested that irradiation caused a fairly rapid (within 1 to 2 h) decrease in the ability of the B cell APC to display a stimulatory combination of Ag and class II molecule. Ag dose-response analyses demonstrated that when presenting a fragment of the Ag pigeon cytochrome c to a T cell clone, 3000 rad-treated B cell APC were able to stimulate approximately 50% as much phosphatidylinositol turnover as unirradiated B cells. It was also found that, in contrast to their inability to initiate T cell proliferation, and similarly to chemically cross-linked splenocytes, heavily irradiated resting B cells plus Ag induced a state of Ag hyporesponsiveness in T cell clones. This effect on T cells had the same Ag- and MHC-specificity as did receptor occupancy required for proliferation, indicating that heavily irradiated resting B cells bear functional class II molecules. Co-culture of T cells with allogeneic B cells and syngeneic heavily irradiated B cells or chemically cross-linked splenic APC plus Ag resulted in T cell proliferation and interfered with the induction of the hyporesponsive state. This co-stimulatory function was radiosensitive in resting allogeneic B cells. Together, these data support the hypothesis that the major functional consequences of radiation to resting B cell APC are a reduction in the effective display of Ag plus class II molecules and, probably what is more important, a loss in the ability to provide APC-derived co-stimulatory signals.""",Included

3030,"Comparison of three fractionation schedules in radiotherapy for early glottic squamous cell carcinoma. Background/Aim: Radiotherapy is widely accepted as the treatment of choice for early glottic squamous cell carcinoma (EGSCC), although it varies greatly with respect to dose, dose per fraction, and treatment techniques. The study aim was to evaluate the use of accelerated fractionation strategy (AFS) for EGSCC in standard clinical practice. Patients and Methods: Patients treated with definitive radiotherapy for EGSCC between 2008 and 2019 were retrospectively identified and received either conventional fractionation, hypofractionation, or hyperfractionation. Result(s): One hundred six patients were analyzed, and 19, 71, and 16 patients underwent conventional fractionation, hypofractionation, and hyperfractionation, respectively. The median follow-up was 56 months. The 5-year local control and overall survival rates were 79% and 83%; 78% and 79%; and 87% and 77%, respectively, and no significant difference was observed between the fractionation schedules. Conclusion(s): Our findings confirmed the utility of AFS in standard clinical practice and support its use for patients with EGSCC.Copyright © 2020 International Institute of Anticancer Research.

3057,"Texture analysis for the assessment of structural changes in parotid glands induced by radiotherapy. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: During radiotherapy (RT) for head-and-neck cancer, parotid glands undergo significant anatomic, functional and structural changes which could characterize pre-clinical signs of an increased risk of xerostomia. Texture analysis is proposed to assess structural changes of parotids induced by RT, and to investigate whether early variations of textural parameters (such as mean intensity and fractal dimension) can predict parotid shrinkage at the end of treatment., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Textural parameters and volumes of 42 parotids from 21 patients treated with intensity-modulated RT for nasopharyngeal cancer were extracted from CT images. To individuate which parameters changed during RT, a Wilcoxon signed-rank test between textural indices (first and second RT week; first and last RT week) was performed. Discriminant analysis was applied to variations of these parameters in the first two weeks of RT to assess their power in predicting parotid shrinkage at the end of RT., RESULTS: A significant decrease in mean intensity (1.7 HU and 3.8 HU after the second and last weeks, respectively) and fractal dimension (0.016 and 0.021) was found. Discriminant analysis, based on volume and fractal dimension, was able to predict the final parotid shrinkage (accuracy of 71.4%)., CONCLUSION: Textural features could be used in combination with volume to characterize structural modifications on parotid glands and to predict parotid shrinkage at the end of RT.

Aortal atherosclerosis prevalence appeared to depend reliably on sex, age, smoking habit (in males), alcohol consumption (in males) and arterial hypertension. Findings are that aortal atherosclerosis prevalence was higher in males and females underwent external gamma-irradiation of total dose over 0.5 Gy, in males and females underwent internal alpha-irradiation from incorporated plutonium of total absorbed radiation dose in liver over 0.025 Gy.

3080,"Radiation- and Age-Associated Changes in Peripheral Blood Dendritic Cell Populations among Aging Atomic Bomb Survivors in Japan. Previous immunological studies in atomic bomb survivors have suggested that radiation exposure leads to long-lasting changes, similar to immunological aging observed in T-cell-adaptive immunity. However, to our knowledge, late effects of radiation on dendritic cells (DCs), the key coordinators for activation and differentiation of T cells, have not yet been investigated in humans. In the current study, we hypothesized that numerical and functional decreases would be observed in relationship to radiation dose in circulating conventional DCs (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) among 229 Japanese A-bomb survivors. Overall, the evidence did not support this hypothesis, with no overall changes in DCs or functional changes observed with radiation dose. Multivariable regression analysis for radiation dose, age and gender effects revealed that total DC counts as well as subpopulation counts decreased in relationship to increasing age. Further analyses revealed that in women, absolute numbers of pDCs showed significant decreases with radiation dose. A hierarchical clustering analysis of gene expression profiles in DCs after Toll-like receptor stimulation in vitro identified two clusters of participants that differed in age-associated expression levels of genes involved in antigen presentation and cytokine/chemokine production in cDCs. These results suggest that DC counts decrease and expression levels of gene clusters change with age. More than 60 years after radiation exposure, we also observed changes in pDC counts associated with radiation, but only among women.",Included

3107,"Protein expression of nucleophosmin, annexin A3 and nm23-H1 correlates with human nasopharyngeal carcinoma radioresistance in vivo. Radioresistance is a significant obstacle in the treatment of endemic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The present study aimed to identify proteins associated with radioresistance in NPC in vitro and in vivo. Proteomics analyses were conducted to screen for differentially-expressed proteins (DEPs) in parental CNE-2 cells and CNE-2R cells. Using proteomics approaches, 16 DEPs were identified. Of these DEPs, nucleophosmin (NPM1), annexin A3 and nm23-H1, were verified using western blot analyses. The tumorigenicity was investigated using mouse xenograft tumorigenicity assays, and tumor growth curves were generated. The protein expression of NPM1, annexin A3 and nm23-H1 was examined by immunohistochemically staining tumor tissues. NPM1 and annexin A3 protein levels were downregulated in the CNE-2R cells, whereas nm23-H1 expression was upregulated. In vivo tests showed that compared with the CNE-2 tumors, CNE-2R tumor growth was significantly retarded (P<0.05). CNE-2 tumor progression was inhibited by irradiation, but CNE-2R tumor progression was not, indicating that the CNE-2R cells were also radioresistant in vivo. NPM1 and annexin A3 expression was significantly lower in non-irradiated (NIR)-CNE-2R tumors compared with NIR-CNE-2 tumors (P<0.01). However, Nm23-H1 protein levels were significantly higher (P<0.05). Overall, the present study established comparable radioresistant and radiosensitive tumor models of human NPC, and identified candidate biomarkers that may correlate with radioresistance. The data showed that dysregulation of NPM1, annexin A3 and nm23-H1 expression correlated with the cellular and tumor radioresponse. These proteins are involved in the regulation of intracellular functions, including stress responses, cell proliferation and DNA repair. However, further clinical evaluations are required.Copyright © 2016, Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.",Included

Background: Essential molecular pathways such as the MAPK pathway, NO system, or the influence of PIK3CA as an oncogene are known to regulate fundamental signalling networks. However, few knowledge about their role in the occurrence of wound healing disorders (WHD) following radiation therapy (RT) exists. This study aims to evaluate the expression profiles of specific molecular pathway marker genes. Method(s): Expression profiles of the genes encoding MAPK, NOS1, NOS3, and PIK3CA were analyzed, by RT-PCR, in specimens from patients with and without a history of RT to the head and neck. Clinical data on the occurrence of cervical WHDs were analyzed. Result(s): Expression analysis of patients with postoperative WHDs revealed a significant increase in MAPK expression compared to the control group without occurrence of postoperative WHDs. PIK3CA showed a significantly increased expression in patients with a history of RT. Expression analysis of all other investigated genes did not reveal significant differences. Conclusion(s): This current study is able to show the influence of RT on different molecular pathways. This underlines the crucial role of specific molecular networks, responsible for the occurrence of long-term radiation toxicity such as WHDs.

PURPOSE: To analyze the (i) expression of AMPK in a variety of epithelial cancer cells, (ii) regulation of AMPK subunit expression by ionizing radiation (IR) and (iii) impact of AMPK on signaling pathways regulating cell cycle and survival., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Human lung, prostate, and breast normal and cancer cells were treated with 0 or 8 Gy IR and mRNA and protein levels of AMPK were evaluated by RT-PCR and immunoblotting 24 or 48 h later. Untreated and radiated wild type (WT) and AMPKalpha(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were analyzed by immunoblotting using total- and phosphorylation-specific antibodies. Histone H2Ax was examined by fluorescence microscopy. The cell cycle and survival of WT and AMPKalpha(-/-) MEFs was also evaluated following 8 Gy by IR., RESULTS: AMPK subunits were found widely expressed in normal and cancer epithelial cells. IR increased subunit protein levels and stimulated gene transcription in cancer cells. AMPKalpha(-/-)-MEFs showed enhanced basal total levels of ATM and phosphorylation of its substrates histone H2Ax, but inhibited response of these markers and of checkpoint kinase Chk2 phosphorylation to IR. AMPKalpha(-/-)-MEFs showed increased basal levels of p53 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21(cip1), but lack of response of both genes to IR. These cells had increased basal levels and activation of the Akt-mTOR-p70(S6K)/4-EBP1 signalling pathway. IR increased Akt, p70(S6K) and 4-EBP1 phosphorylation in WT-MEFs, but this was reduced in AMPKalpha(-/-)-MEFs. AMPKalpha(-/-)-MEFs failed to arrest at the G2-M checkpoint after IR and showed a trend for radio-resistance in proliferation assays., CONCLUSIONS: AMPK is widely expressed in human normal and cancer epithelial cells and its gene transcription, protein levels, and enzymatic activity is stimulated by IR. Work with AMPKalpha knockout cells suggests that AMPK (i) may mediate a suppressive regulation on basal expression and activity of ATM and its downstream effector pathways Chk2/p53-p21(cip1) and Akt-mTOR, (ii) facilitates the normal response of these pathways to IR and, (iii) mediates the IR-induced G2-M checkpoint.

BACKGROUND In the current study, the authors sought to evaluate outcomes, specifically with respect to adjuvant radiotherapy (RT), for patients with desmoplastic melanoma. METHODS The records of 130 consecutive patients who presented between 1985 and 2009 with nonmetastatic desmoplastic melanoma and were treated curatively with either surgery alone (59 patients; 45%) or surgery and postoperative RT (71 patients; 55%) were retrospectively reviewed. Ages ranged from 21 years to 97 years (median age, 66 years). The location of the primary tumor was in the head and neck region in 62% of patients. Only 5 patients (4%) had lymph node involvement at the time of presentation. RESULTS The median follow-up was 6.6 years (range, 11 months-24 years). Overall survival rates at 5 years and 10 years were 69% and 53%, respectively. Disease-specific survival rates were 84% and 80%, respectively, at 5 years and 10 years. The actuarial rate of local recurrence was 17% at 5 years and beyond. Of the patients who underwent surgery without receiving postoperative RT, 14 (24%) experienced local recurrence. Of the 71 patients treated with surgery and postoperative RT, 5 (7%) experienced local recurrence. In a Cox multivariate regression model, improved local control was significantly associated with the receipt of postoperative RT (P = .009).

3182,"Increased oxidative stress in barn swallows from the Chernobyl region. The Chernobyl nuclear accident produced the largest unintended release of radionuclides in history, with dramatic consequences for humans and other organisms. Exposure to ionizing radiation is known to reduce circulating and stored levels of specific antioxidants in birds and humans, thus potentially increasing oxidative stress. However, overall effects of radioactive exposure on oxidative status have never been investigated in any free ranging vertebrate. We measured plasma antioxidant capacity and concentration of reactive oxygen metabolites in adult barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) from colonies with variable background radiation levels in the Chernobyl region in Ukraine and Belarus. We predicted that antioxidants would decrease while reactive oxygen metabolites would increase with exposure to increasing levels of radiation at the breeding sites. Consistent with this expectation, radiation level positively predicted plasma concentration of reactive oxygen metabolites, whereas no significant covariation was found with non-enzymatic plasma antioxidant capacity. An index of oxidative stress was also larger in barn swallows exposed to high contamination levels. Thus, radioactive contamination appeared to be responsible for the increased generation of reactive oxygen metabolites and the imbalance between reactive oxygen metabolites and non-enzymatic plasma antioxidant capacity. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

3184,"MiR-19 in blood plasma reflects lung cancer occurrence but is not specifically associated with radon exposure. Radon is one of the most powerful carcinogens, particularly in terms of lung cancer onset and development. miRNAs may be considered not only as markers of the ongoing tumorigenesis but also as a hallmark of exposure to radiation, including radon and its progeny. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to estimate the value of plasma miR-19b-3p level as the prospective marker of the response to radon exposure in lung cancer pathogenesis. A total of 136 subjects were examined, including 49 radon-exposed patients with lung cancer, 37 patients with lung cancer without radon exposure and 50 age/sex matched healthy controls. Total RNA from blood samples was extracted and used to detect miR-19b-3p expression via reverse transcription quantitative-polymerase chain reaction. The 2-DELTADELTACq method was used to quantify the amount of relative miRNA. The plasma level of p53 protein was determined using a Human p53 ELISA kit. Plasma miR-19b-3p level was significantly higher in the patients with lung cancer groups, compared with the healthy control group (P<0.0001). No other statistically significant differences were determined in the expression level of plasma miR-19b-3p between patients diagnosed with lung cancer exposed to radon and not exposed to radon. The expression level of free circulating miR-19b-3p was higher in the group of non-smoking patients with lung cancer, compared with smokers with lung cancer. The miR-19b-3p was 1.4-fold higher in non-smokers than in smokers (P<0.05). No association between plasma levels of p53 protein and miR-19b-3p freely circulating in patients with lung cancer was observed. No other statistically significant differences were determined in the plasma p53 protein level between patients diagnosed with lung cancer exposed and not exposed to radon. These results indicated that detection of miR-19b-3p levels in plasma potentially could be exploited as a noninvasive method for the lung cancer diagnostics. However, this miRNA is not suitable as the precise marker for radon impact.Copyright © 2018, Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.",Included
3192,"Lack of correlation between basal cell survival and gross response in irradiated swine skin. The relationship between basal cell survival and gross response in irradiated swine skin was tested by comparing dose survival curves derived from time-dose isoeffect data with curves obtained directly from basal cell counts in histological sections. Assuming equal effect per exposure and constant cell survival at isoeffect, best-fitting single-hit multi-target and linear-quadratic response curves were determined for time-dose schedules resulting in non-healing of 50% of irradiated fields. Basal cell survivals for single doses of 970, 1649, 2231, and 2619 rad were estimated 1) by counting regenerating islands and 2) by monitoring total basal cell counts through time. The dose survival curve derived from the isoeffect data was steeper than the curve obtained from direct basal cell counts. Furthermore, the direct basal cell survival curve extrapolates to less than 100% at zero dose, indicating the presence of a resistant basal cell subpopulation. The data show that the isoeffect in this case is not strongly coupled to basal cell survival. Rather, the probability of healing of an irradiated field is more sensitive to the dose per fraction than is basal cell survival, implying a contribution to non-healing from damage to stromal elements such as the capillary endothelium.",Included

Despite variations in the qualitative observations, there was a marked difference in two of the schedules between damage expressed as crypt counts and that described by the qualitative techniques. In the first case high crypt numbers were associated with severe mucosal damage, whereas the second schedule produced a reduced crypt count in association with low damage to the surface mucosa. A third schedule produced results in which there was a general agreement between low crypt numbers and considerable surface mucosal damage. However, observations were made of mucosal formations not previously seen on damaged mucosal surfaces. These resembled the appearance normally associated with the gut of patients suffering from coeliac disease.

BACKGROUND: The safety of gamma knife radiosurgery should be considered when treating pituitary adenomas., OBJECTIVES: To determine the maximum tolerated dose of radiation delivered by gamma knife radiosurgery to optic nerves., METHODS: An animal model designed to establish prolonged balloon compression of the optic chiasm and parasellar region was developed to mimic the optic nerve compression caused by pituitary adenomas. Twenty cats underwent surgery to place a balloon for compression effect and 20 cats in a sham operation group received microsurgery without any treatment. The effects of gamma knife irradiation at 10-13 Gy on normal (sham operation group) and compressed (optic nerve compression group) optic nerves were investigated by pattern visual evoked potential examination and histopathology., RESULTS: Gamma knife radiosurgery at 10 Gy had almost no effect. At 11 Gy, P100 latency was significantly prolonged and P100 amplitude was significantly decreased in compressed optic nerves, but there was little change in the normal optic nerves. Doses of 11 Gy and higher induced significant electrophysiological variations and degeneration of the myelin sheath and axons in both normal and compressed optic nerves., CONCLUSIONS: Compressed optic nerves are more sensitive to gamma knife radiosurgery than normal optic nerves. The minimum dose of gamma knife radiosurgery that causes radiation injury in normal optic nerves is 12 Gy; however, the minimum dose is 11 Gy in compressed optic nerves. Copyright © 2013 S.

As multiple spacefaring nations contemplate extended manned missions to Mars and the Moon, health risks could be elevated as travel goes beyond the Earth's protective magnetosphere into the more intense deep space radiation environment. The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether mortality rates due to cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, accidents and all other causes of death differ in (1) astronauts who never flew orbital missions in space, (2) astronauts who flew only in low Earth orbit (LEO), and (3) Apollo lunar astronauts, the only humans to have traveled beyond Earth's magnetosphere. Results show there were no differences in CVD mortality rate between non-flight (9%) and LEO (11%) astronauts. However, the CVD mortality rate among Apollo lunar astronauts (43%) was 4-5 times higher than in non-flight and LEO astronauts. To test a possible mechanistic basis for these findings, a secondary purpose was to determine the long-term effects of simulated weightlessness and space-relevant total-body irradiation on vascular responsiveness in mice. The results demonstrate that space-relevant irradiation induces a sustained vascular endothelial cell dysfunction.

The potential for radiological accidents and nuclear terrorism has increased the need for the development of new rapid biodosimetry methods.

We utilized metabolomics and lipidomics to investigate changes of metabolites in serum samples following exposure to total body ionizing radiation in humans. Serum was collected prior to irradiation, at 3-8 h after a single dose of 1.25-2 Gy, and at 24 h with a total delivered dose of 2-3.75 Gy. Metabolomics revealed perturbations in glycerophosphocholine, phenylalanine, ubiquinone Q2, and oxalic acid. Alterations were observed in circulating levels of lipids from monoacylglycerol, triacylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylglycerol lipid classes. Polyunsaturated fatty acids were some of the most dysregulated lipids, with increased levels linked to proinflammatory processes. A targeted metabolomics approach for eicosanoids was also employed. The results showed a rapid response for proinflammatory eicosanoids, with a dampening of the signal at the later time point.

Hence, we decided to investigate the relationship between oxidative stress and low dose ionizing radiation (x-rays) in the work environment of x-ray technicians (radiographers), by comparing their RBC malondialdehyde, % hemolysis, catalase and plasma vitamin E levels with those of controls. There was a significant increase in the susceptibility of RBCs to hemolysis in radiographers compared to controls. Malondialdehyde and catalase levels were slightly increased in the radiographers, but this did not disturb the steady state concentration of their plasma vitamin E. These findings go in favour of theories stating that exposure to low dose ionizing radiation does cause a greater amount of oxidative stress, than that caused during normal routine metabolic processes.",Included

We report the first multicenter, blinded, and randomized trial of intracoronary radiation with the use of a 90Sr/90Y beta-source for the treatment of in-stent restenosis., METHODS AND RESULTS: After successful catheter-based treatment of in-stent restenosis, 476 patients were randomly assigned to receive an intracoronary catheter containing either 90Sr/90Y (n=244) or placebo (n=232) sources. The prescribed dose 2 mm from the center of the source was 18.4 Gy for vessels between 2.70 and 3.35 mm in diameter and 23.0 Gy for vessels between 3.36 and 4.0 mm. The primary end point, ie, clinically driven target-vessel revascularization by 8 months, was observed in 56 (26.8%) of the patients assigned to placebo and 39 (17.0%) of the patients assigned to radiation (P=0.015). The incidence of the composite including death, myocardial infarction, and target-vessel revascularization was observed in 60 (28.7%) of the patients assigned to placebo and 44 (19.1%) of the patients assigned to radiation (P=0.024).

Fifty-nine animals were given the opportunity to participate in cognitive cage-side testing. The animals that received single-dose gamma irradiation were significantly less likely to engage in cognitive testing than the controls, suggesting that irradiated animals may have differences in cognitive ability.

Each session consisted of 30 trials in which the animals were required to choose the correct visual stimulus for a food reward. After the initial presentation, the stimulus that signaled the presence of food was twice reversed once the animal reached criterion (90% accuracy across four consecutive sessions). While the limited sample size precluded definitive statistical analysis, irradiated animals took longer to reach the criterion subsequent to reversal than did control animals, suggesting a relative deficiency in cognitive flexibility.

We explored whether intestinal microbe transplantation could alleviate radiation-induced toxicity. High-throughput sequencing showed that gastrointestinal bacterial community composition differed between male and female mice and was associated with susceptibility to radiation toxicity. Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) increased the survival rate of irradiated animals, elevated peripheral white blood cell counts and improved gastrointestinal tract function and intestinal epithelial integrity in irradiated male and female mice. FMT preserved the intestinal bacterial composition and retained mRNA and long non-coding RNA expression profiles of host small intestines in a sex-specific fashion. Despite promoting angiogenesis, sex-matched FMT did not accelerate the proliferation of cancer cells in vivo.

To evaluate the maintenance of T-cell memory within A-bomb survivors 60 years after radiation exposure, we examined functionally distinct memory CD4 T-cell subsets in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of the survivors., METHODS: Three functionally different subsets of memory CD4 T cells were identified by differential CD43 expression levels and measured using flow cytometry. These subsets consist of functionally mature memory cells, cells weakly responsive to antigenic stimulation, and those cells functionally anergic and prone to spontaneous apoptosis., RESULTS: The percentages of these subsets within the peripheral blood CD4 T-cell pool all significantly increased with age. Percentages of functionally weak and anergic subsets were also found to increase with radiation dose, fitting to a log linear model. Within the memory CD4 T-cell pool, however, there was an inverse association between radiation dose and the percentage of functionally mature memory cells., CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the steady state of T cell memory, which is regulated by cell activation and/or cell survival processes in subsets, may have been perturbed by prior radiation exposure among A-bomb survivors.",Included

The pathway activity showed a consistent but minor reduction in the experimental group, which became statistically significant after the total dose of 750 rads (P less than 0.020). In a separate study the changes induced by ionizing radiation in the erythrocyte enzyme NADH-methemoglobin reductase were measured using the same experimental protocol. The enzyme activity in the red cells of the experimental group varied between 34.90 +/- 2.17 to 161.95 +/- 5.34 I.U./ml erythrocyte pack. Its activity declined toward the initial value after reaching the peak by the 12th day of ionizing radiation with 600 rads (P less than 0.001).",Included
3462,"Radiation metabolomics. 5. Identification of urinary biomarkers of ionizing radiation exposure in nonhuman primates by mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics has previously demonstrated utility for identifying biomarkers of ionizing radiation exposure in cellular, mouse and rat in vivo radiation models. To provide a valuable link from small laboratory rodents to humans, gamma-radiation-induced urinary biomarkers were investigated using a nonhuman primate total-body-irradiation model. Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics approaches were applied to determine whether biomarkers could be identified, as well as the previously discovered rodent biomarkers of gamma radiation. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis was carried out on a time course of clean-catch urine samples collected from nonhuman primates (n = 6 per cohort) exposed to sham, 1.0, 3.5, 6.5 or 8.5 Gy doses of (60)Co gamma ray (~0.55 Gy/min) ionizing radiation. By multivariate data analysis, 13 biomarkers of radiation were discovered: N-acetyltaurine, isethionic acid, taurine, xanthine, hypoxanthine, uric acid, creatine, creatinine, tyrosol sulfate, 3-hydroxytyrosol sulfate, tyramine sulfate, N-acetylserotonin sulfate, and adipic acid. N-Acetyltaurine, isethionic acid, and taurine had previously been identified in rats, and taurine and xanthine in mice after ionizing radiation exposure. Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics has thus successfully revealed and verified urinary biomarkers of ionizing radiation exposure in the nonhuman primate for the first time, which indicates possible mechanisms for ionizing radiation injury.",Included

Objective: To estimate the incidence of malignant neoplasms of lymphoid tissue (MNLT) among employees of the Siberian Chemical Combine (SC) occupationally exposed to prolonged ionizing radiation. Material and Methods. The study included 44,041 employees of the SC, of whom 16,938 were occupationally exposed to prolonged low-intensity ionizing radiation (IR). Of 295 cases with hemoblastoses, there were 89 with occupational exposure to IR. The structure and incidence of hemoblastoses (based on the number of person-years of observation, (PYO), as well as the standardized relative risk (SRR) of their development and excess relative risk (ERR) per unit dose of radiation (Gr) were evaluated. Calculation of SRR was carried out for the following intervals of the total dose of external exposure: 0; >0-0.05; >0.05-0.10; >0.10-0.15; >0.15-0.20; >0.20-0.30; >0.30-0.50; >0.5-1.0; >= 1.0 G y. The control group consisted of occupationally non-exposed employees of the SC. The calculation of SRR and ERR was performed using the Poisson regression using the AM FIT module of the EPICU RE package. Results. The incidence of MNLT among males of SC was 17.1 per 100,000 P YO, with the highest incidence rates for Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CL) and chronic leukemia (CL) excluding CL. Among females of the SC, the incidence of MNLT was 21.3 per 100,000 PYO. It was found that in none of the intervals of the external exposure there was no statistically significant excess of the SRR compared with the control group. The results of ERR/Gy calculation also did not demonstrate the increased risk of hemoblastosis among people occupationally exposed to IR. Conclusion. Occupational exposure in the studied dose range does not increase the risk of developing MNLT.Copyright © 2020, Tomsk National Research Medical Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

3478,"Assessment of DNA damage in nuclear medicine personnel--comparative study with the alkaline comet assay and the chromosome aberration test. Despite much research over the last few decades, there still remains considerable uncertainty as to the genetic impact of ionizing radiation on human populations, particularly at low levels. The aim of the present study was to provide data on the genetic hazards due to occupational exposure of low doses of ionizing radiation in nuclear medicine departments. The assessment of primary DNA damage in peripheral blood leukocytes of medical staff was performed using the alkaline comet assay and the data obtained were compared with the results of conventional cytogenetic biodosimetry using the chromosome aberration (CA) test. Altogether 120 subjects (60 exposed and 60 controls) participated in the study. Statistically significant increases in primary DNA damage and increased frequencies of CAs compared to controls were observed. Within the exposed population, significant inter-individual differences in DNA damage were found, indicating differences in genome sensitivity. Age and gender were not confounding factors, while smoking enhanced the levels of primary DNA damage only in control subjects, as revealed by both biomarkers studied. The present study suggests that genotoxic damage results from exposure to chronic low doses of ionizing radiation in nuclear medicine departments. Therefore, the exposed medical personnel should carefully comply with the radiation protection procedures and should minimize radiation exposure where possible to avoid potential genotoxic effects. The results obtained in this study point to the significance of biological indicators providing information on the actual risk to the radiation exposed individuals. According to our results, the alkaline comet assay and CA test are sensitive biomarkers that can be used as additional complements to physical dosimetry for assessing exposure to radiation in nuclear medicine personnel.",Included
3484,"Chernobyl birds have smaller brains. BACKGROUND: Animals living in areas contaminated by radioactive material from Chernobyl suffer from increased oxidative stress and low levels of antioxidants. Therefore, normal development of the nervous system is jeopardized as reflected by high frequencies of developmental errors, reduced brain size and impaired cognitive abilities in humans. Alternatively, associations between psychological effects and radiation have been attributed to post-traumatic stress in humans., METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING: Here we used an extensive sample of 550 birds belonging to 48 species to test the prediction that even in the absence of post-traumatic stress, there is a negative association between relative brain size and level of background radiation. We found a negative association between brain size as reflected by external head volume and level of background radiation, independent of structural body size and body mass. The observed reduction in brain size in relation to background radiation amounted to 5% across the range of almost a factor 5,000 in radiation level. Species differed significantly in reduction in brain size with increasing background radiation, and brain size was the only morphological character that showed a negative relationship with radiation. Brain size was significantly smaller in yearlings than in older individuals., CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Low dose radiation can have significant effects on normal brain development as reflected by brain size and therefore potentially cognitive ability. The fact that brain size was smaller in yearlings than in older individuals implies that there was significant directional selection on brain size with individuals with larger brains experiencing a viability advantage.",Included

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To quantify the late dose-related responses of the rat cervical spinal cord to X-ray irradiations by an array of microbeams or by a single millimeter beam., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Necks of anesthetized rats were irradiated transversely by an 11 mm wide array of 52 parallel, 35 mum wide, vertical X-ray microbeams, separated by 210 mum intervals between centers. Comparison was made with rats irradiated with a 1.35 mm wide single beam of similar X-rays. Rats were killed when paresis developed, or up to 383 days post irradiation (dpi)., RESULTS: Microbeam peak/valley doses of =357/12.7 Gy to 715/25.4 Gy to an 11 mm long segment of the spinal cord, or single beam doses of =146-454 Gy to a 1.35 mm long segment caused foreleg paresis and histopathologically verified spinal cord damage; rats exposed to peak/valley doses up to 253/9 Gy were paresis-free at 383 dpi., CONCLUSIONS: Whereas microbeam radiation therapy [MRT] for malignant gliomas implanted in rat brains can be safe, palliative or curative, the high tolerance of normal rat spinal cords to similar microbeam exposures justifies testing MRT for autochthonous malignancies in the central nervous system of larger animals with a view to subsequent clinical applications.

UNLABELLED: This study evaluates the use of the 99mTc-DTPA aerosol lung clearance method to investigate radiation-induced lung changes in eight patients undergoing radiotherapy for lung or breast carcinoma. The sensitivity of the method was compared with chest radiography for detecting radiation-induced changes in the lung, regional alterations within (irradiated region) and outside (shielded region) the treatment ports, effect of irradiated lung volume, and dependence on time after radiotherapy., METHODS: Serial DTPA lung clearance studies were performed before the first radiation treatment (baseline), then weekly during a 5- to 7-wk course, and up to 12 times post-therapy over periods of 56-574 days. The total activity deposited in the lungs for each study was approximately 150 microCi (approximately 5.6 MBq). DTPA clearance, expressed in terms of the biological half-time, t 1/2, was computed from the slopes of the least-squares fit regression lines of the time-activity curves for the first 10 min for irradiated and shielded lung regions., RESULTS: Major findings include: (a) significant and early DTPA t 1/2 changes were observed in all patients during and after radiotherapy; (b) changes in DTPA t 1/2 values were observed in both irradiated and shielded lung regions in all patients suggesting a radiation-induced systemic reaction; (c) changes in DTPA t 1/2 values were correlated (p < 0.05) with the irradiated lung volumes; (d) significantly reduced DTPA t 1/2 values were observed in three patients who subsequently presented with clinical symptoms and/or radiographic changes consistent with radiation pneumonitis (t1/2 felt to 19% +/- 6% of baseline values, compared with 64% +/- 17% in the remaining patients [p < 0.01]); (e) the onset of decreased DTPA t 1/2 values in these three patients occurred 35-84 days before clinical symptoms and/or radiographic changes; and (f) DTPA t 1/2 tended to approach baseline values with time after radiotherapy, suggesting a long-term recovery in lung injury., CONCLUSION: These observations show significant and early alterations in DTPA lung clearance during and after radiotherapy that may provide a sensitive assay to monitor changes in radiation-induced lung injury and may facilitate early therapeutic intervention.",Included

3532,"Time sequence of cancer occurrence. Implications in low level radiation risk assessment. A total of 8 229 C57 Black mice of both sexes were randomly assigned to various groups. In some groups, mice aged 33 +/- 3 days were submitted to either sham, neutron or cobalt external radiation at 32, 45, 63, 88 and 123 mGy or at 18, 25, 36 and 51 cGy dose levels, respectively. In other groups, mice either at birth or weaning, were injected with tritiated thymidine or tritiated water, or were given tritiated water as drinking water for the entire lifespan. The main purpose of the experiment was to investigate the low dose-response relationship of cancer induction, especially leukemogenesis and to evaluate the excess risk, using actuarial age-specific rates. Following neutron or cobalt exposure, the phenotypic occurrence of lymphocytic lymphomas was earlier in appearance and higher in yield during the first decades of lifespan in irradiated groups versus matching controls, whereas such occurrence was markedly lower in yield at a later age. Under parallel experimental conditions, induction of reticulum cell lymphomas, however, was uniformly enhanced throughout the entire lifespan. Induction rates of all tumors (reticular and solid) pooled were significantly increased, and more so following cobalt than neutron irradiation. In mice injected with tritiated thymidine, the overall tumor incidence was increased monotonically throughout the lifespan. In mice exposed to tritiated water, the incidence of lymphocytic lymphomas was markedly increased throughout the lifespan, whereas no such effect was observed for reticulum cell tumors. In the light of tumor data analysis, it appears that selection of a particular type of tumor as a dependent variable for dose-response assessment cannot disregard the primary modulation of the whole tumor spectrum. In C57 Black murine leukemogenesis, the shape and structure of the dose-response regression curve over the entire lifespan does not fit the linear-quadratic model. It is, however, theorized that our data are consistent with the two-mutation clonal expansion model, assuming creation of initiated cells which are added to the pool of spontaneously occurring initiated cells and implying that the excess risk is initially high at early age and then decreases with increasing age following exposure. It is concluded that murine radiocarcinogenesis investigation may contribute to improving the assessment as well as understanding the underlying mechanisms of low level radiation hazards.

3534,"Increased circulating cell-free DNA levels and mtDNA fragments in interventional cardiologists occupationally exposed to low levels of ionizing radiation. Circulating cell-free DNA (ccf-DNA) and mtDNA (ccf-mtDNA) have often been used as indicators of cell death and tissue damage in acute and chronic disorders, but little is known about changes in ccf-DNA and ccf-mtDNA concentrations following radiation exposure. The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of chronic low-dose radiation exposure on serum ccf-DNA levels and ccf-mtDNA fragments (mtDNA-79 and mtDNA-230) of interventional cardiologists working in high-volume cardiac catheterization laboratory to assess their possible role as useful radiation biomarkers. We enrolled 50 interventional cardiologists (26 males; age = 48.4 +/- 10 years) and 50 age- and gender-matched unexposed controls (27 males; age = 47.6 +/- 8.3 years). Quant-iT TM dsDNA High-Sensitivity assay was used to measure circulating ccf-DNA isolated from serum samples. Quantitative analysis of mtDNA fragments was performed by real-time PCR. No significant relationships were found between ccf-DNA and ccf-mtDNA, and age, gender, smoking, or other clinical parameters. Ccf-DNA levels (44.2 +/- 31.1 vs. 30.6 +/- 19.2 ng/ml, P = 0.013), ccf-mtDNA-79 (2.6 +/- 2.1 vs. 1.1 +/- 0.8, P < 0.01), and ccf-mtDNA-230 copies (2.0 +/- 1.8 vs. 1.04 +/- 0.9, P = 0.02) were significantly higher in interventional cardiologists compared with the non-exposed group. In a subset (n = 15) of interventional cardiologists with a reliable reconstruction of cumulative professional exposure (59.7 +/- 48.4 mSv; range: 1.4-182 mS), ccf-DNA (53.2 +/- 41.3 vs. 36.4 +/- 22.9 and 32.2 +/- 20.5, P = 0.08), mtDNA-79 (2.4 +/- 2.1 vs. 2.03 +/- 1.7 and 1.09 +/- 0.82, P = 0.05), and mtDNA-230 (2.0 +/- 2.2 vs. 1.5 +/- 1.4 and 1.04 +/- 0.9, P = 0.09) tended to be significantly increased in high-exposure subjects compared with both low-exposure interventional cardiologists and controls.

3541,"Polymorphisms in DNA repair genes: Link with biomarkers of the CBMN cytome assay in hospital workers chronically exposed to low doses of ionising radiation. Individual sensitivity to ionising radiation (IR) is the result of interaction between exposure, DNA damage, and its repair, which is why polymorphisms in DNA repair genes could play an important role. We examined the association between DNA damage, expressed as micronuclei (MNi), nuclear buds (NBs), and nucleoplasmic bridges (NPBs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms in selected DNA repair genes (APE1, hOGG1, XRCC1, XRCC3, XPD, PARP1, MGMT genes; representative of the different DNA repair pathways operating in mammals) in 77 hospital workers chronically exposed to low doses of IR, and 70 matched controls. A significantly higher MNi frequency was found in the exposed group (16.2+/-10.4 vs. 11.5+/-9.4; P=0.003) and the effect appeared to be independent from the principal confounding factor. Exposed individuals with hOGG1, XRCC1, PARP1, and MGMT wild-type alleles or APEX1, as well as XPD (rs13181) heterozygous showed a significantly higher MNi frequency than controls with the same genotypes.

3544,"Diagnostic medical radiation in inflammatory bowel disease: Primum non-nocere?. Background and Aims Patients with Inflammatory Bowel disease (IBD) are frequently exposed to diagnostic medical radiation for the diagnosis and evaluation of their disease. Despite increasing awareness of the potentially serious downstream effects, few studies have quantified radiation exposure in IBD patients. Methods We conducted a retrospective review of 225 consecutive patients attending IBD clinics at our hospital. Clinical data including demographics, disease characteristics and therapy were obtained from case note and electronic patient record review. All incidences of diagnostic medical radiation from initial diagnosis until 30 June 2010 inclusive were recorded from case note and computerised radiology database system review. The radiation dose for each procedure was obtained from published tables from the Royal College of Radiologists, UK. Effective dose for each procedure was calculated by multiplying this value by the number of procedures during the study period. The sum of doses received was the cumulative effective dose. Results One hundred and two of the 225 IBD patients reviewed were female, 123 were male. The median age was 48 (Range 17-88) and mean disease duration 9.8 years. One hundred and four patients had Crohn's disease, 113 patients had ulcerative colitis and 8 patients had an indeterminate colitis. The mean and median cumulative effective radiation doses were 11.35 mSv and 5.12 mSv respectively. A cumulative radiation dose greater than 10 mSv was seen in 40.9% (92) patients and greater than 25 mSv in 12.9% (29) patients. In 9 patients the cumulative effective dose was greater than 50 mSv. Crohn's disease was associated with a higher cumulative effective dose with exposure exceeding 10 mSv in 60.6%, 25 mSv in 22.1% and 50 mSv in 8.7% patients respectively. CT imaging accounted for 43% and barium studies for 32% of the total cumulative effective dose exposure. Thirty-nine patients had small bowel magnetic resonance (MR) studies as an alternative to ionising radiation in the last 3 years. Conclusions Patients with IBD, particularly those with Crohn's disease are exposed to significant amounts of diagnostic medical radiation in their lifetime. The increased risk of cancer from cumulative radiation coupled with the inherent risk of colorectal malignancy in long standing IBD and the potential for immunomodulator drugs such as azathioprine to increase the risk of cancers (e.g. lymphoma) is of great clinical and public health concern. Clinicians must remain vigilant to these risks when evaluating these patients and radiation exposure should be minimised and when possible alternatives such as intestinal ultrasound and MR imaging should be preferred.",Included

Background: Osseous cyst echinococcosis (CE) is an infectious disease that causes disability and deformity in patients, yet there is still no satisfactory treatment. Focusing on the feasibility and prognosis of radiotherapy as an adjuvant or palliative treatment for osseous CE, this study investigated the outcome of Meriones meridianus with osseous CE after radiotherapy., Methods: The study utilized a comparison control group design with three groups of gerbils, and 240 osseous CE gerbils were randomly divided into control, 40Gy/5times, and 50Gy/5times groups. Different doses of radiotherapy were given to the gerbils, and then, the effects of radiotherapy on gerbils and lesions were observed at 3 and 6 months after radiotherapy. Statistical analysis was done using chi 2 test, unpaired t-test, and one-way ANOVA., Results: Significant changes (P < 0.05) were achieved between the three groups in terms of seven parameters at 3 and 6 months, including the number of dead gerbils and lesion sites with ulceration and infection, number of dead scolices, protein content, Ca2+ concentration, the maximum diameter of lesion site, and wet weight of cysts. Except for the number of dead gerbils and lesion sites with ulceration and infection, all other parameters were observed a big difference between 3 months and 6 months in the 50Gy/5times group., Conclusion: Radiotherapy at a dose of 50 Gy has inhibitory and therapeutic effects on osseous CE in gerbils, and radiotherapy could probably be a treatment option for persistent or recurrent osseous CE.

Background: Studies of workers at the plutonium production factory in Hanford, WA have led to conflicting conclusions about the role of age at exposure as a modifier of associations between ionising radiation and cancer. Aim(s): To evaluate the influence of age at exposure on radiation risk estimates in an updated follow up of Hanford workers. Method(s): A cohort of 26 389 workers hired between 1944 and 1978 was followed through 1994 to ascertain vital status and causes of death. External radiation dose estimates were derived from personal dosimeters. Poisson regression was used to estimate associations between mortality and cumulative external radiation dose at all ages, and in specific age ranges. Result(s): A total of 8153 deaths were identified, 2265 of which included cancer as an underlying or contributory cause. Estimates of the excess relative risk per Sievert (ERR/Sv) for cumulative radiation doses at all ages combined were negative for all cause and leukaemia and positive for all cancer and lung cancer. Cumulative doses accrued at ages below 35, 35-44, and 45-54 showed little association with mortality. For cumulative dose accrued at ages 55 and above (10 year lag), the estimated ERR/Sv for all cancers was 3.24 (90% CI: 0.80 to 6.17), primarily due to an association with lung cancer (ERR/Sv. 9.05, 90% CI: 2.96 to 17.92). Conclusion(s): Associations between radiation and cancer mortality in this cohort are primarily a function of doses at older ages and deaths from lung cancer.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Irradiation of ocular pterygium is considered a valuable treatment supplementation after surgical therapy. Since prospective randomized trials are scare and only limited patient data are available, the aim of this study was to evaluate the patient population treated with fractioned 90Sr irradiation after surgical pterygium resection., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between September 1993 and March 2001, 1,147 patients with pterygium lesions (1,320 lesions) were treated surgically and with 90Sr postoperative beta-irradiation. A total dose of 30 Gy was used for patients treated within 48 h after surgery, while those treated>48 h postoperatively received a total dose of 35 Gy. A minimum follow-up period of 3 months was required for inclusion in the analysis, and 1,253 lesions were ultimately analyzed., RESULTS: Recurrence of the pterygium after postoperative 90Sr irradiation was observed in 97 of 1,253 cases (7.7%). Statistical analysis (uni- and multivariate) revealed, that male gender, younger age (<40 years), prior treatment (surgery and radiotherapy) and immediate irradiation (<2 h after surgery) were negative predictors for local recurrence. Temporary radiotherapy-induced side effects were observed in 15.2% of patients, including moderate conjunctivitis, local pain, visual disturbance and photophobia or an increase in tear flow. However, no long-term serious side effects were documented., CONCLUSION: 90Sr irradiation of pterygium after surgery represents a safe and effective treatment option to prevent disease recurrence.

3660,"Effect of X-irradiation on epidermal immune function: decreased density and alloantigen-presenting capacity of Ia+ Langerhans cells and impaired production of epidermal cell-derived thymocyte activating factor (ETAF). The mechanisms involved in the modulation of cutaneous immune responses by UV radiation have been extensively investigated; by contrast, few studies have addressed the effects of x-irradiation on epidermal immune function. We therefore investigated the effect of x-irradiation of mice on: (a) the density of epidermal Ia+ Langerhans cells (LC) in immunofluorescence studies, (b) epidermal cell (EC) allostimulatory capacity in the allogeneic EC-lymphocyte reaction (ELR), and (c) production of epidermal cell-derived thymocyte activating factor (ETAF). C3H/He and BALB/c mice were irradiated with 900, 1,800, 2,700, or 3,600 rad from a 137Cs source, and sacrificed 10 h or 3 days later. X-irradiation of mice 10 h previously only slightly decreased the density of epidermal Ia+ LC and did not affect the capacity of their EC to stimulate allogeneic responder lymphocytes in the ELR. X-irradiation of mice 3 days previously, however, resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the density of Ia+ LC. This decrease was accompanied by a substantial reduction in EC allostimulatory capacity in the ELR at all doses of x-irradiation. ETAF production by cultured EC from mice x-irradiated 3 days previously was also found to be diminished at all doses of x-irradiation. Trypan blue exclusion studies demonstrated that the observed decreases in EC allostimulatory capacity and ETAF production were not the result of a generalized lethal effect of x-irradiation on EC. The reduction in EC allostimulatory capacity following in vivo x-irradiation could not be reversed by addition of exogenous ETAF or interleukin-1 in the ELR. Taken together, these results indicate that x-irradiation decreases the density of Ia+ LC, impairs LC alloantigen-presenting function, and reduces ETAF production. Thus cutaneous x-irradiation may affect inflammatory and neoplastic processes not only by its antimitotic activity, but also by a direct effect on EC which subserve immunologic functions.",Included

Background: Although the National Lung Screening Trial reported a significant reduction in lung cancer mortality when low-dose (LD) CT chest examinations are used for a diagnosis, their biologic effects from radiation exposure remain unclear. Purpose(s): To compare LD CT and standard-dose (SD) CT for DNA double-strand breaks and chromosome aberrations (CAs) in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Material(s) and Method(s): Between March 2016 and June 2018, 209 participants who were referred to a respiratory surgery department for chest CT studies were prospectively enrolled in this study. Individuals were excluded if they had undergone radiography examinations within the last 3 days or had undergone chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Peripheral blood samples were obtained before and 15 minutes after CT. The number of g-H2AX foci and unstable CAs in lymphocytes was quantified by immunofluorescent staining of g-H2AX and by fluorescence in situ hybridization by using peptide nucleic acid probes for centromeres and telomeres, respectively. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used for statistical analysis. Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple comparisons. Result(s): Of the 209 participants (105 women, 104 men; mean age, 67.0 years 6 11.3 [standard deviation]), 107 underwent chest LD CT and 102 underwent chest SD CT.

The number of double-strand breaks and CAs increased after a SD CT examination (g-H2AX, P , .001; CAs, P = .003); the number of double-strand breaks and CAs before and after LD CT was not different (g-H2AX, P = .45; CAs, P = .69). Conclusion(s): No effect of low-dose CT on human DNA was detected. In the same setting, DNA double-strand breaks and chromosome aberrations increased after standard-dose CT.Copyright © RSNA, 2020.",Included
3703,"Radiation exposure due to local fallout from Soviet atmospheric nuclear weapons testing in Kazakhstan: solid cancer mortality in the Semipalatinsk historical cohort, 1960-1999. Little information is available on the health effects of exposures to fallout from Soviet nuclear weapons testing and on the combined external and internal environmental exposures that have resulted from these tests. This paper reports the first analysis of the Semipalatinsk historical cohort exposed in the vicinity of the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site, Kazakhstan. The cohort study, which includes 19,545 inhabitants of exposed and comparison villages of the Semipalatinsk region, was set up in the 1960s and comprises 582,750 person-years of follow-up between 1960 and 1999. Cumulative effective radiation dose estimates in this cohort range from 20 mSv to approximately 4 Sv. Rates of mortality and cancer mortality in the exposed group substantially exceeded those of the comparison group. Dose-response analyses within the exposed group confirmed a significant trend with dose for all solid cancers (P < 0.0001) and for digestive and respiratory cancers (P = 0.0255 and P < 0.0001), whereas no consistent dose-response trend was found for all causes of death (P = 0.4296). Regarding specific cancer sites, a significant trend with dose was observed for lung cancer (P = 0.0001), stomach cancer (P = 0.0050), and female breast cancer (P = 0.0040) as well as for esophagus cancer in women (P = 0.0030). The excess relative risk per sievert for all solid cancers combined was 1.77 (1.35; 2.27) based on the total cohort data, yet a selection bias regarding the comparison group could not be entirely ruled out. The excess relative risk per sievert based on the cohort's exposed group was 0.81 (0.46; 1.33) for all solid cancers combined and thus still exceeds current risk estimates from the Life Span Study. Future epidemiological assessments based on this cohort will benefit from extension of follow-up and ongoing validation of dosimetric data.",Included
3709,"Chromosomal instability in offspring of voles in unfavorable radiation zones. A high frequency of cells having chromosomal aberrations was shown to be preserved in the first generation of laboratory offspring of common voles, whose ancestors were captured near the East Ural radioactive track (EURT). In F2 and F3, a decrease in frequency was observed. Most likely, the cytogenetic effects observed were caused by environmental contamination with plutonium in the locality of capture. An increased chromosomal instability observed in the first laboratory generation of nonirradiated common voles was caused by reversible modifications in the expression of mutator genes inherited from parents exposed to alpha-irradiation rather than by classic mutations occurred in specific loci.",Included
1711,"Radiation therapy for extramammary paget disease: Treatment outcomes and prognostic factors. Purpose/Objective(s): Extramammary Paget disease (EMPD) is a relatively rare cutaneous malignancy that primarily affects the genital regions, such as the vulva and scrotum, of the elderly. Although wide surgical excision is the standard curative treatment for EMPD, it is frequently unsuitable due to old age or severe coexisting disease. Radiation therapy is considered a possible treatment option for these patients, but to date there have been few studies that have presented treatment results. Consequently, we have investigated the outcome of radiation therapy in EMPD. Materials/Methods: Thirty-six patients with EMPD received radiation therapy with curative intent. Of these patients, 13 were men and 23 were women, and their median age at irradiation was 74 years (range, 52-94 years). The primary tumor sites were the perineum in 13 patients, vulva in 12, scrotum in 10, and penis in one. Twelve patients had regional lymph node metastases prior to radiation therapy, but none had distant metastasis. Total radiation doses of 45-80.2 Gy (median, 60 Gy) were delivered to tumor sites in 23-43 fractions (median, 33 fractions) with fraction sizes of 1.8-2.2 Gy (median, 1.8 Gy). Result(s): All irradiated tumors had disappeared macroscopically by 2-9 months after irradiation, and the initial complete response rate was 100%. However, 14 of the 36 patients developed recurrences, including four with local progression within the radiation field and 11 with lymph node or/and distant metastases outside the radiation field, during follow-up periods of 2-150 months (median, 40 months). All but one of the 11 patients with regional lymph node or distant metastases after irradiation exhibited tumor invasion into the dermis, whereas of the 15 patients without tumor invasion into the dermis, none had regional lymph node metastasis and only one had distant metastasis after irradiation. The local progression-free and diseasefree rates were 86% and 53%, respectively at 3 years and 86% and 45%, respectively at 5 years. Nine patients died at 6-73 months after irradiation; the causes of death were tumor progression in five patients, infectious pneumonia in two, renal failure in one and old age in one. The overall and cause-specific survival rates were 93% and 95%, respectively at 3 years and 61% and 80%, respectively at 5 years. Tumor invasion into the dermis was a statistically significant prognostic factor for both distant metastasis (p = 0.004) and survival (p = 0.005). No therapy-related toxicities of grade 3 or greater were observed. Conclusion(s): Radiation therapy was found to be safe and effective for patients with EMPD. It appeared to contribute to prolonged survival through good tumor control, and to be a promising curative treatment option.",Excluded
1998,"Hypovolemic men and women regulate blood pressure differently following exposure to artificial gravity. PURPOSE: In addition to serious bone, vestibular, and muscle deterioration, space flight leads to cardiovascular dysfunction upon return to gravity. In seeking a countermeasure to space flight-induced orthostatic intolerance, we previously determined that exposure to artificial gravity (AG) training in a centrifuge improved orthostatic tolerance of ambulatory subjects. This protocol was more effective in men than women and more effective when subjects exercised., METHODS: We now determine the orthostatic tolerance limit (OTL) of cardiovascularly deconditioned (furosemide) men and women on one day following 90 min of AG compared to a control day (90 min of head-down bed rest, HDBR)., RESULTS: There were three major findings: a short bout of artificial gravity improved orthostatic tolerance of hypovolemic men (30 %) and women (22 %). Men and women demonstrated different mechanisms of cardiovascular regulation on AG and HDBR days; women maintained systolic blood pressure the same after HDBR and AG exposure while men's systolic pressure dropped (11 +/- 2.9 mmHg) after AG. Third, as presyncopal symptoms developed, men's and women's cardiac output and stroke volume dropped to the same level on both days, even though the OTL test lasted significantly longer on the AG day, indicating cardiac filling as a likely variable to trigger presyncope., CONCLUSIONS: (1) Even with gender differences, AG should be considered as a space flight countermeasure to be applied to astronauts before reentry into gravity, (2) men and women regulate blood pressure during an orthostatic stress differently following exposure to artificial gravity and (3) the trigger for presyncope may be cardiac filling.",Excluded
963,"Point-of-care ultrasound for confirmation of gastrostomy tube replacement in the pediatric emergency department. Gastrostomy tubes (G-tubes) are frequently used in children for feeding and nutrition. Complications related to G-tubes (and G-buttons) in children represent a common presentation to the emergency department (ED). G-tube replacement is usually performed by pediatric emergency medicine physicians. Misplacement may lead to tract disruption, perforation, fistula tract formation, or feeding into the peritoneum. Contrast-enhanced radiographs are traditionally used for confirmation. In addition to a longer length-of-stay, repeat ED visits result in repeated radiation exposure. The use of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) instead of radiography avoids this exposure to ionizing radiation. Here, we describe three patients who presented with G-tube complications in whom POCUS alone performed by pediatricians was used for confirmation of the tubes' replacement. Two children presented to the ED with G-tube dislodgement, and one child presented with a ruptured balloon. In all three cases, a new G-tube was replaced at the bedside using POCUS guidance without the need for further radiographic studies. There were no known ED or clinic returns for G-tube complaints over the next 30 days. This is the first report of pediatricians using POCUS to guide and confirm G-tube replacement in children. The success of these cases suggests the technique's feasibility. Future prospective studies are needed to evaluate the learning curves, diagnostic accuracy, ED length-of-stay, and use of confirmatory imaging.",Excluded
1901,"Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation improves deglutition in Parkinson's disease. Relatively little is known about the role of the basal ganglia in human deglutition. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) affords us a model for examining deglutition in humans with known impairment of the basal ganglia. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of subthalamic nuclei (STN) DBS on the oral and pharyngeal stages of deglutition in individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PD). It was hypothesized that DBS would be associated with improved deglutition. Within participant, comparisons were made between DBS in the ON and OFF conditions using the dependent variables: pharyngeal transit time, maximal hyoid bone excursion, oral total composite score, and pharyngeal total composite score. Significant improvement occurred for the pharyngeal composite score and pharyngeal transit time in the DBS ON condition compared with DBS OFF. Stimulation of the STN may excite thalamocortical or brainstem targets to sufficiently overcome the bradykinesia/hypokinesia associated with PD and return some pharyngeal stage motor patterns to performance levels approximating those of normal"" deglutition. However, the degree of hyoid bone excursion and oral stage measures did not improve, suggesting that these motor acts may be under the control of different sensorimotor pathways within the basal ganglia.

3216,"Preoperative Chemoradiotherapy for Rectal Cancer in Patients Aged 75 Years and Older: Acute Toxicity, Compliance with Treatment, and Early Results. PURPOSE: Treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer (T3-T4 or N+) is based on short-course radiotherapy (RT) or chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by surgery. It is estimated that 30-40 % of rectal cancer occurs in patients aged 75 years or more. Data on adherence to neoadjuvant CRT and its safety remain poor owing to the under-representation of older patients in randomized clinical trials and the discordance in the results from retrospective studies. The aim of this study was to assess adherence with preoperative CRT and tolerability in older patients with a stage II/III unresectable rectal cancer., METHODS: Patients aged 75 years or more with stage II/III rectal cancer treated with preoperative CRT at the University Hospital of Besancon from 1993 to 2011 were included. Feasibility, toxicities, overall survival, and local recurrence rates were studied., RESULTS: Fifty-six patients with a Charlson score from 2 to 6 were included. The mean age was 78 years. The compliance rates for RT and chemotherapy were 91 and 41.1 %, respectively. Two patients stopped CRT; one for hemostatic surgery, and one for severe sepsis. For CRT, the rate of grade >=3 toxicity was 14.29 %, mainly the digestive type. Fifty-two patients underwent tumor resection, including 76.79 % total mesorectal excision resection with 84.6 % complete resection, and a rate of postoperative complications of 39.6 %. At 2 years, the overall survival and local recurrences rates were 87.3 and 7.8 %, respectively., CONCLUSION: In older patients, selected preoperative CRT, with an adapted chemotherapy dose, is well tolerated. The main toxicity was gastrointestinal. Adherence to RT is comparable to that of younger patients.",Excluded
3286,"Comparison of muscle area and strength between OA knees with and without structural progression - Data from the OA initiative. Purpose: Quadriceps strength was observed to protect against the onset of symptomatic knee OA, but whether it protects against structural progression of knee OA once it is established radiographically, is currently unclear. The objectives of this study were to determine whether baseline or two-year changes in anatomical muscle cross sectional areas (ACSAs) of the quadriceps (heads), hamstrings, and adductors, and/or muscle strength of the extensor and flexors differ between OA knees with structural progression (cartilage loss in MRI and joint space width loss in X-rays) compared with OA knees without structural progression. Method(s): A subcohort of the OA Initiative was used, for which baseline and one-year follow up (FU) quantitative MRI analysis on cartilage thickness was available in one knee (n=719). Of these, n=561 also had quantitative measurement of radiographic joint space width (JSW) at baseline and at one year follow-up, and central X-ray readings from fixed flexion radiographs (public-use data sets 0.E.1/3.E.1). From these, we identified those with structural progression in the medial femorotibial compartment according to both MRI and radiographic JSW, using the smallest detectable change method (n=46). Of those, we included 41 with KLG2 or 3, of which n=23 had axial T1-weighted SE images of the thigh at baseline and 2 year follow-up as well as muscle strength measurement (Isometric chair, Metitur Oy, Jyvaskyla, Finland). For 20 of these we were able to match controls with no progression in either MRI or JSW, with the same sex and KLG, with a body height within 3cm and a BMI within 5kg/m2, and with a WOMAC pain score within 5 (of 20) units. Public use MRI data (T1-weighted spin echo sequence/0.E.1/3.E.1) and custom software were used to determine the ACSAs and signal intensities of the quadriceps, hamstrings, and adductors in an axial image located at 33% of the femoral length (distal to proximal; location estimated based on body height). The four quadriceps heads were analyzed in an axial image slice located at 30% femoral length. Baseline and follow-up data were analyzed independently. A paired t-test was used to compare measurements in progressors vs. nonprogressors. Result(s): Cases with MRI and X-ray progression (age 63.1+/-7.8 y) and controls without progression (age 65.8+/-10.0 y) consisted of 12 women and 8 men, respectively. Progressors did not show significantly smaller baseline total quadriceps, specific quadriceps heads, flexor, or adductor ACSAs, or significantly smaller extensor and flexor strength than matched controls (Table 1). (Table presented) Further, no differences in the mean or SD signal intensity in any of the muscle regions were noted at baseline (data not shown). Changes in ACSAs over 2 years also did not significantly differ between progressor and non-progressor knees (Table 1). When stratifying comparisons for cases with little baseline pain (WOMAC score of 0-1; n=7) vs. those with a score of 5-8 (n=8), the findings were similar (data not shown). Conclusion(s): Progressor (case) and non-progressor (control) knees in this study were carefully selected from a large subsample, based on two independent measures of structural OA progression (MRI cartilage loss and JSW reduction in X-rays). Further, cases and controls were carefully matched for measures known to be associated with progression or with muscle area. The results of this exploratory study do not provide support that, once radiographic knee OA is established, baseline or longitudinal changes in thigh muscle ACSAs or strength predict (or are associated) with structural progression.",Excluded
721,"Apoptosis, ageing and cancer susceptibility. We have previously shown that peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from individuals carrying a germline TP53 mutation show a dramatically reduced apoptotic response to radiation. As part of a study of this phenomenon, we also investigated apoptotic response in a series of breast cancer patients lacking TP53 mutations and in a control group of individuals without cancer. There was a significant reduction in mean apoptotic response with increasing age in all groups. These findings are consistent with a number of studies in rodents, which have demonstrated a reduction in DNA damage-induced apoptosis with increasing age. In addition, after adjusting for age, breast cancer patients showed significantly reduced apoptotic responses compared with normal controls (P=0.002). The odds ratio for breast cancer in women with an apoptotic response of <35%, compared with women with a response of >49%, was 6.42 (95% CI 1.68-24.6). The data further support the hypothesis that a reduction in apoptotic response to DNA damage with increasing age may play a significant role in the age-related increase in cancer.",Excluded

Nine patients with tumour stage mycosis fungoides (MF) have been entered into a pilot study of T-cell depletion and autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT). Eight patients had detectable rearrangements of the T-cell receptor (TCR) gamma-gene demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) in the peripheral blood. The median age was 47 years and the median duration of disease before SCT was 61 months; Peripheral blood progenitor cells were mobilized using high-dose etoposide (1.6 g/m2) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). The apheresis products underwent rigorous T-cell depletion with immunomagnetic methods. Double CD34-positive and CD4/CD8-negative selection achieved a median reduction of 3.89 log of T cells. All nine patients have been transplanted. Conditioning included carmustine (BCNU), etoposide and melphalan (BEM) in seven patients and total body irradiation plus etoposide or melphalan in two. Eight patients engrafted promptly and one patient died of septicaemia. All survivors entered complete remission. Seven patients have relapsed at a median of 7 months (2-14) post SCT. However, most patients have relapsed into a less aggressive stage, which has responded to conventional therapy. Four out of seven evaluable patients had detectable TCR rearrangements in the T-cell depleted graft. A T-cell clone was also detected in the peripheral blood before relapse in four cases. Autologous SCT is feasible, safe and can result in complete remission in a significant proportion of patients with tumour stage mycosis fungoides. Despite a short relapse-free survival, most patients achieved good disease control at the time of relapse.",Excluded
3385,"Primary adenocarcinoma of the anus: A retrospective analysis. Purpose: To report the clinical features and outcome of patients with primary adenocarcinoma of the anus following radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. Methods and Materials: A retrospective analysis was performed on 15 patients referred to Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute between 1981 to 1998 with primary adenocarcinoma of the anus. The median follow-up was 7.5 years. Six patients underwent treatment with curative intent - either chemoradiation or radiotherapy alone. Surgery was mainly limited to either incisional or excisional biopsy. The remaining nine patients were treated with palliative intent because of advanced age, advanced disease, or poor medical status. The biological equivalent doses were calculated for all patients and correlated with time to progression. Result(s): None of the curative group had relapsed after a median follow-up of 6.6 years. All except one were alive and well. No patient developed any serious long-term toxicity and all patients avoided colostomy. All patients managed with palliative intent died with persistent locoregional disease with a median survival of 0.8 year. Conclusion(s): Primary adenocarcinoma of the anus is a very rare disease that precludes a rigorous analysis. This study demonstrates that radiation and in particular chemoradiation are effective therapies consistent with other recent series and analogous to squamous cell carcinomas of the anus. It also emphasizes the poor prognosis of patients treated with palliative intent.",Excluded

In the liver, an area of low attenuation corresponding to the radiation port (or an area of hyperattenuation if the underlying liver tissue shows fatty change) can be seen at computed tomography (CT) performed within 3-6 months after therapy. Later, the liver may be fibrotic and contracted. In the stomach, small intestine, and colon, wall thickening and edema are early manifestations. Ulcers may also be observed. Long-term complications include strictures and fistulas. After irradiation of the kidneys, altered attenuation of the renal parenchyma may be seen at CT. Ureteral strictures, typically involving the distal ureter, may be observed after pelvic irradiation. The bladder may be small and contracted with a thickened wall after radiation exposure. Fistulas between the bladder and other pelvic organs sometimes occur. Typical musculoskeletal changes include growth abnormalities in skeletally immature patients, fatty replacement of bone marrow, and radiation osteitis.

1508,"Treatment outcomes of radiotherapy for tonsillar carcinoma in the era of intensity-modulated radiotherapy. Background: We performed this study to analyze treatment outcomes and to evaluate prognostic factors in patients with tonsillar carcinoma who were treated with radiotherapy (RT). Material(s) and Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed 164 patients with tonsillar carcinoma treated with RT between January 1979 and September 2009. Of the 164 patients, 91 were treated with 2-dimensional RT (2D-RT), 46 were treated with 3-dimensional conformal RT (3D-CRT), and 27 were treated with intensity-modulated RT (IMRT). When patients were treated with IMRT, simultaneous integrated boost was used. Thirty patients were treated with RT alone, 40 patients were treated with chemotherapy and RT (CRT), 66 patients were treated with surgery and RT and/or chemotherapy (SRT), and 28 patients were treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). Bilateral neck irradiation was delivered to 141 patients, and ipsilateral neck irradiation to 23 patients. In definitive RT, median dose was 70 Gy (range, 51-71), 70 Gy (54-74), and 67.5 Gy for 2D-RT, 3D-CRT, and IMRT, respectively. In postoperative RT, median dose was 64.8 Gy (range, 54-70.2), 66 Gy (54-70), and 63 Gy (60-67.5) for 2D-RT, 3D-CRT, and IMRT, respectively. Acute and late toxicity were graded according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group radiation morbidity scoring criteria. Result(s): The median follow-up time was 42 months (range, 2-288). The 5-year locoregional progression-free survival (LRPFS), distant metastasisfree survival (DMFS), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) rates were 86%, 94%, 82%, and 80%, respectively. In the univariate analysis, 5-year DFS rate was associated with the RT technique (2DRT, 77%; 3D-CRT, 82%; IMRT, 100%, p = 0.035), T stage (T1-2, 87%; T3-4, 74%, p = 0.036), and treatment modality (RT alone, 55%; CRT, 78%; SRT, 92%; CCRT, 92%, p < 0.0001). In the multivariate analysis, advanced T stage and treatment modality were statistically significant prognostic factors in DFS rate. None of the patients who were treated with ipsilateral neck irradiation experienced relapse in contralateral neck nodes. After the completion of RT, patients who were treated with 2D-RT, 3D-CRT, IMRT, ipsilateral neck irradiation, and bilateral neck irradiation experienced grade >=2 xerostomia 91%, 58%, 59%, 35%, and 78%, respectively. At least 6 months of follow-up, patients who were treated with 2D-RT, 3D-CRT, IMRT, ipsilateral neck irradiation, and bilateral neck irradiation experienced grade <=1 xerostomia 52%, 76%, 78%, 98%, and 63%, respectively. Conclusion(s): In selected patients with well lateralized tonsillar carcinoma, ipsilateral neck irradiation can be an alternative to bilateral neck irradiation, regarding DFS rate and complications. There was no failure when patients were treated with IMRT, but long-term follow-up is needed to evaluate the 72.0 Gy in 42 fractions/6 weeks). The primary endpoint was the treatment completion rate of patients who completed >= 70% of the cetuximab planned dose administration (in terms of the relative dose intensity of cetuximab) and the full dose of radiotherapy >= 2 weeks over the planned schedule (in terms of radiotherapy duration >=8 weeks). Result(s): From Mar 2009 until Jan 2010, 27 pts were screened. Of them, 22 pts were enrolled and treated (ITT population). Patients characteristics of ITT population: median age (years), 67.0 (range, 53 to 81); male/female, 21/1 pts; oropharynx/hypopharynx/larynx, 6/8/8 pts; stage III/IV, 12/10 pts. The median duration of cetuximab treatment was 7.9 weeks (range, 7 to 9), and that of RT was 44.0 days (range, 40 to 52). All 22 pts completed the treatment, and the completion rate was 100% (95% CI: 84.6%, 100.0%). The response rate (CR+PR) post RT was 81.8% (assessed by the independent committee). All pts experienced AEs. Most common AEs with grade 3/4 were mucosal inflammation (16pts, 72.7%), dermatitis (6pts, 27.3%), infection, radiation skin injury and stomatitis (each in 5 pts, 22.7%). Conclusion(s): The completion rate (100%) and the response rate (81.8%) are comparable to those of the cetuximab + RT group in the multinational randomized phase III study (Bonner et al. 2006). AEs were consistent with the underlying disease, administration of RT or cetuximab.

2452,"The use of spectrophotometry to estimate melanin density in Caucasians. The density of cutaneous melanin may be the property of the skin that protects it from damage by solar radiation, but there is not an accepted, noninvasive method of measuring it. To determine whether the density of cutaneous melanin can be estimated from reflectance of visible light by the skin, reflectance of 15-nm wavebands of light by the skin of the inner upper arm of each of 82 volunteers was measured at 20-nm intervals with a Minolta 508 spectrophotometer. A 3-mm skin biopsy was then taken from the same site, and four nonserial sections of it were stained with Masson Fontana for melanin. The melanin content of the basal area was calculated using the NIH Image analysis system. We show that cutaneous melanin in Caucasians can be estimated by the difference between two measurements of reflectance of visible light by the skin: those at wavelengths 400 and 420 nm. This new spectrophotometric measurement was more highly correlated (r = 0.68) with the histological measurements of cutaneous melanin than was skin reflectance of light of wavelength 680 nm (r = 0.33). Reflectances in the range of 650-700 nm have been used previously in skin cancer research. This relatively accurate measurement of melanin is quick and noninvasive and can be readily used in the field. It should provide improved discrimination of individual susceptibility to epidermal tumors in Caucasians and information about melanin's biological role in the causation of skin cancer.",Excluded

Objective: An analysis is made of the etiologic factors underlying actinic cheilitis and of the results obtained following surgical treatment of the disease in a series of 54 patients (32 males and 22 females). Study design: The case history was evaluated, along with the triggering factors, histopathological pattern and recurrence of lesions. A cold scalpel vermilionectomy was performed in 41 patients, followed by primary closure of the defect using an oral mucosal flap. The remaining 13 patients were subjected to carbon dioxide laser vermilion ablation. Result(s): The history of the patients revealed liver disease associated to alcohol consumption in 35.2% of cases and tobacco smoking in 77.8%. As regards solar exposure, 53.1% of the men referred open-air professional activities, while 100% of the women presented important solar exposure. The most frequent clinical manifestations were bleeding and the presence of leukoplakia patches; pain was reported in only 16% of cases. Over 40% of the patients were asymptomatic. Following treatment, and after a follow-up period of at least 6 months, 90.7% of the subjects showed complete healing. Of the 5 patients reoperated upon, four healed and one evolved towards squamous cell carcinoma. Conclusion(s): Vermilionectomy is the recommended treatment for actinic cheilitis, using either a cold scalpel or carbon dioxide laser. A histological study of the lesion is indicated in all cases to secure early detection of possible malignization. The control of the possible etiologic factors is also essential.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: To examine biochemical control, survival, and late morbidity with definitive low-dose-rate brachytherapy (LDR-BT) for patients with prostate cancer surviving for >10 years after treatment., PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified 757 men with localised prostate cancer who underwent definitive LDR-BT in the period 1990-2006 and were followed for >10 years at our institution. Biochemical failure-free survival (BFFS), distant metastases-free survival (DMFS), prostate cancer-specific survival (PCSS), and overall survival (OS) were selected as study endpoints. Survival was examined using the log-rank test, Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox regression modelling. Urinary, quality of life (QoL), and potency scores at baseline and last follow-up were recorded., RESULTS: The median follow-up was 12.5 years (range, 10.1-21.8 years). At the time of analysis, 88.6% of patients were alive, 1.5% died from prostate cancer and 13.9% developed biochemical failure, with 82% of failures occurring in the first decade of follow-up. Overall, 2.3% developed distant metastases. On multivariate analyses, stage T3a-T3b, prostate-specific antigen level of >20 ng/mL, intermediate- and high-risk disease predicted worse BFFS; whereas age >70 years at diagnosis and stage T3a-T3b predicted worse OS. A total biologically effective dose of >=150 Gy and androgen-deprivation therapy were associated with improved BFFS, but not OS. The overall 17-year rates for BFFS, DMFS, PCSS, and OS were 79, 97, 97, and 72%, respectively. Respective 17-year BFFS rates for low-, intermediate- and high-risk patients were 86, 80, and 65% (P < 0.001), whereas OS rates for the same groups were 82, 73, and 60%, respectively (P = 0.09). Amongst those patients who were potent at baseline, 25% remained potent at the last follow-up. Urinary function and QoL were mainly unaffected., CONCLUSIONS: LDR-BT yields excellent survival rates, with a 17-year PCSS rate of 97%. In all, 18% of patients with biochemical relapse failed at >10 years after implantation, which justifies their continued follow-up.

The expression levels of RAD50 (0,+1,+2,+3) were 27.7%, 32.3%, 21.5%, and 18.5%. LIG4 (+/-) were 43.1% and 56.9% respectively. The 5-year OS rate of patients with LIG4 (+/-) were 90% and 67.9%, respectively (p=0.035). The 5-year TTP rate of patients with LIG4 (+/-) were 75.9%, 55.5%, respectively (P=0.039)., CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the possibility of predicting the radiosensitivity of NP cancer by performing immunohistochemical analysis of LIG4.",Excluded
2670,"Racial disparities in receipt of standard chemoradiation in anal squamous cell carcinoma, an analysis of the National Cancer Database. Background: Standard treatment for locally advanced anal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) consists of concurrent chemoradiation. We evaluated whether racial differences exist in the receipt of standard treatment and its association with survival. Method(s): From the National Cancer Database, we identified patients diagnosed with anal SCC (Stages 2-3) between 2004 and 2015. Using logistic regression, we evaluated racial differences in the probability of receiving standard chemoradiation. We used Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate associations between race, receipt of standard therapy and survival. Result(s): Our analysis included 19,835 patients. Patients receiving standard chemoradiation had better survival than patients receiving nonstandard therapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.61-0.68; p < 0.001). Compared to White patients, Black patients were less likely to receive standard therapy (odds ratio [OR] 0.85; 95% CI 0.76-0.96; p < 0.008). We observed no statistical difference in mortality between Black and White patients overall (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.97-1.15; p = 0.24). However, for the subgroup of patients receiving nonstandard therapy, Black patients had an increased mortality risk compared to White patients (HR 1.17, CI 1.01-1.35; p = 0.034). We observed no survival differences in the subgroup of patients receiving standard treatment (HR 1.00, CI 0.90-1.11, p = 0.99). Conclusion(s): Standard treatment in anal SCC is associated with better survival, but Black patients are less likely to receive standard treatment than White patients. Although Black patients had higher mortality than White patients in the subgroup of patients receiving nonstandard therapy, this difference was ameliorated in the subset receiving standard therapy.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

645,"Safety, biodistribution, and radiation dosimetry of68Ga-OPS202 in patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors: A prospective phase I imaging study. Preclinical and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that radiolabeled somatostatin (sst) receptor antagonists perform better than agonists in detecting neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). We performed a prospective phase I/II study to evaluate the sst receptor antagonist68Ga-OPS202 (68Ga-NODAGA-JR11; NODAGA 5 1,4,7-triazacyclononane, 1-glutaric acid-4,7-acetic acid and JR11 5 Cpa-c(DCys-Aph(Hor)-DAph(Cbm)-Lys-Thr-Cys)-DTyr-NH2)) for PET imaging. Here, we report the results of phase I of the study. Method(s): Patients received 2 single 150-MBq intravenous injections of68Ga-OPS202 3-4 wk apart (15 mg of peptide at visit 1 and 50 mg at visit 2). At visit 1, a dynamic PET/CT scan over the kidney was obtained during the first 30 min after injection, and static whole-body scans were obtained at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h after injection; at visit 2, a static whole-body scan was obtained at 1 h. Blood samples and urine were collected at regular intervals to determine68Ga-OPS202 pharmacokinetics. Safety, biodistribution, radiation dosimetry, and the most appropriate imaging time point for68Ga-OPS202 were assessed. Result(s): Twelve patients with well-differentiated gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) NETs took part in the study.68Ga-OPS202 cleared rapidly from the blood, with a mean residence time of 2.4 6 1.1 min/L. The organs with the highest mean dose coefficients were the urinary bladder wall, kidneys, and spleen. The calculated effective dose was 2.4E2 02 6 0.2E202 mSv/MBq, corresponding to 3.6 mSv, for a reference activity of 150 MBq. Based on total numbers of detected malignant lesions, the optimal time window for the scan was between 1 and 2 h. For malignant liver lesions, the time point at which most patients had the highest mean tumor contrast was 1 h.68Ga-OPS202 was well tolerated; adverse events were grade 1 or 2, and there were no signals of concern from laboratory blood or urinalysis tests. Conclusion(s):68Ga-OPS202 showed favorable biodistribution and imaging properties, with optimal tumor contrast between 1 and 2 h after injection. Dosimetry analysis revealed that the dose delivered by68Ga-OPS202 to organs is similar to that delivered by other68Ga-labeled sst analogs. Further evaluation of68Ga-OPS202 for PET/CT imaging of NETs is therefore warranted.Copyright COPYRIGHT © 2018 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging.",Excluded
3517,"Sonographic evaluation of anterior inferior iliac spine morphology demonstrates excellent accuracy when compared to false profile view. PURPOSE: To compare ultrasound examination to false profile radiographs in identification and classification of AIIS morphology. The study hypothesis stated that sonographic imaging of the AIIS correlates well to AIIS morphology seen on false profile radiographs. METHOD(S): Fifty-three hips in 30 consecutive patients met the inclusion criteria. A single, fellowship trained, orthopedic surgeon performed an ultrasound on all of the patients to evaluate the AIIS morphology. The patients underwent standing false profile radiographs. The US and radiographic images were independently reviewed and classified according to Hetsroni classification of AIIS morphology by two senior, fellowship trained, orthopedic surgeons. Agreement between the two raters was calculated for each imaging modality (inter-rater agreement) as well as the agreement between the rating in each modality by the same rater (""inter-method"" agreement). RESULT(S): The agreement between the raters (inter-rater agreement) for morphologic evaluation of the AIIS by means of FP view was 88.8% (p<0.001) and that by means of US was 81.5%(p<0.001). The overall accuracy of the US compared to the FP view was 92.3% (48/52) for both rater 1 and 2. CONCLUSION(S): This study showed near-perfect agreement in analyzing the morphology of the AIIS in a group of patients with hip pathology. Office sonographic evaluation of the AIIS is reliable and, therefore, may be routinely utilized in the clinic setting avoiding unnecessary radiation exposure to the patient.Level II.",Excluded
1419,"Assessment of pulmonary 18F-FDG-PET uptake and cytokine profiles in non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with radiotherapy and erlotinib. Purpose To investigate effects of radiotherapy (RT) and erlotinib on pulmonary glucose uptake using 2-deoxy-2-(18F)fluoro-D-glucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) during and after treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to identify associations between serum cytokine levels and lung glucose uptake. Material and methods Twenty-seven patients with advanced NSCLC, receiving RT alone or concomitant RT and erlotinib therapy, were examined by 18F-FDG PET before, during, and after treatment. A total of 57 18F-FDG PET scans were analyzed. Pulmonary 18F-FDG uptake and radiotherapy dose mapping were used to acquire dose-response curves for each patient, where subsequent linear regression gave a glucose uptake level in the un-irradiated parts of the lungs (SUV0) and a response slope (DELTASUV). Serum cytokine levels at corresponding time points were assessed using a multiplex bioassay. Correlations between the most robust cytokines and lung 18F-FDG dose response parameters were further investigated. Results From the dose response analysis, SUV0 at post-therapy was significantly higher (P < 0.001) than at mid- and pre-therapy (45% and 58%, respectively) for the group receiving RT + erlotinib. Also, SUV0 at post-therapy was higher for patients receiving RT + erlotinib compared to RT alone (42%; P < 0.001). No differences in DELTASUV were seen with treatments or time. SUV0 was positively associated (r = 0.47, P = 0.01) with serum levels of the chemokine C-C motif ligand 21 (CCL21) for patients receiving RT + erlotinib. Conclusions Concomitant RT and erlotinib causes an elevation in pulmonary 18F-FDG uptake post treatment compared to RT alone. Pulmonary glucose uptake is associated with an upregulation of a chemokine (CCL21) involved in inflammatory reactions.Copyright © 2017 The Authors",Excluded
669,"Granulocytopoietic precursor cells and regulatory factors in irradiated human bone marrow. The effects of irradiation on committed granulopoietic progenitor cells (CFU-C) and granulopoietic humoral regulators were studied in 17 X-ray treated patients with carcinoma of the breast or of the prostate. After 45 or 70 Gy, the CFU-C decreased to 14 +/- 10% in irradiated areas. This remaining CFU-C population probably reflects a combination of radioresistance and survival in situ, and migration of CFU-C from protected marrow areas. The frequency of peripheral blood CFU-C did not change after irradiation. Endogenous colony stimulating activity (CSA), i.e., release of CSA within the marrow cell population, in post-irradiation bone marrow persisted on roughly the same level, indicating a fairly low radiosensitivity of the CSA-producing cells in the bone marrow. Colony stimulating activity in peripheral blood cells and serum remained unchanged, but there were great interindividual variations, and some of the patients with hypercellularity and CFU-C increase in nonirradiated marrow areas also had increased CSA. Serum lipoprotein inhibitors were higher in the post-treatment patients than in healthy control patients.",Excluded
3090,"Ocular surface squamous neoplasia (Squamous Cell Carcinoma) of the socket: Management of extensive tumors with interferon. PURPOSE:: To describe the clinical features and management of extensive ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN) (squamous cell carcinoma) of the socket. METHOD(S):: Retrospective interventional case series. Interferon alpha 2b (IFNa2b) eye drops (1 million units/cc) 4 times daily and IFNa2b sublesional injection (5 million units/0.5cc to 8 million units/0.8 cc) were delivered for tumor control. Participants were 3 patients with ocular prosthesis who developed extensive socket OSSN. Tumor control was graded as complete regression, partial regression, or no regression. RESULT(S):: OSSN was detected in the socket at age 60, 43, and 20 years in patients who had worn ophthalmic prostheses for 54, 26, and 13 years, respectively. The patients had chronic discharge and irritation (n = 3) managed with intermittent topical corticosteroids (n = 2). There were no predisposing factors of cigarette exposure, radiation exposure, eczema, systemic immune suppression, or organ transplantation. The prosthesis fit well with nonirritative edges. At presentation, OSSN was subtle (n = 3), vascular (n = 3), and multifocal (n = 3), with largest lesions or confluence of lesions measuring 20, 25, and 20 mm, respectively. The tumors involved the tarsal (n = 3), bulbar (n = 2), and forniceal (n = 2) surfaces. All patients were treated with topical and injection IFNa2b, with complete regression achieved in 2 cases (at 1 months and 20 months) and partial regression in one case (at 9 months). All patients continue on chronic maintenance IFNa2b topically. There were no recurrences, and IFNa2b injection side effects of nausea and chills were minor, lasting 1 day. No patient required surgical removal of tumors from the socket and no patient required exenteration. CONCLUSION(S):: Patients wearing ophthalmic prosthesis over a socket should be monitored for the development of OSSN. Combined topical and injection IFNa2b could represent a potentially effective therapy for this condition. © 2011 The American Society of Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Inc.",Excluded
2496,"Toxicities Following Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy Treatment of Locally-Recurrent and Previously Irradiated Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma. Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) with concomitant cetuximab is an effective treatment option for previously irradiated, locally recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Its local control and overall survival are similar to those of other available treatment options. Each retreatment depends heavily on the prior treatment and every patient is a special case. Based on the experience of our institution and previously published studies, for patients who receive concomitant cetuximab with a median prior radiation therapy dose of 70Gy, we recommend a total dose of 40-44Gy delivered in 5 fractions on alternating days over 1-2 weeks. However, Grade 2 or 3 toxicities are not uncommon. Therefore, in this review, we also report a pilot study that applies a normal tissue complication probability dose-response model to estimate the probability of toxicities in locally recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck reirradiated with SABR. Although this dose-response model includes concurrent targeted therapy and no comparable model yet exists for SABR without it, complication rates without concurrent biological therapy or chemotherapy should be no higher than those described here.

970,"Ultraviolet radiation enhances both the nodular and ulcerative forms of Mycobacterium ulcerans infection in a Crl:IAF (HA)-hrBR hairles guinea pig model of Buruli ulcer disease. Background: Ultraviolet radiation (UV) pre-exposure enhances intracellular mycobacterial infections, however, its effect upon the pathogenesis of the extracellular Mycobacterium ulcerans parasite had not been previously examined. The hypothesis tested was that UV pre-exposure enhances both the nodular and ulcerative forms of M. ulcerans infection in the Crl:IAF(HA)-hrBR hairless guinea pig. Method(s): Groups of five animals were exposed to total cumulative UV doses of 0 (control), 3 or 30kJ/m2 followed 3 days later by subcutaneous infection with 3 x 104 CFU of M. ulcerans in order to induce the nodular form of the disease. The resultant nodules were then measured for the next 22 days. The experiment was then repeated using intradermal infection with 2 x 106 CFU in order to induce the ulcerative form of the disease. The resultant ulcers were measured for the next 30 days. In both experiments, the animals were tested for delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactivity to Burulin-S as a marker of the onset of the reactive phase of the disease. Result(s): Following low inoculum subcutaneous infection, distinct, well-demarcated, subcutaneously situated skin nodules were present at infected skin sites between 7 and 22 days post-infection. Between days 14 and 21, the mean nodule diameters of the UV irradiated groups were significantly (P < 0.03) greater than that of the control group. UV pre-exposure resulted in significant (P < 0.035) suppression of DTH responses to Burulin-S challenge. High inoculum intradermal infection resulted in the development of ulcerative lesions. Between 10 and 30 days post-infection, the mean lesion diameters and mean ulcer development times of UV irradiated groups were significantly (P < 0.05) greater than those of the controls. However, UV irradiation did not affect DTH responses to Burulins in the high inoculum experiment. In both experiments, the lesions were histologically consistent with human Buruli ulcer disease. These results demonstrate that UV pre-exposure results in enhanced M. ulcerans infection in the hairless guinea pig model of Buruli ulcer disease and suggest that UV exposure may be a relevant factor in the pathogenesis of human forms of the disease.",Excluded
2180,"Comparison of simulator-CT versus simulator fluoroscopy versus surface marking based radiation treatment planning: a prospective study by three-dimensional evaluation. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Field placement for Radiation Treatment Planning can be done based on the surface markings or simulator fluoroscopy or simulator with CT facilities. A prospective study was carried out to compare these three techniques of radiation treatment planning to quantitatively find out the difference in normal tissue dosages and target volume coverage in the three groups after three-dimensional evaluation., PATIENTS AND METHODS: The CT scans of 30 patients in the treatment position, taken on a Shimadzu SCT-3000 TF scanner at 1cm intervals, were transferred to Theraplan-500 three-dimensional radiation treatment planning computer. The normal tissues and target volumes (GTV and CTV) were outlined on all the CT slices as per (ICRU) Report no. 50. Three types of radiation treatment planning was done sequentially: Plan I-based on the surface markings alone, Plan II-based on simulator-fluoroscopy, and Plan III-based on Simulator-CT., RESULTS: The mean dose to 95% of the clinical target volume (D95) was increased by 4.4 and 6.4% by Plans II and III as compared with Plan I. The mean dose to 3/3rd (D(3/3)) to all the critical organs was decreased by 6.6 and 8.4% by Plans II and III as compared to Plan I. The mean time, in simulator room, for field placement for Plans I-III was 6.2, 14.6 and 44 min, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Thus for adequate coverage of target volumes and sparing normal tissues, Simulator-CT based radiation treatment planning is the best method of radiation treatment planning though it is more time consuming.",Excluded
3673,"Third-generation dual-source CT of the neck using automated tube voltage adaptation in combination with advanced modeled iterative reconstruction: evaluation of image quality and radiation dose. Purpose: To evaluate image quality and radiation dose in third-generation dual-source computed tomography (DSCT) of the neck using automated tube voltage adaptation (TVA) with advanced modelled iterative reconstruction (ADMIRE) algorithm. Method(s): One hundred and sixteen patients were retrospectively evaluated. Group A (n = 59) was examined on second-generation DSCT with automated TVA and filtered back projection. Group B (n = 57) was examined on a third-generation DSCT with automated TVA and ADMIRE. Age, body diameter, attenuation of several anatomic structures, noise, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), radiation dose (CTDIvol) and size-specific dose estimates (SSDE) were assessed. Diagnostic acceptability was rated by three readers. Result(s): Age (p = 0.87) and body diameter (p = 0.075) did not differ significantly. Tube voltage in Group A was set automatically to 100 kV for all patients (n = 59), and to 70 kV (n = 2), 80 kV (n = 5), and 90 kV (n = 50) in Group B. Noise was reduced and CNR was increased significantly (p < 0.001). Diagnostic acceptability was rated high in both groups, with better ratings in Group B (p < 0.001). SSDE was reduced by 34 % in Group B (20.38 +/- 1.63 mGy vs. 13.04 +/- 1.50 mGy, p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Combination of automated TVA and ADMIRE in neck CT using third-generation DSCT results in a substantial radiation dose reduction with low noise and increased CNR. Key Points: * Third-generation DSCT provides automated tube voltage adaptation with an increment of 10 kV. * 10 kV increment optimizes scans to the patient's neck anatomy. * TVA combined with ADMIRE significantly lower radiation dose in contrast-enhanced neck CT. * TVA in combination with ADMIRE reduces noise and increases SNR and CNR. * Image analysis quoted less noise and better diagnostic acceptability in third-generation DSCT.Copyright © 2015, European Society of Radiology.",Excluded
139,"Inhomogeneity of pulmonary ventilation during sustained microgravity as determined by single-breath washouts. Gravity is known to cause inhomogeneity of ventilation. Nongravitational factors are also recognized, but their relative contribution is not understood. We therefore studied ventilatory inhomogeneity during sustained microgravity during the 9-day flight of Spacelab SLS-1. All seven crew members performed single-breath nitrogen washouts. They inspired a vital capacity breath of 100% oxygen with a bolus of argon at the start of inspiration, and the inspiratory and expiratory flow rates were controlled at 0.5 l/s. Control measurements in normal gravity (1 G) were made pre- and postflight in the standing and supine position. Compared with the standing 1-G measurements, there was a marked decrease in ventilatory inhomogeneity during microgravity, as evidenced by the significant reductions in cardiogenic oscillations, slope of phase III, and height of phase IV for nitrogen and argon. However, argon phase IV volume was not reduced, and considerable ventilatory inhomogeneity remained. For example, the heights of the cardiogenic oscillations during microgravity for nitrogen and argon were 44 and 24%, respectively, of their values at 1 G, whereas the slopes of phase III for nitrogen and argon were 78 and 29%, respectively, of those at 1 G. The presence of a phase IV in microgravity is strong evidence that airway closure still occurs in the absence of gravity. The results were qualitatively similar to those found previously during short periods of 0 G in parabolic flight.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: Predictors of survival and response to treatment in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) are ill-defined and unclear. In an attempt to assess the impact of common presenting symptoms and laboratory values on survival, we undertook this retrospective review of patients with SCLC. To our knowledge, there is no study on survival in SCLC patients from the Indian subcontinent. DESIGN: Retrospective Cohort study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All newly diagnosed small cell lung cancer cases from December 2001 through December 2004, were identified and clinical data on presenting symptoms and laboratory findings from their hospital records, noted. The influence of various pretreatment factors on survival was investigated using Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox multivariate regression model. RESULT(S): 76 subjects were included (84% males, 91% smokers). 57% patients had five or more symptoms at presentation. Cumulative symptom burden was strongly associated with survival ( P =0.02). Survival was also significantly related with Karnofsky performance status (KPS) ( P =0.04), disease extent (P =0.03) and symptomatic response to treatment ( P< 0.001). Patients with higher hemoglobin ( P =0.02), serum sodium ( P =0.04) and serum globulin ( P =0.02), survived significantly longer. By multivariate regression analysis, hemoglobin, KPS and brain metastases, were significant predictors of survival ( P =0.01, P =0.02, P< 0.01 respectively). CONCLUSION(S): Cumulative symptom burden, KPS, disease extent and symptomatic assessment of improvement after treatment, are useful predictors of survival. This has important clinical implications, keeping in view, the infrastructure and cost involved in more objective tests like CT scan, for evaluation of disease extent and prognosis. These findings can provide a simple basis for predicting prognosis in small cell lung cancer, especially in developing countries like ours.",Excluded

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate radiation exposure and image quality in matched patient cohorts for CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) acquired in single- and dual-energy mode using second- and third-generation dual-source CT (DSCT) systems., METHODS: We retrospectively included 200 patients (mean age, 65.5 years +/- 15.7 years) with suspected pulmonary embolism-equally divided into four study groups (n = 50) and matched by gender and body mass index. CTPA was performed with vendor-predefined second-generation (group A, 100-kV single-energy computed tomography (SECT); group B, 80/Sn140-kV dual-energy computed tomography (DECT)) or third-generation DSCT (group C, 100-kV SECT; group D, 90/Sn150-kV DECT) devices. Radiation metrics were assessed using a normalized scan range of 27.5 cm. For objective image quality evaluation, dose-independent figure-of-merit (FOM) contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were calculated. Subjective image analysis included ratings for overall image quality, reader confidence, and image artifacts using five-point Likert scales., RESULTS: Calculations of the effective dose (ED) of radiation for a normalized scan range of 27.5 cm showed nonsignificant differences between SECT and DECT acquisitions for each scanner generation (p >= 0.253). The mean effective radiation dose was lower for third-generation groups C (1.5 mSv +/- 0.8 mSv) and D (1.4 mSv +/- 0.7 mSv) compared to second-generation groups A (2.5 mSv +/- 0.9 mSv) and B (2.3 mSv +/- 0.6 mSv) (both p <= 0.013).

Qualitative image parameters of overall image quality, reader confidence, and image artifacts showed nonsignificant differences among the four groups (p >= 0.162)., CONCLUSIONS: Third-generation DSCT systems show lower radiation dose parameters for CTPA compared to second-generation DSCT. DECT can be performed with both scanner generations without radiation dose penalty or detrimental effects on image quality compared to SECT., KEY POINTS: * Radiation exposure showed nonsignificant differences between SECT and DECT for both DSCT scanner devices. * Dual-energy CTPA provides equivalent image quality compared to standard image acquisition. * Subjective image quality assessment was similar among the four study groups.",Excluded
850,"High-tech facelift. Recent technological advances in our specialty have made us reappraise the way we approach facial rejuvenation. Some of these technological interfaces have made it possible, in the author's experience, to improve results and to tackle difficult aesthetic problems. The purpose of this paper is to report how we combine these technological advances in an effort to improve the aesthetic outcomes. These technological advances are: laser skin resurfacing, endoscopy, newer fat grafting procedures, and new alloplastic materials for bone augmentation. Other technological advances are consultations via the Internet, computer imaging for simulation of possible outcomes, etc. Endoscopy is routinely used in our facial rejuvenative procedures, almost always for the forehead, often for the midface and less often for the neck. Fat grafting procedures using newly adapted concepts are used for the brow, glabella, tear trough deformity, cheeks, lips, chin, nasolabial folds, marionette lines, and other areas of soft tissue depressions apparent before or after the lifting procedures. This has allowed us to restore the tridimensional volume and treat the soft tissue atrophy. Patients with significant skeletal soft tissue disproportion due to aging, loss of dentition, prior trauma or congenital defects may receive one or more of the following implants: glabella, cheek, piriformis, angle of the mandible, mandibular body glove type of implant, prejawl implant, chin overlay or a glove type of implant. Our preference is for a porous polyethylene material because of its tissue ingrowth inductiveness. Individuals who have damaged skin due to solar exposure, aging, smoking, etc., may receive Ultrapulse CO2 laser resurfacing at the same operative setting (more often) or in a delayed fashion. The Versapulse laser is also needed for the treatment of some skin changes secondary to aging such as telangiectasias (Variable Pulse Green) and brown spots (Q-Switch 532). The high-tech facelift has allowed us to treat the severely damaged skin, fat atrophy, bone atrophy in many patients, at the same time that the lifting procedure is performed. This provides a more comprehensive approach to facial rejuvenation. The combination of different techniques and technologies maximizes the effectiveness and minimizes the potential side effects of each one. Scars in the forehead and scalp are avoided. Incision and fat removal in the lower eyelid are often unnecessary. It provides a more precise vertical lifting with correction of the tear trough deformity and gives a tridimensional restoration of the facial volume. The facial disharmony is treated at every level starting from the facial skeletal support to the most external envelope (skin). Over 200 patients have been treated this way with a minimal rate of complications. The high-tech facial rejuvenation has allowed us to improve the surgical results of our patients compared with previous isolated techniques. The combination of each one of the techniques require a precise understanding of the limits and benefits of each. Case examples of the different combinations will be shown.",Excluded
54,"Schizophrenic patients are impaired in memory reinstatement underlying mismatch negativity system. OBJECTIVE: We modified the paradigm used in the report of Cowan et al. [J Exp Psychol Learn Mem Cogn 19 (1993) 909] to investigate how the silent intervals influence the memory trace underlying mismatch negativity (MMN) generation in schizophrenic patients., METHODS: Experiment 1 was designed to explore how long an inter-train interval would be needed for the memory to become dormant. Experiment 2 was designed to elucidate how many standard stimuli would be needed to reinstate the memory., RESULTS: In Experiment 1, schizophrenic patients showed a significant reduction in MMN amplitude after the longer inter-train intervals compared to the shorter ones, although little difference was observed in controls. Specifically, the memory trace underlying the MMN system in the schizophrenic patients easily became dormant after the extended silent intervals. In Experiment 2, we could not conclude that schizophrenic patients needed more reminders than did controls in order to reinstate the memory once the memory trace became dormant. The patients might be little impaired with respect to forming the memory trace., CONCLUSIONS: In schizophrenic patients, the memory trace in MMN generation might easily become out of context after silent intervals. Patients could not effectively reinstate the memory that was put out of context by the extended silent interval., SIGNIFICANCE: This article provides some suggestions in terms of patients' difficulty encoding episodes and retrieving them within distinct contexts in preconscious processes.",Excluded
1058,"Effects of Probiotics with or without Honey on Radiation-induced Diarrhea. Background: Diarrhea is a well-recognized side effect associated with pelvic radiation; however, there is not any effective common treatment for radiation-induced diarrhea. A popular alternative is probiotics, which have been used in several gastrointestinal disorders. Probiotics are live microbial food supplements. Furthermore, honey is a putative nutritional with a variety of health effects, including antibacterial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and prebiotic. The present study evaluated the effects of probiotic with or without honey on radiation-induced diarrhea. Material(s) and Method(s): Sixty-seven adult patients with pelvic cancer underwent radiotherapy for four weeks. They randomized to receive probiotic (n = 22), probiotic plus honey (n = 21) or placebo (n = 24) from one week before radiotherapy for five weeks. Diarrhea grade and stool consistency score were recorded weekly according to the Common Toxicity Criteria system and the Bristol scales, respectively. Result(s): The results showed a decrease in the daily number of bowel movements (p = 0.003 and 0.006), diarrhea grade (p = 0.001 and 0.001) and the need for antidiarrheal medication (p = 0.021 and 0.041) also an increase in the stool consistency (p = 0.004 and 0.005) in patients who either used probiotic or probiotic plus honey (respectively), these were significant in weeks 4 and 5 of treatment.

Purpose: To evaluate the value of skull-base abnormality on MRI for predicting local recurrence in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Material(s) and Method(s): Between November 1988 and February 1997, 48 patients with NPC were examined with both MRI (1.5 T) and CT prior to radiation therapy. T classification (1987 UICC) based on physical examination and CT findings were T1 in 3 cases, T2 in 22, T3 in 9, and T4 in 14. On MRI, low-intensity tissue with Gd enhancement in the marrow of the skull was considered to be a suspicious finding of skull-base invasion. CT simulation was performed in all patients. The total dose to the primary tumor was 60-75 Gy (mean, 67 Gy). The mean follow-up period was 42 months. Result(s): All 14 T4 patients had abnormal tissue in the marrow of the skull base on MRI. Thirty-eight percent (13 of 34) of T1-3 patients were suspected to have skull-base invasion based on MRI (0% for T1, 27% [6 of 22] for T2, and 78% [7 of 9] for T3). The 5-year local control rate was significantly different between T1-3 and T4 tumors (97% vs. 69%, p < 0.025) but was not different by the presence of the MRI abnormality in the skull base. Conclusion(s): Skull-base invasion suspected solely by MRI does not relate to local recurrence provided that careful treatment planning is performed with the aid of MRI and CT simulator.

114,"Postoperative chemoradiotherapy for high-risk head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma. PURPOSE: To describe the use of postoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy, with either weekly cisplatin or carboplatin, for high-risk head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) in a single institutional setting., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between July 1999 and January 2003, 47 patients were treated with postoperative chemoradiotherapy., RESULTS: Of the 47 patients, 41 (87%) had Stage III-IV disease. The predominant primary site was the oral cavity in 24 patients (51%), 27 had nodal disease with extracapsular extension, and 26 had positive or close mucosal margins (<5 mm). Ten patients had undergone resection of recurrent disease after previous surgery. Twenty-seven (57%) were treated with cisplatin, and the remaining patients received carboplatin because of contraindications to cisplatin. The median radiotherapy dose was 60 Gy (range, 50-66 Gy). Of the 47 patients, 45 (96%) completed at least four of the six planned doses of chemotherapy and 45 (96%) completed the planned course of radiotherapy. Nineteen patients (40%) had confluent mucositis, eight (17%) had Grade 3-4 hematologic toxicity, and four (9%) had febrile neutropenia. No treatment-related deaths occurred. The estimated 2-year locoregional control, progression-free survival, and overall survival rate was 73%, 56%, and 62%, respectively. Excluding the 10 patients with recurrence after previous surgery, the locoregional control, progression-free survival, and overall survival rate was 81%, 64%, and 71%, respectively. Five cases of Grade 3-4 late treatment-related sequelae developed., CONCLUSION: Treatment with postoperative concurrent weekly cisplatin or carboplatin and radiotherapy was reasonably well tolerated. Acute and late toxicity was acceptable. The overall results achieved are comparable with the preliminary results of recent randomized trials. Patients treated after resection of recurrent disease (after previous surgery alone) fared worse than those treated at the initial resection.",Excluded
1420,"PET quantification of brain O-GlcNAcase with [18F]LSN3316612 in healthy human volunteers. Background: Previous studies found that [18F]LSN3316612 was a promising positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand for imaging O-GlcNAcase in nonhuman primates and human volunteers. This study sought to further evaluate the suitability of [18F]LSN3316612 for human clinical research. Method(s): Kinetic evaluation of [18F]LSN3316612 was conducted in a combined set of baseline brain scans from 17 healthy human volunteers and test-retest imaging was conducted in 10 of these volunteers; another 6 volunteers had whole-body scans to measure radiation exposure to body organs. Total distribution volume (VT) estimates were compared for the one- and two-tissue compartment models with the arterial input function. Test-retest variability and reliability were evaluated via mean difference and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The time stability of VT was assessed down to a 30-min scan time. An alternative quantification method for [18F]LSN3316612 binding without blood was also investigated to assess the possibility of eliminating arterial sampling. Result(s): Brain uptake was generally high and could be quantified as VT with excellent identifiability using the two-tissue compartment model. [18F]LSN3316612 exhibited good absolute test-retest variability (12.5%), but the arithmetic test-retest variability was far from 0 (11.3%), reflecting a near-uniform increase of VT on the retest scan in nine of 10 volunteers. VT values were stable after 110 min in all brain regions, suggesting that no radiometabolites accumulated in the brain. Measurements obtained using only brain activity (i.e., area under the curve (AUC) from 150-180 min) correlated strongly with regional VT values during test-retest conditions (R2 = 0.84), exhibiting similar reliability to VT (ICC = 0.68 vs. 0.64). Estimated radiation exposure for [18F]LSN3316612 PET was 20.5 +/- 2.1 muSv/MBq, comparable to other 18F-labeled radioligands for brain imaging. Conclusion(s): [18F]LSN3316612 is an excellent PET radioligand for imaging O-GlcNAcase in the human brain. Alternative quantification without blood is possible, at least for within-subject repeat studies. However, the unexplained increase of VT under retest conditions requires further investigation.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded
856,"3D deep learning angiography (3D-DLA) from C-arm Conebeam CT. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Deep learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that has demonstrated unprecedented performance in many medical imaging applications. Our purpose was to develop a deep learning angiography method to generate 3D cerebral angiograms from a single contrast-enhanced C-arm conebeam CT acquisition in order to reduce image artifacts and radiation dose. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A set of 105 3D rotational angiography examinations were randomly selected from an internal data base. All were acquired using a clinical system in conjunction with a standard injection protocol. More than 150 million labeled voxels from 35 subjects were used for training. A deep convolutional neural network was trained to classify each image voxel into 3 tissue types (vasculature, bone, and soft tissue). The trained deep learning angiography model was then applied for tissue classification into a validation cohort of 8 subjects and a final testing cohort of the remaining 62 subjects. The final vasculature tissue class was used to generate the 3D deep learning angiography images. To quantify the generalization error of the trained model, we calculated the accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and Dice similarity coefficients for vasculature classification in relevant anatomy. The 3D deep learning angiography and clinical 3D rotational angiography images were subjected to a qualitative assessment for the presence of intersweep motion artifacts. RESULT(S): Vasculature classification accuracy and 95% CI in the testing dataset were 98.7% (98.3%-99.1%). No residual signal from osseous structures was observed for any 3D deep learning angiography testing cases except for small regions in the otic capsule and nasal cavity compared with 37% (23/62) of the 3D rotational angiographies. CONCLUSION(S): Deep learning angiography accurately recreated the vascular anatomy of the 3D rotational angiography reconstructions without a mask. Deep learning angiography reduced misregistration artifacts induced by intersweep motion, and it reduced radiation exposure required to obtain clinically useful 3D rotational angiography.Copyright © 2018 American Society of Neuroradiology.

3179,"Value of intra-tumor heterogeneity evaluated by diffusion-weighted MRI for predicting pathological stages and therapeutic responses to chemoradiotherapy in lower rectal cancer. Aim: Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) has the potential to reveal intra-tumor structural heterogeneity consisting of stroma through an evaluation of uniformity on DWI. In present study, we examined the diagnostic value of intra-tumor heterogeneity evaluated by DWI in lower rectal cancer (LRC). Patients and Methods: A total of 172 LRC patients underwent radical surgery between 2009 and 2017. T1 tumors and cases without pre-operative MRI were excluded. Twenty-nine primary resection cases (PR) and 37 pre-operative chemoradiotherapy followed by radical surgery cases (pCRT) were targeted. Intra-tumor heterogeneity on DWI was quantified using a specific formula (HSD). Structural heterogeneity was objectively quantified by an image analysis of resected specimens using a digital microscope (HSP). The relationships between HSD and HSP, pathological factors, and tumor regression grades (TRG) of pCRT were evaluated. Result(s): The relationship between HSD and HSP was analyzed by a linear regression model in PR cases, revealing a positive correlation (R2=0.43). PR cases were divided into HSD-high and HSD-low according to the median. There were more pT3 or N(+) cases in HSD-high (p=0.038, 0.095). HSD before pCRT correlated with TRG (grade 1 versus 2/3) in pCRT cases (p=0.001). The diagnostic accuracy of HSD for predicting T and N stages and therapeutic grades was evaluated by cut-off values calculated using a ROC curve and revealed that each factor may be accurately diagnosed. Conclusion(s): Intra-tumor heterogeneity on DWI corresponded with stromal pathological heterogeneity. It is useful for predicting T3 or deeper tumor invasion, pathological N(+), and the therapeutic effects of pCRT.Copyright © The author(s).",Excluded
1703,"Significant correlations between human cortical bone mineral density and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) obtained with 3D Cones ultrashort echo time magnetic resonance imaging (UTE-MRI). PURPOSE: Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) MRI is a tool that can characterize changes in susceptibility, an intrinsic property which is associated with compositional changes in the tissue. Current QSM estimation of cortical bone is challenging because conventional clinical MRI cannot acquire signal in cortical bone. This study aimed to implement Cones 3D ultrashort echo time MRI (UTE-MRI) for ex vivo QSM measurements in human tibial cortical bone, investigating the correlations of QSM with volumetric intracortical bone mineral density (BMD)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine tibial midshaft cortical bone specimens (25mm long specimens cut at the mid-point of tibial shaft, 67+/-20years old, 5 women and 4 men) were scanned on a clinical 3T MRI scanner for QSM measurement. The specimens were also scanned on a high-resolution micro-computed tomography (muCT) scanner for volumetric BMD estimation. QSM and muCT results were compared at approximately nine regions of interest (ROIs) per specimen., RESULTS: Average 3D UTE-MRI QSM showed significantly strong correlation with volumetric BMD (R=-0.82, P<0.01) and bone porosity (R=0.72, P<0.01). Combining all data points together (77 ROIs), QSM showed significant moderate to strong correlation with volumetric BMD after correction for interdependencies in specimens (R=-0.70, P<0.01). The corrections were required because the data points were not independent in each specimen. Similarly, the correlation between QSM and porosity was significant (R=0.68, P<0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the Cones 3D UTE-MRI QSM technique can potentially serve as a novel and accurate tool to assess intracortical bone mineral density whilst avoiding ionizing radiation.

3530,"Assessment of real-world data surrogate for the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST). OBJECTIVES: The 21stCentury Cures Act calls for the incorporation of real-world evidence (RWE) into the drug labeling process. Critics cite deficiencies of RWE as compared to randomized controlled trials (RCT). We aimed to assess whether subjectively reported best response to treatment differed from responses based on radiographic measurements of target lesions. METHOD(S): Electronic case report forms (eCRF) were fielded to assess clinical response to systemic therapy in a rare malignancy. A comparison of subjectively reported best response with radio-graphic measurements of target lesions was performed to assess responses. RESULT(S): Fifteen physicians with experience treating this malignancy participated in a CRF-based analysis of patterns of care. Treatment response for each line of therapy was collected for each of the 59 patients via CRF. For 9 patients (15%) with reported partial remission (PR), CRFs were augmented with bi-dimensional measurements of sentinel tumors from pre-treatment and best response radiographs (reports). Treatment response was calculated using sum of diameters according to RECIST and compared to the corresponding physician-reported response. Measurement-based response revealed 4 PR, 2 stable disease, and 3 progressive disease, and a concordance of 44.4% (95% CI: 15.3%, 77.4%) between response assessment methods. Reasons cited for variance include availability of previous scans for comparison, inconsistency in target lesions imaged, bone metastases difficult to follow, and use of diameter vs SUV (standardized uptake value) on positron emission topography (PET) scans. CONCLUSION(S): Subjective assessments of response collected via manual chart extraction, electronic medical record (EMR) review via natural language processing, or CRF may be problematic and limit the potential role of RWE in drug label expansion. The collection of target lesion measurements by CRF presents an attractive alternative to elevate the quality and accuracy of clinical response assessment in oncologic patients, but limitations exist.",Excluded
163,"Sonographic diagnosis of intestinal anisakiasis presenting as small bowel obstruction. BACKGROUND: To evaluate the accuracy of ultrasonography (US) in the diagnosis of intestinal anisakiasis presenting as small bowel obstruction., METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical features, US examinations, and CT scans of seven patients with intestinal anisakiasis presenting as small bowel obstruction. We compared the performances of US and CT in demonstrating peritoneal fluid, small bowel dilatation, and segmental edema of Kerckring's folds., RESULTS: All patients presented with a history of ingesting raw saltwater fish or squid less than 2 days prior to presentation at the emergency department and had significant levels of Anisakis-specific IgE. Both US and CT revealed small bowel obstruction, with dilated small bowel in all patients and accumulations of free peritoneal fluid in six patients. CT showed segmental wall thickening and luminal narrowing with submucosal edema distal to the distended small bowel; US did so in four patients., CONCLUSIONS: Although US was inferior to CT in demonstrating the segmental intestinal edema causing small bowel obstruction, it can be applied in suspected cases of intestinal anisakiasis presenting as small bowel obstruction, particularly where CT is unavailable or there are concerns about radiation exposure.

338,"Decreasing the dose of radioiodine for remnant ablation does not increase structural recurrence rates in papillary thyroid carcinoma. Background Our aim was to compare the rate of structural recurrence between patients who had lesser doses of radioactive iodine (RAI) and those who had traditional greater doses for remnant ablation after total thyroidectomy for papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Methods A retrospective cohort study of patients who had undergone thyroidectomy and RAI for PTC was undertaken. We divided the cohort into those who had <=3 GBq (75 mCi) RAI (group A) and those who had >3 GBq (75 mCi) RAI (group B). The primary outcome measure was the rate of structural recurrence. Results Of 1,171 patients with PTC from 1990 to 2012 who were followed for a mean of 60 months, 970 with T1-T3 tumors underwent RAI in addition to thyroidectomy. The mean first dose of RAI was 2.5 GBq (68 mCi) for group A (n = 153) and 4.7 GBq (127 mCi) for group B (n = 817; P <.001). The overall rate of recurrence was 8%. When corrected for T stage, the recurrence rates were not different for T1 tumors (2% group A versus 4% group B; P =.54) nor for T2 and T3 tumors (P =.36 and.55, respectively). On multivariate analysis, the dose of RAI was not an independent predictor for structural recurrence. Conclusion Decreasing the dose of RAI at initial ablation for patients with pT1-pT3 PTC does not seem to be associated with an increased risk of structural cancer recurrence. © 2013 Mosby, Inc.

BACKGROUND: Dual-source computed tomography (CT) enables CT coronary angiography (CTCA) with a prospectively electrocardiography (ECG)-triggered high-pitch spiral (HPS) mode., PURPOSE: To evaluate the radiation dose, image quality, and diagnostic acceptability of the HPS mode in CTCA and to compare HPS with the step-and-shoot (SAS) and low-pitch spiral (LPS) modes., MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred and thirty-eight patients who underwent CTCA with a 128-slice dual-source CT scanner were retrospectively included in this study. Seventeen patients (average heart rate of <=65 beats per minute [bpm] prior to acquisition) were evaluated in the HPS mode, 88 (average heart rate of >65 and <=80 bpm prior to acquisition) in the SAS mode, and 33 (average heart rate of >80 bpm prior to acquisition or patients with an unstable heart rhythm) in the LPS mode. Radiation dose and image noise were recorded for each patient. Diagnostic acceptability was graded using a four-point scale (1, unacceptable; 2, suboptimal; 3, acceptable; 4, fully acceptable)., RESULTS: The effective dose in the HPS mode was 1.5 +/- 0.2 mSv, which was lower than that in SAS (8.9 +/- 2.7 mSv) and LPS (21.5 +/- 4.3 mSv) modes. There were no significant differences in the image noise levels in the descending aorta and left atrium. The average per-patient diagnostic acceptability was 3.2, 3.6, and 3.7 in HPS, SAS, and LPS modes, respectively., CONCLUSION: The radiation dose is lower with HPS than with other modes, and the HPS mode-acquired images of patients with heart rates of <=65 bpm are nearly acceptable for diagnostic image interpretation.

2244,"Baseline analysis of use of denosumab in osteoporotic patients: Indications, compliance, adverse effect and tolerability. Background Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits osteoclast activity, reducing bone loss. In the UK, use of denosumab was approved by National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) from October 2010 (TA204) [1]. Denosumab was used in Rheumatology Department, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, London from October 2010. Objectives We audited the indications for use of denosumab in these patients. Drug compliance, adverse effect and tolerability of the drug were also analysed. Methods 81 patients (female 77, male 4, age range 52 to 92 years, mean age 72 years) who commenced denosumab between October 2010 and December 2011 were identified retrospectively. 97% (79/81) of the patients come from their own home and 3% (2/81) come from nursing home. Patients' demographics, risk factors, fracture history, bone mineral density (BMD), spine and hip T score and previous osteoporosis treatment were assessed. 58 patients had follow up data and renal function was monitored every six months. Side effects were documented. Results Pre-treatment Dual-emission X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) was available on all patients (mean BMD spine and hip 0.686 gm/cm2 and 0.705 gm/cm2, mean T score spine and hip -3.025 and -1.776). 87% (75/81) had failed treatment with both oral and intravenous bisphosphonates. 11% (9/81) had breast cancer and were on aromatase inhibitors. 16% (13/81) had mild renal impairment and 7% (6/81) had moderate renal impairment at the base line. 35.8% (29/81) of patients were found to have vitamin D deficiency at baseline and were treated. 9% (7/81) were on denosumab treatment for primary prevention of osteoporosis (T score range -2.3 to -4.1). All of these had failed oral medication previously. Four patients swapped from intravenous Ibandronate due to poor venous access. Use of denosumab was indicated clinically despite lack of specific risk factors suggested by NICE. All patients treated with denosumab for secondary prevention of osteoporosis (91%,74/81) met NICE criteria by virtue of previous fracture and failure of other treatments. Four men were treated off-license. 44% (36/81) had completed six month treatment and 27% (22/81) had completed one year treatment. All these patients were compliant to the drug.

734,"A prospective study of 18FDG-PET with CT coregistration for radiation treatment planning of lymphomas and other hematologic malignancies. Purpose This prospective single-institution study examined the impact of positron emission tomography (PET) with the use of 2-[18F] fluoro-2-deoxyglucose and computed tomography (CT) scan radiation treatment planning (TP) on target volume definition in lymphoma. Methods and Materials 118 patients underwent PET/CT TP during June 2007 to May 2009. Gross tumor volume (GTV) was contoured on CT-only and PET/CT studies by radiation oncologists (ROs) and nuclear medicine physicians (NMPs) for 95 patients with positive PET scans. Treatment plans and dose-volume histograms were generated for CT-only and PET/CT for 95 evaluable sites. Paired t test statistics and Pearson correlation coefficients were used for analysis. Results 70 (74%) patients had non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 10 (11%) had Hodgkin lymphoma, 12 (10%) had plasma-cell neoplasm, and 3 (3%) had other hematologic malignancies. Forty-three (45%) presented with relapsed/refractory disease. Forty-five (47%) received no prior chemotherapy. The addition of PET increased GTV as defined by ROs in 38 patients (median, 27%; range, 5%-70%) and decreased GTV in 41 (median, 39.5%; range, 5%-80%). The addition of PET increased GTV as defined by NMPs in 27 patients (median, 26.5%; range, 5%-95%) and decreased GTV in 52 (median, 70%; range, 5%-99%). The intraobserver correlation between CT-GTV and PET-GTV was higher for ROs than for NMPs (0.94, P<.01 vs 0.89, P<.01). On the basis of Bland-Altman plots, the PET-GTVs defined by ROs were larger than those defined by NMPs. On evaluation of clinical TPs, only 4 (4%) patients had inadequate target coverage (D95 <95%) of the PET-GTV defined by NMPs. Conclusions Significant differences between the RO and NMP volumes were identified when PET was coregistered to CT for radiation planning. Despite this, the PET-GTV defined by ROs and NMPs received acceptable prescription dose in nearly all patients. However, given the potential for a marginal miss, consultation with an experienced PET reader is highly encouraged when PET/CT volumes are delineated, particularly for questionable lesions and to assure complete and accurate target volume coverage. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AIM: Prospective, randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study to prove the efficacy of Coumarin/Troxerutine (Venalot Depot) for protection of salivary glands during a head and neck irradiation., PATIENTS AND METHOD: Forty-eight radiotherapy patients (60 Gy) with head and neck cancer were included in this trial. During radiotherapy the salivary glands were located in the core irradiation field. Primary efficacy parameters were sialometry, quantitative salivary gland scintigraphy and clinical evaluation of early effects of radiotherapy (RTOG-score, Table 1). All data were collected at 6 assessments: 1 week pre-radiation (U1), at start (U2), half time (U3) and end (U4) of irradiation, 8 days (U5) and 28 days (U6) after the end of irradiation (Figure 1)., RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (11 verum, 12 placebo) completed the study with all assessments. Sialometrically, all patients were severely (half of radiotherapy) or completely (end of radiotherapy) xerostomatic (Figure 2). In a global efficacy measure according to O'Brien combining scintigraphy and RTOG there was a tendency for a higher efficacy of verum compared to placebo (p = 0.068). After start of irradiation therapy, the RTOG-score showed continuously and significantly lower early radiation effects under verum than under placebo (U3 vs U6: p < 0.05, area under curve: p = 0.032; Table 2, Figure 3). The scintigraphically determined excretion fraction was slightly less impaired in the verum group compared to the placebo treatment (p = 0.12. Figure 4). There was no difference in drug safety between placebo and verum for adverse events, changes in the activity of liver enzymes and for global impression of tolerability., CONCLUSIONS: The results give support for an advantageous effect of Venalot Depot in the treatment of radiogenic sialadenitis and mucositis. In even a small number of evaluable patients, early clinical effects of irradiation (RTOG-score) were less pronounced in the active treatment group than in the placebo group, but the sample size was too low to prove statistically also the benefit of coumarin/troxerutine with the scintigraphic method.

3490,"Chromosome anomalies in mouse oocytes after irradiation. We investigated the cytogenetic effects of X-rays on unfertilized mouse oocytes. NMRI females received an irradiation with 0,22.2,66.6,200, and 600 R during the preovulatory phase 3 hrs after HCG (human chorionic gonadotrophin). This is a stage during oogenesis in which the oocytes pass from late dictyotene to diakinesis. Chromosome analysis was performed after ovulation at metaphase II. From these experiments we can draw the following conclusions: 1) X-rays induced during the preovulatory phase a high number of chromosome anomalies. Among these, structural anomalies prevail. 7 out of 144 ovulated oocytes in matched controls carried such an abnormality, whereas after irradiation we observed with 22.2, 66.6, 200, and 600 R, 11 out of 72, 34 out of 108, 89 out of 102, and 122 out of 124, respectively. 2) Irradiation seems also to affect the chromosome segregation during the 1. meiotic division, as we observed after 22.2, 66.6, and 200 R a total of 6 oocytes out of 204 with a supernummary chromosome. In controls, however, no hyperploidy was found in 143 ova. This increase, however, was not significant. 3) Chromosome anomalies, e.g. breaks and deletions that go back to a one-break event increased linearly with increasing dose. Exchanges, however, going back to two-break events fittest best to the linear-quadratic dose-response model. 4) The dose of 600 R seems to represents a kind of borderline in this experiment, because nearly all (122 out 124) carried at least one structural chromosome anomaly. It is also this dose after which the highest frequency of reciprocal translocations was observed in a hump-shaped slope in spermatocytes after irradiation of spermatogonia (Preston and Brewen, 1973). With an increasing dosage up to 1200 R the frequency of translocations decrease again. The elimination of cells, crossing this borderline, might be due to genetic or non-genetic effects. 5) The frequency of radiation-induced translocations per oocyte agrees with the frequency of translocations in human lymphocytes (Dolphin and Lloyd, 1974) after in vitro irradiation. 6) Significant, lower frequencies of structural chromosome anomalies were observed irradiating earlier stages of mouse oogenesis. These stages are dictyotene from females at the age of 3, or 6 weeks and prophase I-stages in female embryos on the 17th day of gestation. This result may be due to a lower sensitivity of these stages or to modifying events during the interval between irradiation and preparations.",Excluded

Methods and Materials We included a cohort of 46 supradiaphragmatic stage I-II classical HL patients. All patients were initially treated with chemotherapy and INRT delivered as 3D-CRT (30 Gy). For each patient, we simulated MF (36 Gy) and INRT plans using VMAT and PT (30 Gy). Linear dose-response curves for the 20-, 25-, and 30-year risk of stroke were derived from published HL data. Risks of stroke with each technique were calculated for all patients. Statistical analyses were performed with repeated measures analysis of variance. Results The mean doses to the right and left common carotid artery were significantly lower with modern treatment compared with MF, with substantial patient variability. The estimated excess risk of stroke after 20, 25, and 30 years was 0.6%, 0.86%, and 1.3% for 3D-CRT; 0.67%, 0.96%, and 1.47% for VMAT; 0.61%, 0.96%, and 1.33% for PT; and 1.3%, 1.72%, and 2.61% for MF. Conclusions INRT reduces the dose delivered to the carotid arteries and corresponding estimated risk of stroke for HL survivors. Even for the subset of patients with lymphoma close to the carotid arteries, the estimated risk is low. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
3127,"Utilityof stress perfusion-cardiac magnetic resonance in followup of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions of the left main coronaryartery. Objectives: To assess the accuracy of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) for the diagnosis of angiographic stenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of left main coronary artery (LMCA). Method(s): Patients undergone in the last year PCI of unprotected LMCA and scheduled for conventional X-ray coronary angiography were prospectively evaluated with stress perfusion CMR within 2 weeks before coronary angiography. Main contraindications to CMR and previous coronary artery bypass were exclusion criteria. Stress perfusion CMR was performed to follow a bolus of contrast Gadobutrol, after 3 min of adenosine infusion. Result(s): Between the 50 patients enrolled, only 1 did not finish the CMR protocol and 49 patients with median age 71 (65-75) years (38 male, 11 female) were analyzed. Previous myocardial infarction was present in 31 patients (63%) and multi vessel PCI in 39 (76%). We evaluated 784 coronary angiographic segments and found 75 stenosis or occlusions (prevalence 9.5%), but only 13 stenosis or occlusions in proximal segments (prevalence 6.6%). Patients with coronary stenosis (n=12, 24%) showed a significantly (p=0.002) higher prevalence of diabetes (7 of 12, 58%), while the other main clinical characteristics were similar to patients without coronary stenosis (all p>0.1). At CMR examination, late gadolinium enhancement was present in 25 (51%), reversible perfusion defects in 12 (24%), and fixed perfusion defects in 6 subjects (12%). The only patient with LMCA ristenosis resulted positive at perfusion CMR (Figure 1). CMR stress perfusion resulted positive in 8 of 12 patients with significant coronary lesions (sensitivity 67%, CI 35-90%) and in 4 of 5 patients with significant proximal coronary lesions (sensitivity 80%, CI 28-99). The accuracy of stress perfusion CMR in diagnosis of coronary stenosis was higher when the analysis was performed only in proximal coronary arteries (95%, CI 86-99) compared to overall vessels (84%, CI70-92). Conclusion(s): Stress perfusion CMR could strongly reduce the need for elective coronary angiography in follow up of LMCA PCI and should be validated in further multi center prospective studies.

2193,"Malignant melanoma risk by nativity, place of residence at diagnosis, and age at migration. Although geographic latitude is clearly linked to the risk of cutaneous malignant melanoma, the chronology of this link is unclear. Based on the 4,611 cases of melanoma with known place of nativity diagnosed in 1972-82 among the non-Latino White residents of Los Angeles County (California, United States) of known place of origin, migrants to Los Angeles from higher US latitudes enjoy relative safety from skin melanoma. This relative safety is largely unaffected by the interval since migration, even after decades of residence in Los Angeles. The same relative protection is enjoyed by native residents of more northerly US communities in comparison with co-resident migrants from the southwestern US. While the observed effect of latitude is consistent with the accepted importance of solar radiation as a determinant of melanoma risk, it suggests that early, rather than late or cumulative, exposure is of most importance. This finding does not affirm the belief that protection of adult skin from exposure to the sun will reduce the risk from melanoma. It does suggest that decades must pass before it will be possible to assess the impact on melanoma risk of any increase in ultraviolet radiation delivered to the earth as a result of the destruction of atmospheric ozone.",Excluded
1599,"Biodistribution and Radiation Dosimetry of 124I-DPA-713, a PET Radiotracer for Macrophage-Associated Inflammation. Whole-body PET/CT was performed using 124I-DPA-713, a radioligand for the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO), to determine biodistribution and radiation dosimetry. Methods: Healthy subjects aged 18-65 y underwent whole-body PET/CT either at 4, 24, and 48 h or at 24, 48, and 72 h after intravenous injection of 124I-DPA-713. Time-activity curves were generated and used to calculate organ time-integrated activity coefficients for each subject. The resulting time-integrated activity coefficients provided input data for calculation of organ absorbed doses and effective dose for each subject using OLINDA. Subjects were genotyped for the TSPO polymorphism rs6971, and plasma protein binding of 124I-DPA-713 was measured. Results: Three male and 3 female adults with a mean age of 40 +/- 19 y were imaged. The mean administered activity and mass were 70.5 +/- 5.1 MBq (range, 62.4-78.1 MBq) and 469 +/- 34 ng (range, 416-520 ng), respectively. There were no adverse or clinically detectable pharmacologic effects in any of the 6 subjects. No changes in vital signs, laboratory values, or electrocardiograms were observed. 124I-DPA-713 cleared rapidly (4 h after injection) from the lungs, with hepatic elimination and localization to the gastrointestinal tract. The mean effective dose over the 6 subjects was 0.459 +/- 0.127 mSv/MBq, with the liver being the dose-limiting organ (0.924 +/- 0.501 mGy/MBq). The percentage of free radiotracer in blood was approximately 30% at 30 and 60 min after injection. Conclusion: 124I-DPA-713 clears rapidly from the lungs, with predominantly hepatic elimination, and is safe and well tolerated in healthy adults.

926,"Intentional outdoor tanning in the United States: Results from the 2015 Summer ConsumerStyles survey. There is limited literature about adults in the United States who usually or always spend time outdoors for the purpose of developing a tan, defined as intentional outdoor tanning. Using data from the 2015 Summer ConsumerStyles, an online cross-sectional survey weighted to the US adult population (n = 4,127), we performed unadjusted and adjusted multivariable logistic regressions to examine the associations between demographic characteristics, behaviors, and belief factors related to skin cancer risk and intentional outdoor tanning. Nearly 10% of the study population intentionally tanned outdoors. Outdoor tanning was more prevalent among women (11.4%), non-Hispanic white individuals (11.5%), those aged 18-29 years (14.1%), those without a high school diploma (12.7%), and those in the northeast United States (13.2%). The adjusted odds of outdoor tanning were significantly higher among women than men (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12-2.04); those with a history of indoor tanning or recent sunburn than those without (AOR 2.61, CI 1.94-3.51; AOR 1.96, CI 1.46-2.63, respectively); those who agreed they looked better with a tan than those who did not (AOR 6.69, CI 3.62-12.35); and those who did not try to protect their skin from the sun when outdoors than those who did (AOR 2.17, CI 1.56-3.04). Adults who engaged in other risky behaviors that expose a person to ultraviolet (UV) radiation were more likely to tan outdoors, further increasing their risk of skin cancer. These findings may guide potential interventions to reduce UV exposure from outdoor tanning.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
212,"A hybrid iterative reconstruction algorithm that improves the image quality of low-tube-voltage coronary CT angiography. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether a hybrid iterative reconstruction (HIR) algorithm improves image quality at low-tube-voltage coronary CT angiography (CTA) compared with filtered back projection (FBP)., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Eighteen patients (seven men, 11 women; mean age, 67.8 years) underwent retrospectively gated coronary CTA at 80 kV with a volume CT dose index (CTDI(vol)) of 18.8 mGy on a 64-MDCT scanner. CT images were reconstructed using only FBP and only HIR. For each patient, CT images subjected to the two different reconstructions were reviewed by two observers. Quantitative image quality parameters-that is, CT attenuation (HU) of the coronary arteries, image noise, and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR)-were calculated and compared for the two reconstruction methods and the overall image quality for each reconstruction was visually scored on a 5-point scale., RESULTS: The mean estimated effective radiation dose for 80-kV coronary CTA was 4.7 +/- 0.4 (SD) mSv. The two reconstruction methods did not significantly differ with respect to the CT attenuation of the coronary arteries. The image noise was significantly lower with HIR than with FBP (20.3 +/- 5.3 vs 49.4 +/- 12.0 HU, respectively; p < 0.01), and the CNR was significantly higher with HIR than with FBP (29.8 +/- 7.4 vs 12.7 +/- 2.9, p < 0.01).

OBJECTIVE: Functional electrical stimulation (FES) has not gained widespread application for a number of factors; two of which are rapid muscle fatigue and imprecise control in force. Stimulation intensity is adjusted during FES to overcome the decline in muscle force due to fatigue and precisely control muscle force output. The purpose of this study was to understand the relationship between muscle force output and stimulation intensity and to see how this relationship changes with fatigue., METHODS: Quadriceps femoris muscles of 10 able-bodied adults were tested isometrically. Pre- and post-fatigue muscle force responses to stimulation trains with different intensities and frequencies were recorded and analyzed. In addition, a case study using a subject with spinal cord injury was presented to illustrate the use of the force-intensity relationship to reduce muscle fatigue and improve the control of muscle force during repetitive electrical stimulation., RESULTS: An exponential relationship between muscle force and stimulation intensity was observed; interestingly, the normalized force-intensity relationship did not change with stimulation frequency or fatigue., CONCLUSIONS: The observed consistencies in the force-intensity relationship should assist scientists and clinicians to more accurately predict the forces produced by a muscle with changes in pulse duration during repetitive electrical stimulation., SIGNIFICANCE: The findings of this study provide guidelines for clinicians and researchers to adjust the stimulation intensity to achieve precise control of force repetitively during the application of FES.",Excluded

Commercial sunscreens may offer some protection from immunosuppression induced by ultraviolet (UV) radiation, but agreement concerning the degree of protection is lacking. Cis-urocanic acid, formed by the photoisomerization of transurocanic acid is considered an important mediator of the cutaneous immunomodulation resulting from exposure to UV radiation. We investigated the effect of sunscreens on the isomerization of urocanic acid in 17 human subjects. Two sunscreens containing chemical filters, sun protection factor (SPF) 4 and SPF 10, and a SPF 10 sunscreen with a physical filter were applied at a thickness of 2 mg/cm2. The effect of a thin layer (0.5 mg/cm2) of the chemical SPF 10 sunscreen was also evaluated, as the amount of sunscreen applied in practice may be considerably less than recommended. All areas were irradiated with a single UV dose of 3.6 SED (standard erythema doses). In irradiated unprotected skin the median net production of cis-urocanic acid was 52% (relative amount). In the sites treated with the chemical sunscreens, the production of cis-urocanic acid was 7.4% (SPF 4) and 3.5% (SPF 10), and isomerization was thus reduced more efficiently at a higher SPF (p<0.01). The physical sunscreen reduced the formation of cis-UCA to 15%, and was significantly less effective than both the chemical SPF 10 sunscreen (p<0.01) and the SPF 4 sunscreen (p<0.01). The production of cis-urocanic acid in the area treated with the thin layer of the chemical SPF 10 sunscreen was 22%.

The tagging agent was barium (n = 271) or iodine (n = 40). Correlation was measured between mean volume CT dose index (CTDI (vol)) and the estimated x-ray attenuation of the tagged stool and fluid (ATT). Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to determine the effect of ATT on CTDI (vol ) and the effect of ATT on image noise while adjusting for other variables including abdominal circumference., RESULTS: CTDI (vol) varied from 0.88 to 2.54 mGy. There was no significant correlation between CTDI (vol) and ATT (p = 0.61). ATT did not significantly affect CTDI (vol) (p = 0.93), while abdominal circumference was the only factor significantly affecting CTDI (vol) (p < 0.001). Image noise ranged from 59.5 to 64.1 HU. The p value for the regression model explaining the noise was 0.38., CONCLUSION: The amount of stool and fluid tagging does not significantly affect radiation exposure.",Excluded
2817,"Organ transplant recipients and skin cancer: Assessment of risk factors with focus on sun exposure. SummaryBackground Organ transplant recipients (OTRs) have an increased risk of developing skin cancer, especially epithelial tumours. A number of factors such as immunosuppression, age, ultraviolet radiation and skin type are considered as important in aetiology. Objectives The purpose of this study was to further evaluate the risk factors for OTRs regarding skin cancer after transplantation. A detailed investigation of the specific compounds of sun exposure was realised. Methods A questionnaire-based study was performed in a specialist OTR dermatology clinic from January to April 2009. The subjects were 70 organ transplanted patients who had developed some form of skin cancer after transplantation. As controls served 69 organ transplanted patients who had no history of skin cancer. The controls were matched concerning age, transplanted organ and gender. Photo protection, sun exposure and transplantation data were part of the questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed with Mann-Whitney-U-test, chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. Results The total sun burden (TSB) and the recreational sun exposure in particular attained higher scores in the skin cancer group (TSB-score: mean 11.8 vs. 10.0, P < 0.05; recreational sun exposure: mean 6.3 vs. 5.1, P < 0.05). The skin cancer group had fairer skin types than the control group (median skin type 2 vs. 3, P < 0.05). The OTRs who developed skin cancer have been more likely to have a history or present intake of azathioprine (mean 42% vs. 21%, P < 0.05). Also, the skin cancer group has been transplanted for a longer time (mean 12.3 vs. 7.2 years, P < 0.001), analogously had a younger age at transplantation (mean 49.5 vs. 52.7 years, P < 0.001). Conclusions Recreational sun exposure is of central importance for OTRs. A long period of transplantation and thus immunosuppression presents a main risk factor for the development of skin cancer in OTRs. A multi disciplinary management with the best medication and a focus on sun protection is needed to prevent skin cancer in OTRs. © 2009 British Association of Dermatologists.",Excluded
2172,"First results of a cervical titanium-coated polyetherether ketone (PEEK)-disc prosthesis. Introduction: Intervertebral disc prostheses have been established as the standard method of choice in the treatment of degenerative cervical disc disease. Due to metal artefacts when using titanium, the capabilities of post-surgical imaging are significantly limited. To combine the advantages of titanium implants regarding osteo-integrity with minimized imaging artefacts when using PEEK, a cervical PEEK-prosthesis was used, of which only the interface to the bone was coated with titanium. Patients and Methods: Since 01/2011 28 titanium-coated PEEK-prostheses were implanted into 23 patients (20 women, 3 men, average age 50.4 years [SD+/-13.2 years]). 5 patients were treated in two segments. The implantations were performed in the segments C3/4 [n=2], C 5/6 [n=14] und C 6/7 [n=12] using a right ventral approach, as well as Milling-approach. Presurgically bone-density measurement was performed using DXA or QCT, as well a segmental CT-scan, to exclude facet arthrosis. Eightteen patients showed pareses with levels of strength of 3-4 ([C6 = 10], [C7 = 8]). All patients suffered from cervicobrachalgia with segmental paresthesias. In all cases the cause of disorder was found to be chronic disc degeneration with loss of lordosis and consequential retrospondylosis and/or compression of nerval structures by disc material. The symptoms prevailed for at least 8 weeks. Result(s): Average surgical time was 97 min [SD+/-33 min]. We found no intra-, peri- or post-surgical complications. Average hospital stay was 4 days [SD+/-0,6 days]. Post-surgical X-ray evaluations of the cervical spine showed appropriate implantpositioning in regard to the center of rotation (COR), as well as significant relordosation. Three cases showed a minor deviation of the implant from the midline, however without clinical relevance. Neurological assessment of the patients could not find signs of paresis, except impaired fist closure in one patient. Patients showed clear decrease of sensory impairment, as well as in levels of pain. Four patients showed persisting neck-pain, as well as radicular paresthesia, of which 2 patients had an initial post-surgical symptom free period. Post-surgical MRI-control was performed for one patient, showing only minimal metal artefacts along the top-plates. Conclusion(s): The new titanium coated PEEK disc-prosthesis shows no significant difference in short-term outcome, compared to the commonly used, mainly metallic ball-socket prostheses. Also the technique of implantation and the range of motion are mostly identical. Future follow-ups will show, whether also the mid- and long-term outcome of this new implant reveals comparable results. Post-surgical X-ray evaluation of the new implant may be more sophisticated, due to the decreased metal content and requires knowledge of the implant-design. However magnet resonance image quality is greatly enhanced, due to the decrease of artefacts. (Figure Presented).",Excluded
3493,"Monitoring of residual hematopoiesis after total body irradiation in humans as a model for accidental x-ray exposure: dose-effect and failure of ex vivo expansion of residual stem cells in view of autografting. PURPOSE: To evaluate the residual hematopoiesis at different levels of total body irradiation (TBI) dose in bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB), and to study the dose-effect relationship on hematopoietic immature and mature progenitors. We also investigated the possibility of expanding ex vivo the residual progenitors exposed to different dose levels of TBI., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eight patients treated for AML (n = 3) and myeloma (n = 5) were included. BM and PB samples were harvested before TBI and after doses of: 5 Gy. Mononuclear cells (MNCs) were assayed for burst-forming unit erythroid (BFU-E), granulocyte-forming unit macrophage (CFU-GM), and long-term culture initiating cells (LTC-ICs). Ex vivo expansion: MNCs (after irradiation and controls) were suspended in long-term cultures and expanded with a combination of five cytokines., RESULTS: CD34+ cells were detectable at 10 Gy. We observed a significant decrease of CFU-GM and BFU-E, respectively, to 13.5% and 8.5% of baseline values for doses <or=2 Gy and to 8.2% and 4.6% for doses ranging between 2.1 and 5 Gy. No dose effect was observed for residual MNCs. LTC-ICs were not detectable after 0.8 Gy. The expansion was not successful after 1.2 Gy., CONCLUSION: This study confirms the significant decrease of human mature and immature progenitors in BM and PB immediately after low-dose TBI. In addition, the lack of expansion suggests that autografting using BM or PB residual stem cells collected and expanded in vitro in case of accidental whole body exposure may be impractical.",Excluded

Assumption-free Bayesian statistical methods were used. The analytical results demonstrate that the published incidence and mortality data do not show that radiation dose is associated with increased risk in this range of doses. This conclusion is based on the observation that the model assuming no dependence of the lung cancer induction on the radiation doses is at least ~90 times more likely to be true than the other models tested, including the linear no-threshold (LNT) model.

Housing recommendations for horses invariably include providing access to shade on hot, sunny days, but the potential benefits have not been scientifically studied. This experiment measured physiological, behavioral, and serological responses of horses confined individually to completely shaded (SH) or completely unshaded (SUN) drylot pens during the summer in Davis, CA. Twelve healthy adult horses in a crossover design experienced both treatments for 5 d each. Rectal temperature, respiration rate, skin temperature, and sweat scores were recorded hourly from 1230 to 1730 h daily. Observations were recorded from 1200 to 1800 h for proximity to water, foraging, locomotion, and insect avoidance behaviors. Daily blood samples were obtained to measure cortisol, hematocrit, and neutrophil- to-lymphocyte ratio. Automated and handheld sensors were used to record environmental conditions. The mean ambient temperature from 1200 to 1800 h during the study was 30.6degreeC. Rectal temperature was greater for horses in SUN than for SH (mean 37.8degreeC and 37.5degreeC, respectively, SE = 0.06, P = 0.002) as was respiration rate (25.5 and 20.5 breaths/min, SE = 1.3, P = 0.008), and skin temperature (35.6degreeC and 34.6degreeC, SE = 0.1, P < 0.001). Horses in SUN showed sweat in 51.4% of observations vs. 1.1% for horses in SH. Horses in SUN spent more time than SH horses standing near their water source (34.0% of observations vs. 20.2%, SE = 0.3, P = 0.004). No differences were observed for foraging, locomotion, or insect avoidance behavior (P > 0.05). Cortisol concentrations were greater in SUN than SH (3.4 and 2.6 mug/dL, respectively, P < 0.001) but remained within the normal range for resting horses. No treatment differences were observed for hematocrit or neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (P > 0.05). Horses exhibited treatment differences in the physiological measures first, most notably in rectal temperature at 1230 h, corresponding to peak solar radiation. Behavioral responses followed these physiological changes, with treatment differences in time standing near water becoming apparent at 1400 h as ambient and black globe temperature increased. Our results indicate that both the SH and SUN treatment groups exhibited thermoregulatory responses to these summer conditions and horses benefited from shade, as it mitigated these physiological and behavioral changes. These results are applicable in developing best management practices for the care of domestic horses. © 2013 American Society of Animal Science. All rights reserved.",Excluded

3407,"Genetic variants in inflammation-related genes are associated with radiation-induced toxicity following treatment for non-small cell lung cancer. Treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy is often accompanied by the development of esophagitis and pneumonitis. Identifying patients who might be at increased risk for normal tissue toxicity would help in determination of the optimal radiation dose to avoid these events. We profiled 59 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 37 inflammation-related genes in 173 NSCLC patients with stage IIIA/IIIB (dry) disease who were treated with definitive radiation or chemoradiation. For esophagitis risk, nine SNPs were associated with a 1.5- to 4-fold increase in risk, including three PTGS2 (COX2) variants: rs20417 (HR:1.93, 95% CI:1.10-3.39), rs5275 (HR:1.58, 95% CI:1.09-2.27), and rs689470 (HR:3.38, 95% CI:1.09-10.49). Significantly increased risk of pneumonitis was observed for patients with genetic variation in the proinflammatory genes IL1A, IL8, TNF, TNFRSF1B, and MIF. In contrast, NOS3:rs1799983 displayed a protective effect with a 45% reduction in pneumonitis risk (HR:0.55, 95% CI:0.31-0.96). Pneumonitis risk was also modulated by polymorphisms in anti-inflammatory genes, including genetic variation in IL13. rs20541 and rs180925 each resulted in increased risk (HR:2.95, 95% CI:1.14-7.63 and HR:3.23, 95% CI:1.03-10.18, respectively). The cumulative effect of these SNPs on risk was dose-dependent, as evidenced by a significantly increased risk of either toxicity with an increasing number of risk genotypes (P,0.001). These results suggest that genetic variations among inflammation pathway genes may modulate the development of radiation-induced toxicity and, ultimately, help in identifying patients who are at an increased likelihood for such events. 2010 Hildebrandt et al.",Excluded
1101,"Clinical Research and Technique Note of TLIF by Wiltse Approach for the Treatment of Degenerative Lumbar. Objective: To assess the clinical efficacy and share the technique notes of Wiltse Approach TLIF for the treating single segment degenerative lumbar spinal disease. Method(s): In this retrospective controlled study, 780 patients with single segment degenerative lumbar disease who were operated in our hospital from January 2016 to December 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. The patients were randomly assigned to Wiltse approach group (group A, 410 cases) and conventional open approach group (group B, 370 cases). Patient's assessment of pain and disability were evaluated by the visual analogue scale (VAS) and the Oswestry disability index (ODI) before and after surgery. The incision length, operative time, exposure time, intraoperative blood loss, hidden blood loss, time to ambulation, total length of hospitalization, serum creatine kinase, X-rays, CT and MRI were also evaluated. Result(s): There were no differences in sex, age, pre-operative ODI score, VAS score between the two groups (P > 0.05). The Wiltse approach group had a shorter incision length with 7.69 +/- 0.44 cm compared to the conventional group with 11.13 +/- 0.36 cm (P < 0.01). The average operative time was 119.20 +/- 14.64 min with exposure time of 16.20 +/- 3.42 min in the Wiltse approach group and 145.65 +/- 16.98 min with 29.20 +/- 3.42 min in the conventional group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Comparing the intraoperative blood loss, hidden blood loss, serum creatine kinase, time to ambulation, total length of hospitalization, the Wiltse approach group was less than the conventional open approach group (P < 0.05). The VAS score of the two groups decreased significantly with time, and the VAS score of the Wiltse group was significantly lower than that of the conventional open approach group (P < 0.05). At last investigation after operation, ODI scores of the two groups were significantly decreased compared with that before operation. Wiltse approach group was significantly lower than that of the conventional open approach group (P < 0.05). The multifidus of the two groups of patients had a certain degree of atrophy. But the Wiltse approach group multifidus muscle atrophy rate is significantly lower than the conventional open approach group. Conclusion(s): The Wiltse approach TLIF significantly reduces the damage to the paravertebral muscles and the postoperative incidence of chronic low back pain.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

1116,"Acceptable levels for ingestion of dimethylsilanediol in water on the International Space Station. INTRODUCTION: Water is recovered aboard the International Space Station (ISS) from humidity condensate and treated urine. The product water is monitored for total organic carbon (TOC). In 2010 the TOC readings indicated that a new contaminant had entered the potable water and was steadily increasing toward the TOC screening limit of 3 mg x L(-1). In a ground-based laboratory, chemists discovered that dimethylsilanediol (DMSD) was the principal new contaminant. As no standard existed for safe levels of DMSD in water, the Toxicology Office at Johnson Space Center was asked to set such a standard., METHODS: The Toxicology Office used methods developed over the past decade, in collaboration with the National Research Council Committee on Toxicology, for setting Spacecraft Water Exposure Guidelines (SWEGs). These methods require a thorough literature search and development of an acceptable concentration (AC) for each potential toxic effect, keeping in mind that the adverse effects that accompany spaceflight could increase toxicity for certain end points. Benchmark dose modeling was encouraged if sufficient data were available. The most sensitive AC becomes the driver for the SWEG., RESULTS: Hematotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and possibly neurotoxicity were the most sensitive toxicological endpoints for DMSD., CONCLUSIONS: The SWEG for DMSD for 100 d of ingestion was set at 35 mg x L(-1), which is equivalent to 9 mg x L(-1) as TOC. This is well above the TOC SWEG of 3 mg x L(-1) and the peak DMSD level of processed water observed on orbit, which was 2.2 mg x L(-1) asTOC (8.5 mg x L(-10 of DMSD).",Excluded
1284,"Staff radiation dose and estimated risk in an interventional radiology department. In interventional radiology attendant staff can be exposed to significant doses from the radiation scattered from the patient, giving rise to heterogeneous energy distribution, exposure occurring over extended periods of time. Protection of staff is a prime concern, also including reducing the risk of carcinogenesis. With only limited published studies available, as in for instance in regard to lens opacifications, further evaluation of staff exposures and assessment of radiation protection techniques and measures are crucial. Present study has sought to evaluate staff radiation exposure in a radiology department that performs interventional procedures. Annual occupational exposures were obtained for 32 personnel (6 females and 26 males) in a radiology department at a tertiary hospital. Personal dose equivalent Hp (d) was measured in terms of Hp (0.07) (shallow dose) and Hp (10) (deep dose). The measurements were made over a period of two consecutive years, 2017 and 2018, use being made of TLD-100 thermoluminescent dosimeters. In units of mSv, the corresponding average annual dose equivalent and range for Hp (10) and Hp (0.07) were 4.6 +/- 7.0 (0.1-25.5) and 5.1 +/- 7.3 (0.1-25.5). Notably, 16% of staff received doses that were greater than the annual dose limit. Since Hp (10) offers a conservative evaluation of effective dose, evaluation of the working environment is necessary in seeking to ensure dose values remain below annual dose limits.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
3382,"Altered depression-related behaviors and functional changes in the dorsal raphe nucleus of serotonin transporter-deficient mice. BACKGROUND: As a key regulator of serotonergic activity and target of many antidepressant treatments, the serotonin transporter (SERT) represents a potential mediator of anxiety- and depression-related behaviors. Using mice lacking the SERT (SERT KO), we examined the role of SERT function in anxiety- and depression-related behaviors and serotonergic neuron function., METHODS: Serotonin transporter knockout mice were evaluated in paradigms designed to assess anxiety-, depression-, and stress-related behaviors. Dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) function was assessed by quantitative serotonergic cell counting and extracellular electrical recording of neuronal firing properties., RESULTS: Serotonin transporter knockout mice showed an increase in latency to feed in a novel situation, more immobility in a forced swim, increased escape latency in a shock escape paradigm, and decreased immobility in tail suspension. No differences in anxiety-related behaviors were seen in the open field and the elevated plus maze. Serotonin transporter knockout mice exhibit a 50% reduction in serotonergic cell number and a fourfold decrease in firing rate in the DRN., CONCLUSIONS: Developmental loss of SERT produces altered behaviors in models of depression that are generally opposite to those produced by antidepressant treatment. The reduced serotonergic cell number and firing rate in the DRN of adult SERT KO mice suggest a mechanism for these altered behaviors.",Excluded
1234,"Human mononuclear cell in vitro activation in microgravity and post-spaceflight. The results of postflight and inflight human in vitro lymphocyte experiments have been reviewed. The cumulative data indicate that mitogen-stimulated T-cell proliferation is blunted following short-duration missions. Since similar responses may also be obtained following exposure to non-spaceflight stressors (hypoxia and academic stress), it is unclear if microgravity per se aggravates this response. Our studies indicate that stress-induced impaired PHA- and PWM-stimulated activation can be detected within the first 24 hours in culture at the level of protein synthesis. While the mechanism for neuroendocrine-mediated blunted mitogen stimulated T cell proliferation has not been elucidated, it is not aggravated by autologous plasma and does not require changes in mononuclear cell subpopulations. While prior studies indicate lymphocyte activation is influenced by altering G forces on in vitro cultures, impaired cellular interactions or suboptimal microenvironments related to reduced cell densities in microgravity may contribute to the greatly impaired mitogen stimulated proliferation responses observed on Spacelab flights. It will be necessary to perform lymphocyte functional assays on crewmembers during spaceflight to determine to contribution of microgravity per se on altered human immune competence.",Excluded
2829,"Allogeneic stem cell transplantation for idiopatic myelofibrosis: A single centre experience. Background: Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation (ASCT) is the only curative option for Myelofibrosis (MF). Development of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens and introduction of Ruxolitinib (Rux) have improved the outcome of ASCT. However, this procedure is still burdened by substantial morbidity and high transplantrelated mortality (TRM). Here we report our experience with ASCT in MF setting, in order to evaluate the factors influencing post-transplant outcome, in term of overall survival (OS) and Progression-free survival (PFS). Method(s): In the last 10 years we performed 30 ASCT on 27 MF patients (pts); 3 pts of them received a second ASCT for MF relapse. The median age was 51 (range: 25-68) years. Driver mutations were found in 23 pts and were: JAK2V617F in 16 (59%), MPL in 3(11%) and CALR mutations in 4 (15%) pts; 4 (15%) pts were defined as ""triple-negative"". According to Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System (DIPSS) at transplant, pts were stratified into high, intermediate-2 and intermediate-1 risk in 11 (41%), 12 (44%) and 4 (15%) cases, respectively. Considering the first ASCT, donors were matched related (MRD), matched unrelated (MUD) and haploidentical in 18 (67%), 7 (26%), and 2 (7%) of cases, respectively. Conditioning regimen (CR) was RIC in 11 pts (41%) or myeloablative in 16 pts (59%); all CR were Busulfan and Fludarabine-based, in 48% of cases (n=13) associated with Tiothepa. Conventional GVHD prophylaxis regimens were used according to type of ASCT. Splenectomy or spleen irradiation were performed before ASCT in 2 and 6 pts in pre-Rux era; 16 pts (59%) received Rux before ASCT. Source of stem cells were bone marrow in 15 (56%) or peripheral blood stem cells in 12 (44%) pts. OS and PFS have been evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Result(s): Aafter a median follow-up of 18.5 (range: 0.5 - 175) months from first ASCT, 4/27 pts (15%) died for early TRM, 6 (22%) pts for MF relapse (4) or leukemic evolution (2). 17 (63%) pts were alive, 15 of them with full chimerism and complete remission (one after the second ASCT); 2 pts were alive in MF relapse. Chronic GVHD occurred in 6 (22%) pts. The probability of OS for the entire cohort at 2 and 5 years was respectively 75% and 60% and the 2 and 5 year PFS was 75% and 55% respectively. In statistical analysis, significant predictive factors of good outcome were: intermediate-1 DIPSS score at transplant, Rux-exposition pre-transplant and development of chronic GVHD. There was no correlation between clinical outcome and type of driver mutations, age at transplant, donor type, CR, source of stem cells. Conclusion(s): ASCT in MF is actually a valid therapeutic option for pts eligible to the procedure also in the Rux era. In our experience, earlier stage of MF at time of transplant and Rux exposition before transplant seem to have a favourable impact on the outcome post-ASCT; also a chronic GVHD seems to play a protective role for reducing relapse risk post-ASCT.",Excluded
2585,"[Effects of proton pump inhibitor on airway hyperresponsiveness in asthmatics with gastroesophageal reflux]. BACKGROUND: Previous data suggest the high incidence of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) in asthmatics, although the relationship between GER and the respiratory condition in asthmatics remain unclear. We investigated the incidence of GER in asthmatics and the association between the effects of proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) on respiratory functions and esophageal pH in asthmatics with GER., METHODS: Two hundreds ninety outpatients who attended our unit with asthma received GER symptoms questionnaire used at Mayo Clinic. Twenty three of them who answered to have any GER symptom were treated with PPI (lansoprazole 30 mg/day) for eight weeks, and investigated changes in the GER symptoms and peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR) before and after treatment. Furthermore, in six of twenty three, airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine and esophageal pH monitor for 24 hours were measured in order to evaluate the association between esophageal pH and the effect of PPI on GER during the test. Furthermore, the serum level of theophylline was analyzed for assessment of the PPI effect on theophylline metabolism., RESULTS: 150 of 290 asthmatics had answered to have any GER symptom including cough. Most of GER symptoms had improved except for cough after treatment with PPI. The airway hyperresponsiveness significantly improved after treatment with PPI (n=6, p<0.03), although PEF and FEV1 were not significantly changed., CONCLUSION: These results suggest that PPI may be an effective drug for asthmatics with GER through suppression of airway hyperresponsiveness.",Excluded
3132,"Effect of a proton pump inhibitor on postprandial gastric volume, emptying and symptoms in healthy human subjects: A pilot study. Background: In consensus guidelines, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are recommended for the treatment of functional dyspepsia. It is unclear whether PPIs change gastric volume or emptying. Aim(s): To assess the effect of a PPI, rabeprazole, on gastric volume and emptying and postprandial symptoms. Method(s): In a double-blind, parallel-group placebo-controlled trial, 13 healthy participants were randomized to rabeprazole, 20 mg b.d., or placebo. On day 3, fasting gastric volume was measured using intravenous 99mTc- pertechnate and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). After the last dose of study medication, an 111In-chloride egg meal (300 kcal) was ingested, and postprandial gastric volume and emptying were measured by SPECT. Symptom ratings using a visual analogue scale (fullness, nausea, bloating, abdominal pain, aggregate score) were obtained at baseline and 15, 30, 45, 60 and 75 min postprandially. Group comparisons were performed using Mann-Whitney rank sum test. Result(s): There were no statistically significant differences in gastric volume or emptying in the two groups. However, there was a borderline increase in gastric volume with rabeprazole compared with placebo. Rabeprazole treatment reduced aggregate postprandial symptoms, particularly fullness, 30 min after the meal (P = 0.01). Conclusion(s): In healthy participants, rabeprazole, 20 mg b.d., did not significantly change gastric emptying, but reduced symptoms and had a borderline effect on gastric volume postprandially.

BACKGROUND: Postal delivery workers spend a large proportion of their work time outdoors, placing them at increased risk of skin cancer. To date, no studies have examined occupational sun safety knowledge and practice within this group in the UK., AIMS: To describe the occupational sun safety knowledge and practice of UK postal delivery workers and to investigate the association of demographic, personal and occupational factors with knowledge and practice in order to identify potential strategies for improving sun safety in this occupational group., METHODS: Postal delivery workers completed a questionnaire that collected data on occupational sun safety knowledge and practice in addition to demographic, personal and workplace characteristics. One-way analysis of variances were applied to assess differences in knowledge and practice by these characteristics., RESULTS: A total of 1153 postal delivery workers completed the questionnaire, a 60% response rate. Thirty-three per cent reported receiving sun safety training within the previous 12 months. The majority of respondents reported correct knowledge on three of the six domains and good practice on four of the six behavioural domains. However, only one-fifth of respondents reported wearing sunglasses and ensuring a plentiful intake of water. Knowledge and practice differed significantly according to demographic, personal and workplace characteristics., CONCLUSIONS: There is a need to raise the profile of occupational skin cancer in this occupational group and to increase the priority given to occupational sun safety policies alongside targeted and tailored interventions, the effect of which can be evaluated.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of stepwise-reduced doses on objective and subjective image parameters and on oncologic readings in whole-body 18F-FDG PET/MRI. Methods: We retrospectively simulated the stepwise reduction of 18F-FDG doses of 19 patients (mean age +/- SD, 50.9 +/- 11.7 y; mean body mass index +/- SD, 22.8 +/- 3.2 kg/m2) who received a whole-body PET/MRI examination from 3 to 0.5 MBq/kg of body weight (kgBW) in intervals of 0.25. Objective imaging parameters were assessed by measuring the SUV and coefficient of variation in different regions (aorta, liver, spleen, kidney, small bowel, lumbar vertebra, psoas muscle, urinary bladder) as well as the noise-equivalent counting rates in each bed position. Subjective image quality was evaluated with a masked reading of each simulated PET compared with the dose of 2 MBq/kgBW. Oncologic reading was performed first according to PERCIST in each dose and second by defining malignant lesions in doses of 2 MBq/kgBW and the maximum dose image (gold standard). The diagnostic confidence of each lesion was measured using a Likert scale. Results: With decreasing doses, regions in the mid abdomen showed a stronger decrease of SUVmean and noise-equivalent counting rates than regions in the upper abdomen (SUVmean, -45% and -15% on average in the small bowel and the liver, respectively). The coefficient of variation showed a nonlinear increase, pronounced below 1.5 MBq/kgBW. Subjective image quality was stable over a range between 1.25 and 2.75 MBq/kgBW compared with 2 MBq/kgBW. However, large photopenic areas in the mid abdomen were observed in 2 patients. In the PERCIST reading, target lesions were above the liver threshold with a stable SUVpeak in all cases down to 2 MBq/kgBW. Eighty-six of 90 lesions were identified correctly with a dose of 2 MBq/kgBW; Likert scores did not differ significantly. Conclusion: A reduction of doses in 18F-FDG PET/MRI might be possible down to 2 MBq/kgBW in oncologic whole-body examinations. The image quality in the mid abdomen seems to be more affected by lower doses than in the upper abdomen, and in single cases large photopenic areas can occur. Therefore, we do not recommend reducing doses below 3 MBq/kgBW in adults at this time. Copyright © 2017 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging.",Excluded

Purpose To assess the efficacy and feasibility of concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) plus preradiation and postradiation chemotherapy for patients with nonmetastatic gastric carcinoma who do not undergo surgery. Methods and Materials Patients with inoperable (due to medical comorbid conditions or patient's refusal to undergo surgery) or unresectable gastric cancer received up to 2 21-day cycles of preradiation and postradiation chemotherapy (docetaxel 37.5 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8, cisplatin 25 mg/m2 on days 1-3, and a continuous infusion of fluorouracil [FU] 750 mg/m2 on days 1-5), respectively. CCRT between preradiation and postradiation chemotherapy was initiated on day 43 and consisted of intensity modulated radiation therapy (50.4 Gy) plus concurrent docetaxel 20 mg/m2 weekly for 6 weeks. Results 36 patients were evaluable; 21 patients with comorbid conditions were unsuitable for surgery (group 1), 8 had unresectable disease (group 2), and 7 refused surgery (group 3). The clinical complete response (cCR) rate for the 36 evaluable patients was 36% (95% confidence interval [CI], 19%-53%) and the overall response rate was 83% (95% CI, 75%-97%). The median survival time and estimated 2-year survival rate were 25.8 months (95% CI, 7.1-44.5 months) and 52% (95% CI, 38%-67%), respectively. The estimated median OS and 2-year OS rates for groups 1, 2, and 3 were 37.0 months (95% CI, 7.9-66.1 months) and 52% (95% CI, 31%-73%), 17.7 months (95% CI, 7.8-27.6 months) and 20% (95% CI, 0%-49%), and 38.9 months (95% CI, 16.6-58.3 months) and 67% (95% CI, 30%-100%), respectively. Achieving a cCR was associated with significantly better overall survival (P=.004) and progression-free survival (P=.003). The most common grade 3 or greater toxicity during the chemotherapy phase was neutropenia. Common grade 3/4 toxicities during CCRT were nausea and vomiting.

Background: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) was the predominant leukemia in a recent study of Chornobyl cleanup workers from Ukraine exposed to radiation (UR-CLL). Radiation risks of CLL significantly increased with increasing bone marrow radiation doses. Current analysis aimed to clarify whether the increased risks were due to radiation or to genetic mutations in the Ukrainian population. Method(s): A detailed characterization of the genomic landscape was performed in a unique sample of 16 UR-CLL patients and age- and sex-matched unexposed general population Ukrainian-CLL (UN-CLL) and Western-CLL (W-CLL) patients (n = 28 and 100, respectively). Result(s): Mutations in telomere-maintenance pathway genes POT1 and ATM were more frequent in UR-CLL compared to UN-CLL and W-CLL (both p < 0.05). No significant enrichment in copy-number abnormalities at del13q14, del11q, del17p or trisomy12 was identified in UR-CLL compared to other groups. Type of work performed in the Chornobyl zone, age at exposure and at diagnosis, calendar time, and Rai stage were significant predictors of total genetic lesions (all p < 0.05). Tumor telomere length was significantly longer in UR-CLL than in UN-CLL (p = 0.009) and was associated with the POT1 mutation and survival. Conclusion(s): No significant enrichment in copy-number abnormalities at CLL-associated genes was identified in UR-CLL compared to other groups.

988,"Simulation of inflorescence dynamics in oil palm and estimation of environment-sensitive phenological phases: a model based analysis. For oil palm, yield variation is in large part due to variation in the number of harvested bunches. Each successively-produced phytomer carries a female (productive), male or aborted inflorescence. Since phytomer development takes 3-4 years and nearly two phytomers are produced per month, many inflorescences develop in parallel but have different phenological stages. Environment-dependent developmental rate, sex and abortion probability determine bunch productivity, which, in turn, affects other phytomers via source-sink relationships. Water deficit, solar radiation, temperature and day length are considered key external factors driving variation. Their impact is difficult to predict because of system complexity. To address this question we built a simple model (ECOPALM) to simulate the variation in number of harvested bunches. In this model, trophic competition among organs, expressed through a plant-scale index (Ic), drives sex determination and inflorescence abortion during specific sensitive phases at phytomer level. As a supplemental hypothesis, we propose that flowering is affected by photoperiod at phytomer level during a sensitive phase, thus, contributing to seasonal production peaks. The model was used to determine by parameter optimisation the influence of Ic and day length on inflorescence development and the stages at which inflorescences are sensitive to these signals. Parameters were estimated against observation of number of harvested bunches in Ivory Coast using a genetic algorithm. The model was then validated with field observations in Benin and Indonesia. The sensitive phases determined by parameter optimisation agreed with independent experimental evidence, and variation of Ic explained both sex and abortion patterns. Sex determination seemed to coincide with floret meristem individualisation and occurred 29-32 months before bunch harvest. The main abortion stage occurred 10 months before harvest - at the beginning of rapid growth of the inflorescence. Simulation results suggest involvement of photoperiod in the determination of bunch growth dynamics. This study demonstrates that simple modelling approaches can help extracting ecophysiological information from simple field observations on complex systems.",Excluded
2900,"Diagnostic Accuracy of Fluoroscopy, Radiography, and Computed Tomography in Detecting Cement Leakage in Kyphoplasty. Purpose Cement leakage is a typical complication of kyphoplasty for vertebral fractures. It is unclear if cement application intraoperatively can be improved by using other techniques of visualization and which kind of postoperative imaging should be recommended to detect cement extravasation accurately. Objective To compare the rates of cement leakage detected by intraoperative fluoroscopy, postoperative radiography, and postoperative computed tomography (CT) in a retrospective study. Patients and Methods The study included 78 patients (60 women and 18 men; 115 vertebral bodies) who were treated with two kinds of kyphoplasty. The patients underwent intraoperative fluoroscopy and postoperative radiography and CT. After surgery, the images were evaluated to compare cement leakage rates and locations in the three visualization techniques. Leakage locations were described as epidural, intradiskal, extravertebral, or intravascular. Results Compared with CT, intraoperative fluoroscopy regularly detected intradiskal leakage (75%) but had a considerably lower sensitivity for visualizing epidural (21%), extravertebral (31%), and intravascular (51%) cement leakages. A comparison of radiography and CT showed that radiography had a high sensitivity for detecting intradiskal (82%) and intravascular (70%) cement extrusions but a lower sensitivity in identifying epidural (42%) and extravertebral (50%) leaks. Therefore, the CT scan overall was best in detecting location and accuracy. Conclusion CT detected more cement leaks than any of the other investigated techniques, especially epidural, extravertebral, and intravascular cement leakages. To achieve the best accuracy, only CT provides complete information.Copyright © 2018 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart - New York.",Excluded

Although adrenal scintigraphy with 131I-6 beta-iodomethyl-19-norcholesterol (NCL-6-131I) was used for the first noninvasive imaging of the adrenal glands, it has the disadvantages. These are: (i) relatively high radiation dose to patients, (ii) the long time required for completion of the scan. To solve these problems, 123I-labeled 6 beta-iodomethyl-19-norcholesterol (NCL-6-123I) was synthesized and was used for adrenal scintigraphy in 6 cases. Successful images were obtained with 185 MBq (5 mCi)-260 MBq (7 mCi) of NCL-6-123I, and optimal time required for the satisfactory scan was 2-3 days after the administration. The estimate radiation dose was reduced by using 185 MBq (5 mCi) of NCL-6-123I instead of 18.5 MBq (0.5 mCi) of NCL-6-131I. From the result of this clinical study, NCL-6-123I was preferred for the adrenal scintigraphy.",Excluded
169,"Axon initial segment Kv1 channels control axonal action potential waveform and synaptic efficacy. Action potentials are binary signals that transmit information via their rate and temporal pattern. In this context, the axon is thought of as a transmission line, devoid of a role in neuronal computation. Here, we show a highly localized role of axonal Kv1 potassium channels in shaping the action potential waveform in the axon initial segment (AIS) of layer 5 pyramidal neurons independent of the soma. Cell-attached recordings revealed a 10-fold increase in Kv1 channel density over the first 50 microm of the AIS. Inactivation of AIS and proximal axonal Kv1 channels, as occurs during slow subthreshold somatodendritic depolarizations, led to a distance-dependent broadening of axonal action potentials, as well as an increase in synaptic strength at proximal axonal terminals. Thus, Kv1 channels are strategically positioned to integrate slow subthreshold signals, providing control of the presynaptic action potential waveform and synaptic coupling in local cortical circuits.",Excluded

66,"Urolithiasis and Frequent CT Scans: Does Chronic Pain Play a Role?. INTRODUCTION: Urolithiasis is among the top 10 causes of Emergency Department (ED) visits in the United States. Approximately 50% of these patients undergo abdominopelvic CT scan, many more than once. We hypothesized that chronic pain conditions may contribute to frequent CT scans in patients who are evaluated in ED for urolithiasis., METHODS: A retrospective review of patients presenting to our tertiary care and the associated satellite EDs for urolithiasis, during the period 12/2012-05/2013, was performed. Patients with multiple ED visits and two or more abdominopelvic CT scans in any 6-month period were labeled as the frequent CT group. Control group consisted of similar patients who had no more than one CT scan in any 6-month period. Background information, number of CT scans for urolithiasis and other reasons, and the presence of chronic pain (established pain clinic visits, chronic pain medication, known chronic pain syndromes) were captured from charts. Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Fisher's exact test were used to compare variables. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify predictors associated with frequent CT scans., RESULTS: We identified 185 patients with frequent CTs and 139 patients in the control arm. Frequent CT scans were independently associated with chronic pain (odds ratio [OR]: 2.67, confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.55, 4.50), age (OR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.60, 0.89), history of prior urolithiasis (OR: 2.15, 95% CI: 1.11, 4.15), and Medicaid insurance status (OR: 3.94, 95% CI: 1.66, 9.35)., CONCLUSION: Chronic pain is a significant contributing factor to frequent CT scans among patients presenting to ED with urolithiasis, leading to increased radiation exposure and healthcare costs.",Excluded
1917,"Reduction of the radiation dose and the amount of contrast material in hepatic dynamic CT using low tube voltage and adaptive iterative dose reduction 3-dimensional. The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate the image quality and the diagnostic ability of low tube voltage and reduced contrast material dose hepatic dynamic computed tomography (CT) reconstructed with adaptive iterative dose reduction 3-dimensional (AIDR 3D). Eighty-nine patients underwent hepatic dynamic CT using one of the 2 protocols: tube voltage of 120 kVp, contrast dose of 600 mgI/kg, and filtered back projection in Protocol A (n = 46), and tube voltage of 100 kVp, contrast dose of 500 mgI/kg, and AIDR 3D in Protocol B (n = 43). The volume CT dose index (CTDIvol) and size-specific dose estimates (SSDEs) were compared between the 2 groups. Objective image noise and tumor to liver contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were also compared. Three radiologists independently reviewed image quality. The jackknife alternative free-response receiver-operating characteristic (JAFROC) analysis was performed to compare diagnostic performance. The mean CTDIvol and SSDE of Protocol B (14.3 and 20.2, respectively) were significantly lower than those of Protocol A (22.1 and 31.4, P < .001). There were no significant differences in either objective image noise or CNR. In the qualitative analysis, 2 readers assigned significant lower scores to images of Protocol B for at least one of the 3 phases regarding overall image quality (P < .05). There was no significant difference in the JAFROC1 figure of merit between protocols.Low tube voltage CT with AIDR 3D yielded a reduction in radiation dose and in the amount of contrast material while maintaining diagnostic performance.",Excluded
3535,"Role of salvage radiation therapy for patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma who failed autologous stem cell transplant. Purpose: To analyze, through chart review, the efficacy of salvage radiation therapy (sRT) for relapsed or progressive Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) patients who failed autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). Patients and Methods: Among 347 patients with recurrent/refractory HL who received ASCT from 1986-2006, 163 had post-ASCT progression or relapse. Of these, 56 received sRT and form the basis of this report. Median age at sRT was 30 years (range, 17-59 years). Disease was confined to lymph nodes in 27 patients, whereas 24 had both nodal and extranodal disease. Salvage radiation therapy alone was given in 34 patients (61%), and sRT plus chemotherapy was given in 22 (39%). Median interval from ASCT to sRT was 0.8 years (range, 0.1-5.6 years). The median dose was 35 Gy (range, 8-40.3 Gy). The sRT technique was extended-field in 14 patients (25%) and involved-field in 42 (75%). Result(s): The median follow-up from sRT was 31.3 months (range, 0.2-205.5 months). Overall response rate was 84% (complete response: 36%; partial response: 48%). The median overall survival was 40.8 months (95% confidence interval, 34.2-56.3 months). The 5-year overall survival was 29% (95% confidence interval, 14%-44%). The 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 16%; the 2-year local PFS was 65%, whereas the 2-year systemic PFS was 17%. The 1-year PFS was higher in patients in whom all diseased sites were irradiated (49%) compared with those in whom only the symptomatic site was treated (22%, P=.07). Among 20 alive patients, 5 were disease free (at 6.4, 6.8, 7.4, 7.9, and 17.1 years). Conclusion(s): For patients with HL who fail ASCT, a selective use of RT provides a durable local control rate of 65% at 2 years and should be considered as part of the standard management plan for the palliation of incurable HL. Occasionally irradiation of truly localized disease can lead to long-term survival. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
3139,"Effect of flowable thrombin-containing collagen-based hemostatic matrix for preventing pancreatic fistula after pancreatectomy: A randomized clinical trial. Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a flowable hemostatic matrix, and their effects for postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) after pancreatectomy. Method(s): This was a randomized, clinical, single-center, single-blind (participant), non-inferiority, phase IV, and parallel-group trial. The primary endpoint was the incidence of POPF. The secondary endpoints were risk factors for POPF, drain removal days, incidence of complication, 90-day mortality, and length of hospital stay. Result(s): This study evaluated a total of 53 patients, of whom 26 patients were in the intervention group (flowable hemostatic matrix) and 27 patients were in the control group (thrombin-coated collagen patch). POPF was more common in the control group than in the intervention group (59.3% vs. 30.8%, p = 0.037). Among participants who underwent distal pancreatectomy, POPF (33.3% vs. 92.3%, p = 0.004), and clinically relevant POPF (8.3% vs. 46.2%, p = 0.027) was more common in the control group. A multivariate logistic regression model identified flowable hemostatic matrix use as an independent negative risk factor for POPF, especially in cases of distal pancreatectomy (DP) (odds ratio 17.379, 95% confidential interval 1.453-207.870, p = 0.024). Conclusion(s): Flowable hemostatic matrix application is a simple, feasible, and effective method of preventing POPF after pancreatectomy, especially for patients with DP. Non-inferiority was demonstrated in the efficacy of preventing POPF in the intervention group compared to the control group.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

1836,"A phase i study on the combination of neoadjuvant radiotherapy plus pazopanib in patients with locally advanced soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities. Accumulating evidence suggests significant synergism combining radiotherapy (RT) with angiogenesis targeted therapies. This multicenter prospective phase I clinical trial established the safety profile and recommended dose for further studies of pazopanib concurrent with preoperative RT in patients with extremity soft tissue sarcomas (ESTS) in curative setting.Methods. Patients with deep seated intermediate and high grade sarcomas, >= 5 cm, received once daily pazopanib (dose-escalation cohorts 400 mg, 600 mg and 800 mg) for 6 weeks and 50 Gy preoperative RT starting Day 8. Surgery was performed 5-7 weeks later. Toxicity was scored according to CTC criteria 4.0. Dose limiting toxicities (DLT) were divided into two separate sets; DLT-I being toxicities occurring during the 6-week chemoradiotherapy period within the radiation portals until day of surgery (designated as DLT-I) and those occurring perioperatively until Day 21 after surgery (DLT-II).Results. A total of 12 patients were enrolled, 11 were evaluable (3 females and 8 males, median age 58 years, range 24-78 years, median tumor size 9 cm, range 5-15 cm). Ten underwent surgery. No increased toxicity inside the radiation fields was seen, but two of 10 patients (one each in the 400 mg and 600 mg cohorts) showed delayed wound healing after surgery. None of the patients showed significant volume reductions after RT. Evaluation of the resection specimen showed pathological (near) complete responses (>= 95% necrosis rate) in four of 10 cases. Unexpectedly, grade 3 + hepatotoxicity led to premature pazopanib interruption in three of 11 (27%) of cases.Conclusion. Apart from hepatotoxicity, neoadjuvant pazopanib 800 mg daily in combination with 50 Gy seems tolerable; the regimen appears to demonstrate promising activity in ESTS and is the recommended dose for further studies.Copyright © 2015 Informa Healthcare.",Excluded
1689,"Postoperative chest radiograph after open reduction internal fixation of clavicle fractures: a necessary practice?. Hypothesis/Background: Iatrogenic pneumothorax is a rare but serious complication of open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of clavicular fractures. Many institutions use postoperative chest radiographs to evaluate for this complication despite a lack of data to support this routine practice. Due to concerns of radiation exposure and health care costs, this practice may not be necessary. This study determined the rate of iatrogenic pneumothorax after clavicular ORIF with plate fixation at a single institution over 8 years. We hypothesized that postoperative chest radiographs would identify a very low rate of pneumothorax in patients with isolated clavicular fractures with no serious preoperative pulmonary injury. Method(s): A retrospective review was performed identifying all patients undergoing clavicular ORIF with plate fixation at a single Level I trauma center by 3 board-certified orthopedic surgeons from 2009 to 2017. Patients without at least 1 postoperative chest radiograph were excluded. We determined patient demographics and rate of preoperative and postoperative pneumothorax. Result(s): We identified 89 patients without preoperative pneumothorax who underwent clavicular ORIF with at least 1 postoperative chest radiograph. Within this group, no patients (0%) had a new postoperative iatrogenic pneumothorax. Discussion/Conclusion: Within this series of 89 patients with isolated clavicular fractures without preoperative pneumothorax, no iatrogenic pneumothoraces occurred after plate fixation. Therefore, for patients undergoing ORIF of isolated clavicular fractures obtaining a postoperative chest radiograph may be an unnecessary practice, especially given their low sensitivity. Future high-powered studies are needed to validate this finding.Copyright © 2018 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees",Excluded
1864,"Characteristic imaging findings predicting the risk of conservative treatment resistance in fresh osteoporotic vertebral fractures with poor prognostic features on magnetic resonance imaging. Background: Recent studies have reported that confined high-intensity and diffuse low-intensity on sagittal T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are distinctive features that are highly predictive of delayed union or nonunion on osteoporotic vertebral fracture (OVF). The objective of this study was to identify the characteristics of imaging findings predicting the risk for requiring surgical treatment in fresh OVF with poor prognostic features on MRI. Method(s): We conducted a retrospective study of 74 patients (17 men and 57 women with a mean age of 81.1 years) of OVF with the poor prognostic MRI findings. We compared the imaging findings between the surgery group (16 patients) and the conservative group (58 patients): vertebral instability defined as the difference between the vertebral collapse ratio in dynamic X-rays, and the grade of posterior wall injury (Grade I, no spinal canal encroachment; Grade II, <2 mm; Grade III, >=2 mm) as well as the presence or absence of pedicle fracture (Grade I, none; Grade II, unilateral; Grade III, bilateral) on computed tomography. Result(s): The mean vertebral instability was 24.0% +/- 10.1% in the surgery group and 13.0% +/- 7.8% in the conservative group, which was significantly different. Posterior wall injury in the surgery and conservative groups was Grade I in 0 and 29 cases, Grade II in 5 and 21 cases, and Grade III in 11 and 8 cases, respectively, constituting a significant difference. Pedicle fracture in the surgery and conservative groups was Grade I in 5 and 55 cases, Grade II in 6 and 2 cases, and Grade III in 5 and 1 case, respectively, also constituting a significant difference. Conclusion(s): The most high-risk OVF patients with poor prognostic MRI findings who required surgical treatment were those who exhibited greater vertebral instability as well as either more severe posterior wall injury or pedicle fracture.

912,"Dosimetric comparison of lateral opposing fields in moderate-to-severe active TAO retro-orbital irradiation. Background: To evaluate and compare the dosimetric advantages of lateral opposing fields (LOF) and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in moderate-to-severe active thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) retroorbital irradiation. Material(s) and Method(s): Fifty-eight TAO patients who underwent radiotherapy from 2012 to 2018 were chosen. LOF and IMRT plans were separately developed for each patient. The independent samples t-test was used to compare the differences among conformity index (CI), homogeneity index (HI), dose received by the maximal 95% of the target (D95), and organs-at-risk (OAR) doses between the two groups. Pearson's correlation analysis was used to analyze the relationship between exophthalmos and OAR dose. Result(s): CI and HI in the IMRT group were better than those in the LOF group, but crystal, eyeball, and optic nerve dose were higher than those in the LOF group (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in D95 (P=0.261). In the LOF group, exophthalmos was negatively correlated with crystal and eyeball dose (P= 0.000). However, there was no correlation between these indicators in the IMRT group (P>0.05). In the LOF group, the median observation time was 26 months; the CT value of post-ball adipose tissue, exophthalmos, and clinical activity score was lower than those before treatment (P=0.000), and eyesight was better than that before treatment (P=0.000); 10% (2/20) had dry eyes and 5% (1/20) had decreased vision. Conclusion(s): LOF is safer than IMRT and can make full use of the high exophthalmos of TAO patients to reduce OAR dose.Copyright © 2021 Novin Medical Radiation Institute.

397,"Low-tube voltage 100 kVp MDCT in screening of cocaine body packing: image quality and radiation dose compared to 120 kVp MDCT. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of a reduced tube potential (100 kVp) for non-enhanced abdominal low-dose CT on radiation dose and image quality (IQ) in the detection of body packing., METHODS: This retrospective study was approved by the local research ethics committee of our clinic. From March 2012 to July 2014, 99 subjects were referred to our institute with suspected body packing. 50 CT scans were performed using a 120 kVp protocol (group A), and 49 CTs were performed using a low-dose protocol with a tube voltage of 100 kVp (group B). Subjective and objective IQ were assessed. DLP and CTDIvol were analyzed., RESULTS: All examinations were of diagnostic IQ. Objective IQ was not significantly different between the 120 kVp and 100 kVp protocol. Mean density of solid and liquid body packets was 210 +/- 60.2 HU at 120 kVp and 250.6 +/- 29.7 HU at 100 kVp. Radiation dose was significantly lower in group B as compared to group A (p < 0.05). In group A, body packs were detected in 16 (32%) of the 50 patients. In group B, packets were observed in 15 (31%) of 49 patients. Laboratory analysis detected cocaine in all smuggled body packs., CONCLUSIONS: Low-tube voltage 100 kVp MDCT with automated tube current modulation in screening of illegal drugs leads to a diagnostic IQ and significant dose reduction compared to 120 kVp low-tube voltage protocols. Despite lower radiation dose, liquid and solid cocaine containers retain high attenuation and are easily detected.",Excluded
215,"Recovery kinetics in mouse skin and CaNT tumours. Recovery kinetics and recovery capacity were studied in a fast proliferating normal tissue, skin, and in an anaplastic mouse mammary carcinoma, CaNT. Three fractions per day of X-rays, repeated over 5 days, were given at varying interfraction intervals from 0 to 8 h. The rate of recovery in tumours (t1/2 = 0.31 +/- 0.15 h for local control) was significantly faster than in skin (t1/2 = 0.96 +/- 0.10 h). By contrast, the fractionation sensitivity of CaNT tumours was less than that of skin (alpha/beta = 43.3 +/- 8.5 Gy vs. alpha/beta = 7.9 +/- 0.2 Gy). Tissues with recovery half-times similar to or longer than that determined for skin would be at risk if interfraction intervals less than 6 h are used in regimes which involve the use of two or more fractions per day. This would be especially true for tissues that show a greater sensitivity to dose fractionation, and hence more sparing of radiation damage with hyperfractionation.",Excluded
1082,"A preliminary experience of moderate-intensity stereotactic body radiation therapy for ultra-central lung tumor. Purpose: Administration of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to ultra-central (UC) lung tumors, generally defined as those abutting the proximal bronchial trees, is difficult due to concerns about serious toxicities. Therefore, our institution has performed moderate-intensity SBRT. Patients and Methods: Patients with UC tumors underwent SBRT at a dose of 50-60 Gy in 10 fractions, with Dmax in the target volume not exceeding 110% of the prescribed dose. The primary outcomes were tumor response and overall survival (OS). Result(s): From January 2017 to September 2018, we treated eight patients who had been diagnosed with UC tumors. The median follow-up time was 8.6 months (range: 2.7-14.9). Five of the eight patients (62.5%) showed a complete response (CR), two (25%) had a partial response (PR), and one (12.5%) had stable disease (SD); the response and disease control rates were 87.5% and 100%, respectively. Seven patients were alive with no evidence of disease or with controlled disease until the last follow-ups, except for one patient who died due to a non-RT cause at 3 months after SBRT. One patient experienced grade 2 esophageal pain and another had grade 1 cough. No grade 3 or higher toxicities were reported. Conclusion(s): Moderate-intensity SBRT might aid in achieving good control of UC tumors without excessive toxicities. Future studies involving larger numbers of patients and longer follow-up times are warranted to confirm the efficacy and feasibility.© 2019, Copyright © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group LLC.",Excluded

Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed 208 consecutive patients (146 men and 62 women) with NSCLC treated with 3D-CRT. The median age of the patients was 64 years (range 35-87 years). The clinical and treatment parameters including gender, age, performance status, sequential chemotherapy, concurrent chemotherapy, presence of carinal or subcarinal lymph nodes, pretreatment weight loss, mean dose to the entire esophagus, maximal point dose to the esophagus, and percentage of volume of esophagus receiving >55 Gy were studied. Clinical and dosimetric factors for radiation-induced acute and late grade 3-5 esophageal injury were analyzed according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) criteria. Result(s): Twenty-five (12%) of the two hundred and eight patients developed acute or late grade 3-5 esophageal injury. Among them, nine patients had both acute and late grade 3-5 esophageal injury, two died of late esophageal perforation. Concurrent chemotherapy and maximal point dose to the esophagus >=60 Gy were significantly associated with the risk of grade 3-5 esophageal injury. Fifty-four (26%) of the two hundred and eight patients received concurrent chemotherapy. Among them, 25 (46%) developed grade 3-5 esophageal injury (P=0.0001<0.01).

1232,"Modifications of the cutaneous microrelief in the superficial radiation-induced fibrosis: Qualitative study. Cutaneous radiation-induced fibrosis (RIF) is characterized by a skin retraction or atrophy, toughness to the palpation and often entails functional limitation. Its clinical evaluation remains poorly quantified. The aim of this study was to propose an analytical method to quantify RIF skin surface with the replica technique. In this preliminary study, we report the qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the cutaneous microrelief in 44 healthy controls and in four patients presenting a superficial RIF, 3 to 20 years after radiotherapy for cancer. The microrelief of these RIF presented an abnormal anisotropy with a parallel reorganization of cutaneous valleys in three cases out of four, suggesting a premature radiation-induced ageing of the skin. Each subject being his own control, the relative vertical amplitude of the skin microrelief was +/- 15% in control skin. Vertical amplitude was respectively increased by 84% in one inflammatory fibrosis (3 years after RT), decreased by 18% in one evolutive fibrosis (6 years after RT), decreased by 26% in one voluminous stabilized fibrosis (8 years after BT) and decreased by 53% in one atrophic fibrosis (20 years after BT). The present study suggests that the variations of the microrelief parameters could reflect the RIF evolution.

The authors of this retrospective study examine patient data from a single center to determine if low-dose ( 14 Gy). METHOD(S): Based on the formula for ellipsoid volumes, the tumor volumes were calculated using measurements from MR images obtained at follow up in patients treated at the authors' center. Follow-up data were available in 159 patients with a mean age of 59.5 +/- 14.2 years at treatment. Fifty-six percent of the patients were women and 53.5% of the tumors were located on the right side of the brain. The mean tumor volume was 3.3 +/- 4.3 cm3 with 10% of the tumors having volumes larger than 8 cm3. After GKS, smaller tumors (> or = 40% decrease in volume) were observed in 44.8% of patients treated with a low dose and in 48.8% treated with a high dose. Enlarged tumors (> or = 40% increase in volume) were seen in 5.2% of the patients receiving a low dose and 2.3% of those receiving a high dose. These differences were not statistically significant. Patients who had been followed up for longer than 5 years after treatment had median residual volumes of only 28.2% of the starting volume in the low-dose group and 26% in the high-dose group. This difference was statistically not significant.

2888,"Reduced ultraviolet-induced DNA damage and apoptosis in human skin with topical application of a photolyase-containing DNA repair enzyme cream: Clues to skin cancer prevention. The exposure of human skin to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) results in the formation of DNA photolesions that give rise to photoaging, mutations, cell death and the onset of carcinogenic events. Photolyase (EC 4.1.99.3) is a DNA repair enzyme that reverses damage caused by exposure to UVR. We sought to investigate whether addition of photolyase enhances the protection provided by a traditional sunscreen (SS), by reducing the in vivo formation of cyclobutane-type pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and UVR-induced apoptosis in human skin. Ten volunteers (Fitzpatrick skin type II) were exposed to solar-simulated (ss) UVR at a three times minimal erythema dose for 4 consecutive days. Thirty minutes prior to each exposure, the test materials [vehicle, SS (sun protection factor 50) alone, and SS plus photolyase from Anacystis nidulans] were applied topically to three different sites. One additional site was left untreated and one received ssUVR only. Biopsy specimens were taken 72 h after the last irradiation. The amount of CPDs and the extent of apoptosis were measured by ELISA. Photolyase plus SS was superior to SS alone in reducing both the formation of CPDs and apoptotic cell death (both P<0.001). In conclusion, the addition of photolyase to a traditional SS contributes significantly to the prevention of UVR-induced DNA damage and apoptosis when applied topically to human skin.",Excluded

Introduction: The incidence of immunosuppression in patients with oropharynx head & neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is not well studied. This study evaluates disease characteristics and treatment outcomes in oropharynx SCC in patients with and without immunosuppression. Method(s): A retrospective review of all patients treated with radiotherapy for oropharynx SCC at BC Cancer from 2011 to 2016 was performed. Survival outcomes were assessed using Kaplan-Meier methods and competing risk analysis. Multivariate analysis and propensity score matching were performed. Result(s): There were 1077 patients, of which 5.8% (n = 62) had an immunosuppressive medical condition or were taking long-term immunosuppressive medication at diagnosis. Median follow-up was 3.3 years. Three year OS for patients without immunosuppression was 79.5% (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 76.8-82.0%) and for those with immunosuppression was 64.6% (95% CI 50.9-75.3%) (hazard ratio [HR] 1.78, 95% CI 1.18-2.68, p = 0.0062). The three year disease recurrence for patients without immunosuppression was 24.9% (95% CI 22.2-27.7%) and 44.4% (95% CI 31.5-56.6%) for those with immunosuppression (HR 2.12, 95% CI 1.45-3.11, p = 0.0001). Multivariate analysis of disease free survival (DFS) found that active smoking, advanced TNM stage, base of tongue subsite, p16 negative and unknown, no concurrent chemotherapy, higher Charlson Comorbidity Index, and lower radiation dose were also associated with worse DFS (all p < 0.05). Immunosuppressed patients had worse DFS relative to patients without immunosuppression, p < 0.001, HR 1.97 (95% CI 1.33-2.91).

The aim of this study was to make direct measurements of the possible radiation-induced EPR signals in the teeth of volunteers who were residents in Fukushima within 80 km distance from the Fukushima Nuclear Power plant at the time of the disaster, and continued to live there for at least 3 month after the disaster. Thirty four volunteers were enrolled in this study. These measurements were made using a portable L-band EPR spectrometer, which was originally developed in the EPR Center at Dartmouth. All measurements were performed using surface loop resonators that have been specifically designed for the upper incisor teeth. Potentially these signals include not only radiation-induced signals induced by the incident but also background signals including those from prior radiation exposure from the environment and medical exposure. We demonstrated that it is feasible to transport the dosimeter to the measurement site and make valid measurements. The intensity of the signals that were obtained was not significantly above those seen in volunteers who had not had potential radiation exposures at Fukushima.Copyright © The Author 2016.

Observation included 35 patients suffering from degenerative joints and disc disease (mean age 56.5 years) undergoing radon water therapy and control group that consisted of 15 osteoarthritis patients (mean age 54.2) without contact with radon water. Before therapy and after 18 days of treatment, serum total antioxidant status (TAS) was assessed with the use of standard colorimetric assay. Results. In the study group, we observed trends to increase TAS concentration, whereas, in the control group, TAS concentration was decreasing. Conclusions. (1) Radon waters treatment influenced the level of TAS of osteoarthritis patients treated with the radon water. (2) The change in TAS concentrations in the study group may be the result of low doses of ionizing radiation, but further studies on larger patient's groups are demanded.

2056,"Histopathology of arteriovenous malformations after gamma knife radiosurgery. Stereotactic radiosurgery effectively obliterates many arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Hemodynamic changes in AVMs after radiosurgery have been illustrated using magnetic resonance imaging and angiography, but there have been no detailed reports describing the underlying histopathological changes. This study examines AVMs at various times after gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) and describes the histopathological changes that lead to vessel occlusion. The authors examined nine AVM specimens obtained 10 months to more than 5 years after GKRS, by using routine histopathological stains as well as immunohistochemical techniques to detect smooth-muscle actin, factor VIII, and type IV collagen. Blood vessels within the AVMs showed progressive changes leading to narrowing or obliteration of the lumen. The earliest changes after gamma knife irradiation appear to be damage to endothelial cells, followed by progressive thickening of the intimal layer caused by proliferation of smooth-muscle cells that elaborate an extracellular matrix that includes type IV collagen. Finally, cellular degeneration and hyaline transformation occur. For statistical correlation analyses, the specimens were graded according to the degree of histopathological change and the relative number of vessels showing such changes. Both of these parameters were significantly correlated with time after GKRS and with AVM size reduction shown on follow-up imaging studies. Gamma knife radiosurgery of AVMs causes endothelial damage, which induces the proliferation of smooth-muscle cells and the elaboration of extracellular collagen by these cells, which leads to progressive stenosis and obliteration of the AVM nidus. This series of pathological changes in AVMs after GKRS is essentially similar to the response-to-injury model of atherosclerosis.",Excluded
1750,"Doctors' knowledge of radiation -- a two-centre study and historical comparison. AIM: To investigate knowledge of the use of ionizing radiation in 2010 and whether there has been any change in this knowledge since the study was first undertaken over 7 years ago. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In both studies a single chest x-ray was classed as one unit of radiation. Doctors from all grades were asked to evaluate the average radiation dose incurred with 13 commonly undertaken radiological procedures, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), etc. Answers within 20% of the actual dose were marked as correct. RESULTS: Two hundred and forty-two questionnaires were completed (130 in 2003; 112 in 2010). Equal numbers of juniors, middle grades, and consultants were questioned, and scores were comparable (23.3% in 2003; 29.4% in 2010). The majority of doctors (92% in 2003; 86% in 2010) correctly noted that ultrasound and MRI involve no radiation. Doctors underestimated the radiation doses of all investigations by a smaller margin in 2010 compared to 2003 (i.e., more accurately), with only one exception: CT of the abdomen. CONCLUSION: Despite evidence of some improvement, doctors of all grades still have a very poor knowledge of radiation exposure even with the most common investigations. The worsening appreciation of the radiation involved in CT scanning is especially worrying considering its increasing use in practice today.",Excluded
2444,"Phase I study of involved-field radiotherapy preceding autologous stem cell transplantation for patients with high-risk lymphoma or Hodgkin's disease. PURPOSE: This Phase I study was designed to evaluate the tolerability of involved-field radiotherapy (IFRT) to areas of persistent disease in patients with high-risk Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas before autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty-one patients with primary refractory or relapsed Hodgkin's disease (n = 13) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 18) were treated with IFRT followed by high-dose chemotherapy and ASCT. All patients had bulky disease (> or =5 cm) and/or an inadequate response to salvage chemotherapy. The IFRT dose was escalated to a maximum of 36 Gy. Dose-limiting toxicity was defined as Grade 3-4 Bearman toxicity (life-threatening/fatal toxicity occurring within 28 days of ASCT). The chemotherapy regimen consisted of cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and carmustine., RESULTS: The delivered dose of IFRT was 20 Gy in 9 patients, 28-30 Gy in 20, and 32-36 Gy in 2 patients to mediastinal (n = 19) and nonmediastinal (n = 12) sites. The median interval between IFRT completion and ASCT was 19 days. One patient developed Bearman Grade 3 hepatic toxicity. No other Grade 3 or 4 Bearman toxicity was observed. An increased requirement for i.v. narcotics was observed in patients treated with mediastinal IFRT vs. nonmediastinal IFRT (p = 0.02). A trend toward increased mucositis severity was seen in patients previously treated with a larger number of chemotherapy agents (p = 0.09) and in those with a shorter interval between IFRT and ASCT (p = 0.12). Pulmonary toxicity was more common in patients treated with mediastinal IFRT than in those treated with nonmediastinal IFRT (21% vs. 0%, p = 0.13). The 2-year overall and progression-free survival rate was 70% and 49% for all patients, 84% and 50% for patients with Hodgkin's disease, and 59% and 47% for patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, respectively., CONCLUSION: The maximal tolerated dose of IFRT was not reached when Grade 3-4 Bearman toxicity was dose limiting. Increased pulmonary toxicity and mucositis severity was seen after mediastinal IFRT compared with nonmediastinal IFRT. Because local control was excellent, higher doses of IFRT are not recommended. The absolute benefit of IFRT in this patient population needs investigation in future studies.",Excluded
1613,"Immune events associated with protection in C57BL/6 mice immunized with anti-idiotypic antibodies mimicking protective antigens shared between gamma-irradiated cercariae vaccine and human resistance model of Schistosoma haematobium. Immunoregulation is central for successful manipulation of schistosomiasis. Unlike schistosome vaccine development strategies that relied on direct selection of antigens from crude responses leading to selection of mildly protective antigens, the present study tested the utility of selection of potentially protective antigens encompassed rounds of immunoregulation via idiotypic network. Anti-idiotypic antibodies (Ab2) were purified from sera of New Zealand white rabbits multiply immunized with gamma-irradiated cercariae of S. haematobium, using adult worm specific idiotypes (Ab1) purified from sera of subjects resistant to reinfection. Ab2 was used for immunization of C57BL/6 mice and consequences of immunization were monitored before and after challenge infection with S. haematobium. Results showed an increase of splenic T cell expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and very late antigen-4 (VLA-4) upon immunization (average % stimulated cells 54.9 vs. 20.4, P < 0.05 for ICAM-1 and 31.1 vs. 6.6, P < 0.01 for VLA-4) and challenge, especially at day 6 (83.5 vs. 45.6, P < 0.01) for ICAM-1 and day 10 (50.4 vs. 20.8, P < 0.05) for VLA-4. Thereafter, both adhesion molecules declined at day 28 through 90. Similarly, lymphoproliferation was manifested upon immunization (OD570-630 0.27 vs. 0.09, P < 0.01) and challenge at day 6 (0.5 vs. 0.17, P < 0.01) through day 10 (0.49 vs.0.18, P < 0.05), then declined at day 28 through 90. Moreover, sera of Ab2-immunized mice exhibited an anti-anti-ids (Ab3) reactivity against antigens of approximate molecular weight 40, 80 and 160 kDa of adult worms, which were also recognized by Ab1. However, in contrast to Ab1, Ab3 showed no surface binding to 3 hr schistosomula. Strikingly, mice immunized with Ab2 showed strong resistance to challenge infection (approximately 82% reduction in worm burden, P < 0.001). Taking all, this alternative vaccine development strategy appears to filter out non-protective antigens. Indeed Ab3 recognizes much fewer numbers of antigens, which passed through two rounds of immune regulation. These antigens appear to represent a significant proportion of the protective response in the gamma-irradiated cercariae vaccine and human resistance model as well, providing the basis for an alternative vaccine for schistosomiasis.",Excluded
1907,"Size-specific dose estimates for chest, abdominal, and pelvic CT: Effect of intrapatient variability in water-equivalent diameter. Purpose: To develop software to automatically calculate size-specific dose estimates (SSDEs) and to assess the effect of variations in water-equivalent diameter (Dw) along the z-axis on SSDE for computed tomographic (CT) examinations of the torso. Material(s) and Method(s): In this institutional review board-approved, HIPAA-compliant, retrospective study, a software program was used to calculate Dw at each image position in 102 consecutive CT examinations of the combined chest, abdomen, and pelvis. SSDE was calculated by multiplying the size-dependent conversion factor and volume CT dose index (CTDIvol) at each image position. The variations in Dw along the z-axis were determined for six hypothetical scanning ranges: chest alone; abdomen alone; pelvis alone; chest and abdomen; abdomen and pelvis; and chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Mean SSDE was calculated in two ways: (a) from the SSDE at each position and (b) from the mean CTDIvol over each scan range and the conversion factor corresponding to Dw at the middle of the scan range. Linear regression analysis was performed to determine the correlation between SSDE values calculated in these two ways. Result(s): Across patients, for scan ranges 1-6, the mean of the difference between maximal and minimal Dw within a given patient was 5.2, 4.9, 2.5, 6.0, 5.6, and 6.5 cm, respectively. The mean SSDE values calculated by using the two methods were in close agreement, with root mean square differences of 0.9, 0.5, 0.5, 1.4, 1.0, and 1.1 mGy or 6%, 3%, 2%, 9%, 4%, and 6%, for the scan ranges of chest; abdomen; pelvis; chest and abdomen; abdomen and pelvis; and chest, abdomen, and pelvis, respectively. Conclusion(s): Using the mean CTDIvol from the whole scan range and Dw from the image at the center of the scan range provided an easily obtained estimate of SSDE for the whole scan range that agreed well with values from an image-by-image approach, with a root mean square difference less than 1.4 mGy (9%).Copyright © RSNA, 2015.",Excluded

The Gamma Knife Icon (Elekta AB, Stockholm) is a cobalt-based stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) unit to support the use of a thermoplastic mask in lieu of a rigid frame, using an onboard cone-beam CT (CBCT) and an intrafraction motion management system (IFMM). We retrospectively reviewed 124 patients treated with Gamma Knife SRS from January 2018 to December 2019 at our institution using a mask-based immobilization system. Patient and treatment characteristics were collected and summarized as well as interfraction shifts and treatment-related outcomes. This dataset includes 124 patients with an associated 358 intracranial tumors. Twenty-four patients presented with primary brain tumors, which included 14 meningiomas and 10 other histologies, with 100 patients having brain metastases. Sixty tumors were post-operative, while 298 were intact. The median dose for primary tumors was 25 Gy in 5 fractions. Median doses to metastases were 20 Gy in 1 fraction, 27 Gy in 3 fractions, and 25 Gy in 5 fractions. Median interfraction CBCT shifts were submillimeter. Median patient follow-up was 6.28 months. 91% of patients with metastases maintained local control. Our early clinical experience has demonstrated limited toxicity profiles and high patient tolerance, which suggests that mask-based Gamma Knife SRS provides a safe alternative option for frameless SRS. Patients with large target volumes where fractionation is preferred or with small target volumes in non-eloquent areas can be considered for this approach. Response rates are encouraging, and continued follow-up is necessary to investigate long-term control and survival.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
476,"Does exposure to static magnetic fields generated by magnetic resonance imaging scanners raise safety problems for personnel?. MRI workers are occupationally exposed to static and time-varying gradient magnetic fields. While the 24-hour time-averaged exposure to static magnetic fields is about a few mT, the maximum static field strength can be as high as 500 mT during patient setup. Over the past several years, our laboratory has performed extensive experiments on the health effects of exposure of animal models and humans to different sources of electromagnetic fields such as cellular phones, mobile base stations, mobile phone jammers, laptop computers, radars, dentistry cavitrons and MRI. This study is to investigate the adverse health effects in MRI workers and also to assess the effect of exposure of MRI workers to static magnetic fields on their cognitive functions. In the first phase of this study a questionnaire was designed to collect information from 120 MRI personnel. The collection of data about the adverse health effects was based on self-reporting by the participants. In the second phase, 47 volunteer university students were asked to continuously move around a 1.5 T MRI scanner. Visual reaction time and working memory tests were performed on all participants before and after the experiment. Forward digit span and backward digit span were used for assessing the working memory. Furthermore, participants were asked to report the symptoms they had experienced during the movement. The first phase of our study showed increased frequencies of adverse health effects in MRI workers. In this study the rates of self-reported symptoms such as a headache, sleep problems, myalgia, palpitation, fatigue, concentration problems, attention problems, nervousness and backpain were possibly affected by static magnetic field. Furthermore we found that reaction time and working memory could be influenced by the movements of the body around a MRI scanner. It can be concluded that movement through a high magnetic field can also lead to some adverse cognitive effects in MRI staff.Copyright © 2018, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.

Aim: This study compares angular stable intramedullary nailing with volar plating for the treatment of displaced fractures of the distal radius. Material(s) and Method(s): In a prospective randomized trial patients with extraarticular fractures of the distal radius (AO 23 A3) were randomly assigned to receive either palmar plating (PP) (2.4mm, Synthes, USA) or intramedullary nailing (TDR) (Targon DR, Aesculap, Germany). Follow up examinations were performed 8 weeks and 2 years post surgery. Result(s): 152 patients (129 female and 23 male, mean age 62.9+/-15.6 years) were included and randomly assigned to receive either PP (n = 72) or TDR (n = 80). Complete clinical and radiological follow up was obtained in 122 patients. All fractures united. The mean palmar tilt was 2.2degree for palmar plating and 2.9degree for intramedullary nailing. Significant differences within groups (p < 0.05, students-t-test, posthoc: Bonferroni) were recorded for time for surgery (Targon DR: 41+/-21 min; 2.4mm plate: 51+/-18 min) for x-ray time (Targon DR: 1.2+/-0.3 min; 2.4mm plate: 0.9+/-0.2 min) as well as for early pain and motor function (Targon DR: VAS 1.2+/-0.2, Ext./Flex. 82%; 2.4mm plate: VAS 1.6+/-0.4, Ext./Flex. 76%). No differences were seen after two years. Osteopenic bone loss as measured by pQCT was seen in 73% of cases and qualitiy of life assessment (SF 36) revealed excellent social and physical function without differences within groups. Complications were CTS (4 PP, 2 TDR), temp. paresthesia of the superficial n. radialis branch (2 TDR), screw overlength (n = 2 PP, n = 2 TDR), intraarticular screw location (n = 2 PP) or extensor tendon affection (n = 4 PP). Conclusion(s): Intramedullary nailing for distal radial fractures is advantageous in terms of pain reduction and early motion when compared to volar plating. The late functional results of both techniques are comparable as well as the fixation stability in osteoporotic fractures.",Excluded
2411,"A comparison of normal tissue complication probability of brain for proton and photon therapy of canine nasal tumors. This study compared the calculated normal tissue complication probability of brain in dogs with a nasal tumor, which had both photon and proton treatment planning. Nine dogs diagnosed with a variety of histologies, but all with large, caudally located nasal tumors were studied. Three-dimensional (3-D) photon dose distribution, and a proton dose distribution was calculated for each dog. To calculate the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) for brain, the partial brain volume irradiated with the prescribed dose was determined, then a mathematic model relating complications to partial volume and radiation dose was used. The NTCP was always smaller for proton plans as compared to photon plans, indicating conformation of the dose to the target allows a higher dose to be given. If a 5% NTCP were accepted, the mean applicable dose for this group of dogs was 50.2 Gy for photons, but 58.3 Gy for protons. Not all dogs would benefit the same from proton irradiation. If a large partial brain volume has to be irradiated, the advantage becomes minimal. There is also a minimal advantage if the planning target volume (PTV) includes a small, superficial brain volume. However, for a complex PTV shape the degree of conformation is clearly superior for protons and results in smaller calculated NTCPs.",Excluded
1134,"Neoadjuvant proton beam irradiation vs. adjuvant ruthenium brachytherapy in transscleral resection of uveal melanoma. Background: Uveal melanoma is the most common primary ocular malignancy in adults in the USA and Europe. The optimal treatment of large uveal melanoma is still under debate. Radiation therapy has its limitation due its eye-threatening secondary complications and is therefore often combined with surgical excision of the tumor. Method(s): In a retrospective interventional review, we evaluated in total 242 patients with uveal melanoma that underwent transscleral tumor resection with a predefined protocol, either with adjuvant ruthenium brachytherapy (Ru-106 group, n 136,), or with neoadjuvant proton beam therapy (PBT group, n 106). Kaplan-Meier estimates with log-rank test were used to show survival curves and a multivariable Cox regression model was used to calculate adjusted rate ratios. Result(s): Local tumor recurrence rates after 3 and 5 years were 4% (95% CI 1.2-17.8%) and 9.1% (95% CI 2.9-27.3%), respectively, in the PBT group and 24.6% (95% CI 15.8-37.1%) and 27.5 (95% CI 17.8-41.1%), respectively, in the Ru-106 group. This leads to an overall recurrence rate almost 4 times higher in the Ru-106 group compared to the PBT group. After adjusting for the a priori confounders and the tumor distance to optic disc and ciliary body infiltration, the adjusted risk of tumor recurrence was 8 times (RR 7.69 (2.22-26.06), p < 0.001) higher in the Ru-106 group as compared to the PBT group. Three- and 5-year metastatic rates were 23.2% (95% CI 5.6-37.1%) and 31.8% (95% CI 20.7-46.8%), respectively, in the PBT group and 13.2% (95% CI 6.8-24.9%) and 30.3% (95% CI 18.3-47.5%), respectively, in the Ru-106 group. There was no statistically significant difference in the overall metastasis rate between the two groups even after adjusting for possible confounders. Conclusion(s): Transscleral resection of large uveal melanomas combined with neoadjuvant proton beam therapy leads to a lower local tumor recurrence rate compared to transscleral tumor resection with adjuvant ruthenium brachytherapy. There was no statistically significant difference in the occurrence of rubeosis iridis, neovascular glaucoma, and in the need for enucleation later on.Copyright © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded

Introduction: Preoperative Planning is an important part of surgical treatment in patients with lower extremity. The aim of the study is to assess recently released web based software, ""Click2correct"" during preoperative planning of patients with lower extremity trauma. The angular deformity and length measurements of fractured bones is highly dependent to taken reference points. The new proposed system offer easy tools for standardization in determination of reference points, which were aimed to tested in the present study. Material(s) and Method(s): Twentyfour patients (eight females and sixteen males) with lower extremity fracture were admitted sequentially to orthopaedics and traumatology department of the same university. All patients were examined with direct x rays. The from fracture distorted and deformed bones were assessed with measurement tools of the PACS system of the Hospital. The radiographs were also uploaded to the click2correct web site. The angular deormity and leg length changes were also assessed by two researchers. The accuracy, and reliability were tested statistically between researchers and their measurements. Result(s): There were found positive correlations interobservers and intraoberver measurements in terms of assesment of angular deformity and shortening of fractured bones. Before decision of treatment modality the positional analysis of fractured bone parts of tibia and femurs has to be evaluated. The preoperative planning softwares aims to ease these procedure. The recently released software announced web based working solution as an advantage. Also new tools were offered during determination of reference points during measurement for standardization. The present study has found consistency between measurements. Furthermore virtual fracture reduction facility, which also guides in proper implant selection and placement was found useful.

Clostridium difficile spores persist in hospital environments for an extended period. We evaluated whether admission to a room previously occupied by a patient with C. difficile infection (CDI) increased the risk of acquiring CDI. DESIGN. Retrospective cohort study. SETTING. Medical intensive care unit (ICU) at a tertiary care hospital. METHODS. Patients admitted from January 1, 2005, through June 30, 2006, were evaluated for a diagnosis of CDI 48 hours after ICU admission and within 30 days after ICU discharge. Medical, ICU, and pharmacy records were reviewed for other CDI risk factors. Admitted patients who did develop CDI were compared with admitted patients who did not. RESULTS. Among 1,844 patients admitted to the ICU, 134 CDI cases were identified. After exclusions, 1,770 admitted patients remained for analysis. Of the patients who acquired CDI after admission to the ICU, 4.6% had a prior occupant without CDI, whereas 11.0% had a prior occupant with CDI (P=.002 ). The effect of room on CDI acquisition remained a significant risk factor (P=.008) when Kaplan-Meier curves were used. The prior occupant's CDI status remained significant (P=.01; hazard ratio, 2.35) when controlling for the current patient's age, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III score, exposure to proton pump inhibitors, and antibiotic use. CONCLUSIONS. A prior room occupant with CDI is a significant risk factor for CDI acquisition, independent of established CDI risk factors.

2960,"Intracranial germ cell tumors: A singleinstitution experience. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Intracranial germ cell tumors (GCTs) are not a common disease. We reviewed the experience of a single institution to determine the variables that affect treatment outcome. DESIGN AND SETTING: A retrospective review of patients with the diagnosis of intracranial germ cell tumors treated in a single institution (KFSHRC) during the period from March 1985 to December 2007. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with the diagnosis of intracranial GCT were recorded in the KFSHRC Tumor Registry during the period from 1985 to 2007. Seven patients with a pineal region tumor treated as germinomas in the earlier years without a tissue diagnosis were excluded. This retrospective study was restricted to the remaining 50 patients with a tissue or marker diagnosis: 31 germinomas and 19 non-germinomatous germ cell tumors (NGGCTs). RESULT(S): The 10-year overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) were 87%, 88% and 96% for patients with germinoma, with a median follow-up of 4.5 (range 2-17) years, compared with 26%, 29% and 46% for patients with NGGCT with a median follow-up of 3 (range 1.5-13) years. For NGGCT, variables favorably influencing OS were younger age (< 16 y vs >=16 y, P=.01), higher radiation dose (>50 Gy vs <=50 Gy; P=.03) and later year of diagnosis (>1990 vs <1990 P=.002). CONCLUSION(S): Tissue diagnosis of GCTs is mandatory prior to treatment except for patients with elevated markers. In germinoma, localized radiotherapy (RT) for M0 patients may be adequate. Long-term follow-up is needed to define the benefit of adding chemotherapy. For NGGCT, the use of combined modality treatment and RT dose >50 Gy are important factors that influence the outcome.

3586,"The tumor-stroma ratio is an independent predictor for survival in nasopharyngeal cancer. Background: The tumor-stroma ratio (TSR) has been identified as a new and practicable prognostic histological characteristic of solid tumors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of the TSR in nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC). Patients and Methods: A total of 93 patients who presented with NPC from 2004 to 2007 were studied. Radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy was administered according to their Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) stages. The TSR was assessed visually on hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue sections of biopsy specimens by 2 independent observers. Result(s): The 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 66.67% and 54.91%, respectively, in the stroma-poor group and 40.48% and 33.33%, respectively, in the stroma-rich group. Both the 5-year OS and DFS rates in the stroma-poor group were significantly better than those in the stroma-rich group (p < 0.05).

1973,"DNA damage and repair: fruit and vegetable effects in a feeding trial. Epidemiologic studies have examined the association between fruit and vegetable (F&V) consumption and the risk of cancer. Several cancer-preventive mechanisms have been proposed, such as antioxidant properties and modulation of biotransformation enzyme activities; both may be associated with reducing DNA damage and hence the mutation rate. We investigated, in a randomized, controlled, crossover feeding trial, the effect of 10 servings/day of botanically defined F&V for 2 wk on endogenous DNA damage; resistance to gamma -irradiation damage; and DNA repair capacity in lymphocytes, measured by the Comet assay. We also explored the association between the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism and serum bilirubin concentrations and DNA damage and repair measures. Healthy men (n = 11) and women (n = 17), age 20 to 40 yr, provided blood samples at the end of each feeding period. Overall, F&V did not affect DNA damage and repair measures in lymphocytes. The number of UGT1A1*28 alleles was inversely associated with sensitivity to gamma -irradiation exposure and DNA repair capacity, but a biological mechanism to explain this association is unclear. A larger sample size is needed to investigate the association between bilirubin concentrations and endogenous DNA damage. With inconsistent findings in the literature, additional dietary intervention studies on the effect of F&V on DNA damage and repair are needed.",Excluded
1849,"4DMRI-based investigation on the interplay effect for pencil beam scanning proton therapy of pancreatic cancer patients. Background: Time-resolved volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (4DMRI) offers the potential to analyze 3D motion with high soft-tissue contrast without additional imaging dose. We use 4DMRI to investigate the interplay effect for pencil beam scanning (PBS) proton therapy of pancreatic cancer and to quantify the dependency of residual interplay effects on the number of treatment fractions. Method(s): Based on repeated 4DMRI datasets for nine pancreatic cancer patients, synthetic 4DCTs were generated by warping static 3DCTs with 4DMRI deformation vector fields. 4D dose calculations for scanned proton therapy were performed to quantify the interplay effect by CTV coverage (v95) and dose homogeneity (d5/d95) for incrementally up to 28 fractions. The interplay effect was further correlated to CTV motion characteristics. For quality assurance, volume and mass conservation were evaluated by Jacobian determinants and volume-density comparisons. Result(s): For the underlying patient cohort with CTV motion amplitudes < 15 mm, we observed significant correlations between CTV motion amplitudes and both the length of breathing cycles and the interplay effect. For individual fractions, tumor underdosage down to v95 = 70% was observed with pronounced dose heterogeneity (d5/d95 = 1.3). For full x 28 fractionated treatments, we observed a mitigation of the interplay effect with increasing fraction numbers. On average, after seven fractions, a CTV coverage with 95-107% of the prescribed dose was reached with sufficient dose homogeneity. For organs at risk, no significant differences were found between the static and accumulated dose plans for 28 fractions. Conclusion(s): Intrafractional organ motion exhibits a large interplay effect for PBS proton therapy of pancreatic cancer. The interplay effect correlates with CTV motion, but can be mitigated efficiently by fractionation, mainly due to different breathing starting phases in fractionated treatments.

3408,"Assessment of peak skin dose in interventional cardiology: A comparison between Gafchromic film and dosimetric software em.dose. OBJECTIVE: To compare the use of a dose mapping software to Gafchromic film measurement for a simplified peak skin dose (PSD) estimation in interventional cardiology procedure., METHODS: The study was conducted on a total of 40 cardiac procedures (20 complex coronary angioplasty of chronic total occlusion (CTO) and 20 coronary angiography and coronary angioplasty (CA-PTCA)) conducted between January 2014 to December 2015. PSD measurement (PSDFilm) was obtained by placing XR-RV3 Gafchromic under the patient's back for each procedure. PSD (PSDem.dose) was computed with the software em.dose©. The calculation was performed on the dose metrics collected from the private dose report of each procedure. Two calculation methods (method A: fluoroscopic kerma equally spread on cine acquisition and B: fluoroscopic kerma is added to one air Kerma cine acquisition that contributes to the PSD) were used to calculate the fluoroscopic dose contribution as fluoroscopic data were not recorded in our interventional room. Statistical analyses were carried out to compare PSDFilm and PSDem.dose., RESULTS: The PSDFilm median (1st quartile; 3rd quartile) was 0.251(0.190;0.336)Gy for CA-PTCA and 1.453(0.767;2.011)Gy for CTO. For method-A, the PSDem.dose was 0.248(0.182;0.369)Gy for CA-PTCA and 1.601(0.892;2.178)Gy for CTO, and 0.267(0.223;0.446)Gy and 1.75 (0.912;2.584)Gy for method-B, respectively. For the two methods, the correlation between PSDFilm and PSDem.dose was strong. For all cardiology procedures investigated, the mean deviation between PSDFilm and PSDem.dose was 3.4+/-21.1% for method-A and 17.3%+/-23.9% for method-B., CONCLUSION: The dose mapping software is convenient to calculate peak skin dose in interventional cardiology.

To compare the effects of Fexofenadine, Chlorpheneramine and Betametasone on eosinophil count and IgE levels. To compare the cost effectiveness of the Fexofenadine, Chlorpheneramine and Betametasone in the treatment of Allergic Rhinitis. Material(s) and Method(s): A prospective study was done over a period of 1 month (20th July 2012 to 20th August 2012) over 75 people aged between 15 to 45 years including males and females at Warangal. They were divided into 3 groups. Group I (n: 25) used Fexofenadine 120 mg, O.D., for 14 days. Group II (n: 25) used CPM 4 mg, O.D., for 14 days. Group III (n: 25) used Betametasone 0.5 mg, B.D., for 7 days. Presenting complaints with duration, personal history of exposure to any allergens, family history of any allergies, general examination of the patient, ENT examination, Investigations: CBP with DLC, Absolute eosinophil count, X-Ray of paranasal sinuses, Skin test for allergy, IgE levels in the serum. Result(s): The three drugs Fexofenadine, Chlorpheneramine and Betametasone were found to have similar levels of efficacy in controlling the symptoms of allergic rhinitis. The physical signs improved better with Chlorpheneramine than the other two drugs. Fexofenadine was found to be most effective in suppression of skin reactions to the allergens. It was closely followed by Betametasone and then Chlorpheneramine. The anti-histamine, Fexofenadine and Chlorpheneramine had no significant effect on the absolute eosinophil count and serum IgE levels whereas Betametasone had significant effect. The Cost burden is extremely low on patients using CPM followed by betamethasone than n fexofenadine. Conclusion(s): According to the results Fexofenadine, CPM Betamethasone have almost equally therapeutic efficacy. Betamethasone cannot be given for very long time because of its wide range of side effects. In rural place like Warangal(KMC) where people can't effort money for treatment, CPM is the better drugbecause it has equal therapeutic efficacy and cost burden is very less compared to othersit is at an affordableprice.",Excluded
2453,"Ultrasonographic diagnosis of fibrolipomatous hamartoma of the median nerve: A report of two cases of carpal tunnel syndrome. [Turkish, English]. Fibrolipomatous hamartoma (FLH) is a rare, slow-growing benign tumor characterized by fibrofatty proliferation. FLH is most commonly seen in the median nerve. Herein, underscoring the role of ultrasound in their diagnosis, we present two unusual cases of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) associated with FLH. Case 1: A 27-year-old man was referred with a likely diagnosis of CTS. He had pain and paresthesias in the right hand for the last one month. In the physical examination, he had macrodactyly in the 2nd and 3rd fingers on the right side. Tinel's sign and Phalen's maneuver were positive. Nerve conduction studies revealed a right-sided moderate CTS. Ultrasonographic imaging of right median nerve was consistent with FLH. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) also confirmed the diagnosis. At the 4th week follow-up visit, his complaints were found to have improved by conservative treatment (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and a static wrist splint in the neutral position). Case 2: A 38-year-old woman had pain, weakness and numbness in her left hand for the last one year. Neurological evaluation yielded sensory loss in the first three fingers on the left side. Additionally, Tinel's sign and Phalen's maneuver were positive. Nerve conduction studies revealed a left-sided severe CTS. Ultrasonographic imaging showed massive enlargement of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel consistent with FLH. MRI examination revaling the presence of characteristic coaxial cable appearance and spaghetti appearance, confirmed the diagnosis. The diagnosis of FLH is crucial for predicting the outcome when planning treatment for CTS. Electromyographic assessment can show the nerve damage and its severity; but it cannot reflect the possible underlying cause. Highlighting the role of ultrasound in the diagnosis of peripheral nerve pathologies due to its high spatial resolution, wide availability, easy applicability and lack of ionizing radiation, herein we advocate the initial use of ultrasonographic imaging for mass lesions.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: The smallest diagnostically appropriate amount of contrast medium should be used in coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA)., PURPOSE: To investigate the feasibility of prospectively ECG-triggered high-pitch CCTA using 30 mL of 270 mg I/mL contrast material, 80 kVp, and iterative reconstruction (IR)., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eighty-two consecutive patients underwent CCTA with a prospectively ECG-triggered high-pitch protocol. Forty-three patients were examined at 100 kVp with filtered back projection after 60 mL of 370 mg I/mL contrast material was administered. Another 39 patients were examined at 80 kVp with IR after 30 mL of 270 mg I/mL contrast material was administered. Subjective and objective image quality was evaluated for each patient. Radiation doses were estimated and compared., RESULTS: Mean attenuation, noise and signal-to-noise ratio in 80 kVp group were significantly lower than in 100 kVp group (all P < 0.05), while there was no significant difference in contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), although a trend towards a lower CNR in 80 kVp group was observed (P = 0.099). The subjective image quality between the two groups was not significantly different (P = 0.905). The effective dose and iodine load in 80 kVp group were reduced by 54% and 64%, respectively, when compared with 100 kVp group., CONCLUSION: Prospectively ECG-triggered high-pitch CCTA at 80 kVp with 30 mL of 270 mg I/mL contrast material and IR is feasible for patients with BMI less than 25 kg/m(2) and reduces radiation dose and iodine load when compared with the standard CCTA protocol.

2676,"Angiotensin receptor blockade: a novel approach for symptomatic radiation necrosis after stereotactic radiosurgery. Preclinical evidence suggests angiotensin blockade therapy (ABT) decreases late radiation toxicities. This study aims to investigate the association between ABT and symptomatic radiation necrosis (SRN) following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Resected brain metastases (rBM) and arteriovenous malformation (AVM) patients treated with SRS from 2002 to 2015 were identified. Patients in the ABT cohort were on therapy during SRS and at 1-month follow up. Kaplan Meier method and cumulative incidence model were used to analyze overall survival (OS) and intracranial outcomes. 228 consecutive patients were treated with SRS: 111 with rBM and 117 with AVM. Overall, 51 (22.4%) patients were in the ABT group: 32 (28.8%) in the rBM and 19 (16.2%) in AVM cohorts. Baseline characteristics were similar, except for higher Graded Prognostic Analysis (3-4) in the rBM (ABT: 25.0% vs. non-ABT: 49.0%, p = 0.033) and median age in the AVM (ABT: 51.4 vs. non-ABT: 35.4, p < 0.001) cohorts. In both populations, OS and intracranial efficacy (rBM-local control; AVM-obliteration rates) were statistically similar between the cohorts. ABT was associated with lower 1-year SRN rates in both populations: rBM, 3.1 versus 25.3% (p = 0.003); AVM, 6.7 vs. 14.6% (p = 0.063). On multivariate analysis, ABT was a significant predictive factor for rBM (HR: 0.17; 95% CI 0.03-0.88, p = 0.035), but did not reach statistical significance for AVM (HR: 0.36; 95% CI 0.09-1.52, p = 0.165). ABT use appears to be associated with a reduced risk of SRN following SRS, without detriment to OS or intracranial efficacy. A prospective trial to validate these findings is warranted.",Excluded
2300,"Correlation of pharyngeal residue with penetration- aspiration in post-radiotherapy nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia. Background: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) ranks first for head and neck malignancies, and radiotherapy is a recommended treatment. Most post-radiotherapy NPC patients experience oropharyngeal dysphagia that results in pharyngeal residue. Pharyngeal residue is thought to be a risk factor for aspiration-penetration. Objective(s): Examining the correlation between pharyngeal residue and penetration-aspiration in postradiotherapy NPC patients. Method(s): Participants have been identified since 2018 to find out the total number of NPC patients. In the period January-October 2019, identification of NPC patients was performed according to participant criteria. Participants were examined for fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES), pharyngeal residue using the Yale Pharyngeal Residue Severity Rating Scale (YPR-SRS), and penetration-aspiration using Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS). Statistical tests were used Spearman correlation test with p<0.05. Result(s): The highest participant's pharyngeal residue appeared in vallecula when given soft bolus (96.55%), and in pyriform sinus when given thick liquid bolus (72.41%). Most participants with soft bolus had the highest negative penetration (72.59%) and positive penetration in thick liquid bolus (51.72%), while most had negative aspirations with the lowest value (89.66%).

3380,"Experience with higher doses of radiotherapy in the postoperative treatment of glioblastoma multiforme: A single institutional report. Background: Glioblastoma multiforme is a highly aggressive tumour with median survival of approximately 14 months. Management consists of maximal surgical resection followed by postoperative chemoradiation with concurrent then adjuvant temozolamide. The standard radiotherapy dose is 60 Gy in 2-Gy fractions. Most tumour recurrences occur within the previous irradiation field. Regimens designed to deliver higher radiation dose to improve local control and enhance survival warrant investigation. Method(s): We report a single institutional experience of treatment of consecutive patients with glioblastoma multiforme, treated with resection, postoperative radiotherapy followed by concurrent and/or adjuvant chemotherapy. Finding(s): Of the 80 patients who entered the study, 68 completed the treatment course; there were 45 (66.2 %) male and 23 (33.8%) female patients with a mean age at diagnosis of 48.97 +/- 12.85 (21-75) years. At a median follow up of 19 months, 39 (57.3%) patients had evidence of tumour progression and 36 (52.9%) patients had died. Median overall survival for all patients was 16 months and progression-free survival for all patients was 6.02 months. All potential prognostic factors were analysed to evaluate their effects on overall survival. age of 50 years or younger, concurrent and adjuvant chemotherapy, and extent of surgery were significant. We noted a lower progression rate among patients who received higher doses of radiotherapy (>60 Gy; p = 0.03). Overall survival was also increased, but this was not significant. Interpretation(s): This study suggests that higher radiation doses (>60 Gy) can improve local control and potentially survival; prospective multicentric studies should be done to evaluate the effect of higher doses of conformal radiation on the outcomes of patients with glioblastoma multiforme.",Excluded

Of these 65 patients, 45 (69.2%) underwent the procedures bedside in ICU using portable DR, and 20 (30.8%) underwent the procedures at the intervention clinic, both performed by a single interventional radiologist. We retrospectively reviewed electronic medical records for clinical presentation, total procedural time, total radiation dose, total patient transfer time, and clinical outcomes. We performed an independent t test to compare the clinical effectiveness between the 2 groups. The technical and clinical success rates were 100% in both groups, and there were no procedure-related complications.

Although it is well known that radiation induces chromosomal aberrations, there is a lack of information on the in vivo dose-effect relationship in patients receiving iodine-131 treatment, and the results of previous studies are controversial. In this study, the sister chromatid exchange (SCE) method was employed to investigate acute and late chromosomal damage (CD) in the peripheral lymphocytes of 15 patients who received various doses of (131)I (259-3,700 MBq), either for thyrotoxicosis (TTX) or for ablation treatment in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). The SCE frequencies in cultured peripheral lymphocytes were determined before treatment (to assess basal SCE frequencies), on the 3rd day (to assess acute SCE frequencies) and 6 months later (to assess late SCE frequencies). The basal, acute and late SCE frequencies (mean+/-SD) were 3.19+/-0.93, 10.83+/-1.72 and 5.75+/-2.06, respectively, in the whole group, and these values differed significantly from each other ( P<0.001). In order to perform a quantitative evaluation of the present data and a comparative analysis with the results of previous studies reported in the literature, we defined acute and late effects using a ""damage ratio"" (DR) and a ""recovery ratio"" (RR), based on the basal, acute and late data for individual patients. No statistically significant difference was found in the DR between DTC and TTX patients (76.4%+/-11.5% vs 67.6%+/-9.0%), while the mean RR was higher in TTX patients than in the DTC group (75.2%+/-24.4% vs 36.8%+/-13.7%). The DR on the 3rd day was not related to the administered (131)I dose in the whole group, but a negative correlation was found between the (131)I dose and the RR at the 6th month (r=-0.60, P=0.04). The best fit for this relationship was obtained by a linear-quadratic model, as y=104.89x-28.4x(2)+38.1 ( R(2)=0.51, P=0.04). On the other hand, comparative analysis with the results of previous studies with comparable sampling times revealed that the best fit for the relationships between the administered dose of (131)I and DR and RR were obtained with a linear-quadratic model (Y=alpha D+beta D(2)) rather than a linear one. However, there was an interesting difference in comparison with in vitro studies, in that we found the coefficient beta to have a negative value, suggesting the disappearance of damaged lymphocytes from the peripheral circulation in a dose-dependent manner following (131)I treatment. Further studies are therefore needed to clarify the effect of the negative beta value on the biological dosimetry approach in continuous internal low LET radiation, as in the case of (131)I treatment.",Excluded
288,"Diagnostic accuracy of 320-row computed tomography as compared with invasive coronary angiography in unselected, consecutive patients with suspected coronary artery disease. Noninvasive coronary angiography with multislice computed tomography (CT) scanners is feasible with high sensitivity and negative predictive value. The radiation exposure associated with this technique, however, is high and concerns in the widespread use of CT have arisen. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of coronary angiography using 320-row CT, which avoids exposure-intensive overscanning and overranging. We prospectively studied 118 unselected consecutive patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) referred for invasive coronary angiography (ICA). All patients had 320-row CT within 1 week of ICA, which, together with quantitative analysis, served as the reference standard. Of the 65 out of 118 patients who were diagnosed as having CAD by ICA, 64 (98 %) were correctly identified at 320-row CT. Noteworthy, 320-row CT correctly detected CAD in 3 patients with atrial fibrillation and ruled out the disease in the other 8 patients. From 151 significant coronary stenoses detected on ICA, 137 (91 %) were correctly identified with 320-row CT. In the per-patient analysis, sensitivity and specificity of 320-row CT were 98 and 91 %, respectively. In the per-vessel analysis, sensitivity and specificity of 320-row CT were 93 and 95 %, respectively. In the per segment analysis, sensitivity and specificity of 320-row CT were 91 and 99 %, respectively. Diameter stenosis determined with the use of CT showed good correlation with ICA (P < 0.001, R = 0.81) without significant underestimation or overestimation (-3.1 +/- 24.4 %; P = 0.08). Comparison of CT with ICA revealed a significantly smaller effective radiation dose (3.1 +/- 2.3 vs. 6.5 +/- 4.2 mSv; P < 0.05) and amount of contrast agent required (99 +/- 51 vs. 65 +/- 42 ml, P < 0.05) for 320 row CT. The present study in an unselected population including patients with atrial fibrillation demonstrates that 320-row CT may significantly reduce the radiation dose and amount of contrast agent required compared with ICA while maintaining a very high diagnostic accuracy. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.",Excluded

783,"Cone beam computerized tomography: basics for digital planning in oral surgery and implantology. For the diagnosis of bone pathology, planning of complex implant-supported prosthetic restorations, and guaranteeing oral surgery that is as safe and free of complications as possible, a three-dimensional radiological display is frequently indicated. Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), which can cover a large part of the indications of the dental and oral surgical spectrum, represents an alternative to computed tomography. Moreover, the method offers the advantage that it can also be used in the dental practice, taking the existing radiation protection regulations into account. This guarantees optimum patient and user friendliness, because referral to a specialized CT facility is thus no longer necessary in most cases. In the first 12 months of the trials of the Planmeca Promax 3D at the Department of Dental Surgery and Radiology of the University Clinic for Oral and Maxillofacial Medicine in Graz, the overwhelming majority of referrals for CBCT (almost 90%) was concerned with the field of oral surgery and implantology. Oral surgical questions mainly covered aspects of wisdom tooth anatomy, position of impacted canines, premolars, and mesiodents, as well as cystic lesions. Diagnoses of the maxillary sinuses and the area of tooth preservation represented further indications. Apart from diagnostic purposes, the objective of the referrals was facilitating optimum preparation for the pending operation. In the area of implantology, this was combined frequently with pre- or post-augmentative three-dimensional digital therapy planning.

Introduction: The use of 80-kilovoltage (kV) tube voltage to reduce radiation exposure during coronary CT angiography has not been well studied. Method(s): We retrospectively identified 17 symptomatic patients without known coronary disease who were clinically referred for CCTA using 80 kV tube voltage. All patients were scanned using a 64-slice scanner. Two experienced readers assessed image quality within each coronary segment using a standard 18-segment model. Segments were graded on a 1-4 quality scale (4, excellent quality without artifacts 3, good quality with minor artifacts 2, adequate quality for stenosis assessment; 1, uninterpretable). In addition, signal (mean Hounsfield intensity of the left main coronary origin), noise (standard deviation of the signal), contrast (mean signal - subcutaneous adipose tissue signal), and obstructive (>= 50%) stenosis were assessed. Bismuth in-plane breast shielding was used in all female patients per institutional protocol. Result(s): Table 1 provides group data. The cohort consisted of predominantly young males with a mean BMI of 23 kg/m2 and mean pre-scan heart rate of 53 bpm. Mean image quality score was 2.9 +/- 0.3 and 94% (16/17) of scans were deemed adequate for interpretation (no uninterpretable segments). One scan was deemed inadequate for diagnostic purposes secondary to poor image quality (signal 448 HU) and poor pre-scan heart rate control (68 bpm). All female patients had diagnostic image quality. The mean total radiation dose for the coronary CTA was 0.6+/-0.1 millisieverts and total radiation exposure for the entire study (including timing bolus and scout images) was 1.3+/-0.7 mSv. Compared to previously reported studies and studies within our institution using 100kV tube voltage, noise levels in the current study were significantly higher. Conclusion(s): In this small sample, the clinical application of CCTA using 80 kV achieved very low radiation exposure with high diagnostic yield despite higher levels of image noise.

2211,"Radiation-induced rib fracture after stereotactic body radiotherapy with a total dose of 54-56 Gy given in 9-7 fractions for patients with peripheral lung tumor: impact of maximum dose and fraction size. BACKGROUND: Radiation-induced rib fracture after stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for lung cancer has been recently reported. However, incidence of radiation-induced rib fracture after SBRT using moderate fraction sizes with a long-term follow-up time are not clarified. We examined incidence and risk factors of radiation-induced rib fracture after SBRT using moderate fraction sizes for the patients with peripherally located lung tumor., METHODS: During 2003-2008, 41 patients with 42 lung tumors were treated with SBRT to 54-56 Gy in 9-7 fractions. The endpoint in the study was radiation-induced rib fracture detected by CT scan after the treatment. All ribs where the irradiated doses were more than 80% of prescribed dose were selected and contoured to build the dose-volume histograms (DVHs). Comparisons of the several factors obtained from the DVHs and the probabilities of rib fracture calculated by Kaplan-Meier method were performed in the study., RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 68 months. Among 75 contoured ribs, 23 rib fractures were observed in 34% of the patients during 16-48 months after SBRT, however, no patients complained of chest wall pain. The 4-year probabilities of rib fracture for maximum dose of ribs (Dmax) more than and less than 54 Gy were 47.7% and 12.9% (p = 0.0184), and for fraction size of 6, 7 and 8 Gy were 19.5%, 31.2% and 55.7% (p = 0.0458), respectively. Other factors, such as D2cc, mean dose of ribs, V10-55, age, sex, and planning target volume were not significantly different., CONCLUSIONS: The doses and fractionations used in this study resulted in no clinically significant rib fractures for this population, but that higher Dmax and dose per fraction treatments resulted in an increase in asymptomatic grade 1 rib fractures.",Excluded
2271,"The expression of PDGF-BB predicts curative effect in locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated by radiotherapy. Radiotherapy is the major approach and is well tolerated in locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). And nowadays, no effective biological markers have been identified for predicting the prognosis of patients with ESCC. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is associated with a poor prognosis of various malignancies. The present study aimed to assess the effect of PDGF-BB on radiotherapeutic responses of ESCC and the underlying mechanisms of its roles in ESCC. Serum from 68 cases that received neoadjuvant or radical radiotherapy was obtained before and during radiotherapy. Gene expression analyses were validated by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The prognosis of patients with significantly reduced PDGF-BB was probably better than that of the others found in the progression-free survival and overall survival groups. Depletion of PDGFB significantly suppressed the proliferation, invasion and migration of cancer cells. Inhibiting PDGFB induced cellular apoptosis and promoted the sensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR). Furthermore, IR inhibited PDGF-BB-induced migration by blocking the PI3K/AKT pathway in ESCC cells. We found that the expression of PDGF-BB provided a possible model for predicting ESCC radiotherapy. It can also be used as a prognostic indicator for locally advanced ESCC that was treated by radiotherapy.",Excluded
1385,"Potential for radiation dose savings in abdominal and chest CT using automatic tube voltage selection in combination with automatic tube current modulation. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the simultaneous use of automatic tube current modulation (ATCM) and automatic tube voltage selection (ATVS) for abdominal and chest CT examinations regarding radiation dose reduction and image quality. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We enrolled 617 patients who all underwent contrastenhanced chest or abdominal CT and divided them into two groups. In group A, 317 patients who underwent CT with only ATCM and a fixed body mass index-adjusted tube voltage (120 kV or 100 kV) were enrolled. In group B, both ATCM and ATVS were used. Image attenuation and noise were measured in different anatomic regions. RESULTS. The mean contrast-to-noise ratio and the signal-to-noise ratio of abdomen and chest CT was higher in group B compared with group A (p < 0.0001). In total, the effective radiation doses for abdomen and chest CT examinations were significantly reduced in group B by 18% compared with group A (p < 0.0001). When only examining those who benefited from the ATVS tool, a dose reduction of 35% for chest CT and 42% for abdomen CT could be achieved (p < 0.0001 for each). CONCLUSION. The simultaneous use of ATVS and ATCM enables significant radiation dose reduction in abdominal and thoracic contrast-enhanced CT examinations compared with the use of ATCM alone. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded
67,"Gamma knife radiosurgery for trigeminal neuralgia: Results and potentially predictive parameters - Part I: Idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia. OBJECTIVE: Gamma knife radiosurgery (GKR) is an increasingly used, minimally invasive treatment option for patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN) refractory to medical therapy. This retrospective study evaluates the long-term results and side effects of GKR in the treatment of TN focusing on potentially predictive factors. METHOD(S): One hundred sixty patients with TN were included in this study (minimum follow-up, >6 mo; mean, 37.4 mo; range, 6-144 mo). In 92 patients, GKR represented the first nonmedical option (""primary GKR""). In 68 patients, invasive treatments had been previously attempted. All patients were treated using a single 4-mm collimator shot targeting the pontine trigeminal root entry zone with a maximal dose of 75 to 95 Gy. Brainstem dose exposure never exceeded 15 Gy. Treatment outcome results were classified as Grade I (pain-free with no pharmacological treatment), Grade II (pain-free with pharmacological treatment), and Grade III (no result). Data were analyzed using the log-rank test for univariate analysis and the ordered logit model for multivariate analysis. RESULT(S): In the overall series, 98 (61%) out of 160 patients reached a Grade I outcome, 45 (29%) reached a Grade II outcome, and 17 (10%) patients had no results from GKR. These results were encouraging for patients with typical facial pain features and for patients treated by a ""primary"" gamma knife. Considering the global outcome, the most effective and safest dose was found to be in the 80 to 90 Gy range. CONCLUSION(S): According to our experience, GKR represents a reliable second-line therapeutic approach for TN after pharmacological failure. Favorable prognostic factors include ""primary GKR"" and maximal GKR dose ranging between 80 and 90 Gy. Copyright © by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.",Excluded
286,"Effects of X-irradiation on the immune response of guinea pigs to Q fever vaccine. The immune response of guinea pigs to Q fever vaccine following 75 to 250 R (60 to 180 rads) of acute whole-body irradiations was investigated. Complement-fixing (CF) antibody titers and protection against febrile response to challenge with virulent Coxiella burnetii were studied. Exposures ranging from 75 to 250 R, 24 hours prior to inoculation, did not detectably alter the CF antibody response. Similar results were observed with 175 R delivered 48 or 72 hours before immunization. Protection against febrile response to challenge with 10(3) median fever doses of C. burnetii was seen in animals irradiated with 175 R, 24 or 72 hours before immunization. Significant protection was detectable at 14, 21, and 42 days after immunization in both irradiated and nonirradiated animals. Acute irradiation of the degree studied increases the mortality in normal animals infected 15 to 17 days later with virulent C. burnetii. The lethal effect could be prevented by use of Q fever vaccine.",Excluded
2280,"Effectiveness and limitations of human identification from cremains: A report of two cases. The present study of two case reports of the victims of the Great East Japan Earthquake demonstrates the effectiveness and limitations of using dental cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging of cremains as a means of identification. In case 1, identification was assisted by further expanding the age range of the cremains evaluated on macroscopy by obtaining CBCT images of the cremated maxilla. The findings of case 2 presented the possibility that the deceased and the candidate were the same person by superimposing the CBCT images of the cremated patella on the X-ray of the candidate. However, since cremated bones are deformed to varying degrees, it is clear that the images obtained before, rather than after, cremation are more effective in comparing post-mortem and ante-mortem images. Thus, it is necessary to collect extensive and diverse data on the deceased before cremation.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
3012,"A novel process for introducing a new intraoperative program: a multidisciplinary paradigm for mitigating hazards and improving patient safety. BACKGROUND: Since the Institute of Medicine's report, To Err is Human, was published, numerous interventions have been designed and implemented to correct the defects that lead to medical errors and adverse events; however, most efforts were largely reactive. Safety, communication, team performance, and efficiency are areas of care that attract a great deal of attention, especially regarding the introduction of new technologies, techniques, and procedures. We describe a multidisciplinary process that was implemented at our hospital to identify and mitigate hazards before the introduction of a new technique: high-dose-rate intraoperative radiation therapy, (HDR-IORT)., METHODS: A multidisciplinary team of surgeons, anesthesiologists, radiation oncologists, physicists, nurses, hospital risk managers, and equipment specialists used a structured process that included in situ clinical simulation to uncover concerns among care providers and to prospectively identify and mitigate defects for patients who would undergo surgery using the HDR-IORT technique., RESULTS: We identified and corrected 20 defects in the simulated patient care process before application to actual patients. Subsequently, eight patients underwent surgery using the HDR-IORT technique with no recurrence of simulation-identified or unanticipated defects., CONCLUSION: Multiple benefits were derived from the use of this systematic process to introduce the HDR-IORT technique; namely, the safety and efficiency of care for this select patient population was optimized, and this process mitigated harmful or adverse events before the inclusion of actual patients. Further work is needed, but the process outlined in this paper can be universally applied to the introduction of any new technologies, treatments, or procedures.",Excluded
398,"Opaque intraocular lens for intractable diplopia: experience and patients' expectations and satisfaction. AIM: To report the authors' experience with the use of opaque intraocular lenses (IOL) in diplopia unresponsive to traditional management strategies, and to assess patients' satisfaction and the visual function of patients following insertion of opaque IOL using the Visual Function Index (VF-14)., SETTINGS: Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK., METHOD: Data were obtained on all patients who underwent insertion of an opaque IOL at our institution between 2002 and 2006. Patients were interviewed by telephone. Any visual function impairment was assessed using the VF-14 questionnaire. Patients were also asked to score subjectively their overall satisfaction with the visual outcome after opaque IOL insertion., RESULTS: The authors studied 12 patients (n = 12) who had insertion of opaque IOL. All patients had constant and persistent diplopia unresponsive to other treatments acceptable to the patient. The median duration of diplopia was 5.5 years (interquartile range was 2.4-17.3 years). The postoperative VF-14 ranged from 75 to 100, and the mean VF-14 was 91 (95% CI 83-99). Three patients reported a maximum score of 100. Patient satisfaction ranged from 2 to 4, and the average was 3.4 out of 4., CONCLUSIONS: Opaque IOL insertion is a valuable option in the management of intractable diplopia. The VF-14 revealed very little or no impairment in visual function following the procedure. All patients reported improvement in their visual function and were pleased with the final outcome.",Excluded
107,"Postoperative chemotherapy vs. chemoradiotherapy for thoracic esophageal cancer: A prospective randomized clinical trial. Background: Neither postoperative radiotherapy nor chemotherapy alone provided a survival benefit after curative esophagectomy for esophageal squamous carcinoma. Material(s) and Method(s): Of 103 consecutive patients who underwent potentially curative esophagectomy for esophageal squamous carcinoma, 45 patients with advanced cancers without preoperative adjuvant treatments were prospectively randomized to two groups; postoperative chemotherapy alone (Group A, n = 23) and postoperative radio/chemotherapy (Group B,n = 22). In Group A, cisplatin (CDDP) (50 mg/m2) was given by intravenous infusion on days 1 and 15, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (300 mg/m2) was given daily by continuous intravenous infusion for 5 weeks. In Group B, in addition to the same chemotherapeutic regimen of Group A, 50 Gy of radiotherapy was given to the mediastinum over 5 weeks. The immunohistochemical staining of tumoral p53 and microvessel density was undertaken to correlate to the radio/chemosensitivity. Result(s): There were no significant differences in the clinicopathologic characteristics between the two groups. The median dose of 5-FU and CDDP administered were not significantly different between the two groups. The mean (SD) dose of radiotherapy in Group B was 42 + 10 Gy. The 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates in Group A were 100, 63 and 38% and those in Group B were 80, 58 and 50%, respectively (P = 0.97). In each group, four patients succumbed to locoregional recurrences. Tumoral p53 was immunohistochemically negative in 43% in Group A and 77% in Group B (P = 0.03), indicating that many patients in Group B might be potentially sensitive to radiochemotherapy. The 3- and 5-year survival rates (75 and 64%) of patients with p53 negative expression (n = 18) were significantly (P = 0.03) better than those with p53 positive expression {n = 27, 44 and 26%). The long-term survival was better for patients with p53 negative tumours than those with p53 positive tumours in Group B (P = 0.06 by long-rank test, P < 0.05 by Generalized-Wilcoxon test). However, the long-term survival was not different between the patients who had p53 negative and positive tumours in Group A (P = 0.19). These data suggest that there were no survival advantage for patients receiving radiotherapy in Group B, instead p53 negative tumours appeared to have a favorable prognosis. Conclusion(s): Postoperative radiotherapy administered concurrently with chemotherapy does not provide a survival benefit compared with chemotherapy alone. Tumoral p53 expression has a predictive value for survival in patients treated with postoperative radio/chemotherapy. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1261,"LOW BMI PATIENT DOSE IN DIGITAL RADIOGRAPHY. In this study, the radiation dose received by 364 low body mass index (BMI) adult patients undergoing chest, abdomen, lumbar spine, kidneys and urinary bladder (KUB) and pelvis X-ray examinations in an X-ray room with a digital radiography system was evaluated. The patients' kerma area product (KAP) values were recorded, and the entrance surface air kerma (ESAK) was calculated based on the X-ray tube output, exposure parameters and technical data. The 75th percentiles of the distribution of ESAK and KAP values were also estimated. The dose values were compared with the corresponding values for normal patients obtained from a previous survey in our hospital, as well as with the national and UK diagnostic reference levels (DRLs). The correlation of dose values with patient size metrics (mass, height, BMI) was also investigated. A statistically significant difference was found in KAP and the ESAK values between low BMI and normal patients (Mann-Whitney test, p < 0.05), for all examinations studied. The percentage difference for chest PA, chest LAT, abdomen PA, lumbar spine AP, lumbar spine LAT, pelvis AP and KUB AP examinations was 40, 36, 48, 68, 57, 46 and 67% for median KAP and 26, 43, 52, 48, 19, 44 and 51% for median ESAK, respectively. The corresponding 75th percentiles for low BMI patients were 0.065, 0.349, 0.683, 1.54, 3.92, 1.11, 0.67 mGy and 0.042, 0.218, 0.450, 0.280, 0.598, 0.597, 0.267 Gycm2 in terms of ESAK and KAP values, respectively. They were 74-90% lower compared to the national diagnostic reference levels (DRLs), 35-84% and 58-82% compared to the UK DRLs, for ESAK and KAP values, respectively. Regarding the gender of the patients, no statistically significant difference was found in the dose values between female and male patients (Mann-Whitney test, p > 0.05), for all examinations studied. A statistically significant correlation was found between ESAK and KAP values with BMI for KUB AP, pelvis AP, lumbar spine AP, lumbar spine LAT and chest PA, while for chest LAT examinations, only the ESAK were significantly correlated with BMI. They also significantly correlated with the mass for KUB AP, lumbar spine LAT, abdomen PA and chest PA examinations, while no significant correlation was found between the dose values and patients' height. It can be concluded that the low BMI patients received a significantly reduced radiation dose compared to normal patients. Additional studies need to be conducted for these patient groups, which could contribute to the further development of a radiation protection culture in diagnostic radiography.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

3262,"Performance ramifications of abnormal functional connectivity of ventral posterior lateral thalamus with cerebellum in abstinent individuals with Alcohol Use Disorder. The extant literature supports the involvement of the thalamus in the cognitive and motor impairment associated with chronic alcohol consumption, but clear structure/function relationships remain elusive. Alcohol effects on specific nuclei rather than the entire thalamus may provide the basis for differential cognitive and motor decline in Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). This functional MRI (fMRI) study was conducted in 23 abstinent individuals with AUD and 27 healthy controls to test the hypothesis that functional connectivity between anterior thalamus and hippocampus would be compromised in those with an AUD diagnosis and related to mnemonic deficits. Functional connectivity between 7 thalamic structures [5 thalamic nuclei: anterior ventral (AV), mediodorsal (MD), pulvinar (Pul), ventral lateral posterior (VLP), and ventral posterior lateral (VPL); ventral thalamus; the entire thalamus] and 14 functional regions"" was evaluated. Relative to controls, the AUD group exhibited different VPL-based functional connectivity: an anticorrelation between VPL and a bilateral middle temporal lobe region observed in controls became a positive correlation in the AUD group; an anticorrelation between the VPL and the cerebellum was stronger in the AUD than control group. AUD-associated altered connectivity between anterior thalamus and hippocampus as a substrate of memory compromise was not supported; instead, connectivity differences from controls selective to VPL and cerebellum demonstrated a relationship with impaired balance. These preliminary findings support substructure-level evaluation in future studies focused on discerning the role of the thalamus in AUD-associated cognitive and motor deficits.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.""",Excluded

Objective: People living close to an environmental hazard site may suffer health harms from real or perceived contaminant exposures. In class-action litigation, medical monitoring is a potential remedy that has been allowed in some jurisdictions but not others. From 1952 to 1989, a US Department of Energy uranium metal plant near Fernald, Ohio, released ionizing radiation and uranium particulates into the surrounding community. Method(s): Settlement of litigation between nearby residents and the Department of Energy resulted in an 18-year medical monitoring program (N = 9775), which focused on general health promotion rather than effects of uranium. Result(s): Participation was higher than projected; decreases in common risk factors (cholesterol and blood pressure) and deaths from cancer have been observed.

1972,"Radiation-related cranial nerve palsy in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. BACKGROUND: Cranial nerve palsy is a rare complication after patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) receive radiotherapy using a technique that delivers 180-200 centigrays (cGy) per day. Cranial neuropathy is of particular clinical interest in terms of making a differential diagnosis, because it is also a common presenting manifestation in patients with NPC. Cranial neuropathy may lead to distressing signs and symptoms in these patients, and their treatment has not been addressed in previous reports. This article presents the authors' experience with radiotherapy-related cranial nerve palsy in patients with NPC., METHODS: Nineteen patients were diagnosed with radiation-related neuropathy. Patients with recurrent tumors or with a suspicion of persistent or recurrent tumors were excluded. Most patients were treated using 180 cGy or 200 cGy per fraction per day. The total dose was 7000-13,000 cGy to the nasopharynx and 5000-9000 cGy to the neck. Unilateral vocal cord paralysis alone and hearing loss were not included in the analysis., RESULTS: There were 15 male patients and 4 female patients. The latency before palsy occurred was 12-240 months. Single nerve palsy developed in four patients, including two patients with hypoglossal palsy and two patients with recurrent laryngeal palsy. Two patients had three nerve palsies each. The other 13 patients presented with 2 nerve palsies each. Vagus and hypoglossal palsy appeared to be a frequent combination and occurred in 11 patients. Overall, there were 17 patients with hypoglossal palsy (7 bilateral, 8 left-sided, and 2 right-sided), 11 patients with vagus palsy (2 bilateral, 7 left-sided, and 2 right-sided), 6 patients with recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy (5 bilateral), and 2 patients with accessory palsies (all bilateral). Marked neck fibrosis was present in 12 patients. Patients who had vocal cord paralysis suffered from easy choking and hoarseness. Severe respiratory difficulty occurred in two patients who had bilateral vocal cord palsy. Surgical procedures included laryngoplasty, tracheostomy, and gastrostomy. Quality of life improved considerably after patients underwent surgery., CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy-related cranial nerve palsy may occur in patients with NPC after they receive conventional radiotherapy. Hypoglossal nerve palsy was found the most frequently in this series, followed by vagus nerve palsy and recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy. Neck fibrosis and the course of the three nerves through the neck may be important risk factors for the development of palsy. The diagnosis must be made only after the possibilities of tumor-induced palsy and idiopathic palsy are excluded. Surgery is helpful in improving the quality of life in many patients.

3589,"Indirect measurement of mitochondrial proton leak and its application. In mitochondria, ATP synthesis is coupled to oxygen consumption by the proton electrochemical gradient established across the mitochondrial inner membrane in a process termed oxidative phosphorylation. It has long been known from stoichiometric studies that ATP synthesis is not perfectly coupled to oxygen consumption. The major inefficiency in the system is leakage of protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane driven by the proton electrochemical gradient. The kinetics of the proton leak can be determined indirectly, by measuring the oxygen consumption of mitochondria under non-phosphorylating conditions (plus oligomycin) as a function of the proton electrochemical gradient. This experimental system provides a convenient means to investigate inner membrane permeability to protons and the effect of factors that may effect that permeability. In this paper we review some results from our laboratory of indirect measurement of mitochondrial proton leak and how it has been applied to investigate the effect of aging, obesity and thyroid status on proton leak. The results show that (i) proton leak in isolated liver mitochondria is not significantly different in a comparison of young and old rats, in contrast (ii) there is an apparent increase in proton leak in in situ mitochondria in hepatocytes from old rats when compared to those from young rats, (iii) proton leak in neuronal mitochondria in situ in synaptosomes is not significantly different in young and old rats, (iv) proton leak is greater in isolated liver mitochondria from ob/ob mice compared to lean controls, (v) acute leptin (OB protein) administration restores the increased leak rate in isolated liver mitochondria from ob/ob mice to that of lean controls, (vi) administration of thyroid hormone (T3) increases proton leak in rat muscle mitochondria, and (vii) proton leak in muscle mitochondria is insensitive to the presence of GDP. It is proposed that the experimental system described here for measuring proton leak, is an ideal functional assay for determining whether the novel uncoupling proteins increase inner membrane permeability to protons.",Excluded

Purpose: To evaluate the incidence of and risk factors for therapy- related myelodysplasia (tMDS) and secondary acute myelogenous leukemia (sAML), after high-dose therapy (HDT) with autologous bone marrow or peripheral-blood progenitor-cell support, in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Patients and Methods: Between January 1985 and November 1996, 230 patients underwent HDT comprising cyclophosphamide therapy and total-body irradiation, with autologous hematopoietic progenitor-cell support, as consolidation of remission. With a median follow-up of 6 years, 27 (12%) developed tMDS or sAML. Result(s): Median time to development of tMDS or sAML was 4.4 years (range, 11 months to 8.8 years) after HDT. Karyotyping (performed in 24 cases) at diagnosis of tMDS or sAML revealed complex karyotypes in 18 patients. Seventeen patients had monosomy 5/5q-, 15 had - 7/7q-, seven had -18/18q-, seven had -13/13q-, and four had -20/20q-. Twenty- one patients died from complications of tMDS or sAML or treatment for tMDS or sAML, at a median of 10 months (range, 0 to 26 months). Sixteen died without evidence of recurrent lymphoma. Six patients were alive at a median follow-up of 6 months (range, 2 to 22 months) after diagnosis of tMDS or sAML. On multivariate analysis, prior fludarabine therapy (P = .009) and older age (P = .02) were associated with the development of tMDS or sAML. Increased interval from diagnosis to HDT and bone marrow involvement at diagnosis were of borderline significance (P = .05 and .07, respectively). Conclusion(s): tMDS and sAML are serious complications of HDT for NHL and are associated with very poor prognosis. Alternative strategies for reducing their incidence and for treatment are needed.

1752,"Bone Marrow Transplantation Induces Normoglycemia in a Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Murine Model. Objective: To study the cellular mechanisms involved in the regression of diabetic nephropathy, bone marrow-derived cells must be identified. The aim of this study was to obtain a diabetic chimeric model with bone marrow cells expressing enhanced green fluorecence protein (EGFP), without modifying the course of diabetic nephropathy. Material(s) and Method(s): Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was performed in an obese type 2 diabetic murine model (db/db) owing to a mutation in the leptin receptor gene. Whole bone marrow from female donor C57BL/6 EGFP+ mice was transplanted into 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice and into 8- and 24-week-old female C57BLKS (db/db) EGFP- mice. Recipient mice received total body irradiation (TBI) followed by bone marrow (BM) cell infusion. We tested various irradiation doses (Gy) and numbers of BM cells. Result(s): When a low TBI dose and a small number of BM cells were administered, only syngeneic C57BL/6 mice became chimeric, whereas allogeneic db/db mice showed rejection. When Gy dose and BM cells were increased, db/db mice became chimeric. However, 8-week-old db/db mice lost the obese phenotype and became normoglycemic, probably due to peripheral BM cell infiltration. Conversely, 24-week-old db/db mice remained obese showing similar blood glucose values, body weights, albuminuria, and glomerular lesions at nontransplanted db/db mice. Conclusion(s): Recipient age greatly influenced the peripheral repopulation after BMT in db/db mice. Only the adult chimeric db/db mice seemed to be a good model to study the cellular mechanisms involved in the regression of diabetic nephropathy. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1814,"Accuracy of Calcium Scoring calculated from contrast-enhanced Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography using a dual-layer spectral CT: A comparison of Calcium Scoring from real and virtual non-contrast data. PURPOSE: Modern non-invasive evaluation of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) requires non-contrast low dose Computed Tomography (CT) imaging for determination of Calcium Scoring (CACS) and contrast-enhanced imaging for evaluation of vascular stenosis. Several methods for calculation of CACS from contrast-enhanced images have been proposed before. The main principle for that is generation of virtual non-contrast images by iodine subtraction from a contrast-enhanced spectral CT dataset. However, those techniques have some limitations: Dual-Source CT imaging can lead to increased radiation exposure, and switching of the tube voltage (rapid kVp switching) can be associated with slower rotation speed of the gantry and is thus prone to motion artefacts that are especially critical in cardiac imaging. Both techniques cannot simultaneously acquire spectral data. A novel technique to overcome these difficulties is spectral imaging with a dual-layer detector. After absorption of the lower energetic photons in the first layer, the second layer detects a hardened spectrum of the emitted radiation resulting in registration of two different energy spectra at the same time. The objective of the present investigation was to evaluate the accuracy of virtual non-contrast CACS computed from spectral data in comparison to standard non-contrast imaging., METHODS: We consecutively investigated 20 patients referred to Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA) with suspicion of CAD using a Dual-Layer spectral CT system (IQon; Philips Healthcare, The Netherlands). CACS was calculated from both, real- and virtual non-contrast images by certified software for medical use. Correlation analyses for real- and virtual non-contrast images and agreement evaluation with Bland-Altman-Plots were performed., RESULTS: Mean patient age was 57.7 +/- 14 years (n = 20). 13 patients (65%) were male. Inter-quartile-range of clinical CACS was 0-448, the mean was 334. Correlation of CACS from real- and virtual non-contrast images was very high (0.94); p < 0.0001. The slope was 2.3 indicating that values from virtual non-contrast images are approximately half of the results obtained from real non-contrast data. Visual analysis of Bland-Altman-Plot shows good accordance of both methods when results from virtual non-contrast data are multiplied by the slope of the logistic regression model (2.3). The acquired power of this results is 0.99., CONCLUSION: Determination of Calcium Score from contrast enhanced CCTA using spectral imaging with a dual-layer detector is feasible and shows good agreement with the conventional technique when a proportionality factor is applied. The observed difference between both methods is due to an underestimation of plaque volume, and-to an even greater extend -an underestimation of plaque density with the virtual non-contrast approach. Our data suggest that radiation exposure can be reduced through omitting additional native scans for patients referred to CCTA when using a dual-layer spectral system without the usual limitations of dual energy analysis.",Excluded

Background:The aim of this study was to investigate the safety of neoadjuvant chemoradiation using radiotherapy (RT) combined with concurrent capecitabine and irinotecan for locally advanced rectal cancer before surgery. Method(s):Forty-six patients were recruited and treated on the basis that MRI scanning had shown poor-risk tumours with threatening (1 mm) or involvement of the mesorectal fascia. Conformal RT was given using 3 or 4 fields at daily fractions of 1.8 Gy on 5 days per week to a total dose of 45 Gy. Concurrently oral capecitabine was given twice daily throughout radiotherapy continuously from days 1 to 35 and intravenous irinotecan was given once per week during weeks 1 to 4 of RT. Dose levels were gradually escalated as follows. Dose level 1: capecitabine 650 mg m 2 b.i.d. and irinotecan 50 mg m 2; Dose level 2: capecitabine 650 mg m 2 b.i.d. and irinotecan 60 mg m 2; Dose level 3: capecitabine 825 mg m 2 b.i.d. and irinotecan 60 mg m 2; Dose level 4: capecitabine 825 mg m 2 b.i.d. and irinotecan 70 mg m 2. Result(s):Diarrhoea (grade 3, no grade 4) was the main serious acute toxicity with lesser degrees of fatigue, neutropenia, anorexia and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia. The recommended dose for future study was dose level 2 at which 3 of 14 patients (21%) developed grade 3 diarrhoea. Postoperative complications included seven pelvic or wound infections and two anastomotic and two perineal wound dehiscences. There were no deaths in the first 30 days postoperatively. Of 41 resected specimens, 11 (27%) showed a pathological complete response (pCR) and five (12%) showed an involved circumferential resection margin (defined as 1 mm).

Material(s) and Method(s): We analyzed gene expression levels of NFkappaB1, NF-kappaB2, and Rel in 49 B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 8 B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 3 acute myeloid leukemia, 3 chronic myeloid leukemia, 2 hairy cell leukemia, 2 myelodysplastic syndrome, and 2 T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia patients using realtime polymerase chain reaction. Result(s): Expression levels of NF-kappaB1, NF-kappaB2, and Rel genes were found to be deregulated. Conclusion(s): These results could be accepted as specific gene traces to radiation-induced leukemia or as potential candidates for new diagnostic biomarker studies. Larger experiments and non-exposed control malignant cell populations are needed to clarify these suggestions.Copyright © 2016, Turkish Society of Hematology. All right reserved.",Excluded
1308,"Diagnostic accuracy of X-ray versus CT in COVID-19: A propensity-matched database study. Objectives To identify the diagnostic accuracy of common imaging modalities, chest X-ray (CXR) and CT, for diagnosis of COVID-19 in the general emergency population in the UK and to find the association between imaging features and outcomes in these patients. Design Retrospective analysis of electronic patient records. Setting Tertiary academic health science centre and designated centre for high consequence infectious diseases in London, UK. Participants 1198 patients who attended the emergency department with paired reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) swabs for SARS-CoV-2 and CXR between 16 March and 16 April 2020. Main outcome measures Sensitivity and specificity of CXR and CT for diagnosis of COVID-19 using the British Society of Thoracic Imaging reporting templates. Reference standard was any RT-PCR positive naso-oropharyngeal swab within 30 days of attendance. ORs of CXR in association with vital signs, laboratory values and 30-day outcomes were calculated. Results Sensitivity and specificity of CXR for COVID-19 diagnosis were 0.56 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.60) and 0.60 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.65), respectively. For CT scans, these were 0.85 (95% CI 0.79 to 0.90) and 0.50 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.60), respectively. This gave a statistically significant mean increase in sensitivity with CT of 29% (95% CI 19% to 38%, p<0.0001) compared with CXR. Specificity was not significantly different between the two modalities. CXR findings were not statistically significantly or clinically meaningfully associated with vital signs, laboratory parameters or 30-day outcomes. Conclusions CT has substantially improved diagnostic performance over CXR in COVID-19. CT should be strongly considered in the initial assessment for suspected COVID-19. This gives potential for increased sensitivity and considerably faster turnaround time, where capacity allows and balanced against excess radiation exposure risk.Copyright ©",Excluded

467,"Contamination of banked femoral head allograft: Incidence, bacteriology and donor follow up. Background: Allograft donations are not uncommonly found to be contaminated. The issue of contaminated donations from live donors at the time of surgery, and the significance of this to the patient in terms of subsequent sepsis of the arthroplasty, were examined. Method(s): The donations of femoral heads to the Queensland Bone Bank over a 9-year period were reviewed, and the incidence and bacteriology of contamination were detailed. Clinical outcomes were determined for donors who had positive cultures at the time of retrieval and they were compared with those of culture-negative donors. Result(s): Between March 1987 and February 1996, 232 femoral heads were donated to the Queensland Bone Bank. Four specimens were sent for culture with each femoral head (surface swab of femoral head, acetabular swab, bone biopsy and capsule). In 51 cases, one or more positive cultures were obtained (22% contamination rate). The majority of organisms cultured were Staphylococcus epidermidis. One hundred and seventy donations came from surgery performed at the Princess Alexandra Hospital, and 40 femoral heads were considered contaminated. Deep infection was recorded in one of the 40 cases with contaminated donations and three out of 130 non-contaminated donations had subsequent septic episodes. Conclusion(s): The contamination rate detailed in the present report is higher than in most series. This may be due to the fact that four bacteriological specimens are taken to assess contamination. Two of these specimens are tissue samples which yielded more positive results than did the two swabs. All other series take no more than two bacteriological specimens, which are usually bone swabs. These are shown to have a poor yield of positive cultures. Therefore there is a significant underestimation of contamination rates by other bone banks. This has implications for the recipients of bone from those banks, particularly when the allograft material is not secondarily sterilized. This is important given increasing allograft usage, and the increasing numbers of revision joint arthroplasty and impaction grafting procedures being performed. Sterilization of all bone by irradiation to 25 kGy is recommended.",Excluded
500,"Effect of topical application of Hypericum perforatum extract (St. John's wort) on skin sensitivity to solar simulated radiation. St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) is a tradional folk remedy that is used for the topical treatment of superficial wounds, scars and burns. A characteristic metabolite of St. John's wort is the photodynamic active plant pigment hypericin. It is known that hypericin may cause a severe photodermatitis called hypericism when higher amounts of St. John's wort are ingested orally. To date, no reports on the photosensitizing capacity of topical application of St. John's wort are available. Here, we investigated the effects of Hypericum oil (hypericin 110 mug/mL) and Hypericum ointment (hypericin 30 mug/mL) on skin sensitivity to solar simulated radiation. Sixteen volunteers of the skin types II and III were tested on their volar forearms with solar simulated radiation for photosensitizing effects of Hypericum oil (n=8)and Hypericum ointment (n=8). The minimal erythema dose (MED) was determined by visual assessment, and skin erythema was evaluated photometrically. With the visual erythema score, no change of the MED could be detected after application of either Hypericum oil or Hypericum ointment (P>0.05). With the more sensitive photometric measurement, an increase of the erythema-index after treatment with the Hypericum oil could be detected (P<=0.01). The results do not provide evidence for a severe phototoxic potential of Hypericum oil and Hypericum ointment, detectable by the clinically relevant visual erythema score. However, the trend towards increased photosensitivity detected with the more sensitive photometric measurement could become relevant in fair-skinned individuals, in diseased skin or after extended solar irradiation.",Excluded
1433,"Effectiveness of Nd: YAG laser therapy on Japanese cedar pollinosis. Many have reported on the effectiveness of laser surgery therapy for perennial allergic rhinitis. However, the suppressive effects of laser irradiation on allergic rhinitis and its symptoms have not been reported in patients with pollinosis. This is because therapeutic effects on pollinosis are difficult to evaluate. The amount of pollen in the air varies during the year, and from year to year. Also, allergic symptoms develop due to exposure to the amount of pollen which is markedly influenced by the weather. In this study, the severity of allergic symptoms in the pollen season was compared between patients treated with early medication, non-treated patients and patients treated with preseasonal contact Nd: YAG laser surgery. Results suggests that laser surgery was effective in reducing the severity of symptoms in patients with cedar pollinosis. Symptoms were milder in the laser group than in the medication group and non-treated group for 3-4 weeks after the start of seasonal pollinosis, although no differences were noted in the early weeks. This may be explained by the fact that laser irradiation reduces the lamina propria of the nasal mucosa, the site of allergic reactions. This also suggests that allergic pollen can't penetrate the mucosal surface which shows squamous epithelization after laser irradiation.",Excluded
949,"Long-term pain outcomes for recurrent idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia after stereotactic radiosurgery: A prospective comparison of first-time microvascular decompression and repeat stereotactic radiosurgery. OBJECTIVE Microvascular decompression (MVD) and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) are common surgical treatments for trigeminal neuralgia (TN). Many patients who receive SRS have pain recurrence; the ideal second intervention is unknown. The authors directly compared pain outcomes after MVD and repeat SRS in a population of patients in whom SRS failed as their first-line procedure for TN, and they identified predictors of pain control. METHODS The authors reviewed a prospectively collected database of patients undergoing surgery for TN between 1997 and 2014 at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Standardized data collection focused on preoperative clinical characteristics, surgical characteristics, and postoperative outcomes. Patients with typical type 1, idiopathic TN with >= 1 year of follow-up were included. RESULTS In total, 168 patients underwent SRS as their first procedure. Of these patients, 90 had residual or recurrent pain. Thirty of these patients underwent a second procedure at UCSF and had >= 1 year of follow-up; 15 underwent first-time MVD and 15 underwent repeat SRS. Patients undergoing MVD were younger than those receiving repeat SRS and were more likely to receive >= 80 Gy during the initial SRS. The average follow-up was 44.9 +/- 33.6 months for MVD and 48.3 +/- 45.3 months for SRS. All patients achieved complete pain freedom without medication at some point during their follow-up. At last follow-up, 80% of MVD-treated patients and 33.3% of SRS-treated patients had a favorable outcome, defined as Barrow Neurological Institute Pain Intensity scores of I-IIIa (p < 0.05). Percentages of patients with favorable outcome at 1 and 5 years were 86% and 75% for the MVD cohort and 73% and 27% for the SRS cohort, respectively (p < 0.05). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis demonstrated that performing MVD was statistically significantly associated with favorable outcome (HR 0.12, 95% CI 0.02-0.60, p < 0.01). There were no statistically significant predictors of favorable outcome in the MVD cohort; however, the presence of sensory changes after repeat SRS was associated with pain relief (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Patients who received MVD after failed SRS had a longer duration of favorable outcome compared to those who received repeat SRS; however, both modalities are safe and effective. The presence of post-SRS sensory changes was predictive of a favorable pain outcome in the SRS cohort.Copyright ©AANS 2019.",Excluded
1020,"Incidental gonadal radiation exposure in the prophylactic treatment of heterotopic ossification. Purpose/Objective(s): Radiation therapy is commonly used for heterotopic ossification (HO) prophylaxis after the orthopedic repair of fractures involving the hip and femur. Given the young age of many of these patients presenting for treatment and the proximity of the reproductive organs to tissue requiring radiation therapy, incidental radiation exposure to the gonads must be considered for potential fertility issues. The purpose of this study was to report dosimetric gonadal exposure among a large cohort of patients who underwent 3-dimensional simulation and radiation therapy for HO prophylaxis. Materials/Methods: A total of 45 patients (38 males; 7 females) were identified that underwent volumetric CT-planned radiation therapy for HO prophylaxis using a single fraction dose of 700 cGy. The median age was 22 years (range, 12 - 55 years). Treatment plans were generated with the Pinnacle3 treatment planning system (Philips Radiation Oncology Systems, Milpitas, CA) with heterogeneity corrections accounted for via convolution/superposition dose calculation algorithm. Treatments were delivered post-operatively within 48 hours using opposed AP/PA fields that generally included the surgical prosthesis as well as the femoral head, ischial ramus, and greater/lesser trochanters. Three male patients received bilateral radiation for fractures involving both hips. The simulation CT scans were retrieved from archives, and the testicles and ovaries were delineated as paired structures on 3 millimeter axial sections so that dose-volume characteristics could be determined. Result(s): The proportion of male patients receiving ipsilateral testicular doses (maximum) greater than 15 cGy, 50 cGy, and 100 cGy was 63%, 24%, and 21%, respectively. Another 20% of male patients had both testicles exposed to maximum doses greater than 15 cGy, the number commonly cited to cause sperm abnormalities. The 3 men undergoing bilateral radiation received an average maximal testicular dose of 422 cGy (range, 187 - 686 cGy). Among female patients, 86% received maximal ipsilateral ovarian doses over 15 cGy. One of the seven women received a dose exceeding 15 cGy to both ovaries (778 cGy and 31.5 cGy). Conclusion(s): Gonadal doses exceeding historically recommended tolerances can result in patients undergoing radiation for HO prophylaxis. Scrotal shields, informing patients about possible fertility issues, and the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as an alternative to radiation therapy should be considered as appropriate in the management of this benign condition.",Excluded
1298,"Concurrent chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced esophageal cancer - A pilot study by using daily low-dose cisplatin and continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil. Background: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) has recently become a promising treatment for esophageal cancer. However, most investigators have adopted the conventional or modified Wayne-State PF (cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil) regimen, which is inevitably associated with moderate to severe treatment-related toxicities. In this pilot study, we incorporated a daily low-dose regimen of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil into CCRT in order to improve the compliance of the patients. Patients and Methods: Between July 1993 and Dec. 1997, 25 patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer (T3, or N1 disease), received CCRT which consisted of daily low-dose cisplatin (6 mg/m2/day) and continuous infusion of 5-FU (225 mg/m2/day) with radiotherapy (fraction size = 200-250 cGy/day). Except for the initial 9 patients, for whom post-CCRT esophagectomy was compulsory, all subsequent patients underwent esophagectomy only when inadequate response to CCRT was noted. The scheduled radiation dose was 50 Gy for the first 9 patients, and 60 Gy for the rest of the patients. Result(s): Eighteen patients (72%) completed the CCRT without interruption. Clinically, there were 8 CR and 9 PR, with a total response rate of 68% (47-87%, 95% C.I.). All patients were evaluable for toxicity. Grade 3/4 leukopenia and thrombocytopenia developed in 14 (56%) and 7 (28%) patients, respectively. Grade 3/4 non-hematologic toxicity was seen in 4 (16%) patients. The median survival of the whole group was 8 months (range: 2-59+). The projected 3-year overall survival was 24%. Conclusion(s): We suggest that for locally advanced esophageal cancer CCRT with the aforementioned daily low-dose regimen, is a treatment with good patient compliance.",Excluded
2315,"Idiopathic pulmonary artery aneurysm: A case report of a rare disease. INTRODUCTION: Pulmonary artery aneurysm (PAA) is defined as dilation of the proximal pulmonary artery or one of its branches. It is difficult to diagnose and often is an autopsy finding. It is classified as central, which arises from the main pulmonary artery, or peripheral, which arises from segmental or sub-segmental arteries. Pulmonary hypertension is an important risk factor for development and rupture of PAA. We present a case of idiopathic PAA which has remained stable for past 10 years. CASE PRESENTATION: A 32 year old male with a history of PAA presented to the ER with complaints of atypical chest pain. Physical exam findings and laboratory studies were unremarkable. Contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest revealed aneurysmal dilation of the right pulmonary artery with a clot in it. This was compared to multiple previous CT scans and did not show any changes. Review of past records revealed that 10 years ago, the patient was admitted for similar complaints, found to have a right hilar mass on X-ray and chest CT suspicious for neoplasm. Thoracotomy was done for biopsy and patient was found to have a 4x3 cm right PAA. Echocardiography showed normal pulmonary artery pressure. On this visit VQ scan was done which was negative for pulmonary embolism. Patient was discharged after 2 days with outpatient follow-up. DISCUSSION: PAA is a rare condition with an incidence of 1 in 14,000 autopsies. Unlike aortic aneurysm it has equal prevalence in both genders and occurs in younger patients. The likely pathology seems to be increased hemodynamic stresses combined with underlying vessel wall weakness. It is commonly associated with congenital heart defects (shunts, PDA or VSD), pulmonary artery hypertension and connective tissue disorders such as Marfan's syndrome and infections like syphilis and TB. It typically presents with hemoptysis, chest pain, cough and/or dyspnea but is also not infrequently discovered as an incidental finding. The advent of contrast-enhanced CT, MRI and echocardiograms have assumed a primary role in diagnosis. Complications may include pulmonary hypertension, thrombus formation, bronchial compression or aneurysmal rupture. Management is surgical coupled with treatment of the underlying disorders. CONCLUSION(S): Controversy still exists regarding indications for surgical management, with some pursuing conservative approach while others in favor of surgical intervention even in asymptomatic patients. One third of the patients die from rupture of the aneurysm emphasizing the need for follow up and prompt intervention if it enlarges or become symptomatic. Therefore, close follow-up is required.",Excluded
1867,"Experience with wound complications after surgery for sacral tumors. Purpose: The aim of this article is to summarize our experience in treating sacral wound complications after sacrectomy. We focus, in particular, on factors associated with wound complications, including surgical site infection (SSI) and wound dehiscence. Method(s): The definition of SSI devised by Horgan et al. was applied. Wound dehiscence was defined as a wound showing breakdown in the absence of clinical signs meeting the diagnostic standard for SSI. Between September 1997 and August 2009, 387 patients with a sacral tumor underwent sacrectomy performed by the same team of surgeons and were followed up for >=12 months. Potential risk factors were evaluated for univariate associations with SSI and wound complications. Multivariable conditional logistic regression was used to identify the combined effects of several risk factors. Result(s): Of the 387 wounds studied, 274 healed uneventfully, and 113 (29.2 %) broke down because of infection or dehiscence. Fifty-one (13.2 %) patients developed a postoperative SSI, and 62 (16.0 %) patients developed wound dehiscence. Gram-negative bacteria grew in 45 cultures (91.8 %) and included 38 cases of Escherichia coli. Previous radiation, rectum rupture, longer duration of surgery, and cerebrospinal fluid leakage were significantly associated with increased likelihood of developing an SSI. Previous radiation, rectum rupture, age <40 years, history of diabetes mellitus, maximum tumor diameter >=10 cm, and instrumentation used were risk factors for wound complications. Conclusion(s): The incidence of wound complications is not so high at a musculoskeletal tumor center with surgeons experienced in treating sacral tumors. Controlling for these risk factors when possible may improve clinical outcomes. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
2181,"Vascular enhancement and image quality of CT venography: comparison of standard and low kilovoltage settings. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to investigate the vascular enhancement and image quality of CT venography (CTV) with a lower peak kilovoltage (kVp) setting than the standard setting., MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, the clinical records of 100 consecutive patients with suspected pulmonary embolism were analyzed. All patients underwent pulmonary CT angiography and CTV of the abdomen, pelvis, and lower extremities using 64-MDCT with automatic tube current modulation: 50 patients underwent CT at 120 kVp, the standard kVp setting, and 50 patients were scanned at 100 kVp; we refer to these groups as the ""standard-kVp group"" and the ""low-kVp group,"" respectively. Vessel enhancement and image noise were assessed in the inferior vena cava (IVC), femoral vein, and popliteal vein. Two radiologists who were blinded to the kVp setting placed the regions of interest on vessels by consensus and assessed image quality using a 5-point visual scale. Effective dose was estimated using the dose-length product. The Wilcoxon rank test was used to evaluate differences between the two groups using statistics software (JMP, version 5.1). A p value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance., RESULTS: Mean vascular enhancement was significantly higher in the low-kVp group than in the standard-kVp group: IVC, 138.4 +/- 12.2 (SD) HU versus 164.5 +/- 17.4 HU, respectively; femoral vein, 130.2 +/- 18.0 HU versus 152.0 +/- 24.5 HU; and popliteal vein, 136.7 +/- 17.5 HU versus 158.3 +/- 26.0 HU. Although the images of the low-kVp group had significantly higher image noise, there were no significant differences in image quality in the IVC and popliteal vein. The mean effective dose for the low-kVp protocol was significantly lower than that for the standard-kVp protocol., CONCLUSION: Lowering the kVp setting for CTV examinations improved vascular enhancement while providing sufficient image quality.",Excluded
1440,"Study of 201 non-small cell lung cancer patients given stereotactic ablative radiation therapy shows local control dependence on dose calculation algorithm. PURPOSE: Pencil beam (PB) and collapsed cone convolution (CCC) dose calculation algorithms differ significantly when used in the thorax. However, such differences have seldom been previously directly correlated with outcomes of lung stereotactic ablative body radiation (SABR)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Data for 201 non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with SABR were analyzed retrospectively. All patients were treated with 50 Gy in 5 fractions of 10 Gy each. The radiation prescription mandated that 95% of the planning target volume (PTV) receive the prescribed dose. One hundred sixteen patients were planned with BrainLab treatment planning software (TPS) with the PB algorithm and treated on a Novalis unit. The other 85 were planned on the Pinnacle TPS with the CCC algorithm and treated on a Varian linac. Treatment planning objectives were numerically identical for both groups. The median follow-up times were 24 and 17 months for the PB and CCC groups, respectively. The primary endpoint was local/marginal control of the irradiated lesion. Gray's competing risk method was used to determine the statistical differences in local/marginal control rates between the PB and CCC groups., RESULTS: Twenty-five patients planned with PB and 4 patients planned with the CCC algorithms to the same nominal doses experienced local recurrence. There was a statistically significant difference in recurrence rates between the PB and CCC groups (hazard ratio 3.4 [95% confidence interval: 1.18-9.83], Gray's test P=.019). The differences (DELTA) between the 2 algorithms for target coverage were as follows: DELTAD99GITV = 7.4 Gy, DELTAD99PTV = 10.4 Gy, DELTAV90GITV = 13.7%, DELTAV90PTV = 37.6%, DELTAD95PTV = 9.8 Gy, and DELTADISO = 3.4 Gy. GITV = gross internal tumor volume., CONCLUSIONS: Local control in patients receiving who were planned to the same nominal dose with PB and CCC algorithms were statistically significantly different. Possible alternative explanations are described in the report, although they are not thought likely to explain the difference. We conclude that the difference is due to relative dosimetric underdosing of tumors with the PB algorithm. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Background: Exposure to radiation during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) could have adverse effects on the endoscopic team members and patients. There is an inverse relationship between fluoroscopy time and endoscopist experience. Objective(s): To determine the relationship between the technical difficulty to cannulate Vater's papilla, and time to perform the procedure and fluoroscopy time. Method(s): Patients scheduled for ERCP were divided in two groups depending on the degree of difficulty of the process according to Schutz classification: group A (grades 1-3) and group B (grades 4 and 5). We registered demographic variables, reference diagnosis, endoscopic and radiological diagnoses, degree of difficulty to cannulate Vater's papilla (Freeman scale), duration of procedure, fluoroscopy time and endoscopic complications. Result(s): 213 patients were included: 101 in group A and 112 in group B. Mean fluoroscopy time was 59.15 seconds in group A and 93.59 seconds in group B (p <0.0001). Mean time to perform the procedure was 13.18 minutes in group A and 20.23 minutes in group B (p <0.0001). Factors related to increased fluoroscopy time were technical difficulty for the CPE according to Schutz (p <0.0001), stent placement (p = 0.021) and hydrostatic dilation (p <0.0001).

PURPOSE:Tocompare clinical outcome and tolerance of two types of treatments in elderly patients affected by newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM): temozolomide (TMZ) concurrent to conventional fractionated radiotherapy followed by adjuvant TMZ versus hypofractionated radiotherapy (RT) followed by adjuvant TMZ. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients older than 65 years with GBM, who underwent surgical resection/biopsy and treated with short-course radiotherapy or concurrent chemo-radiation therapy, were evaluated. Total doses were 25 or 60 Gy: 25 Gy in 5 fractions (palliative approach) and 60 Gy in 30 fractions (standard approach). In the standard approach, TMZ was administered concomitantly and adjuvantly to RT. RESULT(S): At the time of data analysis, 75 out 83 patients had died and the tumour progression was the primary cause of death in 71 patients. Median age was 70 years (range 65-82 yrs) with 39 females (46%) and 44 males (54%). Median KPS at time of treatment was 80. The surgery was gross total in 50 patients and subtotal in 8 patients; 25 patients underwent only biopsy. The O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation status was reported in 55 patients (36 methylated and 19 unmethylated). No patients demonstrated clinically significant acute morbidity, and all patients were able to complete the prescribed radiation dose without interruption. As expected, the most common grade 3-4 adverse events in the standard therapy group were neutropenia (n = 3) and thrombocytopenia (n = 8). The prognostic factors analyzed were gender, age, extent of surgery, performance status before and after radiotherapy, hemoglobin and haematocrit level, and methylation of theMGMTgene. With median follow-up of 14.9 months, the medianOSand PFS were 16 and 8 versus 9 and 3 months, in Stupp arm and short course RT, respectively (p = 0.035 an p = 0.055). At Cox Proportional-Hazards Regression analysis, only the extent of surgery and high haemoglobin level correlated with OS and PFS; whereas age (<70 vs. >=70 years), KPS, diameter of lesion, MGMT methylation status and haematocrit level did not influenced outcome. CONCLUSION(S): Our data suggested that standard approach was and acceptably tolerated and prolonged survival of glioblastoma patients aged > or = 65 years. The extent of surgery remains independent prognostic factor.

2716,"Upfront Gamma Knife radiosurgery for Cushing's disease and acromegaly: A multicenter, international study. OBJECTIVE Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKS) is typically used after failed resection in patients with Cushing's disease (CD) and acromegaly. Little is known about the upfront role of GKS for patients with CD and acromegaly. In this study, the authors examine the outcome of upfront GKS for patients with these functioning adenomas. METHODS An international group of 7 Gamma Knife centers sent pooled data from 46 patients (21 with CD and 25 with acromegaly) undergoing upfront GKS to the coordinating center of the study for analysis. Diagnosis was established on the basis of clinical, endocrine, and radiological studies. All patients were treated on a common radiosurgical platform and longitudinally followed for tumor control, endocrine remission, and hypopituitarism. Patients received a tumor median margin dose of 25 Gy (range 12-40.0 Gy) at a median isodose of 50%. RESULTS The median endocrine follow-up was 69.5 months (range 9-246 months). Endocrine remission was achieved in 51% of the entire cohort, with 28% remission in acromegaly and 81% remission for those with CD at the 5-year interval. Patients with CD achieved remission earlier as compared to those with acromegaly (p = 0.0005). In patients post-GKS, the pituitary adenoma remained stable (39%) or reduced (61%) in size. Hypopituitarism occurred in 9 patients (19.6%), and 1 (2.2%) developed third cranial nerve (CN III) palsy. Eight patients needed further intervention, including repeat GKS in 6 and transsphenoidal surgery in 2. CONCLUSIONS Upfront GKS resulted in good tumor control as well as a low rate of adverse radiation effects in the whole group. Patients with CD achieved a faster and far better remission rate after upfront GKS in comparison to patients with acromegaly. GKS can be considered as an upfront treatment in carefully selected patients with CD who are unwilling or unable to undergo resection, but it has a more limited role in acromegaly.Copyright ©AANS 2019",Excluded
14,"Influence of postoperative low-level laser therapy on the osseointegration of self-tapping implants in the posterior maxilla: A 6-week split-mouth clinical study. Background/Aim. Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has been proven to stimulate bone repair, affecting cellular prolifera-tion, differentiation and adhesion, and has shown a potential to reduce the healing time following implant placement. The aim of this clinical study was to investigate the influence of postoperative LLLT osseointegration and early success of self-tapping implants placed into low-density bone. Meth-ods. Following the split-mouth design, self-tapping implants (n = 44) were inserted in the posterior maxilla of 12 patients. One jaw side randomly received LLLT (test group), while the other side was placebo (control group). For LLLT, a 637 nm gallium-aluminum-arsenide (GaAlAs) laser (Medicolaser 637, Technoline, Belgrade, Serbia) with an output power of 40 mW and continuous wave was used. Low-level laser treat-ment was performed immediately after the surgery and then repeated every day in the following 7 days. The total irradia-tion dose per treatment was 6.26 J/cm2 per implant. The study outcomes were: implant stability, alkaline-phosphatase (ALP) activity and early implant success rate. The follow-up took 6 weeks. Results. Irradiated implants achieved a higher stability compared with controls during the entire follow-up and the difference reached significance in the 5th postoperative week (paired t-test, p = 0.030). The difference in ALP activ-ity between the groups was insignificant in any observation point (paired t-test, p > 0.05). The early implant success rate was 100%, regardless of LLLT usage. Conclusion. LLLT applied daily during the first postoperative week expressed no significant influence on the osseointegration of self-tapping implants placed into low density bone of the poste-rior maxilla. Placement of self-tapping macro-designed im-plants into low density bone could be a predictable thera-peutic procedure with a high early success rate regardless of LLLT usage.Copyright © 2015, Institut za Vojnomedicinske Naucne Informacije/Documentaciju.

2756,"Optimization of radiotherapy for Dupuytren's disease. Purpose: Radiotherapy prevents progression of Dupuytren's contracture. Herein, 1-year results of a prospective randomized trial comparing 2 different dose concepts are presented. Patients and Methods: 129 patients (67 males, 62 females) were included in the study with a minimum 1-year follow-up: 69 had bilateral and 60 unilateral involvement of Dupyutren's disease accounting for 198 irradiated hands. According to Tubiana, 73 hands had Stage N, 61 Stage N/I (<= 10degree flexion deformity), 59 Stage I (11 to 45degree) and 5 Stage II disease (46 to 90degree). Radiotherapy was randomly delivered: group A (63 patients/95 hands) received 10 times 3 Gy (total: 30 Gy) in 2 series (each 5 times 3 Gy) separated by 8 weeks; group B (66 patients/103 hands) received 7 times 3 Gy (total: 21 Gy) within 2 weeks. Orthovoltage radiotherapy (120 kV) with 40 cm standard cones and individual shielding was applied. Patient and disease parameters were equally distributed in both groups. Evaluation (toxicity, efficacy) was performed at 3 and 12 months with regard to subjective (patient's opinion) and objective parameters (palpation, measurements, comparative photographs - physician). Result(s): Acute toxicity was minimal: 76 (38%) hands had skin reactions CTC Grade 1, 12 (6%) CTC Grade 2. Chronic side effects (dryness, skin atrophy, change of sensation, LENT Grade 1) occurred in 9 (5%) hands without differences between treatment groups. At 3 and 12 months follow-up, subjective symptoms and objective signs, nodules and cords, were reduced in both groups (p < 0.01) with no differences between groups: a total of 110 (55%) hands (group A: 55, group B: 55) regressed, 74 (37%) hands (group A: 35; group B: 39) were stable. Overall and mean number of nodules, cords and skin changes decreased at 3 and 12 months. 16 of 198 (8%) hands (group A: 7; group B: 9) progressed at 12 months follow-up (""treatment failure""); at 1 year, 7 of 60 patients with unilateral Dupyutren's disease required prophylactic radiotherapy for the contralateral hand due to disease progression. Conclusion(s): Prophylactic radiotherapy reduces symptoms and prevents disease progression in early-stage Dupyutren's disease. Both treatment concepts are well-tolerated and equally effective. Acute toxicity is slightly increased with treatment concept B (7 times 3 Gy), while chronic sequelae are low in both treatment groups. Long-term evaluation with follow-up of more than 5 years has to be awaited to recommend one or the other dose concept.",Excluded
3195,"Comparison between slope-intercept and slope-only techniques for measuring glomerular filtration rate: use of two independent markers and an independent arbiter. PURPOSE: Exclusive use of the half-time of clearance of a filtration marker in the bolus injection, single compartment technique for measuring glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a convenient approach that gives GFR (GFR(SO)) already scaled for extracellular fluid volume (ECV). It has been criticized as less accurate than the conventional, slope-intercept technique (GFR(SI)). The aim of the study was to compare the respective levels of agreement of GFR(SI) and GFR(SO) with GFR based on plasma creatinine (eGFR) used as an independent arbiter., METHODS: GFR was measured with both 51Cr-EDTA and iohexol, simultaneously injected into opposite arms. Plasma obtained bilaterally 20, 40, 60, 120, 180 and 240 min after injection was assayed for marker injected contra-laterally, 51Cr-EDTA by well-counting and iohexol by X-ray fluorescence. ECV and GFR, scaled to body surface area (BSA), were formally measured from six samples and GFR(SI) (scaled to BSA) and GFR(SO) from the last three., RESULTS: Disagreement between GFR(SO) measured with 51Cr-EDTA and eGFR was not significantly higher than the corresponding disagreement between eGFR and GFR(SI). Disagreement between GFR(SO) measured with iohexol and eGFR was significantly higher than between eGFR and GFR(SI). GFR(SI) and GFR(SO) correlated more closely when measured with 51Cr-EDTA than with iohexol. Individual differences between GFR(SI) and GFR(SO) using one marker correlated significantly with ECV measured with the other., CONCLUSIONS: GFR(SO) is critically dependent on the accuracy of half-time measurement and, measured with iohexol, appeared less reliable than GFR(SI). GFR(SI) and GFR(SO) measured with 51Cr-EDTA, however, have similar levels of reliability.",Excluded

Objective: To assess the advantages of Adaptive Iterative Dose Reduction using Three Dimensional Processing (AIDR3D) for image quality improvement and dose reduction for chest computed tomography (CT). Method(s): Institutional Review Boards approved this study and informed consent was obtained. Eighty-eight subjects underwent chest CT at five institutions using identical scanners and protocols. During a single visit, each subject was scanned using different tube currents: 240, 120, and 60 mA. Scan data were converted to images using AIDR3D and a conventional reconstruction mode (without AIDR3D). Using a 5-point scale from 1 (non-diagnostic) to 5 (excellent), three blinded observers independently evaluated image quality for three lung zones, four patterns of lung disease (nodule/mass, emphysema, bronchiolitis, and diffuse lung disease), and three mediastinal measurements (small structure visibility, streak artifacts, and shoulder artifacts). Differences in these scores were assessed by Scheffe's test. Result(s): At each tube current, scans using AIDR3D had higher scores than those without AIDR3D, which were significant for lung zones (p<0.0001) and all mediastinal measurements (p<0.01). For lung diseases, significant improvements with AIDR3D were frequently observed at 120 and 60 mA. Scans with AIDR3D at 120 mA had significantly higher scores than those without AIDR3D at 240 mA for lung zones and mediastinal streak artifacts (p<0.0001), and slightly higher or equal scores for all other measurements. Scans with AIDR3D at 60 mA were also judged superior or equivalent to those without AIDR3D at 120 mA. Conclusion(s): For chest CT, AIDR3D provides better image quality and can reduce radiation exposure by 50%. © 2014 Yamashiro et al.",Excluded
1214,"Dietary carotenoids contribute to normal human skin color and UV photosensitivity. The aim of the current study was to determine whether dietary carotenoids influence skin pigmentation and UV photosensitivity in a healthy unsupplemented panel (n = 22) of Caucasian (skin Type II) subjects. Skin spectrophotometric and tristimulus (L*a*b*) CR200 chromameter readings were made at various body sites to objectively measure skin carotenoid levels and skin color, respectively. The minimal erythemal dose (MED) was also measured to determine the intrinsic UV photosensitivity of the skin. We found that tristimulus b* values (but not L* and a* values) were consistently and closely correlated with skin carotenoid levels at a number of body sites including the back (r = 0.85, P < 0.00001), forehead (r = 0.85, P < 0.00001), inner forearm (r = 0.75, P < 0.0001) and palm of the hand (r = 0.78, P < 0.0001). Skin carotenoid levels and MED were also correlated in these subjects (r = 0.66, P < 0.001), as were tristimulus b* values and MED (r = 0.71, P < 0.0002). From these observations, we conclude that carotenoids from a normal, unsupplemented diet accumulate in the skin and confer a measurable photoprotective benefit (at least in lightly pigmented Caucasian skin), that is directly linked to their concentration in the tissue. Carotenoids also appear to contribute measurably and significantly to normal human skin color, in particular the appearance of yellowness"" as defined objectively by CR200 tristimulus b* values. On the basis of these findings we believe that objective measurements of skin color, in particular tristimulus b* values, may be a potentially useful means of monitoring dietary carotenoid status and assessing UV photosensitivity in Caucasian populations.""",Excluded

Phytomedicine is used now in a wide range because the natural origin which is preferred by all population and is used as a treatment or supplements more safely than chemical drugs. In this study the aqueous extract of Eucalyptus which was extracted by soaking method was used to treat Acne, the study included 60 patients (22 male and 38 female) with Acne in a mean age of (18.5) which were diagnosed in two private dermatologic clinics. The extract was prepared by soaking in distilled water for 72 hours and then concentrated by rotary evaporator. The medium of the extract was pH=6 which is accepted for skin. The aqueous crude extract then mixed with aqua rose cream (weight to volume 1:1) as a base to obtain consistent texture and the final mixture was poured in clean dry polyethylene containers and stored in 7-8 c until use. The extract was applied directly on the affected skin. The study showed that the extract has a significant effect against Acne especially in face. The improvement began after three days of usage in most cases and the improvement persists to reach 40% in the first week of use, 70% in the second week and up to 90% in the third week of use (once daily in duration of six hours). No any side effects were observed during the use of extract.

1696,"Regulation of Nucleolar Dominance Within the Species Drosophila Melanogaster and Within Interspecies Drosophila Hybrids. In eukaryotes, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes are tandemly repeated, forming ribosomal DNA (rDNA) loci that contain hundreds of rRNA genes to meet the demand of ribosome biogenesis. Individual rDNA loci can be entirely silenced or transcribed (termed nucleolar dominance) to control rRNA dosage. The mechanisms through which rDNA silencing is regulated has been extensively studied, however how or why particular loci are chosen to be silenced/transcribed remain elusive. This dissertation aims to understand how the large-scale silencing of nucleolar dominance is determined and how this choice"" might affect a cell or organism. This dissertation utilizes RNA in situ hybridization techniques and chromosome inversions/translocations to characterize nucleolar dominance within the species D. melanogaster. We show that nucleolar dominance is a developmentally-regulated program in D. melanogaster X/Y males, where the Y rDNA dominates in expression over the X rDNA locus over developmental time and in a tissue-specific manner. We expand on the observation that nucleolar dominance does not typically occur between two X rDNA loci in females across development, and that this difference between male and female nucleolar dominance is not due to cellular sex. We further show that the short arm of the Y chromosome, including its rDNA locus, likely contains elements that dictate its dominant expression over the X rDNA locus. This study on nucleolar dominance in D. melanogaster adds insights into how the ""choice"" of rDNA locus silencing/expression is made.Nucleolar dominance was originally discovered to occur in interspecies hybrids where one species rDNA dominates over another. Whether or not nucleolar dominance is similar within a species and in interspecies hybrids has been extensively studied in Arabidopsis, but has been limited in studies of Drosophila. By utilizing RNA in situ hybridization probes that distinguish rRNA from the closely related species D. melanogaster and D. simulans, we expand on the characterization of nucleolar dominance in Drosophila interspecies hybrids to different stages of development. We find that both rDNA loci in interspecies hybrid Drosophila are expressed in early embryogenesis and that nucleolar dominance (D. melanogaster rDNA dominance and D. simulans rDNA silencing) is established across development, similar to that seen in ""pure species"" Drosophila and Arabidopsis. When D. simulans females and D. melanogaster males form hybrids, the female progeny die during early embryonic divisions as a result of chromosome bridge formation at the large X-chromosome specific heterochromatic block of 359-bp satellite DNA, a satellite DNA specific to D. melanogaster. The D. melanogaster mutant Zhr1, which lacks 359-bp satellite DNA on the X chromosome, is known to rescue this female lethality. This dissertation reveals for the first time that Zhr1-rescued interspecies hybrid females have reversed nucleolar dominance where D. simulans rDNA is expressed and D. melanogaster rDNA is silenced. This dissertation suggests that rDNA and Zhr (359-bp) have a relationship that may connect nucleolar dominance with female lethality seen in these D. melanogaster D. simulans hybrids. This dissertation lays the groundwork to further understand how the organization and function of highly repetitive regions (rDNA) and proximal species-specific satellite DNAs (359-bp) may have relationships that act as barriers between species. In summary, this dissertation begins to uncover the mechanisms underlying nucleolar dominance within the species D. melanogaster and aims to understand how the regulation and divergence of nucleolar dominance and satellite DNAs may have consequences that manifest in barriers between species.

1084,"Routine computed tomography in the evaluation of vocal fold movement impairment without an apparent cause. OBJECTIVE: Routine computed tomography (CT) for vocal fold movement impairment (VFMI) without an apparent cause is common. However, given increased cancer risk associated with ionizing radiation exposure, our purpose is to evaluate the utility of routine scans for these patients., STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series., SETTING: Houston, Texas., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A 5-year review of patients with VFMI diagnosed at an academic institution was conducted. For patients without an apparent cause (eg, recent head, neck, or cardiothoracic surgery or known malignancy), CT head/neck and chest was performed to evaluate the recurrent laryngeal nerve course. Data included demographics, symptoms, radiography, and interventions. Statistical analyses were performed via chi(2) analysis., RESULTS: Of 406 patients with VFMI, 47 (11%) patients had no apparent cause clinically. Routine CT revealed abnormalities in 10 (21%) patients, of which only 3 (6%) could account for VFMI: benign thyroid adenoma (1), papillary thyroid cancer (1), and an esophageal mass (1). The most common lesion detected involved the thyroid. Demographic data and symptom type were not significantly associated with detection of a VFMI-attributable lesion on CT. Overall, routine CT did not identify a focal etiology in 94% patients with VFMI without an apparent cause., CONCLUSION: Routine pan-CT evaluation failed to reveal an etiology in 94% of patients with VFMI without an apparent cause. Patients may be subjected to health risks associated with radiation exposure without significant diagnostic benefit. Further studies should consider more judicious use of CT in the context of risk factors and safer imaging modalities as the initial diagnostic step.

3536,"Preclinical evaluation of dual-energy imaging for lung tumor image guided radiotherapy. Purpose/Objective(s): Dual energy (DE) imaging is routinely used in diagnostic radiology to produce tissue-selective x-ray images. DE imaging uses two different energies, such as 120kVp and 60 kVp. By performing a weighted subtraction of the logarithm of these images, subtraction images can be created to enhance either soft tissue or bone. In the lung, DE imaging can be used to eliminate overlying bony anatomy to improve tumor visualization. The goal of this study was to evaluate the theoretical potential of DE imaging to improve localization of lung tumors in patients undergoing image guided radiotherapy (IGRT). Materials/Methods: Free-breathing planning CT scans of 20 patients with stage IA or IB NSCLC were evaluated for this study. Software was written to convert the Hounsfield units (HU) of the CT scans into attenuation coefficients for 60kV and 120 kV x-rays. Subsequently, digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) were generated for each of these energies.Weighted subtraction was performed to create tissue selective subtraction images that highlight soft tissue. These soft tissue images were compared with the standard DRRs to evaluate tumor contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). CNR represents the difference between the tumor signal and the background, divided by the standard deviation (noise) of these regions. Thus, CNR provides a quantitative measure of tumor visibility. Result(s): Qualitatively, DE subtraction resulted in the complete disappearance of bone and provided improved visualization of lung tumors on anterior-posterior DE-DRRs relative to standard DRRs. The average CNR for DE-DRRs was 5.74 +/- 1.85 vs 3.99 +/- 2.04 for standard DRRs, p<0.01. This represents an improvement of 44% in the CNR when using DE-DRRs. Of interest, the presence of breast tissue in female patients resulted in lower CNRs for both standard and DE-DRRs. In females (7 patients) the average CNR was 5.05 +/- 1.82 for DE-DRRs and 3.35 +/- 1.19 for standard DRRs, compared to 6.11 +/- 1.83 and 4.33 +/- 2.35 in males (13 patients), respectively. Despite the lower CNRs in female patients, the DE-DRRs represented an improvement of 51% over standard DRRs, which is comparable to the improvement in males of 41%. Conclusion(s): DE subtraction chest imaging that enhances soft tissue may improve target localization in lung cancer patients receiving kV-based IGRT planar imaging.We believe that this approach could improve daily localization as well as be used as part of an adaptive radiotherapy program. We are further investigating the use of DE subtraction imaging in this setting including an analysis of image acquisition dose to the patients.

756,"Plasma concentration of Donepezil did not accurately predict tissue concentration: A dynamic whole-body PET study in humans. Background: Donepezil hydrochloride (DNP) is acetylcholine esterase inhibitor most prescribed in patients with Alzheimer's disease. We previously reported its accumulation to brain, myocardium, and pancreas using PET with 11C-DNP. Objects: The purpose of this study was to reveal whether the DNP concentration in these organs could be predicted by measuring its plasma concentration. Method(s): Ten healthy volunteers (5 men and 5 women, age range from 40 to 58 year old, mean age 48.3 year old) were enrolled. 11C-DNP (220 MBq, less than 7mug) was intravenously infused for 1 min immediately followed by 7 repeated whole-body scans (7 min data acquisition in each scan) for 60 min. Radioactivity concentration in brain, pancreas, and myocardium was measured by PMOD software. Time activity curve (TAC) in plasma obtained from arterialized venous blood was measured at 10 time points. Metabolite fraction was measured at 30 min by using HPLC. We assumed linear increase in metabolite fraction during scanning and obtained metabolite-corrected TAC (cTAC) of 11C-DNP. We examined the correlation between integrated TAC and tissue radioactivity of brain, pancreas, and myocardium. We also examined the correlation between plasma radioactivity at single time point and tissue radioactivity in these organs. Result(s): There was no significant correlation between integrated plasma radioactivity (0 to 30 min, 0 to 50 min) and tissue radioactivity at 30 min or 50 min in brain (p=0.066, p = 0.096), pancreas (p=0.156, p=0.162), and myocardium (p=0.308, p=0.481). Metabolite fraction of 11CDNP in plasma was 21.2 +/- 8.6% at 30 min. By using cTAC, we also found no significant correlation between plasma and tissue radioactivity. Conclusion(s): Although plasma concentration has been usually employed to predict tissue concentration of drugs, in case of DNP, plasma concentration did not accurately estimate tissue concentration. PET with positron emitting nuclide-labeled drug may provide more accurate and direct information on the tissue concentration of drugs.",Excluded

High-precision radiotherapy has been established as a valid and effective treatment option in patients with pituitary adenomas. We report on outcome after fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT) in correlation with patient-reported outcomes (PROs). We analyzed 69 patients treated between 2000 and 2019. FSRT was delivered with a median total dose of 54 Gy (single fraction: 1.8 Gy). PRO questionnaires were sent to 28 patients. Median overall survival was 17.2 years; mean local control was 15.6 years (median not reached). Median follow-up was 5.8 years. Twenty (71%) patients participated in the PRO assessment. Physicians reported symptoms grade >=3 in 6 cases (9%). Of all, 35 (51%) patients suffered from hypopituitarism at baseline, and during follow-up, new or progressive hypopituitarism was observed in 11 cases (16%). Patients reported 10 cases of severe side effects. Most of these symptoms were already graded as CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) grade 2 by a physician in a previous follow-up exam. PROs are an essential measure and only correlate to a certain extent with the physician-reported outcomes. For high-precision radiotherapy of pituitary adenomas, they confirm excellent overall outcomes and low toxicity. In the future, the integration of PROs paired with high-end treatment will further improve outcomes.Copyright © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Excluded
3394,"Prospects of application of new photosensitizer Elophit"" in photodynamic therapy for treating some dermatologic diseases"". Purpose: Purpose of the present work was to study photosensitizer (PS) Elophit"" effectiveness for PDT sessions in some dermatologic diseases. Material(s) and Method(s): Gel ""Elophit"" is a complex substance containing chlorins E6 (0.5%), copper chlorophyllin (0.5%), hyaluronic acid (2%) (conformance certificate No. ROSS RU.IM; 25130 2322). Therapeutic effects are produced not only due to the chlorin E6 photodynamic (PDT) action but also due to the action of copper derivatives which have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating effects. The preparation easily penetrates into the skin and accumulates in inflammatory foci. Gel ""Elophit"" was put on skin lesions 40 min before PDT session. Before the session preparation remnants were removed off the skin with a mild alcohol solution. PDT was performed in 12 patients with Acne vulgaris (papulla-pustular form) (4 males, 8 females), 8 patients with superficial forms of streptostaphylodermias (5 males, 3 females). Controls were 24 patients with Acne vulgaris (papulla-pustular form), 20 patients with streptostaphylodermias. Age - 17-58 years old, disease duration from 1 week to 6 years. Patients from the control group received traditional therapy without PDT component. Device ""Soljaris"" with incorporated diodes in the range 660 mum, irradiation power 400 mW was used as a light source. Irradiation was done in a scan manner (70-270 J/cm2). Sessions - twice a week. Research results were assessed by changes in the clinical picture using biophometry techniques with laser therapeutic apparatus ""Milta F-8-01"" having an in-built biophotometer. These changes are shown in photomaterials. FS accumulation degree in the skin was determined with spectrometry (apparatus ""LESA-01-BIOSPEC""). Result(s): A complete rash regression after 4-8 PDT sessions (in 2 weeks - 1 month) was seen in 8 (66.6%) patients with Acne vulgaris, in 5 (62.5%) patients with streptostaphylodermia; in the rest of patients a considerable clinical improvement was seen. No changes in clinical picture during PDT treatment was seen in 2 (16.6%) patients with Acne vulgaris and in 1 (12.5%) patients with streptostaphylodermia. In the controls one month later a clinical remission was seen in 10 (41.6%) patients with Acne vulgaris and in 11 (55%) patients with streptostaphylodermias, no changes - in 7 (29.1%) patients with Acne vulgaris and in 6 (30%) patients with streptostaphylodermias, in the rest of patients - a partial rash regression. A fluorescent examination has shown less FS fluorescence (by 60-75%) in the skin after irradiation what indicates a marked phodynamic effect with a considerable discharge of singlet oxygen. Clinical observations have been confirmed by the results of biophotometric examinations of skin lesions when one could see changes typical for decreased or resorpted inflammatory processes. Conclusion(s): Thus, as it has been shown by preliminary findings PDT with photosensitizer ""Elophit"" may be an effective technique for treating some dermatologic pathologies. Further researches are needed to study better effectiveness of PDT with gel ""Elophit"" application in dermatologic practice so as to determine indications and to develop optimal schemes for treatment.""",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): From 2007 to 2014 one hundred & ten patients were recruited. 59 out of 110 underwent NACT. All underwent lumpectomy and axillary dissection & intraoperatively template guided rigid/flexible needle with 2 or 3 plane. After 2D/3D based CT - planning, HDR dose of 15-16 Gy/2 - 2.5 Gy/# BD given for 3-5 days. Whole breast irradiation (46-50 Gy) was delivered after a 2-3 weeks' gap. CTV & DHI parameters were studied. Acute skin toxicity assessed at end of treatment. Cosmetic assessment done at 3 months according to Harvard scale. Unpaired t and Chi-square tests were used for analysis of parameters. Result(s): The ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence rate was (5) 4.5% with median follow up 5.4 years. Mean D90 (91.5%) and V90 (90.7%). Mean V100 was 84.20%. DHI range 0.7-0.8. The ipsilateral breast except the CTV (Breast-CTV) received a mean dose of 33.2%. Mean dose received by heart was 7.2%. Mean dose received by contralateral breast was (V5%) 1.6% & (V10%) 0.08%. Mean dose received by ipsilateral lung was (V5%) 46% & 18% (V10%). Mean dose to skin is significantly 24.9% brachytherapy. Excellent/good overall cosmesis is observed in 69 patients and fair/poor cosmesis observed in 32 patients. Poor cosmesis was observed in 9 patients. Conclusion(s): Breast conservation treatment options show comparable local control with acceptable dosimetric parameters & cosmetic outcomes even in LABC. With careful patient selection, optimal treatment planning, and careful attention to excision margins & radiation doses, breast conservation can be performed in these patients without sacrificing local control of disease.",Excluded
2592,"Fat Grafting as a Novel Treatment for Xerostomia. PURPOSE: Within the context of xerostomia, there is evidence that adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) can differentiate into salivary gland cells in the appropriate environment. The purpose of this study was to preliminarily investigate whether fat grafting as practiced in the United States would be an effective treatment for xerostomia. METHOD(S): Patients were selected for the study if they were seeking treatment for xerostomia after radiation treatment to the head and neck for cancer treatment. Fat grafting was performed in bilateral parotid and submandibular glands. Visual Analog Scale (VAS) of xerostomia was used both preoperatively and postoperatively to assess the effect upon xerostomia symptoms. RESULT(S): Nine patients were included in this study. All patients had complaints of long-standing xerostomia. The average preoperative VAS score was 9.1. All patients tolerated all rounds of fat grafting with no complications. The average postoperative VAS score was 6.0. Compared to preoperative scores, all patients had improvement in VAS scores. The decrease in average VAS score postoperatively (9.1 versus 6.0) was statistically significant (P = 0.007). CONCLUSION(S): Our study showed that there was improvement in xerostomia symptoms with autologous fat transfer alone. This is a novel finding for fat grafting demonstrating regenerative potential. There has been extensive basic research that has shown that adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells can have a protective and restorative role after salivary gland radiation damage.

UVB irradiation was in summer (April-October) higher than in winter (November-March) (5.6 kJ/m vs. 0.5 kJ/m, p<0.0001). However, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in summer remained high with 76% in T2DM and 59% in GDM. In a stepwise regression analysis for the 25(OH)D3 concentration, significant predictors were outdoor temperature (estimate=0.02, p<0.0001), UVB radiation (estimate=-0.0015, p=0.02), year (2006 vs. 2005 estimate=-0.06, p>0.05, 2007 vs. 2005: estimate=-0.13, p<0.0001) and diabetes type (estimate=0.06, p=0.03). In conclusion, the strong correlation between UVB radiation and 25(OH)D3 concentrations in T2DM and GDM patients determines the seasonal variation. Additional determinants for the 25(OH)D3 concentrations were outdoor temperature, year, and diabetes type. Despite the effects of solar radiation both patients groups remain largely vitamin D deficient during summers.Copyright © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart, New York.",Excluded
2375,"[Which follow-up program after radiotherapy?]. Patients' follow-up after treatment represents a growing part of the radiation oncologist activity. Treatment effectiveness and morbidity are essential criteria to evaluate the quality of a clinical practice. Morbidity and mortality reviews and feedback experience meetings have been made mandatory. Post-treatment follow-up has to be explicitly and formally organized. In the present article, we review the existing recommendations and consider several examples regarding frequently encountered cancers.

1342,"The small molecule drug CBL0137 increases the level of DNA damage and the efficacy of radiotherapy for glioblastoma. Glioblastoma (GBM) is an incurable brain tumor with inevitable recurrence. This is in part due to a highly malignant cancer stem cell (CSC) subpopulation of tumor cells that is particularly resistant to conventional treatments, including radiotherapy. Here we show that CBL0137, a small molecule anti-cancer agent, sensitizes GBM CSCs to radiotherapy. CBL0137 sequesters the FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) complex to chromatin, resulting in cytotoxicity preferentially within tumor cells. We show that when combined with radiotherapy, CBL0137 inhibited GBM CSC growth and resulted in more DNA damage in the CSCs compared to irradiation or drug alone. Using an in vivo subcutaneous model, we showed that the frequency of GBM CSCs was reduced when tumors were pretreated with CBL0137 and then exposed to irradiation. Survival studies with orthotopic GBM models resulted in significantly extended survival for mice treated with combinatorial therapy. As GBM CSCs contribute to the inevitable recurrence in patients, targeting them is imperative. This work establishes a new treatment paradigm for GBM that sensitizes CSCs to irradiation and may ultimately reduce tumor recurrence.Copyright © 2020",Excluded
2247,"A multicenter, prospective pilot study of gamma knife radiosurgery for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy: seizure response, adverse events, and verbal memory. OBJECTIVE: The safety, efficacy, and morbidity of radiosurgery (RS) must be established before it can be offered as an alternative to open surgery for unilateral mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. We report the 3-year outcomes of a multicenter, prospective pilot study of RS., METHODS: RS was randomized to 20 or 24Gy targeting the amygdala, hippocampus, and parahippocampal gyrus. Seizure diaries evaluated the final seizure remission between months 24 and 36. Verbal memory was evaluated at baseline and 24m with the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R) and California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT). Patients were classified as having ""significant improvement,"" ""no change,"" and ""significant impairment"" based on relative change indices., RESULTS: Thirteen high-dose and 17 low-dose patients were treated. Both groups showed significant reductions in seizures by 1 year after treatment. At the 36-month follow-up evaluation, 67% of patients were free of seizures for the prior 12 months (high dose: 10/13, 76.9%; low dose: 10/17, 58.8%). Use of steroids, headaches, and visual field defects did not differ by dose or seizure remission. The prevalence of verbal memory impairment was 15% (4/26 patients); none declined on more than one measure. The prevalence of significant verbal memory improvements was 12% (3/26)., INTERPRETATION: RS for unilateral mesial temporal lobe epilepsy offers seizure remission rates comparable with those reported previously for open surgery. There were no major safety concerns with high-dose RS compared with low-dose RS. Additional research is required to determine whether RS may be a treatment option for some patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.",Excluded
3379,"Characteristics and outcomes of traumatic spinal cord injury in a low-resource setting. Spinal cord injury (SCI) is relatively rare and affects an estimated 15-40 per 1 million people globally. All patients admitted from October 2016 to June 2017 at Kamuzu Central Hospital, Malawi with a spinal column injury were retrospectively studied. Out of 1442 patients, 46 had vertebral column injury, and half of these had neurological deficit. The most common mechanism of injury was road traffic crash (45.7%), and cervical SCIs were the most common (41.3%). The overall mortality was 15.2%, thus demonstrating devastating morbidity and mortality. Owing to the latter, and the relative lack of operative facilities, primary prevention remains the most effective way to attenuate the tragedy of SCIs.Copyright © The Author(s) 2018.",Excluded
1555,"The impact of radiotherapy dose and other treatment-related and clinical factors on in-field control in stage I and II non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Purpose/Objective: To assess local (in-field) disease control, identify potential prognostic factors, and elucidate the optimal radiotherapy dose in various clinical settings of Stage I and II nonHodgkin's lymphoma (non-CNS). Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 285 consecutive patients with Stage I and II non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were treated with curative intent, including 159 with radiotherapy (RT) alone and 126 with combined-modality therapy (CMT). Of these, 72 patients had low-grade lymphomas (LGL), 92 had intermediate or high-grade lymphomas (I/HGL), and 21 had unclassified lymphomas. Clinical and treatment variables with potential prognostic significance for in-field disease control, freedom from relapse (FFR), and absolute survival (AS) were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses. Result(s): The 5-, 10-, and 20-year actuarial AS rates were 73%, 46%, and 33% for patients with LGL and 64%, 44%, and 18% for patients with I/HGL, respectively. The 5-, 10-, and 20- year actuarial FFR rates were 62%, 59%, and 49% for patients with LGL and 66%, 57%, and 57% for patients with I/HGL, respectively. Significant prognostic factors identified by the multivariate analysis were age, tumor size, and histology for AS; tumor size and treatment for FFR; and only tumor size for in-field disease control. There were 95 total failures, with only 12 occurring infield. Most failures (65%) were in contiguous unirradiated sites. All 4 in-field failures in patients with LGL occurred after RT doses < 30 Gy, although none occurred in 10 patients with small-volume LGL of the orbit treated with doses < 30 Gy. The 8 in-field failures in patients with I/HGL were distributed evenly throughout the RT dose range; 5 occurred in patients treated with CMT, all with tumors > 6 cm, and 4 with less than a complete response (CR) to chemotherapy. Conclusion(s): Our analysis suggests that the overwhelming problem in the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is not in- field failure but, rather, failure in contiguous unirradiated sites. A dose of 20-25 Gy may be sufficient for small-volume LGL of the orbit. A dose of 30 Gy is sufficient for LGL in general, as well as for patients with nonbulky (<= 6 cm) I/HGL treated with CMT who have a CR. However, patients with I/HGL treated with CMT for tumors > 6 cm and/or without a CR may benefit from doses >= 40 Gy.",Excluded
2495,"Detectability of radiation-induced changes in magnetic resonance biomarkers following stereotactic radiosurgery: A pilot study. Our objective was to investigate direct voxel-wise relationship between dose and early MR biomarker changes both within and in the high-dose region surrounding brain metastases following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Specifically, we examined the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) from diffusion-weighted imaging and the contrast transfer coefficient (Ktrans) and volume of extracellular extravascular space (ve) derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI data. We investigated 29 brain metastases in 18 patients using 3 T MRI to collect imaging data at day 0, day 3 and day 20 following SRS. The ADC maps were generated by the scanner and Ktrans and ve maps were generated using in-house software for dynamic tracer-kinetic analysis. To enable spatially-correlated voxel-wise analysis, we developed a registration pipeline to register all ADC, Ktrans and ve maps to the planning MRI scan. To interrogate longitudinal changes, we computed absolute DELTAADC, DELTAKtrans and DELTAve for day 3 and 20 post-SRS relative to day 0. We performed a Kruskall-Wallice test on each biomarker between time points and investigated dose correlations within the gross tumour volume (GTV) and surrounding high dose region > 12 Gy via Spearman's rho. Only ve exhibited significant differences between day 0 and 20 (p < 0.005) and day 3 and 20 (p < 0.05) within the GTV following SRS. Strongest dose correlations were observed for ADC within the GTV (rho = 0.17 to 0.20) and weak correlations were observed for ADC and Ktrans in the surrounding > 12 Gy region. Both DELTAKtrans and DELTAve showed a trend with dose at day 20 within the GTV and > 12 Gy region (rho = -0.04 to -0.16). Weak dose-related decreases in Ktrans and ve within the GTV and high dose region at day 20 most likely reflect underlying vascular responses to radiation. Our study also provides a voxel-wise analysis schema for future MR biomarker studies with the goal of elucidating surrogates for radionecrosis.",Excluded
301,"Evidence that ferritin is UV inducible in human skin: part of a putative defense mechanism. As ferritin has been identified as an important factor in antioxidant defense in cultured human skin cells we evaluated the presence of ferritin in human skin in vivo and the modifications following irradiation with UVA I, UVA I + II, and solar simulating light by immunohistochemical analysis. We report that the putative protective protein ferritin is regularly present in the basal layer of unirradiated epidermis in vivo and that the induction of ferritin was dependent on wavelength and cell type. Following UVA I radiation, ferritin increased both in epidermal and in dermal tissue. The same response occurred, although to a lesser extent, with UVA I + II but did not occur following solar simulating radiation. Quantitative analysis for ferritin in cultured keratinocytes and fibroblasts from seven individuals following each UV spectra were also assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The induction of ferritin by UV was highly dependent on the waveband and cell type. UVA I and UVA I + II radiations induced ferritin expression in dermal fibroblasts up to 260% and 200% over basal levels, respectively. Solar simulating radiation produced only a small induction of approximately 130% over basal ferritin levels in dermal fibroblasts. Ferritin increased in cultured fibroblasts as early as 3 h post-UVA with a peak at 6 h that remained until 48 h; there was no observable qualitative or quantitative increase seen in the undifferentiated cultured epidermal keratinocytes. Our findings indicate that the putative defense system of ferritin exists in human skin in vivo and its induction is dependent on UV spectra and cell type. The increased concentrations of this antioxidant in human skin following acute UV radiation could afford increased protection against subsequent oxidative stress.",Excluded
2369,"Calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition in a cohort of 52 patients with Gitelman Syndrome. Background: Gitelman syndrome (GS) is a rare recessively inherited tubulop-athy, caused by inactive mutations in SLC12A3 gene encoding the thiazide-sensi-tive-sodium-chloride transporter. It is characterized by an hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis with hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria. Calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal deposition is frequently described in GS case-reports but its prevalence and clinical phenotype are unknown. Objective(s): The aim is to describe clinical, biological and radiological features of CPP in a cohort of patients with genetically proven GS. Method(s): All patients (pts) with genetically proven GS in the French national reference center of rare diseases were proposed to have a consultation with a senior rheumatologist. Demographic data, history of joint pain and flare and biology disorders were recorded. Other causes of CPP disease were systematically ruled out. CPP crystal deposition was assessed by X-rays (all peripheral joints and cervical spine) and ultrasonography (US) (wrist, knee, ankle joints and symptomatic joints). Patients with history of cervical pain underwent computed tomography (CT) of the full cervical spine from occipital bone to C1-T1 disk, including temporomandibular joints. Result(s): Fifty-two GS pts (21 men, mean age 46.5+/- 12.2 years) have been examined by a rheumatologist. Almost all patients had an heterozygous mutation on SLC12A3 gene. Forty-four pts experienced joint pain (84.6%), 23 joint flares (44,2%) and 25 cervical pain (48.1%). X-rays were performed in 42 pts, US in 38 and CT in 23. CPP depositions were observed in 36 (85.7%), 27 (71.1%) and 15 pts (65.2%) by X-rays, US and CT, respectively. All techniques combined, chondrocalcinosis was discovered in 42 patients. Deposits occurred in knees (n=32), wrists (n=29), cervical spine (n=23), ankles and feet (n=22) and shoulders (n=16). CPP depositions were widespread involving at least 3 joints in 27 (55.1%) pts. In knees, CPP depositions involved menisci (n=24), hyaline cartilages (n=16) and ligament or joint capsule (n=15). Cervical spine CT demonstrated CPP deposition in vertebral discs (n=17), transverse ligament (n=13), other ligament (n=13), vertebral facets (n=3) and temporo-mandibular joints (n=5). Patients with CPP crystal deposition in more than 3 joints were significantly older (52.8+/-10.5 years) than patients with 2 or 3 affected joints (40.8+/-11.6 years, p=0.02) or patients without any affected joint (36.6+/-8.1 years, p=0.001). They were also more symptomatic with significantly more joint flares (p<0.0001). Mag-nesemia was inversely correlated with the number of affected joints: patients with >3 or 2-3 affected joints had a significantly lower magnesemia (0.57+/-0.1 and 0.59 +/-0.1 mM, respectively) than patients with only 1 affected joint (0.83+/-0.1 mM). CPP crystal deposition was not associated with potassium level. (Table Presented).",Excluded
1007,"Experience of direct coronary stenting at National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy, safety and advantage of direct coronary stenting versus traditional angioplasty and stenting., METHODS: From May 2000 to June 2001, 486 patients underwent PTCA procedure. One hundred fifteen (24%) were considered candidates for direct stenting. Out of 150 coronary lesions, 119 (79%) had direct coronary stenting. In 5% patients stent could not be passed across the lesion. These stents were withdrawn without stent damage and after predilatation the same were successfully deployed., RESULTS: Primary success rate was 95%. Angiographically assessed success was achieved in all patients with immediate TIMI 111 flow in 97%. The vessels directly stented were LAD 53%, RCA 27% and LCX 18%. Two saphenous vein grafts were also directly stented. The coronary lesions stented were type A 36%, B1 54% and B2 10%. In borderline lesions IVUS was used for quantification of stenosis. There was no in-hospital death, MI or emergency CABG. Compared to traditional stenting there was 46% reduction in procedure time, 62% reduction in radiation exposure time and 35% decrease in use of contrast media. There was also significant (18%) cost benefit in direct stenting., CONCLUSION: This study supports the view that direct coronary stenting is feasible and a safe procedure in our population with additional benefits of cost reduction by 18%.

2795,"Plaque quantification by coronary computed tomography angiography using intravascular ultrasound as a reference standard: A comparison between standard and last generation computed tomography scanners. Aims: The emerging role of coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) as a non-invasive tool for atherosclerosis evaluation is supported by data reporting a good correlation between CCTA and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) for plaque volume quantification. Aim of the present study was to evaluate whether a last generation CT-scanner may improve coronary plaque volume assessment using IVUS as standard-of-reference. Methods and Results: From a registry of 1915 consecutive, all-comers, patients who underwent a clinically indicated IVUS evaluation we enrolled 59 patients who underwent CCTA with a 64-slice CT (Group 1) and 59 patients who underwent CCTA with whole-heart coverage CT scanner (Group 2). Patients who underwent CCTA with unfavourable heart rhythm were not excluded from the analysis. Image quality (4-point Likert scale) focused on plaque analysis was evaluated. Plaque volume quantification by CCTA was compared to IVUS. No difference in clinical characteristics was found between Group 1 and Group 2. Plaque volume quantification by CCTA was considered not feasible in 11 plaques of Group 1 and in 4 plaques of Group 2 (P = 0.09). Higher correlation for plaque volume quantification by CCTA vs. IVUS was demonstrated in Group 2 when compared with Group 1 (r = 0.9888 vs. 0.9499; P < 0.0001). The Bland-Altman analysis showed plaque volume overestimation by CCTA of 11.9 mm3 in Group 1 and 4 mm2 in Group 2 (P < 0.001). Effective radiation dose of CCTA was significantly lower in Group 2 vs. Group 1 (2.7 +/- 0.9 vs. 8.1 +/- 3.6 mSv, respectively; P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): CCTA using a new scanner generation showed to be an accurate non-invasive tool to assess and quantify coronary plaque volume.Copyright © 2019 Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

Multiple competing normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) models have been proposed for predicting symptomatic radiation-induced lung injury in human. In this paper we tested the efficacy of four common NTCP models applied quantitatively to sub-clinical X-ray computed tomography (CT)-density changes in the lung following radiotherapy. Radiotherapy planning datasets and follow-up chest CTs were obtained in eight patients treated for targets within the lung or hilar region. Image pixel-wise radiation dose exposure versus change in observable CT Hounsfield units was recorded for early (2-5 months) and late (6-9 months) time-points. Four NTCP models, Lyman, Logistic, Weibull and Poisson, were fit to the population data. The quality of fits was assessed by five statistical criteria. All four models fit the data significantly (p<0.05) well at early, late and cumulative time points. The Lyman model fitted best for early effects while the Weibull Model fitted best for late effects. No significant difference was found between the fits of the models and with respect to parameters D50 and gamma50. The D50 estimates were more robust than gamma50 to image registration error. For analyzing population-based sub-clinical CT pixel intensity-based dose response, all four models performed well.",Excluded

Introduction: We examined responses of volunteers with known medical disease to G forces in a centrifuge to evaluate how potential commercial spaceflight participants (SFPs) might tolerate the forces of spaceflight despite significant medical history. Method(s): Volunteers were recruited based upon suitability for each of five disease categories (hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, lung disease, back or neck problems) or a control group. Subjects underwent seven centrifuge runs over 2 d. Day 1 consisted of two +Gz runs (peak 5 +3.5 Gz, Run 2) and two +Gx runs (peak = +6.0 Gx, Run 4). Day 2 consisted of three runs approximating suborbital spaceflight profiles (combined +Gx and +Gz, peak = +6.0 Gx/+4.0 Gz). Data collected included blood pressure, electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry, neurovestibular exams, and post-run questionnaires regarding motion sickness, disorientation, grayout, and other symptoms. Result(s): A total of 335 subjects registered for participation, of which 86 (63 men, 23 women, age 20-78 yr) participated in centrifuge trials. The most common causes for disqualification were weight and severe and uncontrolled medical or psychiatric disease. Five subjects voluntarily withdrew from the second day of testing: three for anxiety reasons, one for back strain, and one for time constraints. Maximum hemodynamic values recorded included HR of 192 bpm, systolic BP of 217 mmHg, and diastolic BP of 144 mmHg. Common subjective complaints included grayout (69%), nausea (20%), and chest discomfort (6%).

Background Role of pre-cut fistulotomy in reducing fluoroscopy time and radiation dose in difficult selective biliary cannulation is unknown. Methods This is a prospective randomized controlled trial where patients with difficult biliary cannulation were randomized into 2 groups, viz, Group I -Early pre-cut fistulotomy after difficult biliary cannulation at 5 minutes and Group II- Late pre-cut fistulotomy after failure of conventional methods of selective biliary cannulation for 15 minutes. We compared the success rates of selective biliary cannulation along with fluoroscopy time and radiation dose, the complication rates, need for repeat Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) and need for other interventions in early and late pre-cut fistulotomy. Results Of the 130 eligible patients screened, 40 patients were randomized. The technical success was comparable between early and late group. The ERC time was less and the fluoroscopy time and radiation dose were significantly less in the early group (4 minutes [3, 6] vs. 15 minutes [8, 28], p=0.001) and (1.35 mGy [0.90, 1.63] vs. 2.40 mGy [1.58, 3.25], p=0.010) respectively. In the late group, 60 % required need for rescue pre-cut fistulotomy. One patient from late group developed PEP while 1 from early developed perforation.

BACKGROUND: Survivors of young adult malignancies are at risk of accumulated exposures to radiation from repetitive diagnostic imaging. We designed a population-based cohort study to describe patterns of diagnostic imaging and cumulative diagnostic radiation exposure among survivors of young adult cancer during a survivorship time period where surveillance imaging is not typically warranted., METHODS: Young adults aged 20-44 diagnosed with invasive malignancy in Ontario from 1992-1999 who lived at least 5 years from diagnosis were identified using the Ontario Cancer Registry and matched 5 to 1 to randomly selected cancer-free persons. We determined receipt of 5 modalities of diagnostic imaging and associated radiation dose received by survivors and controls from years 5-15 after diagnosis or matched referent date through administrative data. Matched pairs were censored six months prior to evidence of recurrence., RESULTS: 20,911 survivors and 104,524 controls had a median of 13.5 years observation. Survivors received all modalities of diagnostic imaging at significantly higher rates than controls. Survivors received CT at a 3.49-fold higher rate (95% Confidence Interval [CI]:3.37, 3.62) than controls in years 5 to 15 after diagnosis.

The treatment was chosen because of a high operative risk, previous thyroidectomy, or refusal to be operated on., MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Standard thyroid function variables and ultrasonically determined thyroid volume before treatment as well as 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment and then once a year., RESULTS: 56 patients were treated with a single dose of 131I, 12 with two doses, and one with four doses. In 45 patients treated with one dose and remaining euthyroid the median thyroid volume was reduced from 73 (interquartile range 50-106) ml to 29 (23-48) ml at 24 months in the 39 patients in whom this was measured during follow up. The median reduction was 40 (22-48) ml (60% reduction, p < 0.0001), half of which occurred within three months. Patients treated with two doses as well as those developing hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism had a significant reduction in thyroid volume.

Flap necrosis was correlated with body mass index >25 (P = 0.022), with smoking (P = 0.04 9) and with radiation therapy at the recipient site (P = 0.020). The long-term morbidity at the donor-site was low, except for scar appearance (17.24%), thigh contour deformity (58.62%), and hypoesthesia (17.24%). Significant age and gender differences were seen for ranking of scar ugliness, with females (P = 0.0061) and younger patients (age <=55) (P = 0.046) assigned higher values. Significant age differences were seen for ranking of thigh contour deformity, with younger patients assigned higher values (P = 0.0012).

2065,"Measuring and Monitoring Skeletal Muscle Mass after Stroke: A Review of Current Methods and Clinical Applications. Objectives: Muscle mass at admission is important to survive stroke, and stroke-induced sarcopenia is a serious problem because of its poor prognosis. Muscle mass measurement and monitoring are essential for appropriate rehabilitation and nutrition management. However, few reviews are available about the muscle mass measurement and monitoring after stroke. Material(s) and Method(s): Several methods are used to assess skeletal muscle mass in stroke, such as computed tomography (CT), ultrasound, bioelectrical impedance analysis, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, biomarkers, and anthropometrics. We summarized the current methods and clinical applications in stroke. Result(s): In stroke, a head CT is used to estimate muscle mass by measuring the temporal muscle. However, it can be conducted retrospectively due to radiation exposure. After stroke, limb muscle atrophy and diaphragm dysfunction are observed using ultrasound. However, ultrasound requires an understanding of the methods and skill. A bioelectrical impedance analysis can be used to assess muscle mass in patients after a stroke unless they have dynamic fluid changes. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry is used for follow-up after hospital discharge. Urinary titin N-fragment and serum C-terminal agrin fragment reflect muscle atrophy after stroke. Anthropometrics may be useful with limited resources. Conclusion(s): We summarized the features of each measurement and proved the recent evidence to properly measure and monitor skeletal muscle mass after stroke.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
29,"A tactile display for International Space Station (ISS) extravehicular activity (EVA). Background: A tactile display to increase an astronaut's situational awareness during an extravehicular activity (EVA) has been developed and ground tested. The Tactor Locator System (TLS) is a non-intrusive, intuitive display capable of conveying position and velocity information via a vibrotactile stimulus applied to the subject's neck and torso. In the Earth's 1 G environment, perception of position and velocity is determined by the body's individual sensory systems. Under normal sensory conditions, redundant information from these sensory systems provides humans with an accurate sense of their position and motion. However, altered environments, including exposure to weightlessness, can lead to conflicting visual and vestibular cues, resulting in decreased situational awareness. The TLS was designed to provide somatosensory cues to complement the visual system during EVA operations. Method(s): An EVA task was simulated on a computer graphics workstation with a display of the International Space Station (ISS) and a target astronaut at an unknown location. Subjects were required to move about the ISS and acquire the target astronaut using either an auditory cue at the outset, or the TLS. Subjects used a 6 degree of freedom input device to command translational and rotational motion. The TLS was configured to act as a position aid, providing target direction information to the subject through a localized stimulus. Result(s): Results show that the TLS decreases reaction time (p = 0.001) and movement time (p = 0.001) for simulated subject (astronaut) motion around the ISS. Conclusion(s): The TLS is a useful aid in increasing an astronaut's situational awareness, and warrants further testing to explore other uses, tasks and configurations.",Excluded

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of sonography for this purpose., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We attempted 26 sonographically guided biopsies of five abdominal, six pelvic, and 12 retroperitoneal lymph nodes in 23 patients. The patients included 19 women and four men who were 26-76 years old (mean, 50 years old). The nodes were less than 2 cm in 16 patients, 2-3 cm in four patients, and greater than 3 cm in three patients. Biopsies were considered successful if the nodes could be visualized and biopsied using sonographic guidance and the pathologist's final report indicated that the tissue specimens obtained were adequate for diagnosis. The length of the procedures and the number of complications were recorded., RESULTS: Lymph nodes were visualized and biopsied with sonographic guidance in 23 (88%) of the 26 attempts. Three biopsies could not be performed with sonography because of poor visualization of the nodes. Adequate tissue for cytologic or histologic evaluation was obtained in 21 (91%) of the 23 sonographically guided procedures. In the 21 successful procedures, clinical and imaging follow-up showed no evidence of false-negative diagnoses. The time from the placement of the patient in the interventional sonography room to completion of the procedure ranged from 25 to 60 min (mean, 35 min) for sonographically guided biopsies. We had no procedure-related complications., CONCLUSION: Sonography is an accurate and safe guidance technique for lymph node biopsies in the abdomen, pelvis, and retroperitoneum. This technique is efficacious for deep nodes as small as 1 cm in diameter. The advantages of sonography over CT include no need for ionizing radiation, portability, shorter procedure time, and real-time visualization of the needle throughout the procedure. These advantages, and the fact that sonography costs less than CT, suggest that sonography is a more appropriate guidance technique in this era of cost containment.",Excluded
3463,"Environmental exposure to pyrethroids and sperm sex chromosome disomy: a cross-sectional study. BACKGROUND: The role of environmental pesticide exposures, such as pyrethroids, and their relationship to sperm abnormalities are not well understood. This study investigated whether environmental exposure to pyrethroids was associated with altered frequency of sperm sex chromosome disomy in adult men.
METHODS: A sample of 75 subjects recruited through a Massachusetts infertility clinic provided urine and semen samples. Individual exposures were measured as urinary concentrations of three pyrethroid metabolites ((3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3PBA), cis- and trans- 3-(2,2-Dichlorovinyl)-1-methylcyclopropane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid (CDCCA and TDCCA)). Multiprobe fluorescence in situ hybridization for chromosomes X, Y, and 18 was used to determine XX, YY, XY, 1818, and total sex chromosome disomy in sperm nuclei. Poisson regression analysis was used to examine the association between aneuploidy rates and pyrethroid metabolites while adjusting for covariates.
RESULTS: Between 25-56% of the sample were above the limit of detection (LOD) for the pyrethroid metabolites. All sex chromosome disomies were increased by 7-30% when comparing men with CDCCA and TDCCA levels above the LOD to those below the LOD. For 3PBA, compared to those below the LOD, those above the LOD had YY18 disomy rates 1.28 times higher (95% CI: 1.15, 1.42) whereas a reduced rate was seen for XY18 and total disomy (IRR = 0.82; 95% CI: 0.77, 0.87; IRR = 0.93; 95% CI: 0.87-0.97), and no association was seen for XX18 and 1818.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that urinary concentrations of CDCCA and TDCCA above the LOD were associated with increased rates of aneuploidy. However the findings for 3BPA were not consistent. This is the first study to examine these relationships, and replication of our findings is needed before the association between pyrethroid metabolites and aneuploidy can be fully defined.",Excluded

3160,"Contrast-enhanced ultrasound detects type II endoleaks during follow-up for endovascular aneurysm repair. Objective: Repeated computed tomography angiography (CTA) can be used during follow-up visits for endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) but leads to accumulated radiation exposure and may cause renal impairment. Therefore, the use of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has increased, and its ability to detect endoleaks has been promising. The aim of this study was to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of CEUS vs CTA for endoleak detection during EVAR follow-up. Method(s): Ninety-two patients with planned EVAR for abdominal aortic aneurysm were prospectively, consecutively enrolled. In total, 233 paired CTA and CEUS procedures were performed within the same day. Follow-up visits occurred 1 month, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months postoperatively. Result(s): Of 48 endoleaks discovered by CTA, 39 were also detected on CEUS, giving an overall sensitivity of 81.3% and specificity of 98.9%. All undetected endoleaks were minor, without clinical importance, and occurred in patients with high body mass index. Conclusion(s): In this study, CEUS was accurate for detecting type II endoleaks during follow-up visits for EVAR. Sensitivity was lower in obese patients. Doppler ultrasound has low sensitivity and seems to be unsuitable for the detection of endoleaks.Copyright © 2020 Society for Vascular Surgery",Excluded
2337,"Nail dystrophy and periungual discoloration in sarcoidosis. Background : Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder that can affect all organs of the body. The disease course can vary from a self-limiting illness to a chronic disease with flares and relapses. Nail changes are rare in sarcoidosis, but can include clubbing, discolouration, dystrophy, subungual hyperkeratosis, splinter haemorrhages and longitudinal ridges. Such changes are frequently an indication of systemic disease, We report a rare case of systemic sarcoidosis presenting as nail dystrophy with painful phalanges and underlying bony cysts. Observation: A 57 year old moroccan woman, with a 2-year history of periungual redpurplish discoloration associated with nail dystrophy of 4 of his toes, presented to the dermatology department. Examination of his toes showed evidence of red to purple discoloration in the nail folds with associated nail dystrophy and subungual hyperkeratosis. Examination of his entire skin showed a symetric ulcerated dactilitis of 2 fingers. Nail clippings were obtained for mycological examination, with negative results. A Hand and toes X-ray demonstrated bony cysts, trabecular pattern and osteolysis in distal phalanx. CT showed multiples lymphadenopaty above and under diaphragmatic. A punch biopsy taken from the nail bed, the lymphadenopathy and salivary gland showed sarcoid granulomas in the dermis and a chronic inflammatory infiltrate. With all this finding, the diagnosis of systemic sarcoidosis was making, and the patient receive a systemic treatment with corticosteroid: 0.5 mg/kg/day. After 1 week of treatment, the patient had a good response. Key message: Although nail changes are rare in sarcoidosis, they are often associated with systemic involvement (commonly pulmonary involvement, dactylitis and lymphadenopathy) and underlying bony changes. Thus, in patients presenting with nail involvement, a search for possible systemic involvement should take place, and this should include radiological imaging of hands and feet alongside chest imaging.",Excluded
1017,"Validation of a New Method for 2D Fusion Imaging Registration in a System Prepared Only for 3D. Purpose: To validate a new 2D-3D registration method of fusion imaging during aortic repair in a system prepared only for 3D-3D registration and to compare radiation doses and accuracy. Material(s) and Method(s): The study involved 189 patients, including 94 patients (median age 70 years; 85 men) who underwent abdominal endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) with 2D-3D fusion on an Artis zee imaging system and 95 EVAR patients (median age 70 years; 81 men) from a prior study who had 3D-3D registration done using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT). For the 2D-3D registration, an offline CBCT of the empty operating table was imported into the intraoperative dataset and superimposed on the preoperative computed tomography angiogram (CTA). Then 2 intraoperative single-frame 2D images of the skeleton were aligned with the patient's skeleton on the preoperative CTA to complete the registration process. A digital subtraction angiogram was done to correct any misalignment of the aortic CTA volume. Values are given as the median [interquartile range (IQR) Q1, Q3]. Result(s): The 2D-3D registration had an accuracy of 4.0 mm (IQR 3.0, 5.0) after bone matching compared with the final correction with DSA (78% within 5 mm). By applying the 2D-3D protocol the radiation exposure (dose area product) from the registration of the fusion image was significantly reduced compared with the 3D-3D registration [1.12 Gy.cm2 (IQR 0.41, 2.14) vs 43.4 Gy.cm2 (IQR 37.1, 49.0), respectively; p<0.001). Conclusion(s): The new 2D-3D registration protocol based on 2 single-frame images avoids an intraoperative CBCT and can be used for fusion imaging registration in a system originally designed for 3D-3D only. This 2D-3D registration protocol is accurate and leads to a significant reduction in radiation exposure.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.",Excluded
3547,"Evaluation of the genotoxic effects of chronic low-dose ionizing radiation exposure on nuclear medicine workers. INTRODUCTION: Nuclear medicine workers are occupationally exposed to chronic ionizing radiation. It is known that ionizing radiation may have damaging effects on chromosomes. In the present study, we investigated the genotoxic effects of ionizing radiation on nuclear medicine workers. We used two different indicators of genotoxicity methods: sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and micronucleus (MN)., METHODS: The present research was carried out using 21 nuclear medicine workers (11 females and 10 males) during two periods: during normal working conditions and after a 1-month vacation. The radiation dose varied from 1.20 to 48.56 mSv, which accumulated during the occupational exposure time between two vacations. Peripheral blood samples were taken from each subject for two distinct lymphocyte cultures (SCE and MN) in each period., RESULTS: In nearly all subjects, SCE values increased significantly during radiation exposure compared to the postvacation period (P<.05). Similarly, MN frequencies in most of the subjects increased significantly during radiation exposure compared to the postvacation period (P<.05)., CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that both SCE and MN frequencies in most of the subjects were significantly higher during exposure to ionizing radiation than after a 1-month vacation period. However, this genotoxic effect was reversible in most of the subjects.",Excluded

2988,"Comparing outcomes of concurrent chemotherapy regimens in patients 65 years old or older with locally advanced oropharyngeal carcinoma. Background: The comparative efficacy of cisplatin (CDDP), carboplatin, and cetuximab (CTX) delivered concurrently with radiation for locally advanced oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma continues to be evaluated. Method(s): The linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database was used to identify and compare patient and disease profiles, mortality, toxicity, and overall cost for patients with oropharynx cancer undergoing definitive concurrent chemoradiation with CDDP, carboplatin, or CTX between 2006 and 2011. The human papillomavirus status was unknown. The primary outcome was 2-year overall survival (OS). Result(s): Four hundred nine patients receiving concurrent CDDP (n = 167), carboplatin (n = 69), or CTX (n = 173) were included. Those who were older, those who were nonwhite, and those with a Charlson Comorbidity Index >= 2 were less likely to receive CDDP. Two-year OS was inferior with CTX (hazard ratio [HR], 1.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-2.60; P =.020) and no different with carboplatin (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.73-2.35; P =.362) in a Cox proportional hazards model (reference CDDP). There was no statistically significant difference between carboplatin and CTX (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.77-2.14; P =.891). Rates of antiemetic use and hospital visits for nausea/emesis/diarrhea or dehydration were statistically higher with CDDP. Pneumonia rates were higher with carboplatin. In the multivariate model, the corrected mean per-patient spending was significantly higher for CTX and carboplatin than CDDP ($61,133 and $65,721 vs $48,709). Conclusion(s): Patients who received CDDP had improved OS. CDDP was also associated with slightly lower overall costs and higher antiemetic usage and hospital visit rates, although a strong selection bias was observed because those receiving CTX and carboplatin were older and had higher comorbidity scores.Copyright © 2018 American Cancer Society",Excluded

3327,"IMRT/VMAT for malignancies in the head-and-neck region : Outcome in patients aged 80. OBJECTIVE: Elderly patients with malignant head-and-neck tumors (HNT) often pose a therapeutic challenge. They frequently have significant comorbidities which may influence their ability to tolerate tumor-specific therapies. Our aim was to investigate the outcome of patients aged 80+ years undergoing curative intent intensity- or volume-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT/VMAT)., METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed our HNT patients aged 80+ treated with curative IMRT/VMAT from December 2003 to November 2015. Overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), local control (LC), and treatment tolerance were assessed. Outcome results were compared with that of a younger HNT patient cohort from our hospital., RESULTS: A total of 140 consecutive patients were included (65 postoperative, 75 definitive). Mean/median age at treatment start was 84.8/84.1 years (range 80-96 years). Mean/median follow-up time was 25/16 months (range 2-92 months). Of the 140 patients, 80 were alive with no evidence of disease when last seen, 28 had died due to the cancer, 12 remained alive with disease, the remaining 20 died intercurrently. Systemic concomitant therapy was administered in 7 %. Late grade 3-4 toxicity was observed in 2 %. All patients completed treatment. Hospitalization and feeding tube rates were 26 % and 11 %, respectively. The 2-/3-year LC, DFS, and OS rates for the entire cohort were 81/80 %, 69/63 %, and 68/66 %, respectively. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) patients showed an inferior 3-year OS rate as compared to non-SCC patients (62 % vs 77 %, p = 0.0002), while LC and DFS did not differ. Patients undergoing postoperative radiation attained a higher OS compared to the definitively irradiated subgroup with 74 vs. 60 % at 3 years (p = 0.01); however, DFS rates were similar for both groups (68 vs. 61 %, p = 0.15). Corresponding rates for >1400 HNT patients <80 years treated during the same time interval were 81/80 %, 69/67 %, and 77/72 %, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Treatment tolerance in our patients aged 80+ was high. These results suggest that elderly HNT patients should not be denied potentially curative treatment strategies.",Excluded

The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of minimising contrast-medium (CM) doses using 80-peak kilovoltage (kVp) 16-channel multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) with CM dose tailored to body weight, when diagnosing pulmonary embolism (PE) in azotaemic patients. Twenty-nine patients (68-93 years; 38-79 kg) with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 12-49 ml/min underwent 80 kVp MDCT at a median dose of 200 mg iodine (I)/kg and 15 s injection time. Pulmonary artery (PA) enhancement where compared with our own reference material using 320 mg I/kg at 120 kVp and with reported figures in the literature at 120-140 kVp and a 42 g iodine CM dose. Median (1st and 3rd quartiles) values regarding CM dose were 12.2 (9.9-12.8) g iodine; density of left main and lower lobe segmental PA 339 (275-395) Hounsfield units (HU) and 354 (321-442) HU, respectively. Those enhancement values were similar to those obtained from the reference population at 120 kVp and those reported in the literature at 120-140 kVp. One patient had a transient increase in plasma creatinine. Three months' follow-up revealed deep venous thrombosis among 1/18 patients with negative results from computed tomography (CT). We conclude that 80 kVp 16-channel MDCT to diagnose PE in azotaemic patients may be performed with markedly reduced CM doses, implying a lesser risk for CM-induced nephropathy.",Excluded

Multiple imaging modalities are often required for the relapsing nature of Crohn disease (CD). Computed tomography (CT) offers a rapid acquisition of images and shows high specificity and sensitivity. However, CT imaging exposes to a higher dose of ionizing radiation than other abdominal imaging modalities. The aim of this study was to compare the use of preoperative and postoperative CT scan in patients undergoing emergency and elective surgery for CD. Method(s):All patients undergoing emergency and elective surgery for ileocaecal CD January 2014 to December 2018 were included in this prospective observational study. The study objective was to evaluate the frequency of use of CT scan perioperatively with the number and findings of preoperative and postoperative CT being the primary outcomes. The secondary outcomes were operating time, length of hospital stay, reoperations, and rehospitalization. Result(s):A total of 75 patients were included, 33 in the emergency group (43%) and 44 in the elective group (57%). There was a higher use of preoperative CT scan in the emergency surgery group, with 14 patients (42%) having a CT scan before surgery compared with 2 (5%) in the elective group (P=0.14). Thirteen patients (39.4%) had a postoperative CT scan in the emergency surgery group, compared with 10 patients (23.8%) in the elective surgery group.

OBJECT: The authors analyzed tumor control rates and complications in patients with superficially located meningiomas after gamma knife surgery (GKS). METHOD(S): Between 1998 and 2003, GKS was performed in 23 patients with 26 lesions in whom follow-up imaging for 1 year or more was available. The male/female ratio was 1:22. The mean age was 59 years. The median tumor volume was 4.7 cm3, and the mean margin dose was 16 Gy at the 50% isodose line. Peritumoral edema was revealed on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in four patients before GKS. Magnetic resonance imaging and clinical examinations were performed every 6 months after GKS. The mean follow-up duration was 32 months. The tumor shrank in eight cases, was stable in 17, and enlarged in one; thus 25 (95%) of 26 tumors were controlled. A peritumoral high signal on T2-weighted MR images was found in eight lesions and preexisting edema was aggravated in three lesions after GKS. Ten of these 11 patients complained of severe headache, and three patients experienced neurological deficits at the same time after a mean latency of 3 months; however, high signal was not demonstrated on imaging before 6 months on average. Steroid agents, when required, gave relief to all patients. The complication rate was 43% (10 of 23 cases). High signal disappeared in nine patients and decreased in the remaining two. High signal was associated with a high integral dose and a large tumor volume. Tumor shrinkage at the last follow-up examination was more prominent in the patients with symptomatic high signal (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION(S): There was a good tumor control rate with a high complication rate. Longer follow up of more patients is needed. Adjusting the dose-volume relationship should be considered to reduce complications.",Excluded

Conventional radiotherapy alone in treatment of unresectable or locally advanced head and neck cancer has poor results. To improve outcome without significant increase in acute and late morbidity, we began a moderately accelerated hyperfractionation radiation therapy protocol without breaks for treatment of unresectable/advanced head and neck malignancies. From August 1984 to June 1995, 48 patients with unresectable or advanced carcinoma of the head and neck were treated using a protocol of accelerated hyperfractionation radiation therapy at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center, Los Angeles. Patients were treated twice a day using 150 cGy per fraction, 4 days per week, to a final dose of 60 Gy. Two patients were excluded from this analysis because they did not complete treatment. With a median follow-up of 33 months, 31 (67%) patients have had disease recurrence, 30 (65%) of whom had a locoregional component to their failures. At the last follow-up, 12 patients (26%) were alive with no evidence of disease, 30 patients had died of disease, and 4 had died of intercurrent disease without recurrence. Nine (19%) patients required treatment interruptions averaging 8 days in duration. This accelerated regimen resulted in outcomes similar to those with conventional radiotherapy, most likely because of a conservative total dose.

The objective of this study was to assess angiographic and clinical outcomes of cutting balloon (CB) angioplasty and concomitant Sr/Y-90 beta-brachytherapy as a treatment modality for patients with native vessel in-stent restenosis (ISR). Procedural advantages over the standard balloon (SB) have been claimed for the CB. Intracoronary brachytherapy preceded by SB angioplasty is regarded as the treatment of choice in patients with ISR. In an interim analysis of a prospective randomized trial designed for 652 patients, 100 consecutive patients with ISR were assigned to treatment with SB angioplasty (n = 51) or CB angioplasty (n = 49), followed in either case by Sr/Y-90 beta-brachytherapy. Quantitative coronary angiography at baseline, postintervention, and at 8 months was performed by an independent central laboratory. More than 90% of target lesions in the overall patient population were diffuse, with 14% of stents totally occluded. Procedural parameters and immediate angiographic outcomes were essentially the same in either study arm. At 8 months, no statistically significant differences were observed in recurrent angiographic restenosis (SB = 26.1%; CB = 29.5%; P = 0.82), target lesion revascularizations (SB = 13.7%; CB = 8.2%; P = 0.53), and major adverse cardiac events (SB = 15.7%; CB = 8.2%; P = 0.36). In this interim analysis, there was no indication of a beneficial effect of CB use over SB use in terms of angiographic or clinical outcomes at 8-month follow-up. CB angioplasty appears to be as safe and efficacious as SB angioplasty in beta-radiation treatment of patients with predominantly diffuse native vessel ISR. It was decided to discontinue the trial.

Purpose/Objective(s) The aim of this study was to analyze the accuracy of gross tumor volume (GTV) delineation and clinical target volume (CTV) margins for neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (neo-CRT) in esophageal carcinoma at pathologic examination and to determine the impact on survival. Methods and Materials The study population consisted of 63 esophageal cancer patients treated with neo-CRT. GTV and CTV borders were demarcated in situ during surgery on the esophagus, using anatomical reference points to provide accurate information regarding tumor location at pathologic evaluation. To identify prognostic factors for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), a Cox regression analysis was performed. Results After resection, macroscopic residual tumor was found outside the GTV in 7 patients (11%). Microscopic residual tumor was located outside the CTV in 9 patients (14%). The median follow-up was 15.6 months. With multivariate analysis, only microscopic tumor outside the CTV (hazard ratio [HR], 4.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-15.36), and perineural growth (HR, 5.77; 95% CI, 1.27-26.13) were identified as independent prognostic factors for OS. The 1-year OS was 20% for patients with tumor outside the CTV and 86% for those without (P<.01). For DFS, microscopic tumor outside the CTV (HR, 5.92; 95% CI, 1.89-18.54) and ypN+ (HR, 3.36; 95% CI, 1.33-8.48) were identified as independent adverse prognostic factors. The 1-year DFS was 23% versus 77% for patients with or without tumor outside the CTV (P<.01). Conclusions Microscopic tumor outside the CTV is associated with markedly worse OS after neo-CRT. This may either stress the importance of accurate tumor delineation or reflect aggressive tumor behavior requiring new adjuvant treatment modalities. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We report one-year angiographic and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) outcomes of in-stent restenosis (ISR) patients treated with intravascular brachytherapy (IVBT). The benefit of IVBT for treating ISR is well documented. However, few data exist on significant angiographic and intravascular ultrasonic in-stent lumen deterioration beyond the habitual 6-month analysis after the index radiation procedure or so-called late catch-up process in the treatment of ISR. Twenty-five consecutive patients with ISR were treated with IVBT using the Beta-Cath System (a 40 mm 90 Sr per 90 gamma source). Quantitative angiographic and IVUS analysis was performed in all of them at 6 and 12 months. IVBT was successful in all patients. Four patients (16%) developed recurrent angiographic binary restenosis at 6-month follow-up, all located within the adjacent reference segments, with 2 being associated with geographical miss.

3629,"Increased risk for vertebral fractures with long-term observation in mild primary hyperparathyroidism: Five year data from the scandinavian investigation of primary hyperparathyroidism (SIPH). Introduction Cohort studies using surrogate endpoints suggest decreased fracture risk after parathyroidectomy in patients with asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), but long-term prospective studies are lacking. Here we report 5 year data on bone mineral density (BMD) and vertebral fracture (VF) incidence from the SIPH study1, where patients with PHPT were randomized to either parathyroidectomy (PTX) or observation (OBS). Methods Data were available from 130 patients (OBS n= 67, PTX n= 63) 5 years after randomization (mean age at inclusion 62 years, 9 men in each group). Baseline biochemistry (total Calcium (Ca), Parathyroid hormone (PTH), Creatinine) and BMD Z-scores by DXA (Z) for lumbar spine (LS) and femoral neck (FN) were similar in the two groups. Lateral radiographs of the thoracolumbar spine were obtained at baseline, and after 2 and 5 years. Two radiologists, blinded to randomization and clinical data, evaluated the radiographs in consensus, using the semiquantitative method of Genant2 (including also L5). Results Basic biochemistry was stable in the OBS group, and normalized after parathyroidectomy (P< 0.001 for Ca and PTH). For the OBS group, baseline BMD Z in LS was -0.3 (IQR: -1.25 to +1.0) and in FN-0.2 (IQR: -0.9 to +0.5). After 5 years BMD Z in LS was-0.2 (IQR: -1.2 to +0.6) and in FN -0.6 (IQR: -1.0 to +0.1); not significant for both sites. For the PTX group, baseline BMD Z in LS was -0.2 (IQR: -1.0 to +1.0) and in FN -0.3 (IQR: 1.0 to +0.3). After 5 years BMD Z in LS increased to +0.4 (IQR: -0.7 to +1.2) and in FN to -0.2 (IQR: -0.7 to +0.4); P< 0.01 for both sites. The change in Z-scores (LS; FN) was different between OBS and PTX (P=0.04; P=0.013). At 5 years, X-rays were available for 110 patients (15 men) with baseline radiographs and at least one follow-up radiograph. Fifty-six patients were randomized to OBS (6 men) and 54 to PTX (9 men). Total follow-up time was 267.9 years (mean 4.8 years) in the OBS group and 271.5 years (mean 5.0 years) in the PTX group. There were 12 VFs in 10 patients (all women; 9.1% of all patients) at baseline (4 OBS patients with 6 VFs, 6 PTX patients with 6 VFs). During follow-up, 5 new VFs occurred in 5 patients (women), exclusively in the OBS group. Thus, 8.9% of the patients randomized to OBS, and none in the PTX group (P= 0.029), developed a new VF. Four of the new VFs occurred in patients with no VFs at baseline. All new VFs were of mild to moderate degree, and none had symptoms that could be related to the VF. Conclusion Five years after randomization, biochemistry and BMD Z-scores were stable with observation. Following parathyroidectomy biochemistry normalized and BMD Z-scores increased. New nonsymptomatic vertebral fractures developed in 5 females in the observation group, a significantly higher risk for fractures than following surgery.",Excluded
2654,"Factors influencing the degree of erythematous skin reactions in humans. Dose-response relationships have been studied using an ordinal visual scale and reflectance spectrophotometry data from 123 treatment sites on 110 patients treated with 10 dose fractions over 12-14 days. Dose rates varied between 3 and 240 Gy/h and total doses of between 25 and 41 Gy were given using teletherapy apparatus. We found qualitative scoring of erythematous skin reactions to be subject to considerable inter- and intra-observer variation. Reflectance spectrophotometry provided more reproducible information, some of which was undetectable by naked eye. Baseline erythema readings were significantly higher in male patients and at anatomical sites of previous heavy UV exposure. In addition, a pronounced decline in erythema readings during the second week of therapy and 'reciprocal vicinity' (abscopal) effects adjacent to the field, undetected by the eye, were observed in a subset of patients. Meaningful dose-response relationships could be derived only from reflectance data with peak change from the pretreatment baseline measure providing the best discrimination. Peak erythema measures following treatment were found to depend on the age and gender of the patient as well as the treatment site and its baseline erythema measurement. This was independent of the total dose administered or the instantaneous dose rate at which it was delivered. The rate of erythema development was also dose rate dependent but only weakly dependent on the biological dose intensity (Gy equiv./day) of the treatment course. The data raise the question of whether irradiation-induced erythema is exclusively a secondary phenomenon occurring as a result of basal cell killing. The short repair half time value of 0.06 h obtained by direct analysis is perplexing and may reflect a dose rate-dependent physiological vasodilatory response to irradiation and/or a multi-component cellular repair process.",Excluded
2994,"Multiple sclerosis, brain radiotherapy, and risk of neurotoxicity: The Mayo Clinic experience. Purpose: The aim of this study was a retrospective assessment of neurotoxicity in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) receiving external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) to the brain. Methods and Materials: We studied 15 consecutively treated patients with MS who received brain EBRT. Neurologic toxicity was assessed with the Common Toxicity Criteria v.3.0. Result(s): Median follow-up for the 5 living patients was 6.0 years (range, 3.3-27.4 years). No exacerbation of MS occurred in any patient during EBRT. Five patients had Grade 4 neurologic toxicity and 1 had possible Grade 5 toxicity. Kaplan-Meier estimated risk of neurotoxicity greater than Grade 4 at 5 years was 57% (95% confidence interval, 27%-82%). Toxicity occurred at 37.5 to 54.0 Gy at a median of 1.0 year (range, 0.2-4.3 years) after EBRT. Univariate analysis showed an association between opposed-field irradiation of the temporal lobes, central white matter, and brainstem and increased risk of neurotoxicity (p < 0.04). Three of 6 cases of toxicity occurred in patients treated before 1986. Conclusion(s): External beam radiotherapy of the brain in patients with MS may be associated with an increased risk of neurotoxicity compared with patients without demyelinating illnesses. However, this risk is associated with treatment techniques that may not be comparable to modern, conformal radiotherapy. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1227,"Determination of netilmicin in rat serum using high performance liquid chromatography and resonance Rayleigh scattering. A method was developed for the direct determination of netilmicin in rat serum using high performance liquid chromatography and resonance Rayleigh scattering (RRS). The separation was carried out on a Cl8 column with the isocratic elution of the mixture of 20 mmol/L sodium acetate aqueous solution and methanol containing 0.22% trifluoroacetic acid (92: 8, v/ v). With the molecular recognition probe of pontamine sky blue, netilmicin formed an ion-association complex and enhanced the intensity of RRS. The RRS signal was detected by a commercial fluorescence detector at 365 nm of both excitation wavelength (lambdaem) and emission wavelength (lambdaex). Under the optimized conditions, the limit of detection (LOD, S/N = 3) for the netilmicin was 0. 7 mg/L. With the internal standard (IS) of tobramycin, a linear calibration curve ranged from 1. 2 mg/L to 30 mg/L was obtained. The presented method can be used for the pharmacokinetics study of netilmicin in rat serum, and can be a new choice for the determination of aminoglycoside antibiotics in biological samples.",Excluded
2489,"Mating competitiveness of sterile male anopheles coluzzii in semi-field cages. The renewed interest in the development of control strategies using sterile insects raises hopes of being able to control the disease by cutting down the high reproductive rate of mosquitoes. Specifically, investigations into factors that account for male mating competitiveness are critical to the development of genetic control strategies. In this study, we assessed the effects of partial irradiation with 75 Gy on Anopheles coluzzii sexual competitiveness when allowed to mate in different ratios of sterile/ fertile males for 2 nights in field cages. Moreover, to determine the dynamics of this competition, competitiveness was compared between males allowed 1 night vs 2 nights of contact with females. Sterilized (S) and fertile (U) males between 4 and 6 days of age were released in field cages (1.70mx1.70mx1.70m) with females (F) of similar age and left for 2 nights at the following ratios (S:U:F): (100:0:100) (100:100:100) (300:100:100) (500:100:100) (0:100:100). Each treatment was replicated 3 times. Competitiveness was determined by assessing the hatching rate of eggs laid en masse and the insemination rate, determined by dissecting recaptured females. An additional experiment with a ratio of (500:100:100) has been done with a mating period of either 1 or 2 nights. For the first experiment, the egg hatching rate was significantly affected by the release ratio and we thus observed that the Fried competitiveness index of sterile males was between 0.29 and 0.55. A similar insemination rate was recorded after 2 nights of contact in experiment 1, while significant difference was observed in the (S:U:F) (100:0:100) ratio between the males left to mate for 1 and 2 nights. However, a similar hatching rate was observed when mating occurred for 1 or 2 nights. The results suggest a release ratio of at least 2 sterile males for 1 fertile male and that An. coluzzii mating competitiveness experiments in field cages should be run for 1 instead of 2 nights.",Excluded
3309,"Acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) shear wave elastography of the bowel wall in healthy volunteers and in ulcerative colitis. Background: Acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography is a non-invasive, ultrasound-based approach of evaluation of tissue elasticity. It has not yet been systematically applied to the bowel wall. Purpose(s): To perform ARFI elastography of the bowel wall in healthy volunteers and patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Material(s) and Method(s): A high-frequency ultrasound (with bowel wall thickness and vascularization score) and an ARFI elastography of the bowel wall were performed in 20 patients with UC and 13 healthy volunteers. At least 10 ARFI measurements were obtained within the terminal ileum and the ascending, transverse, descending, and sigmoid colon and correlated with results of high-frequency ultrasound. Result(s): The UC group had mostly moderate disease activity. All patients had signs of inflammation upon B-mode ultrasound. Eight patients showed an ulcerative (ileo)pancolitis. Overall, ARFI elastography values and wall thickness were higher in the UC group than in the group of healthy volunteers (P = 0.021 and P < 0.001, respectively). ARFI velocities of the separate segments were significantly higher in the transverse (P = 0.045) and sigmoid colon (P = 0.032) in case of UC. Conclusion(s): ARFI elastography of the bowel wall of the colonic frame and the terminal ileum is feasible but shows high standard deviation. ARFI shear wave velocities appear to be slightly higher in patients with UC than in healthy volunteers, particularly in the sigmoid and transverse colon.

901,"Radiation dosimetry and biodistribution in monkey and man of 11C-PBR28: a PET radioligand to image inflammation. UNLABELLED: (11)C-PBR28 ([methyl-(11)C]N-acetyl-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)-2-phenoxy-5-pyridinamine) is a recently developed radioligand to image peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) in brain. The aim of this study was to estimate the human radiation doses of (11)C-PBR28 based on biodistribution data in monkeys and humans. In addition, we scanned 1 human subject who fortuitously behaved as if he lacked the PBR binding protein., METHODS: Whole-body PBR images were acquired after intravenous bolus administration of (11)C-PBR28 in 7 healthy humans (651 +/- 111 MBq) and 2 rhesus monkeys (370 +/- 59.9 MBq). One monkey was scanned after receptor blockade with PK 11195 (10.7 mg/kg intravenously)., RESULTS: For typical subjects (subjects 1-6), the 3 organs with highest exposure were those with the high PBR densities (kidneys, spleen, and lungs), and the effective dose was 6.6 microSv/MBq. The unusual subject (subject 7) had 60%-90% less uptake in these 3 organs, resulting in 28% lower effective dose. The activity in the baseline monkey scans was greater than that in humans for organs with high PBR densities. For this reason, the human effective dose was overestimated by 60% with monkey biodistribution data. The monkey with receptor blockade had an overall distribution qualitatively similar to that of the unusual human subject (subject 7), with decreased exposure to lungs, kidney, and spleen., CONCLUSION: The effective dose of (11)C-PBR28 was modest and was similar to that of several other (11)C-radioligands. Lack of receptor binding in the unusual human subject and in the monkey with receptor blockade decreased exposure to organs with high PBR densities and enhanced uptake in excretory and metabolic pathways.",Excluded
1713,"Mechanisms for discomfort glare in central vision. PURPOSE: The presence of a bright light source in the visual field can generate visual discomfort. Based on empirical observations we can predict to a reasonable degree of accuracy how uncomfortable a given lighting installation is likely to be; yet very little is known about the mechanism or physiological underpinnings that lead to visual discomfort. This study attempts to elucidate some of the underlying mechanisms by controlling the amount of light reaching the retina and by varying photometric properties of the glare source., METHODS: The participants were required to view a source of light presented against a simulated residential street background in the form of uniform flashes of light of varying intensity. Discomfort-glare thresholds were estimated using a staircase procedure; the dependent variable was retinal illuminance. The size of the glare source and the luminance of the surrounding background were varied systematically., RESULTS: Across glare-source sizes or background luminances the discomfort-glare threshold varied less in terms of retinal illuminance than it did in terms of pupil-plane illuminance or light flux. A two-stage model based on saturation of photoreceptors followed by summation of an edge response signal that defines the edges of the glare-source accurately predicted the data., CONCLUSIONS: Discomfort glare in central vision is more closely associated with the spatial properties of the glare source, such as contrast-defined edges, than the overall amount of light entering the eye. The results suggest that discomfort glare in lighting installations could be reduced while maintaining adequate illuminance levels by an appropriate choice of illuminant source size.

2324,"Ability of a chest X-ray and an abdominal computed tomography scan to identify traumatic thoracic injury. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to show that a chest X-ray (CXR) and an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan are sufficient to identify most clinically significant thoracic injuries in trauma patients, rendering the thoracic CT scan useful in only a subset of patients., METHODS: A retrospective study identified thoracic injuries in 374 trauma patients evaluated with a CXR, a thoracic CT scan, and an abdominal CT scan. Injuries seen on the initial CXR versus those seen on a CT scan only (occult) were identified and assessed for clinical relevance., RESULTS: An abdominal CT scan identified 65% (15/23) of occult pneumothoraces, 100% (25/25) of occult hemothoraces, 64% (18/28) of occult pulmonary contusions, and 58% (18/31) of occult rib fractures. No occult pneumothoraces seen on the thoracic CT scan alone required tube thoracostomy., CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot study suggests that a CXR and an abdominal CT scan will identify most occult intrathoracic injuries. Reserving a thoracic CT scan for patients with an abnormal CXR or high-risk mechanism could safely reduce cost and radiation exposure while still diagnosing significant thoracic injuries.

1647,"The metabolic effects of abdominal irradiation in man with and without dietary therapy with an elemental diet. The metabolic effects of abdominal radiotherapy were assessed in patients with pelvic neoplasms, and the effects of supplementation of the diet with an 'elemental' diet assessed. Therapeutic irradiation led to significant mean weight losses of 1.4 kg in control patients and 1.0 kg in patients receiving 'elemental' diet supplements. Irradiation was associated with small falls in plasma potassium and calcium concentrations in both groups. In the 'elemental' group there was a small increase in circulating alanine and insulin concentrations and a fall in glycerol and ketone body concentrations, but all variables remained within or close to normal basal reference ranges. Plasma albumin fell slightly but significantly in the 'elemental' diet group from 44 +/- 1 to 42 +/- 1 g/litre during treatment. Is is concluded that modern radiotherapy is no more than a modest catabolic stimulus. Long-term dietary supplementation with 'elemental' diets in ill subjects did not produce adverse effects.",Excluded
282,"Surgical treatment for diffused-type giant cell tumor (pigmented villonodular synovitis) about the ankle joint. Background: Diffused-type giant cell tumor(Dt-GCT) is a rare, aggressive disorder of the joint synovium, bursa and tendon sheaths. Osseous erosions and subchondral cysts may develop as the result of synovium infiltration in Dt-GCT. We present a retrospective study of a series of patients who are diagnosed with Dt-GCT about the ankle joint, there clinical outcome is evaluated in this study. Material(s) and Method(s): Fifteen patients with radiologically and histologically confirmed Dt-GCT about the ankle joint were identified in our foot and ankle department. Patients were managed with open synovectomy for the tumor tissue and bone grafting for bony erosions. X-rays and MRI scans were used for evaluation of the tumor and bony erosions pre- and post-operatively. Pre- and post-operative ankle function was assessed using the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society -Ankle and Hindfoot (AOFAS-AH) score and the Muscularskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) score. Result(s): The mean follow-up duration was 37.4 months (range 25 to 50 months). There were 6 males and 9 females, with a mean age of 35 years old (range 18 to 65 years). All patients had talar erosion with the average size of 10.1*9.1z.ast;8.2 mm, distal tibia was affected in 5 patients with the average size of 6.2 5.6 5.8 mm. 7 patients had tendon involvement, 2 patients had recurrence and progression of ankle osteoarthritis. Both of them underwent ankle fusion. At the time of last follow-up, the mean AOFAS-AH score increased from 49 to 80 points (p < 0.05), the MSTS score increased from 12 to 22 points (p < 0.05).

888,"Stimulus intensity affects early sensory processing: visual contrast modulates evoked gamma-band activity in human EEG. We studied the effect of different contrast levels on the visual evoked gamma-band response (GBR) in order to investigate whether the GBR is modulated in a similar manner as previously reported for visual evoked potentials. Previous studies showed that the GBR can be modulated by individual characteristics (age) and experimental conditions (task difficulty, attention). However, stimulus properties, such as size and spatial frequency, also have a large impact on the GBR, which necessitates identification and control of relevant stimulus properties for optimal experimental setups. Twenty-one healthy participants were investigated during a forced-choice discrimination task. Sinusoidal gratings were presented at three contrast levels with a constant spatial frequency of 5 cycles per degree visual arc (cpd). The present data replicate the results reported for visual evoked potentials and exhibit a contrast dependent modulation of the GBR. Gamma activity is increased for higher contrast levels. These results demonstrate the importance of stimulus contrast for evoked gamma activity. Thus, it appears meaningful to control the contrast of stimuli in experiments investigating the role of gamma activity in perception and information processing.",Excluded

Method(s): Imaging data of 7 patients aged from 23 to 56 years (mean age 39.5 years) with bone echinococcosis were analysed retrospectively. All cases underwent X-ray plain film examination (frontal view and lateral view); 4 cases were examined with CT; 3 cases received MRI scan. Result(s): The echinococcosis located in skull (1 case), vertebrae (3 cases), sacrum (1 case), ilium (1 case) and ribs (1 case) respectively. X-ray signs: 5 cases appeared as expanding destructive lesion, two of them were solitary cystic lesions, the others were multiple cystic lesions. Lytic destruction was showed in 2 cases. Sclerotic margin, calcification, soft tissue mass was visible in 5, 1 and 4 cases respectively. CT signs: 3 of 4 cases were expanding destructive lesions, including 2 multiple cystic lesions and 1 solitary cystic destruction. The other one showed lytic destruction. 3 had sclerotic margin; calcification was identified in 2 cases, 4 cases accompanied with soft tissue mass.

486,"31P NMR spectroscopy can predict the optimum interval between fractionated irradiation doses. This study was performed to clarify whether changes in the metabolites observed by phosphorous-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS) could indicate an optimum interval between two doses of radiation in a murine tumor model. Murine mammary carcinoma cells, FM3A, were irradiated 7 days after transplantation with a single 5 Gy dose without anesthesia. 31P spectra were measured with a spectrometer up to 30 days. The beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi values were calculated from the peak area of each spectrum. In a fractionation experiment, two fractions of irradiation at a 5 Gy per fraction were given at 0, 1, 2, 3 and 6 day intervals. Tumor growth delay was also scored to determine the fractionated radiation effect. In the control group, beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi decreased with tumor growth. In the single irradiation group, the tumor did not grow up to day 6, and an initial rise and subsequent decrease in beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi were observed. Maximum beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi were observed on day 2 after irradiation. In a fractionation experiment, the greatest growth delay was observed in the two day interval group, in which maximum beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi were demonstrated in 31P-MRS. Our results suggested that changes in the metabolites observed by 31P-MRS could be useful indicators for determining the fractionation schedule in radiation therapy.",Excluded
49,"Cardiac magnetic resonance and the need for routine cardiac catheterization in single ventricle patients prior to Fontan: A comparison of 3 groups: Pre-Fontan CMR versus cath evaluation. Objectives: This study investigated whether cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and echocardiography (echo) can replace catheterization (cath) for routine evaluation prior to Fontan and under what circumstances CMR and cath are used together. Background(s): Routine cath prior to Fontan has been utilized for years; noninvasive methods, however, may be sufficient. Method(s): This study reviews clinical data in 119 consecutive patients investigating 3 groups: those who underwent CMR alone (MR; n = 41), cath alone (C; n = 41), or both cath and CMR (C+M; n = 37) prior to Fontan. Result(s): No clinically significant differences were noted in patient characteristics, hemodynamics, or clinical status prior to or after surgery between the C and MR groups. CMR added information in 82%. There were no discrepant findings between CMR and cath data in the C+M group. Diagnostic success was <95% in all groups. Of those undergoing Fontan completion, the C+M group had similar outcomes to C and MR; C and CMR were utilized in combination to assess aortopulmonary collaterals or the need for an intervention or evaluate its success. Echo could not delineate pulmonary arterial anatomy in 46% to 53% of patients. The C+M and C groups were exposed to 6.8 +/- 4.1 mSv of radiation. Conclusion(s): Single ventricle patients not requiring an intervention can undergo successful Fontan completion with CMR and echo alone with similar short-term outcomes to C, which was used as a control, preventing an invasive test and exposure to radiation. CMR can add information in a significant number of patients. Cath and CMR are utilized together for interventions and assessment of aortopulmonary collaterals. © 2012 American College of Cardiology Foundation.",Excluded
1516,"Pathogen reduction by ultraviolet C light effectively inactivates human white blood cells in platelet products. BACKGROUND: Residual white blood cells (WBCs) in cellular blood components induce a variety of adverse immune events, including nonhemolytic febrile transfusion reactions, alloimmunization to HLA antigens, and transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD). Pathogen reduction (PR) methods such as the ultraviolet C (UVC) light-based THERAFLEX UV-Platelets system were developed to reduce the risk of transfusion-transmitted infection. As UVC light targets nucleic acids, it interferes with the replication of both pathogens and WBCs. This preclinical study aimed to evaluate the ability of UVC light to inactivate contaminating WBCs in platelet concentrates (PCs)., STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The in vitro and in vivo function of WBCs from UVC-treated PCs was compared to that of WBCs from gamma-irradiated and untreated PCs by measuring cell viability, proliferation, cytokine secretion, antigen presentation in vitro, and xenogeneic GVHD responses in a humanized mouse model., RESULTS: UVC light was at least as effective as gamma irradiation in preventing GVHD in the mouse model. It was more effective in suppressing T-cell proliferation (>5-log reduction in the limiting dilution assay), cytokine secretion, and antigen presentation than gamma irradiation., CONCLUSIONS: The THERAFLEX UV-Platelets (MacoPharma) PR system can substitute gamma irradiation for TA-GVHD prophylaxis in platelet (PLT) transfusion. Moreover, UVC treatment achieves suppression of antigen presentation and inhibition of cytokine accumulation during storage of PCs, which has potential benefits for transfusion recipients.

The objective of this study was to assess the lung cancer risk resulting from indoor radon exposure in the province of Quebec, Canada, and to evaluate the efficacy of mitigation measures to reduce this exposure. Concentrations of radon were determined in a representative sample of houses, and the corresponding lung cancer risk estimates were generated using the BEIR IV model, taking into account smoking, residential mobility, and regional variations in radon concentrations. Mean (geometric) radon concentrations in basements (n = 418) and on first floors (n = 319) were, respectively, 34.4 (95% CI-30.6 to 38.8) and 16.5 Bq m(-3) (14.2 to 19.3). A total of 109 deaths from lung cancer are predicted to occur as a result of this exposure in a cohort of 60,000 people. Detecting all residences with high radon concentrations (equal to or above 200 Bq m(-3)) and implementing mitigation measures in each of them would reduce by 4 the number of lung cancer deaths attributable to indoor radon exposure. A reduction of 0.05% in the prevalence of smoking would prevent as many deaths from lung cancer as would radon mitigation. From a public health perspective, in order to reduce mortality from lung cancer, most efforts should be focused on smoking, not on the relatively minor and hardly preventable population risk arising from household radon exposure.",Excluded

The association between ionizing radiation and the subsequent development of osteosarcoma has been well described, but little is known about the cytogenetic and molecular events, which could be involved in the formation of radiation-induced osteosarcomas. Here, we performed comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to detect chromosomal copy number changes in a series of 16 rat osteosarcomas induced by injection of plutonium-238. Recurrent gains/amplifications were observed at chromosomal regions 3p12-q12, 3q41-qter, 4q41-qter, 6q12-q16, 7q22-q34, 8q11-q23, 9q11-q22, 10q32.1-qter, and 12q, whereas recurrent losses were observed at 1p, 1q, 3q23-q35, 5q21-q33, 8q24-q31, 10q22-q25, 15p, 15q, and 18q. The gained region at 7q22-q34 was homologous to human chromosome bands 12q13-q15/8q24/22q11-q13, including the loci of Mdm2, Cdk4, c-Myc and Pdgf-b genes. The lost regions at 5q21-q33, 10q22-q25 and 15q contained tumor suppressor genes such as p16INK4a/p19ARF, Tp53 and Rb1. To identify potential target gene(s) for the chromosomal aberrations, we compared the expression levels of several candidate genes, located within the regions of frequent chromosomal aberrations, between the tumors and normal osteoblasts by using quantitative RT-PCR analysis. The Cdk4, c-Myc, Pdgf-b and p57KIP2 genes were thought to be possible target genes for the frequent chromosomal gain at 7q22-34 and loss at 1q in the tumors, respectively.

BACKGROUND: The irradiation of red blood cells (RBCs) causes damage of the RBC membrane with increased potassium (K) leak during storage compared with nonirradiated RBC units of similar age. A previous in vitro study showed a mean reduction of K of 94 +/- 5% with a potassium adsorption filter (PAF)., STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A prospective, single-center, nonblinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of transfusing irradiated RBC units with the PAF. Patients 18 years of age or older who received irradiated RBC units due to chemotherapy-induced anemia were randomly assigned to receive irradiated RBC units with the PAF (PAF group) or with the standard blood infusion set (control group). Primary outcome measures were safety and efficacy of the PAF (absolute change in hemoglobin [Hb] and K, respectively, in patient's blood values after transfusing the irradiated RBC units with or without the PAF)., RESULTS: A total of 63 irradiated RBC units were transfused to 17 patients in the control group, and a total of 56 irradiated RBC units were transfused to 13 patients in the PAF group.

1219,"Radiation-induced sarcoma: A challenge for the surgeon. Background: Treatment of radiation-induced sarcoma (RIS) remains an unsolved problem. To provide more insight into the disease process, its characteristics, outcome, and potential outcome determinants were defined. Method(s): From 1978 to 2003, 27 patients-20 females (74%) and 7 males (26%) with a median age 44 years (range, 1-73 years) at the time of diagnosis of the primary tumor-developed an RIS after a median interval of 8 years (range, 3-41 years). The histology of the RIS was 10 (37%) undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcomas, 7 (26%) angiosarcomas, 6 (22%) fibrosarcomas, 2 (7%) osteosarcomas, 1 (4%) pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma, and 1 (4%) pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma. Surgical resection was performed in 21 patients: 13 (62%) R0 (microscopically radical), 4 (19%) R1 (microscopically irradical), 2 (9.5%) R2 (macroscopically irradical), and 2 (9.5%) RX (unknown radicality). Six (22%) patients underwent no resection. Result(s): The 5-year disease-free and overall survival rates were 27% and 30%, respectively. The local failure rate after R0 resection was 54%. The distant failure rate for the entire group was 41%. Patients with an R0 resection had a significantly better survival rate (P < .05) than patients with an R1, R2, or no resection. Conclusion(s): RISs are aggressive malignancies with a high tendency for local recurrence and distant metastases. Previously applied treatment often hampers adequate resection. Therefore, radical surgical resection is the only chance to improve disease-free and overall survival, but it may also have a palliative role. Still, the overall prognosis remains poor. © 2005 The Society of Surgical Oncology, Inc.",Excluded
2779,"A high lymph node ratio predicts loco-regional recurrence while microscopic N2 predicts survival after radiation therapy in pIIIA-N2 non-small cell lung cancer. Objective: Post-operative management of pIIIA-N2 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is still debated. Our objective was to identify subgroups of patients who could benefit from treatment based on invaded lymph node ratio (LNR). Method(s): From January 2003 to December 2012, 297 pIIIA-N2 NSCLC patients treated with surgery followed by conformational radiation therapy (RT) were retrospectively analysed. Result(s): Median follow-up time was 30 months. A correlation was observed between LNR and overall survival (OS) (R = -0.3, p < 0.0001), local relapse (R = -0.27, p < 0.0001) and extra-capsular spread (ECS) (Cramer's V = 0.49, p < 0.0001). In univariate analysis, OS was significantly lower in patients with LNR higher than 1/3 (median survival 61 +/- 6.5 vs. 28 +/- 3.8 months, p < 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, favourable prognostic factors for OS were a LNR <1/3 (HR = 0.53, 95 % CI 0.33-0.85, p = 0.009) and microscopic N2 (HR = 0.56, 95 % CI 0.35-0.90, p = 0.01). For local relapse, multivariate analysis identified the following risk factors: female gender (HR = 2.41, CI 1.36-4.27, p = 0.003), microscopic N2 (HR = 0.40, CI 0.2-0.81, p = 0.01) and a LNR of lower than 2/3 (HR = 0.18, CI 0.07-0.48, p = 0.001). Conclusion(s): Our study supports that LNR is likely related to OS and loco-regional recurrence. Furthermore, microscopic N2 seems to be associated with a better prognosis.Copyright © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
2379,"Oxygen consumption during walking and running under fractional weight bearing conditions. INTRODUCTION: Knowledge of changes in oxygen consumption during reduced body weight loading at different speed levels is important, in particular in astronauts who may lose aerobic fitness as well as in clinical patients (e.g., in obese individuals at walking speeds or in injured athletes at running speeds). Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze oxygen consumption during unloaded walking and running., METHODS: Oxygen consumption (Vo2), heart rate (HR), and Borg rating of perceived exertion (Borg RPE) were quantified in 10 healthy young female and male volunteers at 3 body weight (BW) conditions (100%, 66%, and 33% BW) and 4 treadmill speeds (slow walking at 0.4 m x s(-1), comfortable walking at 1.3 m x s(-1), slow running at 2.2 m x s(-1), and moderately fast running at 3.1 m x s(-1)). Unloading was achieved in a waist-high chamber with increased pressure called Lower Body Positive Pressure (LBPP)., RESULTS: All parameters (Vo2, HR, and Borg RPE) decreased during unloaded walking and running. Interestingly, our findings confirm a specific linear relationship between each parameter and treadmill speed for each BW condition with smaller slope angles at higher levels of unloading (e.g., for Vo2, the slope angle decreased from 11.9 at 100% BW to 4.4 at 33% BW)., DISCUSSION: Oxygen consumption, heart rate, and Borg rating of perceived exertion are reduced during unloaded exercise with a relatively greater decline at higher treadmill speeds. That is, the higher the treadmill's speed in unloaded conditions, the relatively ""easier"" it is to exercise.",Excluded
3344,"Temporal and spatial melanoma trends in austria: An ecological study. Annual solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is mostly determined by latitude and altitude. Over the last decades, increasing UVR ground levels have been observed. Exposure to UVR is associated with a life-time risk to develop melanoma, a malign skin cancer. Thus, we hypothesized that melanoma incidence in Austria is associated with altitude of place of living and time of diagnosis. We investigated this hypothesis in an ecological study by district and year for Austrian melanoma incidence (1990-2010) and mortality (1970-2011) data. As expected, incidence rates increased with altitude (about 2% per 10 m) and year (about 2%). Additionally, melanoma incidence rates were about 50% higher in urban than in rural districts. In contrast, mortality rates decreased with altitude (for males: 0.4% per 10 m, for women: 0.7% per 10 m, respectively). The observed discrepancy between incidence and mortality data could partly be explained by melanoma diagnosis at earlier tumor stage in districts with higher altitude. Possible reasons for this finding include higher awareness of patients, better diagnostic performance of medical professionals working at higher altitudes, or slower tumor growth due to protective effects of sun light-associated vitamin D synthesis. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Excluded

UNLABELLED: Safety, targeting, and antitumor efficacy of pretargeted radioimmunotherapy using anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) hMN-14 x m734 bispecific antibody (BsmAb) and 131I-di-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA)-indium hapten were evaluated in a phase I study performed on patients with CEA-expressing tumors., METHODS: Twenty-two patients with nonmedullary thyroid carcinoma (non-MTC) (group I, 13 patients) or medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) (group II, 9 patients) were enrolled. These patients received a 75 mg/m2 (11 patients) or 40 mg/m2 (11 patients) dose of BsmAb and escalating activities of (131)I-di-DTPA-indium 5 d later. Toxicity and tumor response were assessed in 20 patients who received a therapeutic (>2.2 GBq) hapten dose of radioactivity., RESULTS: The percentage of lesions detected by immunoscintigraphy after injection of the therapeutic dose of hapten was 70% on an anatomic-site basis. High bone uptake was relatively frequent. A transient grade I or II hepatic toxicity was observed in 5 patients (45%) injected with 75 mg/m2 of BsmAb and in 1 patient (11%) injected with 40 mg/m2. No other nonhematologic toxicity was observed. With 75 mg/m2 of BsmAb, hematologic toxicity was high: 5 cases of grade III or IV leukopenia (45%) and 5 cases of grade III or IV thrombopenia (45%). With a 40 mg/m2 dose of BsmAb, hematologic toxicity was reduced significantly: 3 cases of grade III or IV leukopenia (33%) and 1 case of grade III or IV thrombopenia (11%) (P = 0.02). Toxicity was significantly higher in MTC patients than in non-MTC patients (P = 0.019). Nine cases of tumor stabilization of 3 mo to more than 12 mo were observed (45%), 6 in the MTC group and 3 in the non-MTC group. The rate of disease stabilization was significantly higher with 75 mg/m2 of BsmAb (64%) than with 40 mg/m2 (22%) (P = 0.04). Human antimouse antibody elevation was observed in 1 patient (8%) and human antihuman antibody in 4 (33%)., CONCLUSION: A BsmAb dose of 40 mg/m2 and a 5-d interval appeared to be a better dose/schedule regimen, with acceptable toxicity. Under these conditions, the maximal tolerated activity was 3 GBq of 131I-di-DTPA-indium in MTC patients. In non-MTC patients, dose escalation should continue.",Excluded

2603,"Inter-laboratory consistency and variability in the buccal micronucleus cytome assay depends on biomarker scored and laboratory experience: results from the HUMNxl international inter-laboratory scoring exercise. The buccal micronucleus cytome (BMNcyt) assay in uncultured exfoliated epithelial cells from oral mucosa is widely applied in biomonitoring human exposures to genotoxic agents and is also proposed as a suitable test for prescreening and follow-up of precancerous oral lesions. The main limitation of the assay is the large variability observed in the baseline values of micronuclei (MNi) and other nuclear anomalies mainly related to different scoring criteria. The aim of this international collaborative study, involving laboratories with different level of experience, was to evaluate the inter- and intra-laboratory variations in the BMNcyt parameters, using recently implemented guidelines, in scoring cells from the same pooled samples obtained from healthy subjects (control group) and from cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy (treated group). The results indicate that all laboratories correctly discriminated samples from the two groups by a significant increase of micronucleus (MN) and nuclear bud (NBUD) frequencies and differentiated binucleated (BN) cells, associated with the exposure to ionizing radiation. The experience of the laboratories was shown to play an important role in the identification of the different cell types and nuclear anomalies. MN frequency in differentiated mononucleated (MONO) and BN cells showed the greatest consistency among the laboratories and low variability was also detected in the frequencies of MONO and BN cells. A larger variability was observed in classifying the different cell types, indicating the subjectivity in the interpretation of some of the scoring criteria while reproducibility of the results between scoring sessions was very good. An inter-laboratory calibration exercise is strongly recommended before starting studies with BMNcyt assay involving multiple research centers. Copyright © The Author 2016.

3642,"Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry for Measurement of Phalangeal Bone Mineral Density on a Slot-Scanning Digital Radiography System. Objective: In this paper, we assess the feasibility of using two detectors in a slot-scanning digital radiography system to acquire images for measuring bone mineral density (BMD) of the middle phalanx of the middle finger using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Method(s): Simulations were used to evaluate the spectral separation of the low- and high-energy spectra and detective quantum efficiency was used for assessing image quality. Scan parameters were chosen to optimize spectral separation, image quality, and radiation dose. We introduce the measurement of volumetric BMD (vBMD) using basis material decomposition. We assess the accuracy of our methods by comparing measurements taken using bone images against reference data derived from subsequent incineration of the bones. In vivo scans were conducted to evaluate the system precision (repeatability) and agreement with a clinical densitometer. Result(s): Average errors for bone mineral content (BMC), areal BMD (aBMD), and vBMD were 4.85%, 5.49%, and 12.77%, respectively. Our system had good agreement with a clinical densitometer based on concordance correlation coefficient values of 0.92 and 0.98 for aBMD and BMC, respectively. Precision studies yielded coefficient of variation (CV) values of 1.35% for aBMD, 1.48% for BMC, and 1.80% for vBMD. The CV values of all measurements were within 2%, indicating that the methods have clinically acceptable precision. Conclusion(s): We conclude that our techniques yield bone measurements with high accuracy, clinically acceptable precision, and good agreement with a clinical densitometer. Significance: We have shown the clinical potential of phalangeal DXA measurements of aBMD and vBMD on a slot-scanning digital radiography system.Copyright © 2015 IEEE.",Excluded
3088,"Time course of pain relief in patients treated with radiotherapy for cancer pain: a prospective study. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this prospective study was to analyze time course of pain relief by radiotherapy for cancer pain., METHODS: A total of 91 patients with painful bone metastases were treated by radiotherapy with a median total dose of 46 Gy. Pain of the irradiated site was assessed using a numerical rating scale (pain score: 0 to 10) once a week from the beginning of radiotherapy (day 1) for about 5 weeks., RESULTS: In time course analysis of the 91 cases, the mean (+/-SD) pain scores at day 5, day 12, day 19, day 26, day 33, and day 40 were 7.8 (+/-1.6), 5.3 (+/-2.5), 3.5 (+/-2.5), 2.4 (+/-2.5), 1.6 (+/-2.1), and 1.1 (+/-1.9), respectively, and mean pain score was significantly reduced with time from the start of radiotherapy (P<0.001: repeated measure ANOVA). Mean pain score was significantly reduced every week by d33 (P<0.05: d5 vs. d12, d12 vs. d19, d19 vs. d26, and d26 vs. d33). Complete pain relief was obtained in 45/91 (49%) cases, and partial (> or =50%) pain relief was obtained in 83/91 (91%) cases. The mean time to obtain 50% pain relief was 13 days. The mean time to obtain complete pain relief (n=45) was 24 days. Doses of analgesics were reduced in 28/64 (44%) cases at the end of radiotherapy., DISCUSSION: Telling approximate time course of pain relief seems to reduce patients' anxiety, and knowing time course of pain relief seems to be useful to determine optimal dose of analgesics that changes according to the course.",Excluded
3335,"Complex fractures of the distal humerus in the elderly: Is primary total elbow arthroplasty a valid treatment alternative? A series of 20 cases. Introduction: Distal humerus fractures are fairly rare. But as our population ages, these fractures become more complex and the choice of treatment more delicate. Poor bone quality results in many technical problems and the fixation hardware stability remains at risk. The goal of this study was to evaluate the functional recovery and morbidity of complex distal humerus fractures in elderly patients when treated with elbow prosthesis. Hypothesis: Good functional recovery can be achieved with a total joint replacement. Patients and Methods: This series consisted of 20 patients (18 women and two men) having an average age of 80years (range 65-93, median 80). Based on the AO classification, there were two Type A2 fractures, two Type B fractures, 15 Type C fractures and one fracture that could not be classified because of previous rheumatoid disease history at this elbow. Two fractures were open. In two cases, the olecranon was also fractured. Treatment consisted of the implantation of a Coonrad-Morrey, hinge-type total elbow prosthesis (Zimmer, Warsaw, IN, USA). The Mayo Clinic surgical approach was used 17 times and the transolecranon approach was used three times. Primary arthroplasty was performed in 19 cases and the surgery was performed after six weeks of conservative treatment (diagnostic delay) in one case. Unrestricted motion was allowed after surgery, but a maximum of 0.5kg could be carried during the first 3months; this was subsequently increased to 2.5kg. Result(s): Fifteen of the 20 patients were available for reevaluation with an average follow-up of 3.6. years (range 1.7-5.5, median 3.4). Four patients had died and one was lost to follow-up. The average range of motion was 97degree (range 60-130degree), comprising an average flexion of 130degree (range 110-140degree) and average loss of extension of 33degree (range 0-80degree). Pronation and supination were normal. The average Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS) was 83 (range 60-100, median 80). X-rays revealed seven cases of radiolucent lines, with two being progressive. There was no visible wear of the polyethylene bushings at the hinge. Six patients had moderate periarticular heterotopic ossification. The two cases of olecranon osteotomy and one case of olecranon fracture had healed. There were no surgical site infections but two cases of ulnar compression, one of which required neurolysis. There was one case of humeral component loosening after 6. years, but the implant was not changed. Discussion(s): The clinical range of motion results were comparable to published data. The functional scores were slightly lower, mainly because of the pain factor. The initial results were encouraging and consistent with published data as long as the indications were well-chosen. Based on this retrospective study, total elbow arthroplasty can be a valid alternative in the surgeon's treatment armamentarium for complex distal humerus fractures in elderly patients who have moderate functional demands. Our results support our hypothesis, since we found good functional recovery without associated morbidity.

3585,"Non-inferior low-dose coronary computed tomography angiography image quality with knowledge-based iterative model reconstruction for overweight patients. We investigated the feasibility of low-dose coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), using a prospective electrocardiogram (ECG)-triggered axial scan protocol, knowledge-based iterative model reconstruction (IMR), and fixed tube current, in overweight subjects. Forty non-overweight (group A; body-mass index [BMI] < 25 kg/m2) and 40 overweight individuals (group B; BMI = 25-30 kg/m2), who underwent CCTA for coronary artery disease screening, were retrospectively and consecutively enrolled. A 64-slice CT scanner was used at 100-kVp tube voltage and 150-mA tube current, and images were reconstructed using IMR techniques. Image noise, attenuation at the aorta, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) at the proximal right and left main coronary arteries (pRCA and LMCA) were calculated. CCTA images were qualitatively evaluated using a four-point scale (1, poor; 4, excellent) and analyzed using a non-inferiority test with a predefined non-inferiority margin of -0.2. The mean CCTA radiation dose (Group A: 1.33 +/- 0.02 mSv; Group B: 1.35 +/- 0.10 mSv; p = 0.151) and mean aortic root CT attenuation values (Group A: 447.9 +/- 81.6 HU; Group B: 439.5 +/- 63.6 HU; p = 0.571) did not differ significantly between the two groups. The mean noise in groups A and B was 26.0 +/- 4.8 HU and 29.2 +/- 4.4 HU, respectively (p = 0.005). The noise reduction ratio in the groups, compared to filtered back projection, was 65.0% and 68.1%, respectively. The mean grade of image quality did not differ significantly (3.75 +/- 0.04 vs. 3.71 +/- 0.04, p = 0.478). Group B CCTA image quality was non-inferior (mean difference = -0.043, 95% CI = -0.162-0.077) to that of Group A. We concluded that low-dose CCTA with prospective ECG-triggering and IMR might be applied to overweight subjects, as well as to normal-weight subjects, by using a fixed tube current without an increase in tube current based on the patient's body size.Copyright © 2018 Park et al.

The characteristics and estimated effective dose of CTs unrelated to the final diagnosis were analyzed. The factors affecting the estimated effective dose of CTs unrelated to final diagnosis were investigated., Results. More than half of all CT examinations were not associated with the final diagnosis. The additional estimated effective dose due to CTs being unrelated to the final diagnosis in each patient was a sufficient amount of radiation exposure to increase the possibility of fatal cancer., Introduction. Computed tomography (CT) has many diagnostic advantages, spurring growth in the number of CT examinations. As the use of CT increases, the potential for radiation-induced adverse effects has become an issue. The primary objective of this study was to assess the liberal use of CT induced radiation exposure in patients with multiple blunt traumas. The secondary objective was to investigate the factors affecting the estimated effective dose resulting from CTs unrelated to final diagnosis., Conclusion. A considerable number of CT scans were unrelated to the patient's final diagnosis, which exposes the patient to additional radiation exposure.Copyright ©, Pharmamed Mado Ltd.

1309,"Lung exposure from inhalation of radon progeny: Calculated from in vivo measurements of 210Pb in the skull. To calculate the radiation dose to the lungs from the inhalation of radon and its short-lived progeny, an accurate estimate of cumulative exposure is necessary. In this preliminary study, the content of 210Pb in the skeleton is used to obtain a measure of integrated exposure to the lungs of people living in homes with above average concentrations of radon. Measurements of skeletal 210Pb made in vivo allow the exposed individuals to become, in effect, their own 'samplers' and 'dosimeters' through the normal physical and physiological processes of inhalation, deposition, and retention. 210Pb measurements have been made on 40 subjects whose homes have above average levels of radon. These data are used to obtain their cumulative lung exposures, defined as RLM (Respiratory Level Months). RLM is calculated from the numbers of atoms of RaA, RaB, and RaC,C' deposited in their respiratory systems over the time periods lived in the surveyed homes. The RLM values obtained are not significantly different than conventional WLM exposures calculated for the same time periods.",Excluded
2249,"Extracellular vesicle miRNAs and autophagic CTCs: Predictive and prognostic biomarkers in radiotherapy treated NSCLC patients. Introduction: Most non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patients are diagnosed at advanced stages, when the prognosis is dismal. Thoracic irradiation in combination with chemotherapy have demonstrated to increase the survival of these patients, however, progression is still developed early. The failure of the treatment may be caused by inaccurate patient stratification due to the heterogeneous and evolving nature of tumors that tissue biopsy fails to reflect. Therefore, real-time predictive and prognostic biomarkers are needed to improve the survival of NSCLC patients. In this context, miRNAs are potential markers as they regulate the expression of cancer genes and can be selectively encapsulated into extracellular vesicles (EVs) by cancer cells and found in blood circulation. Similarly, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are a key event in the metastatic process that shredded into the circulation resemble the features of the tissue of origin. Thus, CTCs can act as tissue surrogates and potential predictive and prognostic factors in these irradiated patients. Recent evidence has associated autophagy activation to an increased resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. However, controversial reports showed a dual role of autophagy during tumor cell survival, thus requiring further research to be done. In this work, we aimed to identify the predictive and prognostic role of specific EV miRNAs and autophagic CTCs in advanced NSCLC patients under concomitant radio-chemotherapy Methods: This study prospectively enrolled 38 locally advanced NSCLC patients under concomitant radio-chemotherapy (cisplatin-vinorelbine/carboplatin-taxol). Peripheral blood samples were drawn before, during, and after the treatment. CTCs were immunomagnetically isolated and autophagic activity was characterized by immunofluorescence. EVs were isolated by ultracentrifugation methods and specific miRNAs were analyzed by RT-PCR. Internal validation of the predictive model was performed by bootstrap approach. Result(s): The increase of EV-miR-375 and miR-200c was associated with the reduction of autophagic CTCs along the treatment (p=0.013 & p=0.025). Moreover, baseline levels of EV-miR-375, miR-200c, and miR-30c predicted the response to the treatment with an area under the curve (AUC) of 86%. The presence of autophagic CTCs and low EV-miR-30c were independent prognostic biomarkers for shorter relapse-free survival (p=0.002 & p=0.002) and overall survival (p=0.012 & p<0.001). The analysis of miRNA targets showed that miR-375, miR-200c, and mir30c regulate genes involved in autophagy and cell division such as PIK3CA, potentially modulating radio-chemotherapy resistance. Conclusion(s): This study reports for the first time that EV-miRNAs and autophagic CTCs are predictive and prognostic biomarkers in advanced NSCLC patients under concomitant radio-chemotherapy. Their identification could serve as tumor surrogates for a real-time treatment stratification of NSCLC patients and might also benefit new combinatory strategies based on autophagy inhibition or immunotherapy.",Excluded
2971,"Unstable chromosomal aberrations and micronuclei analyses in the biomonitoring of workers occupationally exposed to ionising radiation. The quantification of unstable chromosomal aberrations and micronuclei in peripheral blood lymphocytes is a method commonly used in biodosimetry by cytogenetic analysis, especially when physical dosimetry cannot be performed. In this context, the aim of this research was to compare these methods in the biomonitoring of health professionals occupationally exposed to ionising radiation. In parallel, the C-banding technique was applied to confirm the presence of unstable chromosomal aberrations (dicentrics and rings). For this, samples of peripheral blood from health professionals of three hospitals (Recife - Brazil) were collected and lymphocyte cultures were carried out based on classical cytogenetic techniques. The number of cells scored per subject was the same (1000) for each assay. Among the individuals, those who do not usually wear a lead apron had higher frequencies of unstable chromosomal aberrations and micronuclei than the ones who carefully observe the radioprotection rules.

UV exposure measurement and diffuse skin reflectance spectrophotometry were performed at the beginning and end of the expedition. Over the course of the expedition, the expeditioners and Sherpas received a median dose of 93.6 (interquartile range [IQR], 61.0-102.8) and 102.5 (IQR, 72.2-117.8) minimal erythemal doses (MEDs) of UV radiation. The maximum dosage exceeded 106 +/- 1.4 MEDs. Using reflectance spectrophotometry, expeditioner and Sherpa melanin-hemoglobin increased by 83.6% (IQR, -1.5 to 89.8%) and 24.7% (IQR, -22.4 to 61.5%) for exposed skin, respectively. The amount of subcutaneous lipid-water decreased by a factor of 196.6 (IQR, 52.1-308.4) and 46.7 (IQR, 1.8-1156.5), for expeditioners and Sherpas, respectively. This expedition's participants received massive doses of UV radiation during their time at high altitude. In many individuals this was similar to the annual exposure of northern European office-workers (100 MEDs). Diffuse skin reflectance spectroscopy revealed considerable subcutaneous lipid loss, skin dehydration, and increased melanin in keeping with these levels of exposure.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the value of prospectively ECG-triggered high-pitch spiral mode CT coronary angiography (CTCA) in the follow-up of patients with prior coronary stent implantation., METHODS: According to the different scan modes, ninety-six patients with heart rate below 75 beat per minute, sinus rhythm and weight below 100 kg and previous coronary stent implantation who underwent 128-slice dual-source Flash spiral CT coronary angiography were randomly divided into two groups according to the randomly numbers in the envelopes: group A(the prospective electrocardiography gated group, 50 cases) and group B(the prospectively ECG-triggered high-pitch spiral mode group, 46 cases). The image quality was evaluated with a four-point grading scale (1 = excellent, 2 = good, 3 = poor, 4 = very poor or non-diagnostic). The total effective dose and the total dose length product between the two groups were recorded respectively. The CTCA enhanced effective dose, dose length product, and the CT volume dosage index (CTDIvol) between the two groups were recorded respectively., RESULTS: A total of 157 stents were implanted, there were 78 stents in group A and 79 stents in group B, and the value of the image quality was (1.3 +/- 0.6) scores in group A and (1.4 +/- 0.6) scores in group B (P > 0.05). The total effective dose [(7.6 +/- 1.8) mSv vs. (1.6 +/- 0.3) mSv] and dose length product [(545.8 +/- 131.5) mGyxcm vs. (111.4 +/- 19.8) mGyxcm]of the entire scan process were significantly higher in group A than in group B (all P < 0.01). The CTCA enhanced effective dose [(6.7 +/- 1.7) mSv vs. (1.2 +/- 0.2) mSv], dose length product [(480.8 +/- 121.9) mGyxcm vs. (84.2 +/- 17.5) mGyxcm] and the CTDIvol [(35.7 +/- 8.6) mGy vs. (4.5 +/- 0.9) mGy] of group A were also significantly higher than those in group B (all P < 0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: It is clinically feasible to use the dual-source Flash spiral CT coronary angiography for the follow-up of the patients with previous coronary stent implantation. This new process can substantially reduce the radiation dose while preserving good imaging quality.",Excluded
1233,"Comparison of dual-axis rotational coronary angiography (XPERSWING) versus conventional technique in routine practice. INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Coronary angiography is the gold standard for the study of coronary artery disease. This technique requires several orthogonal projections. Rotational angiography is a new technique which involves pre-set rotation of the X-ray tube around the patient and allows visualization of each coronary artery in different views, using a single contrast injection. The purpose of this study was to compare conventional coronary angiography (A) vs rotational angiography (B), focusing on radiation dose, amount of contrast administered, and total procedure time for both diagnostic and therapeutic percutaneous coronary interventions., METHODS: Prospective study of 104 consecutive patients undergoing coronary angiography who were randomized to one of these techniques., RESULTS: We found a significant reduction in the amount of contrast administered (A vs B, 93.1 [41.7] vs 50.9 [14.7] mL; P<.0001) and radiation exposure (27.6 [11.5] vs 18 [6.4] mGycm(2); P<.0001). A significant increase in total procedure time was noted in the rotational angiography arm. However, when only the last 50 patients were analyzed, we found no difference in procedure time between the groups, probably related to the learning curve of the operators. Angioplasty was performed in 29 patients in group A and 28 patients in group B. Contrast reduction was maintained in the rotational angiography group compared to the conventional technique (A vs B, 335.1 [192.1] vs 238.5 [114.4] mL; P=.02)., CONCLUSIONS: The rotational angiography technique leads to a significant decrease in radiation exposure and contrast dose administered for diagnostic procedures when compared to conventional coronary angiography. In patients who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention, contrast reduction remains significant. Copyright © 2011 Sociedad Espanola de Cardiologia. Published by Elsevier Espana.

268,"Changes in performance and bio-mathematical model performance predictions during 45 days of sleep restriction in a simulated space mission. Lunar habitation and exploration of space beyond low-Earth orbit will require small crews to live in isolation and confinement while maintaining a high level of performance with limited support from mission control. Astronauts only achieve approximately 6 h of sleep per night, but few studies have linked sleep deficiency in space to performance impairment. We studied crewmembers over 45 days during a simulated space mission that included 5 h of sleep opportunity on weekdays and 8 h of sleep on weekends to characterize changes in performance on the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) and subjective fatigue ratings. We further evaluated how well bio-mathematical models designed to predict performance changes due to sleep loss compared to objective performance. We studied 20 individuals during five missions and found that objective performance, but not subjective fatigue, declined from the beginning to the end of the mission. We found that bio-mathematical models were able to predict average changes across the mission but were less sensitive at predicting individual-level performance. Our findings suggest that sleep should be prioritized in lunar crews to minimize the potential for performance errors. Bio-mathematical models may be useful for aiding crews in schedule design but not for individual-level fitness-for-duty decisions.",Excluded

AIMS: To quantitatively evaluate the changes in corneal irregular astigmatism after laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) in relation to the amount of laser ablation., METHODS: In 189 eyes of 116 patients undergoing LASIK for myopia, corneal topography was obtained before and 1 month after surgery. Using Fourier harmonic analysis of the topography data, corneal irregular astigmatism (asymmetry and higher order irregularity) was calculated., RESULTS: By surgery, asymmetry component significantly increased (p < 0.0001, Wilcoxon signed rank test), while higher order irregularity did not (p = 0.767). The increases in the asymmetry component significantly correlated with ablation depth (Spearman rank correlation coefficient r(s) = 0.440, p < 0.0001). No significant correlation was found between changes in higher order irregularity and ablation depth (r(s) = 0.137, p = 0.074)., CONCLUSION: LASIK significantly increases the asymmetry component of the cornea which is dependent on the amount of laser ablation.",Excluded
2173,"Significance of Fuchs Flecks in Patients With Pterygium/Pinguecula: Earliest Indicator of Ultraviolet Light Damage. PURPOSE: Fuchs flecks (FFs) have been previously identified at the leading edge of pterygia and may represent collections of epithelial stem-like cells that give rise to this condition. This study aims to evaluate the clinical significance of FFs in patients with ocular surface disorders, such as pterygium and pinguecula, by in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM)., METHODS: This study is a Single-center, retrospective, observational case series of 40 eyes from 20 patients with clinical diagnoses of pinguecula or pterygium, or both. IVCM (Rostock Cornea Module; Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) was performed on patients with pinguecula or pterygium, or both. The presence of FFs on the ocular surface of patients with pterygium and pinguecula was assessed by IVCM and subsequently documented., RESULTS: FFs were present in 24 of 30 eyes (80.0%) in paired macroscopically normal nasal or limbal regions, 19 of 20 (95.0%) in pinguecula, 13 of 15 (86.7%) in primary pterygia, and 7 of 7 (100%) in recurrent pterygia., CONCLUSIONS: High rates of FFs were identified at the head of pinguecula, primary pterygium, recurrent pterygium, and macroscopically normal nasal and temporal limbus. We postulate that FFs may represent precursor lesions to UV-associated ocular surface pathology. Identification of Fuchs fleck by IVCM may permit clinicians to predict the patients who may progress to develop more advanced pathology.",Excluded
636,"Effects of parental radiation exposure on developmental instability in grasshoppers. Mutagenic and epigenetic effects of environmental stressors and their transgenerational consequences are of interest to evolutionary biologists because they can amplify natural genetic variation. We studied the effect of parental exposure to radioactive contamination on offspring development in lesser marsh grasshopper Chorthippus albomarginatus. We used a geometric morphometric approach to measure fluctuating asymmetry (FA), wing shape and wing size. We measured time to sexual maturity to check whether parental exposure to radiation influenced offspring developmental trajectory and tested effects of radiation on hatching success and parental fecundity. Wings were larger in early maturing individuals born to parents from high radiation sites compared to early maturing individuals from low radiation sites. As time to sexual maturity increased, wing size decreased but more sharply in individuals from high radiation sites. Radiation exposure did not significantly affect FA or shape in wings nor did it significantly affect hatching success and fecundity. Overall, parental radiation exposure can adversely affect offspring development and fitness depending on developmental trajectories although the cause of this effect remains unclear. We suggest more direct measures of fitness and the inclusion of replication in future studies to help further our understanding of the relationship between developmental instability, fitness and environmental stress.

Sarcoma of the head and neck region following irradiation for primary malignancy other than retinoblastoma has rarely been reported. Three cases of postirradiation sarcoma arising in the head and neck region following definitive radiotherapy for primary malignancies of the nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, and larynx are presented. The intervals from initial radiation to diagnosis of sarcoma were 10 years, 10 1/2 years, and 12 1/2 years, respectively. The dosage ranged from 6000--6400 rads using conventional fractionation (1750--1811 ret) on a 60Cobalt teletherapy unit. Methotrexate (25 mg I. V. every three days for seven doses) was utilized during the initial course of radiation in two of the three patients. The cases conform well to established criteria for the diagnosis of radiation-induced sarcoma.

360,"Effects on human skin of repetitive ultraviolet-A1 (UVA1) irradiation and visible light. Background: Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) has a variety of effects on human skin. Best known are the effects of UVB (290-320 nm) and UVA2 (320-340 nm), which cause DNA damage and increased risk of cancer. However, the effects of UVA1 (340-400 nm) have been not completely investigated. Method(s): The effects of repetitive low doses of UVA1 and visible light were studied in 12 healthy individuals. A part of the buttock was exposed to 20 J/cm2 UVA1 and another part to 126 J/cm2 of visible light three times a week for 4 weeks. Repeated punch biopsies were taken during the 4 weeks of treatment and also 2 weeks after the last irradiation. The avidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase technique was used to investigate the expression of p53, p21WAF, bcl-2, Ki67 and cyclin A. Result(s): By comparison to untreated skin, an increased expression of p53 but not p21WAF in keratinocytes was seen. The bcl-2 protein expression increased slightly after both UVA1 and visible light. An increased staining with Ki67 and cyclin A after UVA1 but not after visible light was observed as a sign of increased proliferation.

2912,"Retrospective assessment of self-reported exposure to medical ionizing radiation: results of a feasibility study conducted in Germany. BACKGROUND: Exposure to medical ionizing radiation has been increasing over the past decades and constitutes the largest contributor to overall radiation exposure in the general population. While occupational exposures are generally monitored by national radiation protection agencies, individual data on medical radiation exposure for the general public are not regularly collected. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of assessing lifetime medical ionizing radiation exposure from diagnostic and therapeutic procedures retrospectively and prospectively within the framework of the German National Cohort study., METHODS: Retrospective assessment of individual medical radiation exposure was done using an interviewer-based questionnaire among 199 participants (87 men and 112 women) aged 20-69 randomly drawn from the general population at two recruitment locations in Germany. X-ray cards were distributed to 97 participants at one recruitment center to prospectively collect medical radiation exposure over a 6-month period. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used to test differences in self-reported median examination frequencies for the variables age, sex, and recruitment center. To evaluate the self-reported information on radiological procedures, agreement was assessed using health insurance data as gold standard for the time period 2005 to 2010 from 8 participants., RESULTS: Participants reported a median of 7 lifetime X-ray examinations (interquartile range 4-13), and 42% (n = 83) reported having had a CT scan (2, IQR = 1-3). Women reported statistically significant more X-ray examinations than men. Individual frequencies above the 75th percentile (>=15 X-ray examinations) were predominantly observed among women and in individuals >50 years of age. The prospective exposure assessment yielded a 60% return-rate of X-ray cards (n = 58). 16 (28%) of the returned cards reported radiological examinations conducted during the 6-month period but generally lacked more detailed exposure information. X-ray examinations reported for the period for which health insurance data were available provided a moderately valid measure of individual medical radiation exposure., CONCLUSIONS: The assessment of more recent medical examinations seems in the German National Cohort study feasible, whereas lifetime medical radiation exposure appears difficult to assess via self-reports. Health insurance data may be a potentially useful tool for the assessment of individual data on medical radiation exposure both retrospectively and prospectively.",Excluded
2428,"Correlation between fracture healing status and euroqol score (EQ-5D) during conservative therapy for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. INTRODUCTION: EQ-5D is a standardized instrument utilized as a measure of health related quality of life outcome. There are few reports investigating the relationship between fracture healing status and EQ-5D after conservative treatment for painful vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). METHOD(S): Forty consecutive patients (5 male, 35 female, average age: 78) had fresh VCFs due to primary osteoporosis diagnosed by MRI. They were treated in hospital for 2 to 3 weeks by conservative therapy consisting of medication (NSAIDs, Alendronate, Calcitonin) and brace. EQ-5D and questionnaires were collected at pre-fracture (retrospective) and post-fracture at first visit, at discharge and after 12-week conservative therapy. Radiographic evaluation was conducted by flexion-extension X-ray and CT. Pseudoarthrosis was diagnosed when the intervertebral cleft was seen in both X-ray and CT, and there was a motion more than 3-degrees in flexion-extension X-rays. Correlations among fracture healing status, brace compliance, and EuroQOL score were investigated. Final follow-up rate was 85% (34/40). RESULT(S): There were 30 patients who could move by themselves (Group A), and other 10 patients who could not even turn over due to severe pain (Group B). EQ-5D at pre-fracture, post-fracture, discharge, and after conservative therapy were 0.9067, 0.5030, 0.7538, and 0.7688 in Group A, 0.7359, -0.0179, 0.5546, and 0.7948 in Group B, respectively. Post-fracture EQ-5D in Group B was significantly lower (p<0.0001). Pseudoarthrosis was found in 6 cases (18%), while the intervertebral cleft was observed in 41 at 12-weeks. All these 6 cases answered as the brace compliance, almost all day"". Average EQ-5D in these 6 cases was 0.2657 at first visit and 0.689 after 12-week therapy, which was significantly lower than that of other fracture healed cases(0.8029, p=0.0001). DISCUSSION: Successful fracture healing rate in this conservative therapy was 82%. Eighteen percent of pseudoarthrosis patients with lower EQ-5D could be candidates for the interventional therapy.""",Excluded

Background: Data is still limited regarding the clinical impact of direct rotational atherectomy(RA) in patients with complex coronary artery lesions during percutaneous coronary intervention(PCI). Method(s): Using the ""Clinical Outcome of ROtational atherectomy in Calcified lesions in Korea(ROCK)"" registry, we sought to examine the effect of the direct RA on procedural outcomes and complications in patients undergoing PCI compared to the indirect RA. The outcomes of interest were procedural outcomes including procedural time, contrast amount, and radiation dose, technical and procedural success rates, in-hospital major adverse cerebral and cardiac events (MACCEs), and procedure-related complications. Result(s): Procedure time was significantly shorter in the direct RA compared to the indirect RA [60 min (interquartile range (IQR), 42-90 min) indirect RA vs. 68 min (IQR, 50-106 min), p<0.001]. Technical and procedural success rate, in-hospital MACCEs and procedure-related complication were similar between the two groups. There was no event of cardiac tamponade and in-hospital stroke in the direct RA. Also, severe coronary artery dissection and coronary perforation were numerically less frequently observed in the direct RA compared to the indirect RA. Conclusion(s): Direct RA showed more efficient strategy compared to indirect RA regarding procedure time. Severe coronary dissection during the procedure and coronary perforation were less frequently observed in direct RA. Further randomized study may be warranted.Copyright © 2021",Excluded
3205,"Neoadjuvant chemoradiation may increase the risk of respiratory complications and sepsis after transthoracic esophagectomy. Background: The role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy before resection in esophageal cancer remains controversial. Operative risks may be increased, but this has not been systematically addressed in published trials or reports. Method(s): This was a prospective, nonrandomized, restricted cohort design of patients (n = 200) from 1997 to 2003 with resectable cancer of the esophagus or esophagogastric junction. A total of 102 patients underwent multimodal therapy with 5-fluorouracil, cisplatin, and radiation therapy before surgery, and 98 patients opted for surgery alone. In-hospital mortality and morbidity were the primary end points, and cancer survival was a secondary end point. Result(s): In patient cohorts matched for operative risk factors, the odds ratio for postoperative sepsis (P = .007), respiratory failure (P = .009), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (P = .02) was increased in the multimodal group. There was no significant difference between groups comparing median and 1-, 2-, and 3-year survivals. Conclusion(s): Multimodal therapy was associated with increased respiratory and septic complications compared with a surgery-only cohort undergoing the equivalent surgery. Respiratory failure was in most cases idiopathic.

586,[Stimulation of the suppressor activity in relation to hematopoietic cells in the mouse thymus as affected by pertussis vaccine]. After a single intraperitoneal injection of formalinized whole-cell pertussis vaccine 5374 into CBA mice a drastic depletion of cells in the thymus accompanied by the enhancement of suppressor T-cells production is observed. T-cells inhibit the endogenous and exogenous colony-formation in the spleen by hematopoietic stem cells (CFUs). Treatment of thymus cells with the anti-I-Jk alloantiserum against a specific marker of suppressor T-cells in the presence of complement removes the inhibitory effect on CFUs proliferation and has a stimulatory action on the capacity of the marrow CFUs to form macroscopic hematopoietic colonies in the spleen compared with control ones.

In a subset of patients with limited lung metastases we hypothesized that Cyberknife Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy may improve treatments outcome. Material(s) and Method(s): Between February 2007 and December2011, 68 patients, 24 female, 44 male, median age of 69 years (range 32-87 years) with 91 pathologically proven pulmonary metastases not amenable to surgery, (colorectal 36, lung 20, kidney 12, breast 8, parothyd 9, bladder 2, pancreas 2, endometrium 1 and melanoma 1) with a median gross tumor volume of 31 cc (range 3.55-240.06 cc) were referred to our Radiotherapy Department for Cyberknife stereotactic radiotherapy treatment. 1-3gold fiducials (24 patients) were used as markers implanted, except for pts who were eligible for fiducialless Xsight Lung option. Treatment consisted of 48-54 Gy in 3 to 4 fractions for patients with centrally located lesions, and 23-30 Gy single fraction for peripheral lesions. Patients were followed with CT and PET scan to detect disease Local recurrence was defined as an increase in size of tumor following treatment as most tumors shrunk following radiation. Median follow-up was 20 months (range, 4-71months). Result(s): The Kaplan-Meier local control rate (LC) at 1, 2 and 3 years was 95.1%, 90.7%, and 86.9%; overall survival (OS) at 1, 2 and 3 years of 84.6%, 71.2% and 71.2%; disease free Survival (DFS) at 1, 2 and 3 years 63.5%, 48.7% and 40.2% respectively. The overall toxicity was very mild, with the majority of patients without any clinical side effect that did not interfere with their activities of daily living with the exception of fatigue which was experienced by many of them. In one patients with concomitant infection we observed a grade 3 acute pneumonitis, one patients developed significant thoracic pain related to high radiation dose received by the peripheral nerve. Conclusion(s): Cyberknife stereotactic radiotherapy, in patients with pulmonary metastases has been shown to be a promising treatment with high local control and low toxicity profile. Additionally follow up is needed to investigate the optimal radiation dose and overall treatment efficacy. Unfortunately, most patients die from progression of their disease systemically despite local control of their pulmonary disease.",Excluded

The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of a recently developed method of retrospectively estimating the patient dose-area product (DAP) of a chest tomosynthesis examination, performed using VolumeRAD, in thoracic spine tomosynthesis and to determine the necessary field-size correction factor. Digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM) data for the projection radiographs acquired during a thoracic spine tomosynthesis examination were retrieved directly from the modality for 17 patients. Using the previously developed method, an estimated DAP for the tomosynthesis examination was determined from DICOM data in the scout image. By comparing the estimated DAP with the actual DAP registered for the projection radiographs, a field-size correction factor was determined. The field-size correction factor for thoracic spine tomosynthesis was determined to 0.92. Applying this factor to the DAP estimated retrospectively, the maximum difference between the estimated DAP and the actual DAP was <3 %. In conclusion, the previously developed method of retrospectively estimating the DAP in chest tomosynthesis can be applied to thoracic spine tomosynthesis. Copyright © The Author 2015.

We examined the relationship between all-site and main site-specific cancer mortalities and global solar radiation using Poisson regression with municipal data around 2000. The models included single-level (municipality) and multilevel (municipality and prefecture) with/without potential confounding factors (lifestyle and socioeconomic variables). For all-site cancer, single-level analysis showed a significant, strong negative association with solar radiation. However, multilevel analysis showed a moderate or no association. In multilevel analysis with potential confounding factors, solar radiation was significantly negatively associated with most site-specific cancers, but not with gallbladder and liver cancer in men and stomach and breast cancer in women. Our findings support the preventive effective of solar radiation on several types of cancer. However, to show a concrete relationship, a statistical model with an appropriate hierarchy and adjustment for potential confounding factors is required.",Excluded
1860,"Are navigation techniques risk-benefit effective for vertebral transpedicular instrumentation? A prospective comparative study. BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Pedicle screw malposition is very common and may cause neurological, vascular and visceral injuries and compromise mechanical stability. Image-guided surgical techniques have reduced the risk of serious complications and have improved the mechanical stability of pedicle screws. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to compare the malposition rate between intraoperative navigation and free-hand fluoroscopy-guided techniques for placement of pedicle screw instrumentation. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Prospective observational study. PATIENT SAMPLE: All consecutive patients with degenerative disease (degenerative disc disease, listhesis, scoliosis, lumbar stenosis), with instrumentation between T10 and S1, who underwent surgical procedures using the free-hand or intraoperative navigation technique for placement of transpedicular instrumentation were included in the study. METHOD(S): Radiological analysis of the position of the transpedicular screws was performed usisng a 1-mm spinal CT scan. Evaluation of axial slices as well as sagittal and coronal reconstructions were carried out. Analysis of screw position was assessed using the Heary classification. Breach severity was defined according to the Gertzbein classification. Radiation doses were evaluated usisng thermoluminiscent dosimeter (TLD) and estimates of effective dose and organ dose were made based on the scan technical parameters. RESULT(S): A total of 114 patients were included; 58 were operated on using assisted surgery and 56 using free-hand fluoroscopy-guided surgery. A total of 625 screws were implanted (575 below L3 and 50 between T10 and L2): 52% in the navigation-assisted surgery group and 48% in the free-hand surgery group. The total number of malpositioned screws was: 11 (3.6%) in the navigated surgery group (right side: n=7, left side: n=4) and 33 (10.3%) in the free-hand group (right side: n=23, left side: n=10) (p<.001). Screw position according to the Heary scale was: grade II (4 navigated surgery, 6 fluoroscopy guided), grade III (3 navigated surgery, 11 fluoroscopy guided), grade IV (4 navigated surgery, 15 fluoroscopy guided) and grade V (1 fluoroscopy guided). There was only one symptomatic case in the fluoroscopy guided group. Breach severity was as follows: 7 grade A and 4 grade B in the navigated surgery group and 8 grade A, 24 grade B and 1 breach >4 mm grade C in free-hand fluoroscopy-guided group. The radiation received per patient was 5.8 mSv (4.8-7.3). The mean dose received by patients in the free-hand fluoroscopy group was 1 mGy (0.8-1.1). There was no detectable radiation level in the navigation-assisted surgery group whereas the effective dose was 10microGy in the free-hand fluoroscopy-guided surgery group. CONCLUSION(S): The malposition rate, both, symptomatic and asymptomatic, in spinal surgery is reduced when using navigation assisted transpedicular intrumentation compared to placement under fluoroscopic guidance, with radiation values within the safety limits for health. Larger studies, specially in levels above L1, which are the ones that may benefit most from navigated surgery are needed to determine risk-benefit in these patients.",Excluded

Outcome Measure The outcome measure was patients' choice of surgical approach (MIS or open). Methods All patients were subjected to a stepwise interviewing process and were asked to select between open and MIS approaches at each step. Further subgroup analysis stratifying subjects based on stages of decision-making was performed to identify key predictors of selection changes. No sources of funding were required for this study and there are no conflicts of interests. Results Fifty-four patients with a mean age of 55.8 years participated in the study. Thirteen (24.1%) consistently selected a single approach, whereas 31 (57.4%) changed their selection more than once during the interviewing process. Overall, 12 patients (22.2%) had a final decision different from their initial choice, and 15 patients (27.8%) were unable to decide. A large proportion of patients (65.0%) initially favored the open approach's midline incision. This proportion dropped to 16.7% (p<.001) upon mention of the term MIS. The proportion of patients favoring MIS dropped significantly following discussion on the pros and cons (p=.002) of each approach, as well as conversion or revision surgery (p=.017). Radiation and cosmesis were identified as the two most important factors influencing patients' final decisions. Conclusions The longer midline incision of the open approach is cosmetically more appealing to patients than the paramedian stab wounds of MIS. The advantages of the MIS approach may not be as valued by patients as they are by surgeons. Given the equivalent long-term outcomes of both approaches, it is crucial that patients are adequately informed during preoperative counseling to achieve the best consensus decision.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
3194,"Dose reduction in standard head CT: First results from a new scanner using iterative reconstruction and a new detector type in comparison with two previous generations of multi-slice CT. Purpose: Computed tomography (CT) accounts for more than half of the total radiation exposure from medical procedures, which makes dose reduction in CT an effective means of reducing radiation exposure. We analysed the dose reduction that can be achieved with a new CT scanner [Somatom Edge (E)] that incorporates new developments in hardware (detector) and software (iterative reconstruction). Method(s): We compared weighted volume CT dose index (CTDIvol) and dose length product (DLP) values of 25 consecutive patients studied with non-enhanced standard brain CT with the new scanner and with two previous models each, a 64-slice 64-row multi-detector CT (MDCT) scanner with 64 rows (S64) and a 16-slice 16-row MDCT scanner with 16 rows (S16). We analysed signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios in images from the three scanners and performed a quality rating by three neuroradiologists to analyse whether dose reduction techniques still yield sufficient diagnostic quality. Result(s): CTDI Vol of scanner E was 41.5 and 36.4 % less than the values of scanners S16 and S64, respectively; the DLP values were 40 and 38.3 % less. All differences were statistically significant (p < 0.0001). Signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios were best in S64; these differences also reached statistical significance. Image analysis, however, showed non- inferiority"" of scanner E regarding image quality. Conclusion(s): The first experience with the new scanner shows that new dose reduction techniques allow for up to 40 % dose reduction while still maintaining image quality at a diagnostically usable level. © 2013 The Author(s).""",Excluded
241,"Is treatment of hemorrhagic radiation cystitis with hyperbaric oxygen effective?. OBJECTIVE: We report our own experience with the use of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) for the management of postradiation hemorrhagic cystitis., METHODS: We reviewed retrospectively 14 patients from 2001 to 2007 with different pelvic organ malignancies who developed radiation cystitis after irradiation. Patients received 100% oxygen in a hyperbaric chamber at a pressure of 2.5 atmospheres absolute, 60 min bottom time, once a day, 7 days a week for at least 1 month. In principle, 30 HBO treatments per course were performed. After every course of HBO treatments, therapeutic effect was evaluated. The mean duration of follow-up of all patients was 18 months (range: 1-6 years)., RESULTS: Patients were divided into 2 groups, group 1 (treatment group, n = 10) and group 2 (without treatment, n = 4). The mean duration between the onset of hematuria and the beginning of HBO therapy was 8.9 months (range: 3-34). Group 2 did not receive HBO because they were not healthy enough. Only 2 patients (20%) of group 1 recovered from their hemorrhagic cystitis. Group 1 had a significantly lower cure rate of postirradiation hemorrhagic cystitis in comparison to group 2., CONCLUSIONS: Our experience with the use of HBO did not yield favorable results.

2279,"DNA alterations detected in the progeny of paternally irradiated Japanese medaka fish (Oryzias latipes). A nonmammalian test system for germ-cell mutagenesis has been developed by using the Japanese medaka fish. We describe a system for detecting DNA alterations in F1 progeny descended from the gamma-irradiated male medaka that uses an arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction and fingerprinting. A combination of these two methods has some advantages for screening changes in genomic DNA of individual progeny because this detection system can (i) screen for mutational events before embryos with dominant lethal mutations are eliminated during development and (ii) detect DNA changes in the progeny of irradiated males without functional selection and bias, such as resistance to chemicals. DNA alterations are detected as changes in patterns (i.e., band loss and/or band gain) of DNA fingerprints of progeny descended from males whose spermatozoa or spermatids were gamma-irradiated (4.75 or 9.50 Gy). We determined the frequency of gamma-irradiation-induced band loss in arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction fingerprints of DNA from severely malformed embryos with dominant lethal mutations and hatched viable embryos. The frequency of band loss in both dominant lethal embryos and hatched viable embryos increased with increasing gamma-ray dose, although more so in the former. We detected a new band in the fingerprints as a heritable DNA alteration but not a viability- or phenotype-affecting DNA alteration in two viable mutants recovered after gamma-irradiation experiments. A cloned amplified fragment of the new band contained a repeated sequence of p(ATGT)n.",Excluded

To examine the compatibility of low dose rate (LDR) with high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy, we reviewed 399 patients with early oral tongue cancer (T1-2N0M0) treated solely by brachytherapy at Osaka University Hospital between 1967 and 1999. For patients in the LDR group (n = 341), the treatment sources consisted of Ir-192 pin for 227 patients (1973-1996; irradiated dose, 61-85 Gy; median, 70 Gy), Ra-226 needle for 113 patients (1967-1986; 55-93 Gy; median, 70 Gy). Ra-226 and Ir-192 were combined for one patient. Ir-192 HDR (microSelectron-HDR) was used for 58 patients in the HDR group (1991-present; 48-60 Gy; median, 60 Gy). LDR implantations were performed via oral and HDR via a submental/submandibular approach. The dose rates at the reference point for the LDR group were 0.30 to 0.8 Gy/h, and for the HDR group 1.0 to 3.4 Gy/min. The patients in the HDR group received a total dose of 48-60 Gy (8-10 fractions) during one week. Two fractions were administered per day (at least a 6-h interval). The 3- and 5-year local control rates for patients in the LDR group were 85% and 80%, respectively, and those in the HDR group were both 84%. HDR brachytherapy showed the same lymph-node control rate as did LDR brachytherapy (67% at 5 years). HDR brachytherapy achieved the same locoregional result as did LDR brachytherapy.

3419,"Lymphocyte transformation to phytohaemagglutinin and delayed hypersensitivity related to age and previous cancer history. Declining immunosurveillance in old age has been considered one possible explanation for the increased incidence of cancer in the elderly. This study was set up to search for evidence of persistent immunodeficiency in patients with a past history of cancer. Lymphocyte responses to phytohaemagglutinin and cutaneous delayed hypersensivity were assessed in fifty-seven elderly subjects who had successfully completed treatment for cancer more than 18 months previously and compared with those of forty-three healthy controls matched for age and sex. Although a significant difference between mean tritiated thymidine uptake was observed in the lymphocyte response to phytohaemagglutinin (cancer patients 1859 cpm, control 2502 cpm), this could be explained by an unexpectedly prolonged effect of radiotherapy. Mean counts for those twenty-six cancer patients receiving radiotherapy within the period 18 months to 4 years were low (1257 cpm), but were normal (2366 cpm) for the remainder. A significant negative correlation of lymphocyte transformation with age was confirmed in both groups. There was no significant difference in cutaneous delayed hypersensitivity response to commonly encountered antigens. Whilst recognising that these tests do not comprehensively assess immune function, the present results provide no support for the theory that an age-related decline in immune function contributes to the heightened incidence of cancer in the elderly.",Excluded
246,"Neuromuscular activation patterns during treadmill walking after space flight. Astronauts adopt a variety of neuromuscular control strategies during space flight that are appropriate for locomoting in that unique environment, but are less than optimal upon return to Earth. We report here the first systematic investigation of potential adaptations in neuromuscular activity patterns associated with postflight locomotion. Astronaut-subjects were tasked with walking on a treadmill at 6.4 km/h while fixating a visual target 30 cm away from their eyes after space flights of 8-15 days. Surface electromyography was collected from selected lower limb muscles and normalized with regard to mean amplitude and temporal relation to heel strike. In general, high correlations (more than 0.80) were found between preflight and postflight activation waveforms for each muscle and each subject: however relative activation amplitude around heel strike and toe off was changed as a result of flight. The level of muscle cocontraction and activation variability, and the relationship between the phasic characteristics of the ankle musculature in preparation for toe off also were altered by space flight. Subjects also reported oscillopsia during treadmill walking after flight. These findings indicate that, after space flight, the sensory-motor system can generate neuromuscular-activation strategies that permit treadmill walking, but subtle changes in lower-limb neuromuscular activation are present that may contribute to increased lower limb kinematic variability and oscillopsia also present during postflight walking.",Excluded

1093,"Translocation analysis by the FISH-painting method for retrospective dose reconstruction in individuals exposed to ionizing radiation 10 years after exposure. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a powerful method largely used for detecting chromosomal rearrangements, translocations in particular, which are important biomarkers for dose assessment in case of human exposure to ionizing radiation. To test the possibility of using the translocation analysis by FISH-painting method in retrospective dose assessment, we carried out in vitro experiments in irradiated human lymphocytes, in parallel with the analysis of translocations in lymphocytes from 10 individuals, who were exposed to 137cesium in the Goiania (Brazil) accident (samples collected 10 years after exposure). The in vitro dose-response curve for the genomic translocation frequencies (FGs) fits a linear quadratic model, according to the equation: Y=0.0243X2+0.0556X. The FG values were also calculated for the individuals exposed to 137cesium, ranging from 0.58 to 5.91 per 100 cells, and the doses were estimated and compared with the results obtained by dicentric analysis soon after the accident, taking the opportunity to test the validity of translocation analysis in retrospective biodosimetry. A tentative of retrospective dosimetry was performed, indicating that the method is feasible only for low level exposure (below 0.5Gy), while for higher doses there is a need to apply appropriate correction factors, which take into consideration mainly the persistence of chromosomal translocations along with time, and the influence of endogenous and exogenous factors determining the inter-individual variability in the cellular responses to radiation. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Objective: To explore the association between idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) and acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Method(s): Established acute GVHD model of C57BL/6 -> BALB/c mice. Chest computed tomography (CT) scans were dynamically performed in recipient mice after transplant. Lung histopathology and cytokine levels (including TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma) were examined in three experimental groups: mice receiving simple irradiation, syngeneic transplants, and allogeneic transplants. Result(s): All allogeneic transplant mice developed aGVHD. On CT, most aGVHD mice had bilateral diffuse lung infiltrates, while syngeneic transplant mice had normal lungs. On histopathology, aGVHD mice had acute pneumonitis. On immunohistochemistry, the infiltrates were mainly CD4+ T cells during aGVHD onset, but CD8+ T cells predominated during aGVHD progression. Lung TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma levels were higher in the three experimental groups than in normal controls on days + 3 and + 7 post-transplant. On day + 7, TNF-alpha levels were higher in allogeneic than in syngeneic transplant mice; IFN-gamma levels were not different. On days + 12 and + 16, TNF-alpha levels were higher but IFN-gamma levels were lower in allogeneic mice than in syngeneic transplant mice. Conclusion(s): The underlying cause of IPS is aGVHD.

Objective Most centers performing fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (F-EVAR) use hybrid rooms with fusion technology for mapping. We present our experience of successfully performing F-EVAR using C-arm without fusion technology. Methods During the period of January 2016 to October 2018, data were collected from a prospectively maintained F-EVAR database at our tertiary care institute. The primary endpoint was technical success, and the secondary outcomes measured were short- and midterm clinical success (both defined by the Society for Vascular Surgery reporting standards), blood loss, radiation dose, operative time, postoperative endoleaks, aneurysm rupture, endograft patency, and complications. Results We performed 11 F-EVARs during the study period in five (45.5%) males and six (54.5%) females, with a mean age of 75+8 years. All procedures were performed under general anesthesia using OEC 9900 Elite Mobile C-arm (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) without the use of fusion technology. Three patients had planned preoperative open procedures for access due to prior cutdown or bypass. Technical success was achieved in all 11 (100%) cases. The mean length of stay was 5+2 days, and the mean follow-up was 7.5+6.5 months. The mean procedure time was 301+167 minutes, and the mean blood loss was 361+233 mL. Mean fluoroscopy time was 72+31 minutes, and the mean radiation exposure time was 2,160+930 mGy. No patients required intraoperative transfusion. Thirty-day (short term) clinical success was achieved in 10 (90.0%), cases whereas six-month (midterm) clinical success was achieved in 7 (77.7%) patients. Branch vessel patency was 11 (100%) at 30 days and 9 (81.8%) at six months, and primary endograft patency was 100% (11) at six months. We had no perioperative mortality or major adverse cardiac event at 30 days. Thirty-day postoperative morbidity included readmission for pulmonary edema from cardiac failure in one patient. Two patients had clinically insignificant silent cardiac enzyme elevation. Three patients had re-interventions performed during the mean follow-up period. Two patients developed renal stent thrombosis resulting in renal insufficiency, which is defined as an increase in creatinine concentration >=0.5 mg/dL, without the need for dialysis. One type II endoleak was identified postoperatively that required trans-lumbar embolization. No type I or III endoleaks were identified during the study period. Asymptomatic common femoral artery thrombosis was seen on follow-up imaging in one patient.

3021,"The QUANTEC criteria for parotid gland dose and their efficacy to prevent moderate to severe patient-rated xerostomia. BACKGROUND: Recently, the Quantitative Analysis of Normal Tissue Effect in the Clinic (QUANTEC) Group defined dose-volume constraints for the parotid glands to avoid severe xerostomia. The aim of this study was to determine if application of these QUANTEC criteria also protected against moderate-to-severe patient-rated xerostomia., MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 307 head and neck cancer patients treated with primary (chemo)radiotherapy, either with 3D-CRT (56%) or with IMRT (44%). All patients participated in a standard follow-up program in which radiation-induced toxicity and quality of life were prospectively assessed. Patients who met the QUANTEC criteria were classified as low risk and otherwise as high risk., RESULTS: In total, 41% of the patients (treated with 3D-CRT and IMRT) were classified as low risk patients. In the group treated with 3D-CRT and IMRT, it was possible to meet the QUANTEC criteria in 47% and 32% of the patients, respectively. Sparing the parotid glands with IMRT was considerably more difficult in patients with lymph node metastases and in patients with nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal tumours. Low risk patients reported significantly less moderate-to-severe xerostomia than high risk patients. However, the predicted risk of elderly patients and patients with pre-existing minor patient-rated xerostomia at baseline was > 20%, even when the QUANTEC criteria were met., CONCLUSIONS: Significantly lower rates of radiation-induced patient-rated xerostomia were found among low risk patients treated according to the QUANTEC criteria, but these criteria do not completely protect against xerostomia. Particularly in elderly patients and patients already suffering from minor xerostomia at baseline, the QUANTEC criteria do not sufficiently protect against persistent, moderate-to-severe patient-rated xerostomia.",Excluded

OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether a significant number of normal 1-day stress-rest 99mTc-tetrofosmin myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) studies can be identified from the low-dose stress acquisition alone, and whether technical staff can find such studies reliably., METHODS: The supervising consultant and four technologists independently graded the stress acquisitions from 200 consecutive MPS studies using a five-point scale. Studies were classified as normal or abnormal according to the final clinical report based on the completed stress-rest protocol., RESULTS: Between 31 and 62 studies (16-31%) were classified as definitely normal from the stress acquisition alone, of which 0-4 (0-9%) proved abnormal on the final report. Of stress studies graded definitely normal by each technologist, the consultant disagreed in 13-34% of cases. Of 78 stress studies graded definitely normal by at least one technologist, 6% turned out to be abnormal and the consultant disagreed in 33%. When there was agreement between at least two technologists (57 studies), the rates fell to 4% and 21% respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Technologists could make the decision to avoid a resting study in up to 30% of patients following a normal low-dose stress acquisition. The supervising nuclear cardiologist would disagree in perhaps one in five cases, even when there was consensus between two or more technologists. These patients would suffer minor inconvenience by being recalled for a rest acquisition on a second day, but there would be important savings in time and radiation exposure for the majority.",Excluded
3449,"Endonasal phototherapy significantly alleviates symptoms of allergic rhinitis, but has a limited impact on the nasal mucosal immune cells. The literature documents the fact that UV irradiation of cutaneous Langerhans cells (LC) in vivo prevents the development of contact allergy and produces long-lasting immunosuppression. However, not much is known about the effect of UV irradiation on the LC of the nasal mucosa and their connection with clinical scores. Local antigen presentation may be necessary for both primary and recall T cell responses to birch pollen in patients with hay fever. Endonasal phototherapy combination of UVB (5%), UVA (25%) and visible light (70%) utilises the immunosuppressive effects of UV irradiation. The aim of this study was to correlate clinical symptom scores with possible changes in the LC of the nasal mucosa induced by UV radiation. The clinical effectiveness of this form of treatment is discussed. Nasal biopsies were obtained from ten birch pollen-sensitive patients with seasonal rhinitis before and after endonasal phototherapy. All patients showed a significant clinical benefit post-treatment as assessed by standardised instruments, including total nasal symptom score, nasal congestion score, nasal itching score, sneezing score, nasal secretion score and impairment-to-health score.

2862,"Influence of muscle strength to weight ratio on functional task performance. Existing models of muscle deconditioning such as bed rest are expensive and time-consuming. We propose a new model utilizing a weighted suit to manipulate muscle strength, power, or endurance relative to body weight. The aims of the study were to determine as to which muscle measures best predict functional task performance and to determine muscle performance thresholds below which task performance is impaired. Twenty subjects performed seven occupational astronaut tasks (supine and upright seat egress and walk, rise from fall, hatch opening, ladder climb, object carry, and construction board activity), while wearing a suit weighted with 0-120 % of body weight. Models of the relationship between muscle function/body weight and task completion time were developed using fractional polynomial regression and verified with pre- and post-flight astronaut performance data. Spline regression was used to identify muscle function thresholds for each task. Upright seat egress and walk was the most difficult task according to the spline regression analysis thresholds. Thresholds normalized to body weight were 17.8 N/kg for leg press isometric force, 17.6 W/kg for leg press power, 78.8 J/kg for leg press work, 5.9 N/kg isometric knee extension and 1.9 Nm/kg isokinetic knee extension torque. Leg press maximal isometric force/body weight was the most reliable measure for modeling performance of ambulatory tasks. Laboratory-based manipulation of relative strength has promise as an analog for spaceflight-induced loss of muscle function. Muscle performance values normalized to body weight can be used to predict occupational task performance and to establish relevant strength thresholds.",Excluded
2101,"Cortical Bone Trajectory Screws in Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion: Minimally Invasive Surgery for Maximal Muscle Sparing - A Prospective Comparative Study with the Traditional Open Technique. Introduction. A prospective comparative study between classical posterior interbody fusion with peduncular screws and the new technique with divergent cortical screws was conducted. Material and Methods. Only patients with monosegmental degenerative disease were recruited into this study. We analyzed a cohort of 40 patients treated from January 2015 to March 2016 divided into 2 groups (20 patients went to traditional open surgery and 20 patients under mini-invasive strategy). Primary endpoints of this study are fusion rate and muscular damage; secondary endpoints analyzed were three different clinical scores (ODI, VAS, and EQ) and the morbidity rate of both techniques. Results. There was no significant difference in fusion rate between the two techniques. In addition, a significant difference in muscular damage was found according to the MRI evaluation. Clinical outcomes, based on pain intensity, Oswestry Disability Index status, and Euroquality-5D score, were found to be also statistically different, even one year after surgery. This study also demonstrated a correlation between patients' muscular damage and their clinical outcome. Conclusions. Cortical bone trajectory screws would provide similar outcomes compared to pedicle screws in posterior lumbar interbody fusion at one year after surgery, and this technique represents a reasonable alternative to pedicle screws.Copyright © 2018 Nicola Marengo et al.",Excluded

The 3-year overall survival, progression-free survival, distant metastasis free survival and loco-regional control rates were 59%, 48%, 52.4% and 71%, respectively. Of the 122 patients, 32 developed loco-regional recurrence as the initial recurrence, including in-field recurrence in 26 patients, marginal recurrence in five patients and out-field recurrence in seven patients. Of the five patients with marginal recurrence, four have had two or more surgeries before the intensity-modulated radiotherapy and three had oral cavity cancer. Severe adverse events were not frequent, occurring at a frequency of <5%, except for mucositis. No severe toxicities associated with the flap reconstruction were observed either. Conclusion(s): Postoperative intensity-modulated radiotherapy appears to be effective and feasible for patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.Copyright © The Author 2016.

223,"Assessment of glenoid inclination on routine clinical radiographs and computed tomography examinations of the shoulder. Background: Accurate assessment of glenoid inclination is of interest for a variety of conditions and procedures. The purpose of this study was to develop an accurate and reproducible measurement for glenoid inclination on standardized anterior-posterior (AP) radiographs and on computed tomography (CT) images. Material(s) and Method(s): Three consistently identifiable angles were defined: Angle alpha by line AB connecting the superior and inferior glenoid tubercle (glenoid fossa) and the line identifying the scapular spine; angle beta by line AB and the floor of the supraspinatus fossa; angle gamma by line AB and the lateral margin of the scapula. Experimental study: these 3 angles were measured in function of the scapular position to test their resistance to rotation. Conventional AP radiographs and CT scans were acquired in extension/flexion and internal/external rotation in a range up to +/-40degree. Clinical study: the inter-rater reliability of all angles was assessed on AP radiographs and CT scans of 60 patients (30 with proximal humeral fractures, 30 with osteoarthritis) by 2 independent observers. Result(s): The experimental study showed that angle alpha and beta have a resistance to rotation of up to +/-20degree. The deviation from neutral position was not more than +/-10degree. The results for the inter-rater reliability analyzed by Bland-Altman plots for the angle beta fracture group were (mean +/- standard deviation) -0.1 +/- 4.2 for radiographs and -0.3 +/- 3.3 for CT scans; and for the osteoarthritis group were -1.2 +/- 3.8 for radiographs and -3.0 +/- 3.6 for CT scans. Conclusion(s): Angle beta is the most reproducible measurement for glenoid inclination on conventional AP radiographs, providing a resistance to positional variability of the scapula and a good inter-rater reliability. © 2012 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.",Excluded
1709,"Radioembolization-induced tumor calcifications as a surrogate marker of tumor response in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Background/Aim: Tumoral calcification after chemotherapy or radiation therapy has been reported in various cancer patients, but not after radioembolization. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of radioembolization-induced tumor calcification of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated by radioembolization. Patients and Methods: This retrospective study comprised patients with single nodular HCC who underwent yttrium-90 radioembolization between November 2015 and April 2019. The presence of tumoral calcification was visually assessed on a follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan. Result(s): Fiftyfive patients (64.8+/-11.8 years, 43 men) were evaluated. Tumoral calcification was present in 21 (38.2%) of 55 patients in the one-month CT scan (calcification group). The complete response rate for the primary index tumor was 72.7% (40 of 55) in the total study population, and 100% (21 of 21) in the calcification group, respectively. The calcification group had a longer local progression-free survival rate than the noncalcification group (p=0.017). Conclusion(s): Radioembolizationinduced tumoral calcification is relatively common and can be used as an early surrogate marker of complete response.Copyright © 2020 International Institute of Anticancer Research.

1471,"Advanced abdominal imaging with dual energy CT is feasible without increasing radiation dose. BACKGROUND: Dual energy CT (DECT) has proven its potential in oncological imaging. Considering the repeated follow-up examinations, radiation dose should not exceed conventional single energy CT (SECT). Comparison studies on the same scanner with a large number of patients, considering patient geometries and image quality, and exploiting full potential of SECT dose reduction are rare. Purpose of this retrospective study was to compare dose of dual source DECT versus dose-optimized SECT abdominal imaging in clinical routine., METHODS: One hundred patients (62y (+/-14)) had either contrast-enhanced SECT including automatic voltage control (44) or DECT (56). CT dose index (CTDIvol), size-specific dose-estimate (SSDE) and dose-length product (DLP) were reported. Image noise (SD) was recorded as mean of three ROIs placed in subcutaneous fat and normalized to dose by [Formula: see text] . For dose-normalized contrast-to-noise ratio (CNRD), mean attenuation of psoas muscle (CTmuscle) and subcutaneous fat (CTfat) were compared by CNRD = (CTmuscle - CTfat)/SDn. Statistical significance was tested with two-sided t-test (alpha = 0.05)., RESULTS: There was no significant difference (p < 0.05) between DECT and SECT: Mean CTDIvol was 14.2 mGy (+/-3.9) (DECT) and 14.3 mGy (+/-4.5) (SECT). Mean DLP was 680 mGy*cm (+/-220) (DECT) and 665 mGy*cm (+/-231) (SECT). Mean SSDE was 15.7 mGy (+/-1.9) (DECT) and 16.1 mGy (+/-2.5) (SECT). Mean SDn was 42.2 (+/-13.9) HU [Formula: see text] (DECT) and 47.8 (+/-14.9) HU [Formula: see text] (SECT). Mean CNRD was 3.9 (+/-1.3) [Formula: see text]. (DECT) and 4.0 (+/-1.3) [Formula: see text] (SECT)., CONCLUSION: Abdominal DECT is feasible without increasing radiation dose or deteriorating image quality, even compared to dose-optimized SECT including automatic voltage control. Thus DECT can contribute to sophisticated oncological imaging without dose penalty.",Excluded
33,"Image quality in obese patients undergoing 256-row computed tomography coronary angiography. To evaluate, objectively and subjectively, the feasibility of 256-row computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) in obese patients. 256-row CTCA was performed in 68 symptomatic patients (age 61 +/- 10 years, 37 females), 39 obese (body mass index-BMI > 30 kg/m(2)) and 29 non-obese. Retrospective analysis was performed by two observers who assessed the image quality of each coronary segment using a 4-point subjective scale (1 excellent to 4 non-diagnostic), and another blinded observer measured objective image parameters. BMI in the obese group was 35 +/- 5 (32-65) Kg/m(2), and 24 +/- 3 (16-29) Kg/m(2) in the non-obese (P = 0.004). Average subjective image quality was similar in obese (1.41 +/- 0.40) and non-obese (1.34 +/- 0.40) patients, P = 0.17. Proportion of coronary artery segments with non-diagnostic image quality was low in both groups (0.7% in obese and 0.2% in non-obese, P = 0.31). Signal to noise and contrast to noise ratios were not significantly lower in obese than in non-obese patients (9.4 +/- 3 vs. 12 +/- 2.5, P = 0.16 and 11.1 +/- 3.8 vs. 13.7 +/- 2.9, P = 0.07 respectively). However, dose length product (1167 +/- 567 vs. 827 +/- 375 mGy x cm, P = 0.014) and image noise (44 +/- 13 vs. 35 +/- 5 HU, P < 0.001) were higher in the obese patient group.

180,"Reduction of radiation exposure during ablation of atrial fibrillation. AIMS: Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) during ablation of atrial fibrillation (Afib) may be associated with long fluoroscopy duration. Although most current publications report on fluoroscopy time (FT), the dose-area product (DAP) may be a more valuable parameter for depicting radiation exposure. The aim of our study was to describe a method to reduce DAP by simple means during ablation of Afib., METHODS: Patients undergoing Afib ablation using a three-dimensional (3D) mapping system were assigned to two fluoroscopy protocols: (1) standard settings with 7.5 pictures/s and collimation to the heart, fluoroscopy as needed for the convenience of the operator (standard group, SG); and (2) strict collimation to the left atrium, a frame rate of 4 pictures/s, shortened pulmonary vein angiography sequences, and maximal orientation by the 3D mapping system (redDAP group). The primary endpoint was DAP., RESULTS: The study comprised 206 patients, who were assigned to the SG (n = 101, 49 %) or to the redDAP group (n = 105, 51 %). Mean FT was significantly reduced from 29.9 +/- 11.3 min (SG) to 13.3 +/- 8.3 min (redDAP group); mean DAP was reduced by approximately 90 % from 8,690 +/- 5,727 to 837 +/- 647 cGycm(2). The groups did not differ significantly in body mass index (28.8 +/- 4.1 vs. 29.0 +/- 5.0). PVI could be achieved in 98 of 101 patients (97 %) from the SG group and in all patients (100 %) from the redDAP group. Procedure time was significantly longer in the redDAP group (160.9 +/- 35.7 vs. 138.1 +/- 34.3 min)., CONCLUSION: Radiation exposure during Afib ablation procedures can be reduced with simple means by strict collimation to the left atrium, a frame rate of 4 pictures/s, shortened pulmonary vein angiography sequences, and maximal 3D orientation.",Excluded
822,"Parasympathetic stimulation improves epithelial organ regeneration. Parasympathetic nerves are a vital component of the progenitor cell niche during development, maintaining a pool of progenitors for organogenesis. Injured adult organs do not regenerate after parasympathectomy, and there are few treatments to improve organ regeneration, particularly after damage by therapeutic irradiation. Here we show that restoring parasympathetic function with the neurotrophic factor neurturin increases epithelial organ regeneration after damage. We use mouse salivary gland explant culture containing fluorescently labelled progenitors, and injure the tissue with irradiation. The progenitors survive, parasympathetic function is diminished and epithelial apoptosis reduces the expression of neurturin, which increases neuronal apoptosis. Treatment with neurturin reduces neuronal apoptosis, restores parasympathetic function and increases epithelial regeneration. Furthermore, adult human salivary glands damaged by irradiation also have reduced parasympathetic innervation. We propose that neurturin will protect the parasympathetic nerves from damage and improve organ regeneration. This concept may be applicable for other organs where parasympathetic innervation influences their function.",Excluded
2643,"Safety of deferred CT imaging of intoxicated patients presenting with possible traumatic brain injury. BACKGROUND: Patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with altered mental status and alcohol intoxication can clinically resemble patients with an intracranial hemorrhage. Although intracranial hemorrhage is quickly excluded with a head computed tomographic (CT) scan, it is common practice to defer imaging and allow the patient to metabolize to spare ED resources and minimize radiation exposure to the patient. Although this reduces unnecessary scans, it may delay treatment in patients with occult intracranial hemorrhage, which some fear may increase morbidity and mortality. We sought to evaluate the safety of deferred CT imaging in these patients by evaluating whether time to scan significantly affects the rate of neurosurgical intervention., METHODS: In this retrospective medical record review, all clinically alcohol-intoxicated patients presenting to 2 university EDs were included. Time to order CT imaging, findings on imaging, and outcomes of these patients were determined. Patients were assessed in 3 groups: CT ordered within 1 hour of triage, CT ordered 1-3 hours from triage, and CT ordered 3 or more hours from triage., RESULTS: During the study period, 5943 patients were included in the study. Of these, 0 patients scanned in less than 3 hours had intracranial findings on imaging requiring neurosurgery, whereas 1 patient with a deferred CT scan required a neurosurgical intervention; however, it was not emergently performed., CONCLUSION: Routine CT scanning of alcohol-intoxicated patients with altered mental status is of low clinical value. Deferring CT imaging while monitoring improving clinical status appears to be a safe practice. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1288,"Analysis of radiation therapy in 1054 patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) treated during 1985-2009. Purpose/Objective(s): Since 15 years ago, our group has conducted nationwide surveys of PCNSL seen at radiation therapy (RT) departments in Japan. The vast majority of the surveyed institutions are university hospitals. So far, data on 1,054 patients treated between 1985 and 2009 have been collected. The purpose of this study was to analyze RT and evaluate treatment outcome in these patients. Materials/Methods: Subjects of the survey were patients with histologically- proven PCNSL who received RT, including those who did not complete planned treatment. Clinical characteristics, treatment and prognosis of the patients were asked using a detailed questionnaire. Data on 466 patients seen between 1985 and 1994 were collected from 62 institutions, and 273 patients seen between 1995 and 2004 were collected from 30 institutions. Most recently, 315 patients seen between 2005 and 2009 were collected from 20 institutions. Thus, 1,054 patients (630 men and 424 women; median age, 62 years) were evaluable. No patients had AIDSrelated PCNSL. Among the patients, 696 were dead and 358 were alive or lost to follow-up. Median follow-up period for living patients was 37 months. Result(s): For all 1,054 patients, the median survival time (MST) was 24 months and the 5-year survival rate (5YSR) was 25.8%. The MST and 5YSR were 23 months and 24.8%, respectively, for 969 patients treated with whole-brain RT and 25.5 months and 29%, respectively, for 85 patients treated with partial-brain RT (p = 0.80). Patients were divided into 4 groups according to the total radiation dose: (1) 30-39.9 Gy; (2) 40- 49.9 Gy; (3) 50-53.9 Gy; and (4) >= 54 Gy. Patients receiving < 30 Gy were excluded. The MST and 5YSR were significantly better in the group receiving 40-49.9 Gy than in the other groups (5YSR was 24%, 32%, 25%, and 21% for groups 1-4, respectively; all p < 0.05 against group 2 receiving 40-49.9 Gy). Even when the analysis was limited to patients receiving high-dose methotrexate containing chemotherapy and RT, the survival rate was similarly the best in the group receiving 40-49.9 Gy (5YSR was 41%, 51%, 37%, and 37% for groups 1-4, respectively). Patients receiving a whole-brain dose < 40 Gy had better survival than those receiving >= 40 Gy (5YSR: 32% vs 20%, p = 0.0005). For patients receiving high-dose methotrexate containing chemotherapy and partial brain RT (>= 30 Gy), the 5YSR was 51%. Conclusion(s): This large retrospective analysis suggests that the optimal total dose to the tumor may be in the range 40-49.9 Gy, even in combination with methotrexate-containing chemotherapy. Patients receiving partial-brain RT had a prognosis similar to those receiving while-brain RT. The whole-brain dose >= 40 Gy did not seem to be associated with better survival. Partial-brain RT with high-dose methotrexate may worth consideration for patients with a single PCNSL.",Excluded
330,"Removal of comfort pads underneath babies: a method of reducing radiation exposure to neonates. RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The recent increasing utilization of imaging has increased the population exposure to ionizing radiation. With increasing knowledge of the potential harm of radiation exposure, efforts should be made to minimize patient radiation whenever possible, especially in young children. The purpose of this study was to use the exposure index (EI) standard to assess the potential for reducing radiation dose to babies by removing a soft comfort pad, often placed underneath the baby. The pad is located between the baby and the image detector plate. As such it absorbs x-rays that have already passed through the baby but have not yet reached the imaging detector plate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a thoracic infant phantom and fixed exposure factors, we measured the percentage of the radiation exiting a neonatal chest phantom that was absorbed/attenuated by the comfort pad, before it hit the detector to create the image. We studied comfort pads of 4 different thicknesses, ranging from 0.5 to 8. RESULTS: Radiation beam attenuation, ranging from 12% to 72.1%, was found with all comfort pads, with increased x-ray beam attenuation occurring with increasing pad thickness. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows that comfort pads cause a high attenuation of the radiation beam, after it exits the chest phantom. As such, removal of the pads prior to radiographic exposure of babies is a method of potentially reducing patient radiation exposure in the newborn nursery.",Excluded

This study aims to investigate the feasibility of quantitative ultrasonic backscatter in evaluating human cortical and trabecular bone densities in vivo based on a head-down-tilt bed rest study, with 36 participants tested through 90 d of bed rest and 180 d of recovery. Backscatter measurements were performed using an ultrasonic backscatter bone diagnostic instrument. Backscatter parameters were calculated with a dynamic signal-of-interest method, which was proposed to ensure the same ultrasonic interrogated volume in cortical and trabecular bones. The backscatter parameters exhibited significant correlations with site-matched bone densities provided by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (0.33 < R < 0.72, p < 0.05). Some bone densities and backscatter parameters exhibited significant changes after the 90-d bed rest. The proposed method can be used to characterize bone densities, and the portable ultrasonic backscatter bone diagnostic device might be used to non-invasively reveal mean bone loss (across a group of people) after long-term bed rest and microgravity conditions of spaceflight missions.Copyright © 2021 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology",Excluded

3251,"Ultrasound Guidance Reduces Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy Cost Compared to Fluoroscopy. OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost factors associated with ultrasound and fluoroscopic guidance for percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and to determine which method can be performed at a lower cost per case., METHODS: A cost comparison study was performed utilizing clinical data from a prospectively maintained research database. We included the most recent 33 consecutive ultrasound-guided PCNL cases in 2016 and the most recent 40 consecutive fluoroscopy-guided PCNL cases before the operative surgeon transitioned to ultrasound guidance in May 2014. The total operative time and clinical outcomes were examined. Costs were extracted from the institution accounting systems and given a uniform multiplier to protect institutional financial reporting confidentiality. Comparisons were made using the Student t test and the chi-squared test., RESULTS: After excluding outliers, 71 PCNL procedures were included in the analysis. Demographic data and stone characteristics were not different between ultrasound-guided and fluoroscopy-guided groups. However, the mean operative time for ultrasound-guided PCNL was significantly shorter (99.8 +/- 27.0 vs 144.9 +/- 55.1 minutes, P < .05). When capital equipment costs were included, the mean total cost per case of ultrasound-guided PCNL was approximately 30% less than fluoroscopy-guided PCNL (simulated costs with a uniform multiplier; $5258.90 +/- 957.12 vs $7508.60 +/- 1163.83, P < .05). Postoperative clinical outcomes were comparable between the 2 groups., CONCLUSION: When capital costs are included, ultrasound-guided PCNL can produce comparable clinical outcomes to fluoroscopy-guided procedures at a lower cost to the institution. Shorter operative time drives significant savings with the adoption of ultrasound guidance, which may be magnified with increasing case volume. Using ultrasound imaging during PCNL may be more cost-effective compared to fluoroscopy and warrants further study. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2892,"Subacute and chronic benign superior vena cava obstructions: Endovascular treatment with self-expanding metallic stents. OBJECTIVE. Our purpose is to report our clinical experience with patients who underwent endovascular treatment with Wallstents for subacute or chronic benign obstruction of the superior vena cava (SVC). SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Twelve patients who were an average of 54 +/- 12 years old were referred for treatment of severe SVC syndrome related to implanted central venous catheters (n = 8), postradiation fibrosis (n = 2), a permanent pacemaker (n = 1), or a benign tumor (n = 1). Symptoms were present for an average of 16 weeks (range, 4-48 weeks) before treatment. Diagnosis of SVC obstruction was confirmed with helical CT and pretherapeutic phlebography. Four patients had Stanford's type II stenosis; two, type III; and six, type IV. The mean clinical and radiologic follow-up intervals were 11 months (range, 1-36 months) and 7 months (range, 1 week to 32 months), respectively. RESULTS. Recanalization was successful in all patients. Fifteen stents were implanted in the 12 patients. Stents were placed after percutaneous balloon angioplasty in nine patients, and primary stent placement was attempted in three patients. We immediately achieved a satisfactory SVC diameter in all patients, whose symptoms were relieved completely within 1 week of stent placement. No technical or clinical complications occurred. SVC syndrome recurred in one patient 2 months after stent placement and was treated by placing a second stent. CONCLUSION. Endovascular treatment with stent placement should be considered relevant and safe for refractory benign SVC syndrome. However, a larger series and a longer follow-up period are needed to define the role of stent placement for this syndrome.",Excluded

Aim: To investigate the effect of diode laser on the Candida albicans colonization in complete denture patients. Method(s): A total of 40 complete maxillary dentures wearers studied in this cross-sectional study. Dentures were then randomly divided into two groups. In first group as the control group no intervention was made. Dentures of the second group merely exposed to laser irradiation by the diode laser with wavelength of 940 nm with 100mW for 30 seconds on mucosal surface of dentures before delivery. Samples were collected from the mucosal surface of upper dentures on the determined days. All collected colonies were counted. Clinical outcome was evaluated regarding the colonization of Candida albicans reported by CFU. Difference of colony counts results between two groups was evaluated by Mann-Whitney test. Statistical significance was assumed if p<0.05. Result(s): The results showed laser irradiation was significantly effective in reducing candida colonization. The lower density of the colonies was seen in laser group in compare with control group on 15th and 60th days after denture delivery (P=0.002) & (P=0.003), respectively. Conclusion(s): generalization our data into the clinical setting, it can be proposed that a direct laser-based approach can significantly reduce the colonization of Candida albicans. It can also be concluded that laser light at specific wavelengths could be a possible promising novel strategy for prevention of denture stomatitis.Copyright © 2021 Lahore Medical And Dental College.

INTRODUCTION: Our objective was to investigate the effect of sex on cognitive decline within the context of amyloid beta (Abeta) burden and apolipoprotein E genotype., METHODS: We analyzed sex-specific effects on Abeta-positron emission tomography, apolipoprotein, and rates of change on the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite-5 across three cohorts, such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle, and Harvard Aging Brain Study (n = 755; clinical dementia rating = 0; age (standard deviation) = 73.6 (6.5); female = 55%). Mixed-effects models of cognitive change by sex, Abeta-positron emission tomography, and apolipoprotein epsilon4 were examined with quadratic time effects over a median of 4 years of follow-up., RESULTS: Apolipoprotein epsilon4 prevalence and Abeta burden did not differ by sex. Sex did not directly influence cognitive decline. Females with higher Abeta exhibited faster decline than males. Post hoc contrasts suggested that females who were Abeta and apolipoprotein epsilon4 positive declined faster than their male counterparts., DISCUSSION: Although Abeta did not differ by sex, cognitive decline was greater in females with higher Abeta. Our findings suggest that sex may play a modifying role on risk of Alzheimer's disease-related cognitive decline. Copyright © 2018 the Alzheimer's Association. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1266,"An open-label, prospective pilot clinical study of denosumab for severe hyperparathyroidism in patients with low bone mass undergoing dialysis. CONTEXT: Denosumab is widely used for bone diseases with increased bone resorption. Its effectiveness in patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism on dialysis is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of denosumab in patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism who are on dialysis.
DESIGN: This 6-month prospective, open-labeled study evaluated 12 patients (five women, seven men; mean age 53.5 ± 3.8 y). All had intact PTH (iPTH; > 1000 pg/mL), low bone mass (T-score < -1.0 SD), and bone pain and were poor surgical candidates. Serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase (AP), and iPTH levels were assessed at baseline and every month thereafter. Vertebral spine x-rays and bone mineral densities (BMDs) (lumbar spine and femoral neck) were assessed at the start and end of the study. All patients received denosumab (60 mg), calcitriol, phosphate binders, and dialysate calcium that were adjusted according to the biochemistry data.
RESULTS: The BMD increased in both the femoral neck (mean increase 23.7% ± 4.0%) and lumbar spine (17.1% ± 2.6%) after 6 months. In the first month, most patients had increased iPTH levels, which dramatically decreased from 1702.1 ± 181.9 to 518.8 ± 126.8 pg/mL by the end of the study after increasing the calcitriol dose. All patients had significant decreases in AP, calcium × phosphorus, and bone pain. Changes in femoral neck BMD correlated only with AP and iPTH levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Denosumab is effective in restoring bone mass and reducing bone pain in patients on dialysis with secondary hyperparathyroidism. It also allows for a more aggressive use of calcitriol to control hyperparathyroidism.",Excluded
1806,"Molecular model T6: C60 bulk-heterojunction solar cells. Organic photovoltaic devices offer a large technological potential as a renewable source of electrical energy because of their low cost and ease of processing. For the last few years, the interest in such devices has grown rapidly, allowing multiplication of the solar conversion efficiency by 5 within about 10 years. The highest conversion efficiency obtained is now close to 5% with a spin-coated polythiophene-fullerene blend. For a better understanding of those polymer blend systems, we have fabricated a coevaporated solar cell from model molecules. The molecular blend was composed of sexithiophene (, -dihexylsexithiophene, T6) as a donor and fullerene C60 as an acceptor. The influence of the T6: C60 proportion was studied for an active layer of 100 nm thickness. The conversion efficiency obtained with the optimal proportion of T6: C60 (40-60) is 0.7%. Reverse bias annealing effect was studied by measuring the current-voltage characteristics after each postprocessing step.

3130,"Hapten-specific IgE antibody responses in mice. VI. Selective enhancement of IgE antibody production by low doses of X-irradiation and by cyclophosphamide. Exposure of BALB/c, A/J, and (BALB/c X A/J)F1 mice, which are IgE high responder animals, to total body x-irradiation ranging from 50 to 200 R resulted in a dose-dependent enhancement of the hapten-specific IgE antibody level as compared to unirradiated control mice. In contrast, anti-hapten antibody responses of the IgG class in these same animals were rarely enhanced, and when so, were of a lesser degree. This relatively selective augmentation of the IgE vs IgG antibody responses was observed in both unprimed and primed mice. By utilizing adoptive transfer systems, it was demonstrated that the enhancing effects of x-irradiation resulted from its action on the carrier-primed cell population and not upon the responding B cells or upon macrophages. The data presented herein suggest that this enhancement phenomenon is the result of the elimination of T cells (or their products) with suppressive functions and that these cells are neither dependent upon nor specific for the carrier antigen employed in the immunization. This hypothesis is given indirect support by the observations that treatment of the same strains of mice with cyclophosphamide, in doses known to abrogate suppressive T cell functions, resulted in a similar enhancing effect to that observed after low doses of x-irradiation. In addition an interesting difference between IgE and IgG precursor B lymphocytes was observed by the ability of IgE B cells to differentiate to the secretory state at a strikingly more rapid rate than IgG B lymphocytes when exposed to comparable T cell helper influences. These observations may provide important clues to the cellular mechanisms of the immune regulation of the IgE response and its relationship to allergic diseases.",Excluded
2959,"Cerebral embolism in cancer patients. Sudden neurological deterioration suggesting embolism in a patient with a history of cancer should alert the physician to the possibility of a non-metastatic, and therefore potentially reversible, cause of cerebral embolism before cerebral metastasis is implicated. During a four year period, we have observed eight cases of acute cerebral embolism among 3000 cancer patients seen in a department of medical oncology. Five patients had features post mortem of non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis, and in one, the diagnosis had been made antemortem, but treatment with heparin did not prevent further emboli. Two patients had radiation related carotid vascular disease, and one patient post lymphangiographic embolism. The literature reporting these uncommon causes of cerebral embolism is reviewed. Post-lymphangiographic embolism carries a uniformly good prognosis. In selected cases of post-irradiation cerebral embolism, surgical intervention may prevent a neurological catastrophe. Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis and mucin embolism are of uncertain aetiology and natural history; long-term survival is uncommon, and treatment does not appear to influence the clinical course or outcome.",Excluded

188,"Local and disease control for nasal melanoma treated with radiation and concomitant anti-programmed death 1 antibody. Mucosal melanoma of the nasal cavity is a rare disease that has been consistently associated with poor outcome. While complete surgical excision offers the only prospect of a cure, it is associated with a high risk of surgical morbidity due to the challenging anatomical location, and most patients still develop incurable metastatic disease. The efficacy of immunotherapy on mucosal melanoma is lower in comparison with cutaneous melanoma, and mucosal melanoma rarely has BRAF mutations. Although preclinical data have shown that combination treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors and radiotherapy (RT) improve the response, there have been few reports on the combination of RT and anti-programmed death 1 therapy for mucosal melanoma of the nasal cavity. We retrospectively investigated 10 cases of mucosal melanoma of the nasal cavity in which combined treatment was applied. The local control (LC) rate of the primary lesion and regional lymph nodes was favorably 100%. On the other hand, the median progression-free survival (PFS) time was 29.6 weeks (range, 2-82). The 6-month PFS rate was 60%. Although severe mucositis occurred in one patient, the incidence of treatment-related adverse events was not significantly increased. RT with anti-programmed death 1 antibody therapy for mucosal melanoma of the nasal cavity was tolerable and had the potential to improve LC and PFS.

1377,"Hypervascular liver tumors: low tube voltage, high tube current multidetector CT during late hepatic arterial phase for detection--initial clinical experience. PURPOSE: To intraindividually compare a low tube voltage (80 kVp), high tube current computed tomographic (CT) technique with a standard CT protocol (140 kVp) in terms of image quality, radiation dose, and detection of malignant hypervascular liver tumors during the late hepatic arterial phase., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective single-center HIPAA-compliant study had institutional review board approval, and written informed consent was obtained. Forty-eight patients (31 men, 17 women; age range, 35-77 years) with 60 malignant hypervascular liver tumors (mean diameter, 20.1 mm +/- 16.4 [standard deviation]) were enrolled. Pathologic proof of focal lesions was obtained with histopathologic analysis for 33 nodules and imaging follow-up after a minimum of 12 months for 27 nodules. Patients underwent dual-energy 64-section multi-detector row CT. By using vendor-specific software, two imaging protocols-140 kVp and 385 mA (protocol A) and 80 kVp and 675 mA (protocol B)-were compared during the late hepatic arterial phase of contrast enhancement. Paired t tests were used to compare tumor-to-liver contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) for each lesion, mean image noise, and effective dose between the two data sets. Three readers qualitatively assessed the two data sets in a blinded and independent fashion. Lesion detection and characterization and reader confidence were recorded, as well as readers' subjective evaluations of image quality. Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney statistical analysis was performed on this assessment., RESULTS: Image noise increased from 5.7 to 11.4 HU as the tube voltage decreased from 140 to 80 kVp (P < .0001), resulting in a significantly lower image quality score (4.0 vs 3.0, respectively) with protocol B according to all readers (P < .001). At the same time, protocol B yielded significantly higher CNR (8.2 vs 6.4) and lesion conspicuity scores (4.6 vs 4.1) than protocol A, along with a lower effective dose (5.1 vs 17.5 mSv) (P < .001 for all)., CONCLUSION: By substantially increasing the tumor-to-liver CNR, a low tube voltage, high tube current CT technique improves the conspicuity of malignant hypervascular liver tumors during the late hepatic arterial phase while significantly reducing patient radiation dose.",Excluded
76,"Synovial sarcoma presenting as soft tissue rheumatic syndrome: A challenge for the clinician. Purpose: Despite of its name, synovial sarcoma (SS) does not have synovial origin; it arises from the primitive mesenchyme of the tendon sheath and fascial aponeurosis. SS is frequently misdiagnosed as a benign soft tissue condition. Will be described clinical and histopathological features of patients with diagnosis of SS, emphasizing those manifestations that may lead to misdiagnosis of soft tissue rheumatism. Method(s): A retrospective chart, imaging and pathological review of consecutive histopathological proved cases of SS, registered between January 2000 to December 2008 at Pathology department. Result(s): 27 patients (17 male 63%; 10 female, 37%). The average age at diagnosis was 28 years (11 - 63 years). Anatomical regions involved were, lower limb in 93% (foot 11, 41%; ankle 4, 15%; knee 4, 15%; thigh 4, 15%; inguinal region 2, 7%) and upper limb in 2, 7%; arm and forearm,). Signs and symptoms at presentation were: pain in all cases, palpable deep-seated swelling or periarticular mass in 22 (81%), decrease range of joint motion in 44%, weight loss in 18%, skin color changes in 7%, and muscle weakness in 4%. Eleven (34%) were initially diagnosed as benign rheumatologic conditions: synovitis in 3 (11%); fasciitis in 2 (7%); Mortonxs neuroma; arthrofibrosis; chronic bursitis, synovial cyst, bunionette, and tarsal tunnel syndrome 1 (4%) instance each. The time elapsed since onset of symptoms to diagnosis was 40 months (1 - 156 months). The more advantageos imaging studies that helped defining the presence of a soft-tissue tumor were MRI, CT-scan, scintigraphy and X-rays. In all cases a biopsy was necessary to confirm diagnosis. Surgical treatment was: amputation in 11 patients (41%), block resection in 6 (22%) and marginal resection in 5 (18.5%). Five patients (18.5%) refused surgical treatment. The size of the tumors ranged from 1-to 12 cm. Histological subtype was identified as monophasic (24/89%) and biphasic (3/11%). Patients were classified according to the TNM system as follows: T1N0M0 19(70%), T2N0M0 2(7%) T2N1M0 1(4%) and T2N1M1 5(19%). They also were categorized according to the IRSG classification as type I in 18 patients (67%), type II in 2 (7%), type III in 6 (22%) and type IV in 1 case (4%). Ten (37%) patients underwent adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The average follow-up was 51 months (6-96), local recurrences and metastases were in 7 patients (26%). Fifteen (55.5%) patients were alive and disease free. Conclusion(s): It is essential that the Rheumatologist retain awarness of SS, particularly in young male patients presenting with slow growth, palpable, deep-seated soft tissue swelling or mass in close proximity to joints of the lower extremities. SS should be included in the differential diagnosis of soft tissue rheumatic syndromes.",Excluded
931,"Management of mediastinal relapse after treatment with stereotactic body radiotherapy or accelerated hypofractionated radiotherapy for stage I/II non-small-cell lung cancer. Purpose/Objective(s): Regional failures occur in up to 15% of patients treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for stage I/II lung cancer. This report focuses on the management of the unique scenario of isolated regional failures. Method(s): Patients treated initially with SBRT or accelerated hypofractionated radiotherapy were screened for curative intent treatment of isolated mediastinal failures (IMFs). Local control, regional control, progression-free survival, and distant control were estimated from the date of salvage treatment using the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): Among 160 patients treated from 2002 to 2012, 12 suffered IMF and were amenable to salvage treatment. The median interval between treatments was 16 months (2-57 mo). Median salvage dose was 66 Gy (60-70 Gy). With a median follow-up of 10 months, the median overall survival was 15 months (95% confidence interval, 5.8-37 mo). When estimated from original treatment, the median overall survival was 38 months (95% confidence interval, 17-71 mo). No subsequent regional failures occurred. Distant failure was the predominant mode of relapse following salvage for IMF with a 2-year distant control rate of 38%. At the time of this analysis, three patients have died without recurrence while four are alive and no evidence of disease. High-grade toxicity was uncommon. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge, this is first analysis of salvage mediastinal radiation after SBRT or accelerated hypofractionated radiotherapy in lung cancer. Outcomes appear similar to stage III disease at presentation. Distant failures were common, suggesting a role for concurrent or sequential chemotherapy. A standard full course of external beam radiotherapy is advisable in this unique clinical scenario.© Copyright 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

To evaluate the strategy of using high-dose etoposide mobilization followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (APBSCT) in patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) refractory to rituximab-based chemotherapy. Forty patients with refractory DLBCL were treated with high-dose etoposide for stem cell mobilization. All patients were in progressive disease (PD) prior to mobilization and underwent high-dose chemotherapy followed by APBSCT. Successful PBSC mobilization was achieved in all patients. Twenty-three patients (57.5%) showed a clinical response to high-dose etoposide. After APBSCT, 17 patients (42.5%) achieved CR. The 2-year progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rate were higher in patients responding to high-dose etoposide (64.1% and 77.7%) compared to those without response (11.8% and 11.8%; P < 0.001 for both). The response to high-dose etoposide mobilization therapy was an independent prognostic factor for CR achievement, PFS and OS after APBSCT. High-dose etoposide mobilization chemotherapy followed by APBSCT could rescue a proportion of patients with refractory DLBCL who responded to etoposide mobilization regimen.Copyright © 2019, The Author(s).",Excluded

Preoperative concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy can be highly effective but are often associated with significant rates of morbidity and even mortality. We studied the toxicity of continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and weekly paclitaxel combined with radiotherapy. Patients had histologic proof of local-regional carcinoma of the esophagus or gastroesophageal (GE) junction, a Karnofsky performance status of 70 or greater, and normal liver, renal, and bone marrow functions. Chemotherapy consisted of continuous infusion of 5-FU (300 mg/m2/d) for 5 days a week for 5 weeks, plus paclitaxel (45 mg/m2) given during 3 hours every week for 5 weeks. Based on the tumor location and its resectability, the total dose of concurrent radiation varied between 45 Gy and 50.4 Gy. Nine men and one woman, with a median age of 61 years, were evaluated. One had GE junction cancer, six had distal esophageal cancer, and three had midesophageal cancer. Weight loss, nausea, vomiting, and dysphagia of grades I and II were noted. The hematologic toxicity was mild. No patients required transfusion. There was no leukopenia or thrombocytopenia. None of the patients was hospitalized during chemoradiation; all patients completed treatment as outpatients. Five patients had subsequent surgical resections: one had a pathologically complete response, and two had a partial response (>90% necrosis).

1940,"Clinical determinants of radiation dose in percutaneous coronary interventional procedures: influence of patient size, procedure complexity, and performing physician. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this work were to establish the primary clinical determinants of patient radiation dose associated with percutaneous coronary interventional (PCI) and to identify opportunities for dose reduction., BACKGROUND: Use of X-ray imaging and associated radiation dose is a necessary part of PCI. Potential adverse consequences of radiation dose include skin radiation injury and predicted increase in lifetime cancer risk., METHODS: Cumulative skin dose (CSD) (measured in gray [Gy] units) was selected as a measurement of patient radiation burden. Several patient-, disease-, and treatment-related variables, including 15 performing physicians, were analyzed in a multiple linear regression statistical model with cumulative skin dose CSD as the primary end point. The model results provide an estimate of the relative CSD increase (decrease) attributable to each variable., RESULTS: Percutaneous coronary interventions performed on 1,287 male and 540 female patients were included. Median patient age was 68.6 years, median body mass index was 29.7 kg/m(2), and median weight was 88 kg. Median CSD was 1.64 Gy per procedure for male and 1.15 Gy for female patients. Increasing body mass index, patient sex, lesion complexity, lesion location, and performing physician were significantly associated with CSD. Physicians who performed more procedures were associated with lower CSD., CONCLUSIONS: Several primary determinants of patient radiation dose during PCI were identified. Along with physician development of radiation-sparing methods and skills, pre-procedure dose planning is proposed to help minimize radiation dose for PCI.

2178,"MRI can play a decisive role in establishing acute and chronic muscle infarction as the primary and often unsuspected cause of sickle cell crisis: A 20-year follow-up of prior and current cases. Objective: To demonstrate that MRI rather than radionuclide, CT, ultrasound or PET scans is most efficient and specific in establishing muscle infarction as the primary cause of sickle cell crisis. MRI can therefore serve as a basis for initiating prompt treatment in the emergency department or nontreatment in the setting of suspected addiction. Longstanding chronic changes are also important to recognize. Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty patients with sickle cell disease included 17 patients followed for 20 years (6 male, 11 female; age range, 17-55 years, 15 with sickle cell anemia and 2 sickle beta thalassemia) with MRI-documented muscle infarcts initially imaged within 24-72 hours of limb pain utilizing Phillips 0.5-T superconductive magnets with interim and more recent studies using superconductive 1.5- and 3-T magnets (Sigma, GE Healthcare), dedicated extremity coils, and T1-weighted, fast spin-echo, fat-saturated, and fluid-sensitive sequences. Result(s): All studies showed acute and chronic abnormal MRI soft-tissue patterns. One third of lower limbs (20 of 60 prior patients) had focally increased signal loci compatible with acute or subacute inflammation, edema, or both associated with hemorrhage or ischemia. In cases without SI alteration in bone or soft tissue, sickle cell crisis could not be substantiated. In the 20 limbs with increased SI loci followed for 20 years, changes ranged from diminishing signal alterations to complete, often bilaterally symmetric curvilinear or rectangular signal voids attributed to infarcts or fibrosis. Recent radiographs when interpreted without adequate history or referral to prior MR studies showed large focal ossifications at one of multiple sites in upper and lower limbs compatible with myositis ossificans without known conventional trauma. Conclusion(s): MR imaging can function as an effective problem solver in patients with sickle cell disease with extremity pain without definitive evidence on multiple other imaging modalities in instances of suspected sickle cell crisis. Chronic or long delayed soft-tissue changes of sickle cell crisis are important to recognize along with muscle involvement in an acute crisis. The latter leads to prompt treatment in the emergency department or no treatment in instances of suspected addiction. Chronic soft-tissue changes are also important since they may be mistaken for nonspecific entities, e.g., myositis ossificans in all stages of repair and resolution on the commonly used imaging modalities in modern practice. Routine radiographs most specifically document mature ossifications.",Excluded
948,"Fat depot specific differences in mRNA expression of novel loci associated with waist-hip ratio. Background and aims: Body fat distribution is one of the main predictors of obesity-associated complications. It might be hypothesised that changes in the gene expression or in gene function caused by genetic variants may result in metabolic alterations related to obesity. We therefore investigated the adipose tissue expression profiles of 6 loci (TBX15, WARS, PIGC, STAB1, GRB14, ZNRF3), identified in a recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) for WHR, as their exact role in fat distribution remains largely unknown. Effects of genetic variants within these loci (rs984222 TBX15/WARS; rs6784615 STAB1; rs1011731 PIGC; rs4823006 ZNFR3; rs10195252 GRB14) on gene expression, WHR, and obesity related traits were examined. Material(s) and Method(s): Paired samples of visceral (vis) and subcutaneous (sc) adipose tissue were obtained from 297 Caucasian men and women who underwent open abdominal surgery. Abdominal vis and sc fat area was calculated using CT scans and percentage body fat was measured by dualenergy X-ray absorptiometry. Gene expression was measured by quantitative real-time PCR by using TaqMan methodology. SNP genotyping was done using the TaqMan SNP Genotyping assay. Differences in mRNA expression between vis and sc adipose tissue were assessed using the paired t-test. Correlation analyses were carried out and multivariate linear relationships were assessed by generalized linear regression models. Two-sided P-values <0.05 were considered to provide nominal evidence for association (adj. age, gender). Result(s): Differential expression between vis and sc adipose tissue could be observed for all tested genes. Except for STAB1 with higher mRNA expression in sc adipose tissue of males vs. females, there were no gender differences in gene expression in either tissue. Surprisingly, no correlation between WHR and fat mRNA expression of any of the genes was observed except for WARS whose expression in vis fat correlated positively with WHR in men. However, mRNA expression of several genes (e.g. WARS, PIGC, STAB1) correlated with BMI. Further, STAB1 expression in sc adipose tissue correlated with fat mass, and ZNRF3 expression in sc tissue correlated negatively with vis fat area. In addition, vis as well as sc expression of WARS and PIGC correlated negatively with both vis and sc fat area. Nominal associations were detected for rs984222 and TBX15 mRNA expression, rs4823006 and ZNFR3 mRNA expression, and rs10195252 and GRB14 mRNA expression, whereat rs984222 was also associated with BMI, sc and vis fat area as well as the GRB14 SNP with waist and waist-hip ratio in men (adj. age, BMI). Conclusion(s): Besides rather moderate correlations of the expression levels with BMI or WHR, the most striking feature of expression of the 6 examined genes is the inter-depot variability as well as correlations with the vis and sc fat area. Our data further support the role of genes from recent GWAS in the regulation of fat distribution.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: Salvage treatment for locally recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is complicated and relatively limited. Radiotherapy, combined with effective concomitant chemotherapy, may improve clinical treatment outcomes. We conducted a phase II randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of intensity-modulated radiotherapy with concomitant weekly cisplatin on locally recurrent NPC., METHODS: Between April 2002 and January 2008, 69 patients diagnosed with non-metastatic locally recurrent NPC were randomly assigned to either concomitant chemoradiotherapy group (n = 34) or radiotherapy alone group (n = 35). All patients received intensity-modulated radiotherapy. The radiotherapy dose for both groups was 60 Gy in 27 fractions for 37 days (range 23-53 days). The concomitant chemotherapy schedule was cisplatin 30 mg/m(2) by intravenous infusion weekly during radiotherapy., RESULTS: The median follow-up period of all patients was 35 months (range 2-112 months). Between concomitant chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy groups, there was only significant difference in the 3-year and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates (68.7% vs. 42.2%, P = 0.016 and 41.8% vs. 27.5%, P = 0.049, respectively). Subgroup analysis showed that concomitant chemoradiotherapy significantly improved the 5-year OS rate especially for patients in stage rT3-4 (33.0% vs. 13.2%, P = 0.009), stages III-IV (34.3% vs. 13.2%, P = 0.006), recurrence interval >30 months (49.0% vs. 20.6%, P = 0.017), and tumor volume >26 cm(3) (37.6% vs. 0%, P = 0.006)., CONCLUSION: Compared with radiotherapy alone, concomitant chemoradiotherapy can improve OS of the patients with locally recurrent NPC, especially those with advanced T category (rT3-4) and stage (III-IV) diseases, recurrence intervals >30 months, and tumor volume >26 cm(3).",Excluded

1120,"Robot-assisted intravertebral augmentation corrects local kyphosis more effectively than a conventional fluoroscopy-guided technique. OBJECTIVE Intravertebral augmentation (IVA) is a reliable minimally invasive technique for treating Magerl type A vertebral body fractures. However, poor correction of kyphotic angulation, the risk of cement leakage, and significant exposure to radiation (for the surgeon, the operating room staff, and the patient) remain significant issues. The authors conducted a study to assess the value of robot-assisted IVA (RA-IVA) for thoracolumbar vertebral body fractures. METHODS The authors performed a retrospective, single-center study of patients who had undergone RA-IVA or conventional fluoroscopy-guided IVA (F-IVA) for thoracolumbar vertebral body fractures. Installation and operating times, guidance accuracy, residual local kyphosis, degree of restoration of vertebral body height, incidence of cement leakage, rate of morbidity, length of hospital stay, and radiation-related data were recorded. RESULTS Data obtained in 30 patients who underwent RA-IVA were compared with those obtained in 30 patients who underwent F-IVA during the same period (the surgical indications were identical, but the surgeons were different). The mean +/- SD installation time in the RA-IVA group (24 +/- 7.5 minutes) was significantly shorter (p = 0.005) than that in the F-IVA group (26 +/- 8 minutes). The mean operating time for the RA-IVA group (52 +/- 11 minutes) was significantly longer (p = 0.026) than that for the F-IVA group (30 +/- 11 minutes). All RA-IVAs and F-IVAs were Ravi's scale grade A (no pedicle breach). The mean degree of residual local kyphosis (4.7degree +/- 3.15degree) and the percentage of vertebral body height restoration (63.6% +/- 21.4%) were significantly better after RA-IVA than after F-IVA (8.4degree +/- 5.4degree and 30% +/- 34%, respectively). The incidence of cement leakage was significantly lower in the RA-IVA group (p < 0.05). The mean length of hospital stay after surgery was 3.2 days for both groups. No surgery-related complications occurred in either group. With RA-IVA, the mean radiation exposure was 438 +/- 147 mGy x cm for the patient and 30 +/- 17 mGy for the surgeon. CONCLUSIONS RA-IVA provided better vertebral body fracture correction than the conventional F-IVA. However, RA-IVA requires more time than F-IVA.Copyright ©AANS 2019.",Excluded
1472,"Whitacre needle reduces the incidence of intravascular uptake in lumbar transforaminal epidural steroid injections. Background: Transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI) is a commonly used interventional pain management procedures to treat radicular leg pain. Although most reported complications of TFESI are minor, serious morbidity has also been demonstrated including spinal cord infarction, paraplegia, and quadriparesis. Suggested mechanisms include direct vascular injury or intravascular injection of particulate steroid. Objective(s): We compared 2 different needle types, Whitacre and Quincke type needles, with regard to intravascular injection rate with total procedure time and the amount of radiation during lumbar TFESI. Study Design: Prospective, randomized trial. Setting(s): An interventional pain management practice in South Korea. Method(s): After Institutional Review Board approval, 149 patients undergoing lumbar TFESI for radicular leg pain were randomly assigned to one of 2 needle groups (Whitacre needle or Quincke type needle). After final confirmation of intravascular injection with digital subtraction angiography, total procedure time and amount of radiation exposure during TFESI were measured. Result(s): The overall incidence of intravascular injection was 10.4% (28/269). We analyzed the overall incidence of intravascular injection according to the 2 different needle types. The incidence of intravascular injection of the Whitacre needle was 5.4% (8/146), whereas the incidence of intravascular injection of the Quincke needle was 16.2% (20/123). Total procedure time and amount of radiation required to complete the TFESI in the Whitacre and Quincke needle groups was 168.4 +/- 57.9 (seconds) and 33.4 +/- 15.9 (cGy/cm2), 131.9 +/- 46.0 (seconds) and 33.2 +/- 15.8 (cGy/cm2), respectively. Limitation(s): The physician who performed the TFESI was not blinded to the type of needle for detecting intravascular injection. This study was focused on lumbar TFESI, however, most TFESIs are performed at the L4-5 or L5-S1 level. Conclusion(s): The Whitacre needle had the benefit of reducing the incidence of intravascular injection with minimal differences in technical difficulties and the amount of radiation exposure during lumbar TFESI.Copyright © 2015, American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians.

The hypothesis that differences in UV doses influence the BCC/ SCC ratio, number of tumors, and anatomic location of the tumor was investigated in 311 participants having 326 tumors and with exposure to a broad range of UV doses. An epidemiologic questionnaire was given to each participant soliciting detailed information on exposure to solar radiation. Environmental UVA and UVB doses were measured continually for 6 years at a permanent UV monitoring station. The total ratio of BCC/SCC was 3.5. Participants who received low and high UV doses had a BCC/SCC ratio of 4.2. Those who received very high UV doses had a ratio of 2.1. A very high UV dose was also associated with the doubling of the total number of tumors per person and a significantly increased risk of having SCC, a more aggressive malignancy. Tumors in sun-exposed areas (on the body) were more common in participants who received high and very high UV doses. The tumors in sun-protected areas were associated with exposure to lower levels of UV. This large-scale population study provides evidence that varying doses of UV radiation have a profound influence on key characteristics of NMSC.",Excluded
2059,"Risk-adapted stereotactic body radiation therapy for central and ultra-central early-stage inoperable non-small cell lung cancer. To determine the therapeutic efficacy and safety of risk-adapted stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) schedules for patients with early-stage central and ultra-central inoperable non-small cell lung cancer. From 2006 to 2015, 80 inoperable T1-2N0M0 NSCLC patients were treated with two median dose levels: 60 Gy in six fractions (range, 48-60 Gy in 4-8 fractions) prescribed to the 74% isodose line (range, 58%-79%) for central lesions (ie within 2 cm of, but not abutting, the proximal bronchial tree; n = 43), and 56 Gy in seven fractions (range, 48-60 Gy in 5-10 fractions) prescribed to the 74% isodose line (range, 60%-80%) for ultra-central lesions (ie abutting the proximal bronchial tree; n = 37) on consecutive days. Primary endpoint was overall survival (OS); secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), tumor local control rate (LC), and toxicity. Median OS and PFS were 64.47 and 32.10 months (respectively) for ultra-central patients, and not reached for central patients. Median time to local failure, regional failure, and any distant failures for central versus ultra-central lesions were: 27.37 versus 26.07 months, 20.90 versus 12.53 months, and 20.85 versus 15.53 months, respectively, all P <.05. Multivariate analyses showed that tumor categorization (ultra-central) and planning target volume >=52.76 mL were poor prognostic factors of OS, PFS, and LC, respectively (all P <.05). There was one grade 5 toxicity; all other toxicities were grade 1-2. Our results showed that ultra-central tumors have a poor OS, PFS, and LC compared with central patients because of the use of risk-adapted SBRT schedules that allow for equal and favorable toxicity profiles.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

892,"Gastroduodenal complications after concurrent chemoradiation therapy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: endoscopic findings and risk factors. PURPOSE: Concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) is useful in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but little is known about radiation-induced gastroduodenal complications following therapy. To determine risk factors, we investigated the prevalence and patterns of gastroduodenal complications following CCRT using endoscopy., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Enrolled in the study were 123 patients treated with CCRT for unresectable HCC between January 1998 and December 2005. Radiation-induced gastroduodenal complications were defined as radiation gastritis/duodenitis, radiation gastric/duodenal ulcer, or other gastroduodenal toxicity associated with radiation, based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE 3.0). Serious gastroduodenal complications were defined as events occurring within 12 months from completion of CCRT, those requiring prompt therapeutic intervention, or symptoms equivalent to Grade 3 or 4 radiation-related gastroduodenal toxicity, including nausea or vomiting, based on CTCAE 3.0., RESULTS: A month after completion of CCRT, 65 (52.8%) patients displayed endoscopic evidence of radiation-induced gastroduodenal complications. Radiation gastric and duodenal ulcers were found in 32 (26.0%) and 20 (16.3%) patients, respectively; radiation gastritis and duodenitis were found in 50 (40.7%) and 42 (34.1%) patients, respectively. Radiation-related bleeding was observed in 13 patients (10.6%). Serious gastroduodenal complications occurred in 18 patients (14.6%) and were significantly more frequent in patients with liver cirrhosis than in those without cirrhosis (p=0.043). There were no radiation-related deaths., CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopically detectable radiation-induced gastroduodenal complications were common in HCC following CCRT. Although serious complications were uncommon, the frequency was higher in patients with liver cirrhosis; thus, these patients should be closely monitored when receiving CCRT.

324,"INTESTINE MICROBIOME ASPIRATION (IMBA) CAPSULE: A NEW AUTONOMOUS AND MINIMALLY-INVASIVE DEVICE FOR WHOLE GUT MICROBIOME SAMPLING AND MAPPING. BACKGROUND. Intestinal microbiota is closely related to human health. However, our current understandings about intestine microbiota are limited due to its inaccessibility. Invasive and expensive catheter-based sampling methods are not suitable for large-scale studies. So, a reliable, inexpensive and convenient capsule device to collect intestinal microbiome is demanded. Here, we report the Intestine Microbiome Aspiration (IMBA) which aims to collect intestine fluid sample autonomously. Without using expensive MEMS technologies, IMBA utilizes controlled-release technology equipped with an novel sampling mechanism to achieve precise and regional sampling in intestine. METHODS. Three healthy volunteers and three IBS-D volunteers ingested the IMBA capsule with distilled water in their empty stomach in the morning. As shown in Fig. 1, Each capsule has an outer hard gelatin shell with an small intestine (SI)-targeted coating (Eudragit L100-55) that kept the main capsule body intact in the acidic stomach. Once the outer shell dissolved in SI, the capsule body was exposed to the luminal environment, and intestinal fluid flowed into a compartment via four wide channels on the capsule wall. The compartment contained 50mg hydrophilic fibers to wick and retain the fluidic luminal sample. A piston was fixed by a dissolvable spring-loaded latch to keep the channels open initially. The latch gradually dissolved in its thickness until its structure collapsed to release the spring, which pushed the piston to close the channels and seal the samples. The subjects underwent a low-dose X-ray scan every 30 minutes after oral intake of the capsule to monitor the sampling status until the spring was released. Capsules and swabbed fecal samples were collected by the volunteer after their bowel movements in the following 1-2 days, and sent for 16s rRNA analysis. RESULTS. All six capsules completed sampling in the small intestine within 3 hours after oral intake. Each capsule collected 74mg of small intestine luminal contents on average. The microbiota composition was different not only between intestines and feces, but also between healthy volunteers and IBS-D volunteers. Intestinal samples were characterized by increased abundance of Gammaproteobacteria, Pseudomonadales and Proteobacteria and reduction of Peptostreptococcaceae and Janthinobacterium (Fig. 2). CONCLUSION. The IMBA prototype has proven the concept of ""MEMS-free"" intestine-targeted microbiome sampling technology, a critical step towards personalized whole gut microbiota mapping. The technology offers a safe and reliable solution of capsule-based GI contents sampling while significantly reducing the costs per operation. New designs of large-scale human studies become possible to reveal temporal and spatial variation of gut microbiota for better understanding of its roles in various diseases.

60,"Survival and complications following Gamma Knife radiosurgery or enucleation for ocular melanoma: A 20-year experience. Background We present our experience in treating ocular melanoma at theNational Centre for Stereotactic Radiosurgery in Sheffield, UK over the last 20 years. Method We analysed 170 patients treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery, recorded the evolution of visual acuity and complication rates, and compared their survival with 620 patients treated with eye enucleation. Different peripheral doses (using the 50% therapeutic isodose) were employed: 50-70 Gy for 24 patients, 45 Gy for 71 patients, 35 Gy for 62 patients. Findings There was no significant difference in survival between the 35-Gy, 45-Gy and 50- to 70-Gy groups when compared between themselves (p00.168) and with the enucleation group (p00.454). The 5-year survival rates were: 64% for 35 Gy, 62.71% for 45 Gy, 63.6% for 50-70 Gy and 65.2% for enucleated patients. Clinical variables influencing survival for radiosurgery patients were tumour volume (p00.014) and location (median 66.4 vs 37.36 months for juxtapapillary vs peripheral tumours, respectively; p00.001), while age and gender did not prove significant. Regarding complications, using 35 Gy led to more than a 50% decrease, when compared with the 45-Gy dose, in the incidence of cataract, glaucoma and retinal detachment. Retinopathy, optic neuropathy and vitreous haemorrhage were not significantly influenced. Blindness decreased dramatically from 83.7% for 45 Gy to 31.4% for 35 Gy (p00.006), as well as postradiosurgery enucleation: 23.9% for 45 Gy vs 6.45% for 35 Gy (p00.018). Visual acuity, recorded up to 5 years postradiosurgery, was significantly better preserved for 35 Gy than for 45 Gy (p00.0003). Conclusions Using 35 Gy led to a dramatic decrease in complications, vision loss and salvage enucleation, while not compromising patient survival. © Springer-Verlag 2012.",Excluded
1994,"Central nervous system failure in Korean breast cancer patients with HER2-enriched subtype: Korean radiation oncology group 16-15 multicenter retrospective study. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the risk of central nervous system (CNS) failure in Korean patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-enriched breast cancer treated with surgery followed by postoperative radiotherapy (RT). Method(s): A total of 749 patients from eight institutions were enrolled in this study. All of them underwent surgery followed by postoperative RT from 2003 to 2011; 246 (32.8%) received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 649 (81.7%) received adjuvant chemotherapy. Adjuvant trastuzumab was administered to 386 patients (48.6%). Result(s): The median follow-up duration was 84 (range, 8-171) months. The 7-year disease-free and overall survival rates were 79.0% and 84.2%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, mastectomy, nodal involvement, and presence of lymphatic invasion were correlated with poor overall survival (p = 0.004, 0.022, and 0.011, respectively), whereas T stage and lymphatic invasion were associated with disease-free survival (p = 0.018 and 0.005, respectively). Regarding CNS failures, 30 brain metastases, 2 leptomeningeal metastases, and 8 brain and leptomeningeal metastases were noted. The 7-year CNS relapse-free survival rates in patients receiving and not receiving trastuzumab were 91.2% and 96.9%, respectively (p = 0.005). On multivariate analysis, the administration of adjuvant trastuzumab was the only prognostic factor in predicting a higher CNS failure rate (hazard ratio, 2.260; 95% confidence interval, 1.076-4.746; p = 0.031). Conclusion(s): Adjuvant trastuzumab was associated with higher CNS failure rate in Korean patients with HER2-enriched breast cancer. Close monitoring and reasonable approaches such as CNS penetrating HER2 blockades combined with the current standard therapy could contribute to improving intracranial tumor control and quality of life in patients with CNS metastasis from HER2-enriched breast cancer.Copyright © 2019 Korean Breast Cancer Society.",Excluded
3437,"Limitations on upper bound dose to adults due to intake of 129I in drinking water and a total diet-implications relative to the proposed Yucca Mountain high level radioactive waste repository. The purpose of this report is to comment on the potential annual doses due to the intake by adults of I, an important radionuclide in the proposed high-level radioactive waste repository at Yucca Mountain. An often overlooked, but significant, factor is that, in this case, the ground water, which would be the primary transport vehicle for any releases, contains relatively high concentrations of stable iodine (127I); in fact, the median concentration in the ground water in the vicinity of the proposed repository is 5.0 microg L-1. In comparison, the maximum concentration of 129I in the ground water, due to potential releases of 129I during the first 10,000 y following closure of the repository, is estimated to be approximately 3.7 x 10(-7) Bq L-1 (approximately 10(-5) pCi L-1). This would result in a 127I to 129I ratio in the water of almost 90 million to one. Assuming no other sources of these two isotopes were being consumed, this would place an upper bound on the annual committed thyroid dose of 1.2 x 10(-1) mSv (1.2 x 10(-1) mrem), less than one thousandth of the Ground Water Protection Standard of 4 mrem y-1. When the additional intake of stable and radioactive iodine in other components of the diet is considered, the overall ratio of 127I to 129I would be more than 2 billion to one. The would place an upper bound on the annual committed effective dose of approximately 2.5 x 10(-8) mSv (approximately 2.5 x 10(-6) mrem), less than one millionth of the Individual Protection Standard of 0.15 mSv (15 mrem).",Excluded
1875,"When is rotational angiography superior to conventional single-plane angiography for planning coronary angioplasty?. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the value of rotational coronary angiography (RoCA) in the context of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) planning., BACKGROUND: As a diagnostic tool, RoCA is associated with decreased patient irradiation and contrast use compared with conventional coronary angiography (CA) and provides superior appreciation of three-dimensional anatomy. However, its value in PCI remains unknown., METHODS: We studied stable coronary artery disease assessment and PCI planning by interventional cardiologists. Patients underwent either RoCA or conventional CA pre-PCI for planning. These were compared with the referral CA (all conventional) in terms of quantitative lesion assessment and operator confidence. An independent panel reanalyzed all parameters., RESULTS: Six operators performed 127 procedures (60 RoCA, 60 conventional CA, and 7 crossed-over) and assessed 212 lesions. RoCA was associated with a reduction in the number of lesions judged to involve a bifurcation (23 vs. 30 lesions, P < 0.05) and a reduction in the assessment of vessel caliber (2.8 vs. 3.0 mm, P < 0.05). RoCA improved confidence assessing lesion length (P = 0.01), percentage stenosis (P = 0.02), tortuosity (P < 0.04), and proximity to a bifurcation (P = 0.03), particularly in left coronary artery cases. X-ray dose, contrast agent volume, and procedure duration were not significantly different., CONCLUSIONS: Compared with conventional CA, RoCA augments quantitative lesion assessment, enhances confidence in the assessment of coronary artery disease and the precise details of the proposed procedure, but does not affect X-ray dose, contrast agent volume, or procedure duration.

1090,"Mediastinal Nodal Involvement After Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation for Siewert II/III Adenocarcinoma. Background: Adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction (AEG) poses a management challenge, as preoperative prediction of occult mediastinal nodal metastasis is difficult. We sought to identify factors predictive of mediastinal involvement among patients undergoing trimodality therapy. Method(s): Patients undergoing trimodality therapy for Siewert II and III AEG at a single institution between 2000 and 2015 were identified. Mediastinal involvement was defined as pathologic nodal involvement after neoadjuvant chemoradiation (ypN+) in mediastinal stations or mediastinal recurrence 2 years or less after resection. Maximal chi2 analysis and Youden's J index were used to identify the pretreatment proximal tumor extent that best discriminated mediastinal involvement. Result(s): In all, 204 patients (151 [74%] AEG II, 53 [26%] AEG III) were included, of whom 47 (23%) had clinical evidence of thoracic nodal disease. Thirty-one of the 204 patients (15%) met criteria for mediastinal involvement (24 of 31 ypN+, 10 of 31 mediastinal recurrence). Patients with mediastinal involvement had greater proximal tumor extent (median 2 cm [interquartile range, 1.0 to 3.0 cm] vs 1.4 cm [interquartile range, 0.7 to 3.0 cm], P =.030), were more frequently Siewert II lesions (27 of 31 [87.1%] vs 124 of 173 [71.7%], P =.071), and were more often observed to have clinical thoracic nodal metastasis (cN) evidence (13 of 31 [42%] vs 34 of 173 [20%], P =.007) than patients who did not. On multivariable analysis of patients with intrathoracic cN0, esophageal extent of 1.5 cm or greater was independently predictive of mediastinal involvement (odds ratio 5.46, P =.011), whereas Siewert classification was not (Siewert II odds ratio 3.48, P =.116). Conclusion(s): Pretreatment proximal tumor extent, rather than Siewert classification, is an independent predictor of mediastinal involvement among AEG II/III patients without clinical evidence of mediastinal metastasis and should be considered during treatment planning.Copyright © 2019 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons",Excluded
1641,"Development of a medical examination program for former workers at a Department of Energy national laboratory. BACKGROUND: As a part of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Former Workers' Medical Surveillance Program, a Needs Assessment was conducted at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). The objective was to identify former LANL employees who may be at significant risk for occupational disease and determine whether a medical examination program could reduce morbidity or mortality. We describe the needs assessment approach used at LANL., METHODS: An algorithm was developed to make needs determinations. Information on factors including exposure, health impacts, size of exposed populations, and LANL worker concerns and recommendations were obtained. Each of these factors was scored from 1 to 3. The resulting factor sum was then multiplied by a binary (1 or 0) intervention suitability factor which was 1 if both of the following were available: (1) a screening test with acceptable sensitivity and specificity for the health outcome of concern; and (2) an intervention that decreases morbidity or mortality. This resulted in an Intervention Needs Score that was used to set priorities for the medical examination program for the estimated 35,000 former LANL workers., RESULTS: Analysis of the algorithm output suggested that six exposure categories be recommended for consideration in a medical examination program. Beryllium, asbestos, and noise clearly warranted inclusion. Lead and ionizing radiation required careful consideration regarding availability of screening tests. Solvents were problematic due to the lack of screening tests and suitable intervention in formerly exposed workers., CONCLUSIONS: The algorithm approach to the needs assessment at LANL documented that six chemical and physical agents should be considered as candidates for inclusion in a medical examination program for former workers.

1404,"Feasibility of wall stress analysis of abdominal aortic aneurysms using three-dimensional ultrasound. OBJECTIVE: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are local dilations that can lead to a fatal hemorrhage when ruptured. Wall stress analysis of AAAs is a novel tool that has proven high potential to improve risk stratification. Currently, wall stress analysis of AAAs is based on computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging; however, three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound (US) has great advantages over CT and magnetic resonance imaging in terms of costs, speed, and lack of radiation. In this study, the feasibility of 3D US as input for wall stress analysis is investigated. Second, 3D US-based wall stress analysis was compared with CT-based results., METHODS: The 3D US and CT data were acquired in 12 patients (diameter, 35-90 mm). US data were segmented manually and compared with automatically acquired CT geometries by calculating the similarity index and Hausdorff distance. Wall stresses were simulated at P = 140 mm Hg and compared between both modalities., RESULTS: The similarity index of US vs CT was 0.75 to 0.91 (n = 12), with a median Hausdorff distance ranging from 4.8 to 13.9 mm, with the higher values found at the proximal and distal sides of the AAA. Wall stresses were in accordance with literature, and a good agreement was found between US- and CT-based median stresses and interquartile stresses, which was confirmed by Bland-Altman and regression analysis (n = 8). Wall stresses based on US were typically higher (+23%), caused by geometric irregularities due to the registration of several 3D volumes and manual segmentation. In future work, an automated US registration and segmentation approach is the essential point of improvement before pursuing large-scale patient studies., CONCLUSIONS: This study is a first step toward US-based wall stress analysis, which would be the modality of choice to monitor wall stress development over time because no ionizing radiation and contrast material are involved.

2789,"Assessment of ureteric colic in irish emergency departments-how do we compare with the gold standard?. Ureteric colic describes the spasmodic pain that arises from obstruction of the ureter by a calculus. It is a common presentation in the Emergency Department (ED) with a lifetime risk of 12 % in men and 5 % in women with an incidence of 3/1000 population per year [1]. Prompt assessment and diagnosis is important as infection in the presence of obstruction is a surgical emergency. The aim of this study is to ascertain the work-up of ureteric colic in Irish EDs and compare these to the agreed gold-standard. An electronic survey was distributed to Consultants and Specialist Registrars in Emergency Medicine. Hospital demographics and presence of a urology service within the hospital were also recorded. Out of 63 responses, 66 % were Consultants and 27.4 % were Specialist Registrars in Emergency Medicine. All HSE training networks were represented. 62.9 % had established guidelines for ureteric colic in their ED. While FBC, U&E, and urine dipstick were routinely performed, metabolic profile and mid-stream urine was only performed 31 and 39 % of the time, respectively. 88.5 % of physicians agree that CT KUB should be the first-line imaging however, only 65 % of EDs actually do this, with X-ray KUB representing 36.5 % of initial imaging. The recommended analgesic-NSAIDs, are prescribed 61.9 % versus morphine, 69.8 % of the time. This is the first study to assess the work-up of ureteric colic in Irish EDs and is important in that it may change Emergency Physician behavior before Urological opinion is sought.

2609,"Central command and metaboreflex cardiovascular responses to sustained handgrip during microgravity. Four subjects were studied before and during a 16-day space flight. The test included 2min of rest, 2min of sustained handgrip (SHG), and 2min of post-exercise circulatory occlusion (PECO). Heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) responses to central command and mechanoreceptor stimulation were determined from the difference between SHG and PECO. Responses to metaboreceptor stimulation were determined from the difference between PECO and rest. Late in-flight (days 12-14) the central command/mechanoreceptor component of the HR response was reduced by 5bpm (P=0.01) from its pre-flight value of 15 (+/-3)bpm (mean (+/-SEM)). At the same time the metaboreflex responses of HR and MAP were unchanged. The attenuated HR response to central command was likely of baroreflex origin. Together with a parallel study of PECO after dynamic leg exercise, our data indicate that central processing of metaboreflex inputs is unchanged in microgravity whereas metaboreflex inputs from weight-bearing muscles are enhanced.",Excluded
2660,"[Lung nodule detection with ultra-low-dose CT in routine follow-up of cancer patients]. PURPOSE: To evaluate the value of an ultra-low-dose CT protocol (ULD-CT) in the dectection of lungnodules in follow-up of cancer patients., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between April and August 2003, 72 consecutive patients with a history of malignancy were prospectively examined on a single-slice helical CT scanner (Aquilion, Toshiba) with ULD-CT (120 kV, 5 mAs, D-eff 0.12 mSv) and regular-dose CT (R-CT) (120 kV, 150 mAs, D-eff 4.8 mSv). The ULD-CT examinations were independently evaluated by two radiologists. Afterwards, consensus reading of the ULD-CT and R-CT examinations was done. Individual nodules were classified benign (benign calcifications) and non-benign. The studies were classified in 4 subgroups: 1) non-benign nodule evident; 2) non-benign nodule probable; 3) non-benign nodule possible, but not likely; 4) no-non benign nodule., RESULTS: ULD-CT detected 180 nodules in 47 patients, while R-CT showed 168 nodules in 39 patients. The sensitivity of ULD-CT was 87 % in detecting nodules regardless of size and 94 % in detecting nodules > or = 5 mm. Regarding the prediction of a case with non-benign nodules (subgroups 1 to 3), the sensitivity of ULD-CT was 94 % and the specificity 75 %., CONCLUSION: ULD-CT is a good diagnostic tool in detecting lung nodules > or = 5 mm. Radiation dose can be markedly reduced. A negative ULD-CT study excludes non-benign nodules in R-CT with a high probability. In case of a positive ULD-CT, R-CT can be immediately followed.",Excluded
3075,"Clinical efficacy of open-irrigated electrode cooled with half-normal saline for initially failed radiofrequency ablation of idiopathic outflow tract ventricular arrhythmias. BACKGROUND: Acute failure of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) occur in 10%-20% of patients and is partly attributed to inadequate lesion depth acquired with standard ablation protocols. Half-normal saline (HNS)-irrigation is a promising strategy to improve the success rate of VA ablation., OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the efficacy of HNS-irrigated ablation after a failed standard plain normal saline solution (PNSS)-irrigated ablation on idiopathic outflow tract ventricular arrhythmia (OT-VA)., METHOD: This is a prospective observational study of consecutive patients undergoing RFA of idiopathic OT-VA comparing the efficacy of additional HNS-irrigated ablation for failed standard PNSS-irrigated ablation. Acute failure was defined as persistence of spontaneous VA or persistent inducibility of the clinical VA., RESULTS: Out of 160 OT-VA cases (51 +/- 15-year-old, 62 males), 31 underwent HNS irrigation after a failed standard PNSS-irrigated ablation. The HNS group had a significantly longer procedure time (60.06 +/- 43.83 vs 37.51 +/- 33.40 minutes; P = .013) and higher radiation exposure (31.45 +/- 20.24 vs 17.22 +/- 15.25 minutes; P = .001) than the PNSS group but provided an additional acute success in 21 of 31 (67.7%) patients. Over a follow-up duration of 7.8 +/- 4.6 months, 24 recurrences were identified, including 8 (25.8%) in the HNS and 16 (12.4%) in the PNSS group, with lower freedom from recurrence in the HNS group (log rank P = .009). No major complication was observed., CONCLUSION: HNS-irrigated ablation after failed standard PNSS-irrigated ablation is safe and additionally improves acute ablation success by 67.7% for idiopathic OT-VA but with a higher rate of recurrence on follow-up. Whether the application of HNS as initial irrigant could result in better outcome requires further investigation. Copyright © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded

666,"Phase I trial of concurrent hyperfractionated split course radiotherapy (HFx RT), cisplatin (cDDP), and paclitaxel in patients with recurrent, previously irradiated, or treatment-naive locally advanced upper aerodigestive malignancy. Purpose: Phase I study to determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of cisplatin (cDDP), paclitaxel (P), and concurrent split course hyperfractionated (BID) RT in advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and other upper aerodigestive tumors. Material(s) and Method(s): Eligibility stipulated ECOG performance status 0-2 and either Tx-naive, locally advanced, or locally recurrent, previously radiated, surgically unresectable upper aerodigestive cancer. Metastases were permitted if disease was predominantly locoregional. RT-naive patients received 150 cGy bid x 5 d Q 2 wks x 4. Previously radiated patients received 150 cGy bid x 5, wk 1; then 120 cGy bid x 5 Q 2 wk x 3 (later increased to 150 cGy BID for the entire treatment). Treatment fields included recurrent tumor only with 2 cm margins. Whenever possible, conventional and 3-D conformal techniques were used. Elective nodal radiation was not administered. Starting doses of cDDP and P were 12 mg/m 2/d x 5 and 15 mg/m2/d x 5, respectively, Q 2 wk x 4, each given on RT days only. At dose level 2, cDDP was increased to 15 mg/m 2/d x 5. At dose level 3, P was increased to 20 mg/m2/d x 5. Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) days 6-12 (off treatment week) was added if cumulative neutropenia precipitated treatment delays. Result(s): Thirty-one patients (21 men, 10 women) were treated. Eight had received prior chemotherapy, 27 prior RT. At dose level three, regular treatment delays of >=1 week due to slow neutrophil recovery occurred. Addition of G-CSF (dose level 3b) reduced treatment delays from 100 percent to 28 percent and decreased the incidence of Grade >=2 neutropenia and mucositis. Six of 7 patients at this dose level completed all 4 cycles of treatment and all received full dose RT (60 Gy). No other dose-limiting toxicities occurred. Of 22 assessable patients with locally recurrent SCCHN, 12 (55 percent) responded. Median time to progression in this group was 6 months, with median and one-year survival of 9.5 mos and 41 percent, respectively. Conclusion(s): Concurrent daily cisplatin/paclitaxel and split course hyperfractionated RT (60 Gy) is feasible in previously radiated patients.

PURPOSE: To compare life expectancy (LE) losses attributable to three imaging strategies for appendicitis in adults-computed tomography (CT), ultrasonography (US) followed by CT for negative or indeterminate US results, and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-by using a decision-analytic model., MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this model, for each imaging strategy, LE losses for 20-, 40-, and 65-year-old men and women were computed as a function of five key variables: baseline cohort LE, test performance, surgical mortality, risk of death from delayed diagnosis (missed appendicitis), and LE loss attributable to radiation-induced cancer death. Appendicitis prevalence, test performance, mortality rates from surgery and missed appendicitis, and radiation doses from CT were elicited from the published literature and institutional data. LE loss attributable to radiation exposure was projected by using a separate organ-specific model that accounted for anatomic coverage during a typical abdominopelvic CT examination. One- and two-way sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate effects of model input variability on results., RESULTS: Outcomes across imaging strategies differed minimally-for example, for 20-year-old men, corresponding LE losses were 5.8 days (MR imaging), 6.8 days (combined US and CT), and 8.2 days (CT). This order was sensitive to differences in test performance but was insensitive to variation in radiation-induced cancer deaths. For example, in the same cohort, MR imaging sensitivity had to be 91% at minimum (if specificity were 100%), and MR imaging specificity had to be 62% at minimum (if sensitivity were 100%) to incur the least LE loss. Conversely, LE loss attributable to radiation exposure would need to decrease by 74-fold for combined US and CT, instead of MR imaging, to incur the least LE loss., CONCLUSION: The specific imaging strategy used to diagnose appendicitis minimally affects outcomes. Paradigm shifts to MR imaging owing to concerns over radiation should be considered only if MR imaging test performance is very high.",Excluded
3124,"The consequences of treatment and disease in patients with primary CNS non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: cognitive function and performance status. North Central Cancer Treatment Group. Per protocol, patients with primary CNS non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in an intergroup phase II trial conducted by the North Central Cancer Treatment Group and the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group had their cognitive functions measured using the Folstein and Folstein Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) and their physical functions measured using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Score (PS) at study entry, at each treatment evaluation, and at quarterly intervals thereafter until disease progression or death. Of the 53 eligible participants who began therapy, 46 (87%) had baseline MMSE scores recorded, 36 (68%) had at least one follow-up MMSE, and 32 (60%) had both, while 52 (98%) had baseline PS, 49 (92%) had at least one follow-up PS, and 48 (91%) had both. Patterns of MMSE and PS values over time were studied in each individual, in the group as a whole, in the 20 patients who completed the study regimen, in the 23 who survived more than a year, and in patients who were classified as nonprogressors at each key evaluation. For each patient, all recorded values were plotted versus time, with dates of disease progression and death included, to look for signs of decline in cognitive or physical function preceding adverse events. Long-term declines in scores of both cognitive and physical function were observed in many treated patients with primary CNS non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Nearly all patients who were alive more than 52 weeks after study entry had a demonstrable decline in cognitive and physical functionality. Such declines may occur before disease progression is documented; they may also occur in some patients who have long-term follow-up without evidence of disease progression. Declining MMSE and PS was a poor predictor of disease progression. There was no association of PS and toxicity. The data from this study demonstrated the considerable difficulties we encountered conducting an ancillary study such as this within a multicenter clinical trial. Firstly, the test instruments written into the protocol were unable to tell if the declines seen were due to disease, treatment, co-morbidity, or other factors. Secondly, the missing data created difficulties in interpreting outcome.",Excluded
3428,"Preliminary Evidence That Cortical Amyloid Burden Predicts Poor Response to Antidepressant Medication Treatment in Cognitively Intact Individuals With Late-Life Depression. Objective: Amyloid accumulation, the pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, may predispose some older adults to depression and cognitive decline. Deposition of amyloid also occurs prior to the development of cognitive decline. It is unclear whether amyloid influences antidepressant outcomes in cognitively intact depressed elders. Design(s): A pharmacoimaging trial utilizing florbetapir (18F) PET scanning followed by 2 sequential 8-week antidepressant medication trials. Participant(s): Twenty-seven depressed elders who were cognitively intact on screening. Measurements and Interventions: After screening, diagnostic testing, assessment of depression severity and neuropsychological assessment, participants completed florbetapir (18F) PET scanning. They were then randomized to receive escitalopram or placebo for 8 weeks in a double-blinded two-to-one allocation rate. Individuals who did not respond to initial treatment transitioned to a second open-label trial of bupropion for another 8 weeks. Result(s): Compared with 22 amyloid-negative participants, 5 amyloid-positive participants exhibited significantly less change in depression severity and a lower likelihood of remission. In the initial blinded trial, 4 of 5 amyloid-positive participants were nonremitters (80%), while only 18% (4 of 22) of amyloid-negative participants did not remit (p = 0.017; Fisher's Exact test). In separate models adjusting for key covariates, both positive amyloid status (t = 3.07, 21 df, p = 0.003) and higher cortical amyloid binding by standard uptake value ratio (t = 2.62, 21 df, p = 0.010) were associated with less improvement in depression severity. Similar findings were observed when examining change in depression status across both antidepressant trials. Conclusion(s): In this preliminary study, amyloid status predicted poor antidepressant response to sequential antidepressant treatment. Alternative treatment approaches may be needed for amyloid-positive depressed elders.Copyright © 2020",Excluded
814,"Radioprotection of hematopoietic stem cells by interleukin-1. Radioprotective agents such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), when given prior to irradiation, protect animals from radiation damage. However, in vivo administration of these cytokines does not allow one to determine whether the protective effects act directly on the hematopoietic system. In the present study, we subjected male bone marrow cells to in vitro treatment with IL-1 prior to irradiation and bone marrow transplantation. We found that male bone marrow cells pretreated with IL-1 prior to irradiation increased the survival of irradiated female recipient mice when compared with nontreated irradiated marrow cells. In addition, irradiated female recipients that received IL-1-pretreated male donor bone marrow cells displayed an increased presence of male donor cells in their bone marrow, spleen, and thymus for up to 3 months posttransplant. Furthermore, serial transplantation studies revealed that male cells could only be detected in tertiary female recipients who received bone marrow from mice transplanted with IL-1-treated cells. These results indicate that IL-1 pretreatment protects both short-term and long-term repopulating stem cells from an irradiation insult and that these cells are capable of reconstituting the myeloid and lymphoid organs of recipient mice.",Excluded

1083,"Impact of the Number of Metastatic Tumors Treated by Stereotactic Radiosurgery on the Dose to Normal Brain: Implications for Brain Protection. PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the number of brain lesions for which stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) was performed on the dose volume relationships in normal brain., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Brain tissue was segmented using the patient's pre-SRS MRI. For each plan, the following data points were recorded: total brain volume, number of lesions treated, volume of brain receiving 8 Gy (V8), V10, V12, and V15., RESULTS: A total of 225 Gamma Knife R treatments were included in this retrospective analysis. The number of lesions treated ranged from 1 to 29. The isodose for prescription ranged from 40 to 95% (mean 55%). The mean prescription dose to tumor edge was 18 Gy. The mean coverage, selectivity, conformity, and gradient index were 97.5%, 0.63, 0.56, and 3.5, respectively. The mean V12 was 9.5 cm3 (ranging from 0.5 to 59.29). There was no correlation between the number of lesions and brain V8, V12, V10, or V15. There was a direct and statistically significant relationship between the brain volume treated (V8, V10, V12, and V15) and total volume of tumors treated (p < 0.001). In our study, the integral dose to the brain exceeded 3 J when the total tumor volume exceeded 25 cm3., CONCLUSIONS: The number of metastatic brain lesions treated bears no significant relationship to total brain tissue volume treated when using SRS. The fact that the integral dose to the brain exceeded 3 J when the total tumor volume exceeded 25 cm3 is useful for establishing guidelines. Although standard practice has favored using whole brain radiation therapy in patients with more than 4 lesions, a significant amount of normal brain tissue may be spared by treating these patients with SRS. SRS should be carefully considered in patients with multiple brain lesions, with the emphasis on total brain volume involved rather than the number of lesions to be treated. Copyright © 2017 S.

51,"Risk of covid-19 infection of a bariatric surgery cohort at the beginning of the pandemic. Background: Obesity is a known risk factor for COVID-19. The first case in New York was reported in March 1st, 2020 but it is believed that the virus was already spreading during the prior months. In our institution, bariatric surgery was carried out as usual until March 18th, at which time 92 cases of COVID-19 were already admitted. We believe that bariatric patients could have been exposed to COVID-19 during this overlap and sought to evaluate incidence of infection among this high-risk cohort at our institution. We sought to determine the incidence of COVID-19 in patients undergoing bariatric surgery during the preceding months of the pandemic. Method(s): This is a cross-sectional study from a single major bariatric center in the Bronx, New York. Patients who underwent bariatric surgery from January to March 2020 were included. Medical records were assessed looking COVID-19 symptoms and/or diagnosis. Additionally, phone interviews were made looking for COVID-19 symptoms and/or diagnosis outside our institution after the index operation. Result(s): A total of 203 patients were included. Eleven patients (5.4%) had post-op symptoms such as fever, cough and shortness of breath. Of those, 2 tested positive, 1 tested negative, 1 was diagnosed with X-ray findings, 6 were not tested and 1 had an alternate diagnosis. Additionally, 6 patients were tested negative without symptoms for different reasons. None of the patients identified had a severe disease.

2096,"Clinical outcome of stereotactic body radiotherapy for primary and oligometastatic lung tumors: A single institutional study with almost uniform dose with different five treatment schedules. Background: To evaluate clinical outcomes of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for localized primary and oligometastatic lung tumors by assessing efficacy and safety of 5 regimens of varying fraction size and number. Method(s): One-hundred patients with primary lung cancer (n = 69) or oligometastatic lung tumors (n = 31), who underwent SBRT between May 2003 and August 2010, were included. The median age was 75 years (range, 45-88). Of them, 98 were judged to have medically inoperable disease, predominantly due to chronic illness or advanced age. SBRT was performed using 3 coplanar and 3 non-coplanar fixed beams with a standard linear accelerator. Fraction sizes were escalated by 1 Gy, and number of fractions given was decreased by 1 for every 20 included patients. Total target doses were between 50 and 56 Gy, administered as 5-9 fractions. The prescribed dose was defined at the isocenter, and median overall treatment duration was 10 days (range, 5-22). Result(s): The median follow-up was 51.1 months for survivors. The 3-year local recurrence rates for primary lung cancer and oligometastasis was 6 % and 3 %, respectively. The 3-year local recurrence rates for tumor sizes <=3 cm and >3 cm were 3 % and 14 %, respectively (p = 0.124). Additionally, other factors (fraction size, total target dose, and BED10) were not significant predictors of local control. Radiation pneumonia (>= grade 2) was observed in 2 patients. Radiation-induced rib fractures were observed in 22 patients. Other late adverse events of greater than grade 2 were not observed. Conclusion(s): Within this dataset, we did not observe a dose response in BED10 values between 86.4 and 102.6 Gy.

838,"Increased protoporphyrin IX accumulation does not improve the effect of photodynamic therapy for actinic keratosis: a randomized controlled trial. Background: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with methyl aminolaevulinate (MAL) is highly effective for treating actinic keratosis (AK) on the face/scalp, but less effective on the extremities. Insufficient accumulation of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) may cause these inferior efficacy rates. However, it is possible to increase PpIX accumulation by extending the MAL application time and/or pretreating the skin with curettage. Objective(s): To investigate whether increased PpIX accumulation improves the effect of MAL-PDT for AKs in a randomized intra-individual study. Method(s): Twenty-two patients with 533 AKs on both hands were treated with MAL-PDT. To obtain different concentrations of PpIX, four symmetrical areas on each patient were randomly allocated to different regimens: (i) 3-h MAL application without prior curettage (3hC-); (ii) 3 h with curettage (3hC+); (iii) 21 h without curettage (21hC-); and (iv) 21 h with curettage (21hC+). Treatment efficacy was evaluated after 3 months, whereas PpIX fluorescence, pain and erythema were assessed during and after PDT. Result(s): Extended MAL application with and without curettage increased PpIX accumulation significantly compared with the standard 3hC+ regimen (P = 0.001 and P = 0.002, respectively). However, the median total clearance rates did not improve accordingly: 3hC+ (55.0%), 21hC- (55.0%) and 21hC+ (53.6%). Conversely, insufficient PpIX accumulation in the 3hC- regimen led to a significantly lower clearance rate (33.3%) than the other regimens (P < 0.045). Furthermore, pain and erythema were correlated to PpIX accumulation. Conclusion(s): Increased PpIX accumulation does not improve the effect of MAL-PDT for AKs on the hands, but leads to worse adverse events. Different strategies are needed to improve PDT on the extremities.Copyright © 2016 British Association of Dermatologists",Excluded

PURPOSE: To demonstrate superiority of intravitreal ranibizumab 0.5 mg compared to focal and peripheral laser treatment in patients with radiation retinopathy for choroidal melanoma., METHODS: Inclusion criteria were as follows: patients with radiation retinopathy and visual acuity impairment due to radiation maculopathy accessible for laser therapy, age >= 18 years, and BCVA less than 20/32. The main objective was to study the change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) over 6 months from ranibizumab 0.5 mg (experimental) compared to focal laser of the macula and panretinal laser treatment of the ischemic retina (control) in patients with radiation retinopathy in choroidal melanoma. The secondary objectives of the radiation retinopathy study were to compare functional and anatomical results between ranibizumab and laser group over 12 months and to measure the frequency of vitreous hemorrhage and rubeosis iridis., RESULTS: The intention-to-treat analysis included 31 patients assigned to ranibizumab (n = 15) or laser treatment (n = 16). In terms of BCVA at month 6, ranibizumab was superior to laser treatment, with an advantage of 0.14 logMAR, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.25, p = 0.030. The positive effect of ranibizumab disappeared after treatment was discontinued. Similar results without statistically significant difference were found with respect to macular thickness. In both groups, no change was observed at month 6 in the size of ischemia in the macula or periphery compared to baseline. There was 1 case of vitreous hemorrhage in the laser group and no case of rubeosis iridis over time., CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a statistically significant improvement in visual acuity and clear superiority of ranibizumab compared to laser treatment up to 26 weeks, but this effect disappeared at week 52 after completion of intravitreal treatment.

Background(s): Coronary CTA provides increasingly reliable image quality, but the associated radiation exposure can be high. Method(s): Seventy-five patients with suspected coronary artery disease and in sinus rhythm were screened for participation. After exclusion of 25 patients for body weight >100 kg or failure to lower heart rate to <=60 beats/min, 50 patients were studied by prospectively ECG-triggered high-pitch spiral computed tomography (CT). Coronary CTA was performed using a dual-source CT system with 2 x 128 x 0.6-mm collimation, 0.28-s rotation time, a pitch of 3.4, 100-kVp tube voltage, and current of 320 mA. Data acquisition was prospectively triggered at 60% of the R-R interval and completed within 1 cardiac cycle. Diagnostic accuracy for detection of coronary artery stenoses <50% diameter stenosis was determined by comparison to invasive coronary angiography. Per-patient diagnostic performance was the primary form of analysis. Result(s): In all 50 patients (34 males, 59 +/- 12 years of age), imaging was successful.

1799,"Volumetric mapping of bound and pore water as well as collagen protons in cortical bone using 3D ultrashort echo time cones MR imaging techniques. Cortical bone assessment using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has recently received great attention in an effort to avoid the potential harm associated with ionizing radiation-based techniques. Ultrashort echo time MRI (UTE-MRI) techniques can acquire signal from major hydrogen proton pools in cortical bone, including bound and pore water, as well as from the collagen matrix. This study aimed to develop and evaluate the feasibility of a technique for mapping bound water, pore water, and collagen proton densities in human cortical bone ex vivo and in vivo using three-dimensional UTE Cones (3D-UTE-Cones) MRI. Eight human tibial cortical bone specimens (63+/-19years old) were scanned using 3D-UTE-Cones sequences on a clinical 3T MRI scanner and a micro-computed tomography (muCT) scanner. Total, bound, and pore water proton densities (TWPD, BWPD, and PWPD, respectively) were measured using UTE and inversion recovery UTE (IR-UTE) imaging techniques. Macromolecular proton density (MMPD), a collagen representation, was measured using TWPD and macromolecular fraction (MMF) obtained from two-pool UTE magnetization transfer (UTE-MT) modeling. The correlations between proton densities and muCT-based measures were investigated. The 3D-UTE-Cones techniques were further applied on ten young healthy (34+/-3years old) and five old (78+/-6years old) female volunteers to evaluate the techniques' feasibility for translational clinical applications. In the ex vivo study, PWPD showed the highest correlations with bone porosity and bone mineral density (BMD) (R=0.79 and -0.70, p<0.01). MMPD demonstrated moderate to strong correlations with bone porosity and BMD (R=-0.67 and 0.65, p<0.01). MMPD showed strong correlation with age in specimens from female donors (R=-0.91, p=0.03, n=5). The presented comprehensive 3D-UTE-Cones imaging protocol allows quantitative mapping of protons in major pools of cortical bone ex vivo and in vivo. PWPD and MMPD can serve as potential novel biomarkers to assess bone matrix and microstructure, as well as bone age- or injury-related variations. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The practiced subjects experienced lessening dizziness and ataxia within and over sessions. Their response to the new perceptual situation was markedly less than the control group (p less than 0.001). Assessment of ""adaptability,"" in addition to the provocative vestibular tests now in use, may improve prediction of susceptibility to the space adaptation syndrome.

Purpose/Objective(s): Due to the difficulties of air tissue interface interactions as well as the close proximity to the optical apparatus, tumors in the PNS region treated with IMRT may have increased local failure and higher complications. The clinical outcome of patients treated with IMRT for PNS malignancies are reported. Materials/Methods: Between May 2001 and June 2008, 31 patients with PNS malignancies were treated with IMRT to a median dose of 60 Gy in 30 fractions. There were 13 males and 18 females, with median age 68 years. Seventeen (59%) patients had AJCC stage III/IV disease at presentation. Twenty one of 31 patients presented with clinical stage N0 neck disease. Elective nodal irradiation (ENI) is not considered due to low incidence of lymph node metastases among these patients. Histology was: 14 squamous cell, 3 adenocarcinoma, 3 adenoid cystic, 6 mucosal melanoma, 5 others. The base of skull was treated in 3 patients with perineural invasion. Median RT dose values to optic apparatus were: Optic chiasm Dmax 22 Gy (range: 1-48); right and left optic nerve Dmax were 39, 37 Gy (range: 2-62; 2-65) and right, left parotid glands were 17; 25 Gy (range: 7-30; 5-53) respectively.

The study, involving 100 patients, was able to demonstrate that the increase in radiation dose to the patient when using an anti-scatter grid for AP shoulder examinations is not justified by the improved image quality. A poor level of inter-rater reliability between the consultants scoring the lateral cervical spine images prevented a firm conclusion from being reached. The fact that all images were of diagnostic quality, however, suggested that the use of the anti-scatter grid was unnecessary. Following completion of the project the hospital involved was informed of all findings. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.",Excluded
362,"Association of clinical response and long-term outcome among patients with biopsied orbital pseudotumor receiving modern radiation therapy. Purpose: To retrospectively evaluate institutional outcomes for patients treated with modern radiation therapy (RT) for biopsied orbital pseudotumor (OP). Methods and Materials: Twenty patients (26 affected orbits) with OP were treated with RT between January 2002 and December 2011. All patients underwent biopsy with histopathologic exclusion of other disease processes. Sixteen patients (80%) were treated with intensity modulated RT, 3 (15%) with opposed lateral beams, and 1 (5%) with electrons. Median RT dose was 27 Gy (range 25.2-30.6 Gy). Response to RT was evaluated at 4 months post-RT. Partial response (PR) was defined as improvement in orbital symptoms without an increase in steroid dose. Complete response (CR) 1 and CR 2 were defined as complete resolution of orbital symptoms with reduction in steroid dose (CR 1) or complete tapering of steroids (CR 2). The median follow-up period was 18.6 months (range 4-81.6 months). Result(s): Seventeen patients (85%) demonstrated response to RT, with 7 (35%), 1 (5%), and 9 (45%) achieving a PR, CR 1, and CR 2, respectively. Of the 17 patients who had >=PR at 4 months post-RT, 6 (35%) experienced recurrence of symptoms. Age (>46 years vs <=46 years, P=.04) and clinical response to RT (CR 2 vs CR 1/PR, P=.05) were significantly associated with pseudotumor recurrence. Long-term complications were seen in 7 patients (35%), including 4 with cataract formation, 1 with chronic dry eye, 1 with enophthalmos, and 1 with keratopathy. Conclusion(s): RT is an effective treatment for improving symptoms and tapering steroids in patients with a biopsy supported diagnosis of OP. Older age and complete response to RT were associated with a significantly reduced probability of symptom recurrence. The observed late complications may be related to RT, chronic use of steroids/immunosuppressants, medical comorbidities, or combination of factors. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Objective: To study the efficacy of coumarin/troxerutine for the protection of salivary glands and mucosa during irradiation. Design(s): Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. Setting(s): University hospital, Germany. Patient(s): 48 patients who had radiotherapy to the head and neck. Main Outcome Measure(s): Salivary gland scintigraphy and acute side-effects of radiotherapy (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) score). Result(s): 23 patients (11 experimental, 12 placebo) completed the study. The global efficacy measure combining scintigraphy and RTOG score favoured the experimental arm (P=0.07). The RTOG score showed significantly fewer acute side-effects of radiation in the experimental arm (P<0.05).

1076,"A phase II trial of accelerated multimodality therapy for locoregionally advanced cancer of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction: The impact of clinical heterogeneity. OBJECTIVES: This is a report of mature results from a phase II trial of an accelerated multimodality treatment program for locoregionally advanced cancer of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction with a focus on the impact of clinical heterogeneity on outcomes. A split course of pre- and postoperative hyperfractionated radiation therapy and concurrent chemotherapy was used in an effort to limit perioperative mortality. METHOD(S): Eligibility required a diagnosis of esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer and an esophageal ultrasound stage of at least T3, N1, or M1A. Patients received a 12-day induction course of radiation (1.5 Gy twice a dose to a dose of 30 Gy) concurrent with 4-day continuous intravenous infusions of cisplatin (20 mg/m per day) and 5-fluorouracil (1000 mg/m per day) beginning on day 1. Surgery followed in 4 to 6 weeks followed 6 to 10 weeks later by a second, identical course of chemoradiotherapy. RESULT(S): From October 1999 through March 2003, 93 patients were enrolled; 96% were white, 86% male, and 83% had adenocarcinoma. Resection was possible in 83 patients (89%) with 4 (5%) perioperative deaths. With a median follow up of 50 months (range, 34-72 months), the 3-year projected overall survival rate is 27.9%, freedom from recurrence 30.5%, and distant metastatic control 32.4%. Locoregional control in resected patients is 86%. Freedom from recurrence and distant control were significantly better in patients with 1) earlier pretreatment clinical stage, 2) earlier postinduction pathologic stage, 3) squamous cell cancer, and 4) a pathologic response. CONCLUSION(S): This accelerated multimodality treatment program is feasible and perioperative mortality proved acceptable. Despite excellent locoregional control, freedom from recurrence, and overall survival proved disappointing reflecting the frequency of distant metastases. Heterogeneity in patient populations makes comparisons with similar nonrandomized experiences problematic. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",Excluded

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate head CT protocol developed to improve visibility of the brainstem and cerebellum, lower bone-related artefacts in the posterior fossa and maintain patient radioprotection., METHODS: A paired comparison of head CT performed without Adaptive Statistical Iterative Reconstruction (ASiR) and a clinically indicated follow-up with 40 % ASiR was acquired in one group of 55 patients. Patients were scanned in the axial mode with different scanner settings for the brain and the posterior fossa. Objective image quality analysis was performed with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). Subjective image quality analysis was based on brain structure visibility and evaluation of the artefacts., RESULTS: We achieved 19 % reduction of total DLP and significantly better image quality of posterior fossa structures. SNR for white and grey matter in the cerebellum were 34 % to 36 % higher, respectively, CNR was improved by 142 % and subjective analyses were better for images with ASiR., CONCLUSIONS: When imaging parameters are set independently for the brain and the posterior fossa imaging, ASiR has a great potential to improve CT performance: image quality of the brainstem and cerebellum is improved, and radiation dose for the brain as well as total radiation dose are reduced., KEY POINTS: *With ASiR it is possible to lower radiation dose or improve image quality *Sequentional imaging allows setting scan parameters for brain and posterior-fossa independently *We improved visibility of brainstem structures and decreased radiation dose *Total radiation dose (DLP) was decreased by 19.",Excluded

We evaluate the efficacy and safety of CyberKnife treatment in the management of metastatic cancer to the pituitary grand. PATIENTS 13 pituitary metastases (male 6, female 7). Age 47y-69y (median 53y). KPS 70. No previous irradiation. METHOD(S): Treatment system: CyberKnife (G3 or G4), Planning system: On target, Multiplan (Accuray), Calculation model: Ray tracing, Inverse algorithm, Immobilaization: thermoplastic mask, Image: CECT 1mm in thickness + MRI Gd T1WI 1-3mm in thickness, PTV = CTV = GTV, Verification: TLS (Target locating system), 6 axis correction. TREATMENT PROTOCOL: Marginal dose: D95PTV 95%, iso-dose line 80% (goal), Fractions: tumor size, adjacent to OAR (organs at risk), Tolerable dose of optic appratus: 12Gy (SRS), 21Gy (3fr.), 25Gy (5fr.), 28Gy (7fr.). Tumor volume (PTV): 0.5-18.2 cc (median 2.8 cc), Primary origin: Breast 5, Lung 2, Others 6. Clinical symptom: visual disturbance 11 (85%), diabetes insipidus 5 (38%), diplopia 1 (7.7%), asymptomatic 1 (7.7%). Marginal dose: 18-35 Gy (median 23Gy). RESULT(S): Follow up periods 4-31months. Progression free survival: 81.8% (@6m), 63.6% (@12m), 54.5% (@24m). Overall survival: 92.3% (@3m), 84.6% (@6m), 67.3% (@12m), 25.6% (@24m).

In this case, maximum dose for optic apparatus BED2 (Gy) was 229 Gy (highest). CONCLUSION(S): These preliminary results seem to indicate that CyberKnife SRT is a safe, effective and palliative treatment for most patients with pituitary metastasis. To prevent radiation induced optic neuropathy, maximum dose for optic apparatus BED2 (Gy) is under 126 Gy (single dose equivalent: 15Gy).

299,"Narrow-band ultraviolet B radiation induces the expression of beta-endorphin in human skin in vivo. BACKGROUND: Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) from the sun and solaria has addictive properties that may develop into dependence. In mice, UVR addiction was connected to beta-endorphin (beta-END) formed in the skin after UVR exposure. In humans, the formation of beta-END in skin keratinocytes has not been confirmed in vivo., OBJECTIVE: To determine with immunohistochemistry if sub-erythematous narrow-band UV-B (NB-UV-B) exposures stimulate p53 mediated expression of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), beta-END and alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) in human skin keratinocytes in vivo., METHODS: Within 12 healthy volunteers, 7 received a single 1 standard erythema dose (SED) of NB-UV-B on their whole body, and 5 volunteers received a cumulative dose of 3 SED delivered on two subsequent days i.e., 1+2 SED. Skin biopsies were taken immediately before the first exposure and at 24h from the last UV-B exposure to assess p53, beta-END, POMC, and alpha-MSH expression., RESULTS: Nuclear p53 expression increased in all samples taken at 24h after NB-UV-B exposure. UV-B irradiation also increased epidermal beta-END expression in 11 out of 12 samples taken at 24h after UV-B exposure. The brownish staining was localized in the cytoplasm of keratinocytes and around the nuclei, being more pronounced in the basal cell layers. POMC and alpha-MSH staining showed no obvious meaningful increase since only one section of each showed any change compared with basal levels., CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to show that UV-B exposures increase beta-END expression in epidermal keratinocytes of human skin in vivo, which could be the link to proposed UVR addiction.

426,"Joint echinococcosis: A report of three new cases. Background Joint hydatidosis is defined as the development within the joint of multiple cysts that are the larval form of the tapeworm echinococcus granulosus. Bone and joint cysts account for less than 0.5% of all hydatid cysts in human. We report three cases of joint hydatidosis. Results Case 1: A 63-year-old woman, who was operated 4 times for lung and liver cyst hydatidosis, was complaining of right inflammatory lumbosciatica S1. Examination revealed pain when pressing the sacral region. X-rays revealed a heterogeneous lesion of the right sacrum. Computed tomography showed an eleven-mm diameter cyst in the right buttock joint with an anterior development into the pelvic cavity. Muscles were not involved. Surgical enucleation of the cysts was performed. Histopathologic examination showed germinative membranes of the hydatid cyst confirming the diagnosis. Case 2: A 35 year old man with history of right hip pain for the past 5 years and a progressive loss of motion range. Examination found a painful and restricted right hip movement in all directions. X-rays and computed tomography scan showed bone destruction of the hip, multiple cysts and ectopic calcifications around the joint. Serological test for hydatid disease was positive (1/280), confirming the diagnosis of hip hydatidosis. Case 3: A 39 year old women with history of liver hydatid cyst treated with surgery 14 years ago, was complaining of right shoulder pain for the past year. Examination revealed diffuse swelling of right shoulder with painful and restricted movement in all directions. X-rays showed multiple cysts of the shoulder with pathological fracture of the humerus diaphysis. MRI and hydatid serological test confirmed the diagnosis. Conclusions Hydatid cysts still occur in Tunisia despite prevention programs. The liver and the lung are the most frequent targets. The joint involvement is uncommon but severe. Joint contamination is usually local from bone lesion and rarely by blood or lymph vessels. Surgical excision of cysts is the main treatment but recurrence is possible particularly at proximal joint that are difficult to access.",Excluded
1265,"First in vivo head-to-head comparison of high-definition versus standard-definition stent imaging with 64-slice computed tomography. The aim of this study was to compare image quality characteristics from 64-slice high definition (HDCT) versus 64-slice standard definition CT (SDCT) for coronary stent imaging. In twenty-five stents of 14 patients, undergoing contrast-enhanced CCTA both on 64-slice SDCT (LightSpeedVCT, GE Healthcare) and HDCT (Discovery HD750, GE Healthcare), radiation dose, contrast, noise and stent characteristics were assessed. Two blinded observers graded stent image quality (score 1 = no, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe artefacts). All scans were reconstructed with increasing contributions of adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) blending (0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 %). Image quality was significantly superior in HDCT versus SDCT (score 1.7 +/- 0.5 vs. 2.7 +/- 0.7; p < 0.05). Image noise was significantly higher in HDCT compared to SDCT irrespective of ASIR contributions (p < 0.05). Addition of 40 % ASIR or more reduced image noise significantly in both HDCT and SDCT. In HDCT in-stent luminal attenuation was significantly lower and mean measured in-stent luminal diameter was significantly larger (1.2 +/- 0.4 mm vs. 0.8 +/- 0.4 mm; p < 0.05) compared to SDCT. Radiation dose from HDCT was comparable to SDCT (1.8 +/- 0.7 mSv vs. 1.7 +/- 0.7 mSv; p = ns). Use of HDCT for coronary stent imaging reduces partial volume artefacts from stents yielding improved image quality versus SDCT at a comparable radiation dose.",Excluded
3282,"Malignant melanoma and other second cutaneous malignancies in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The influence of additional therapy after total skin electron beam radiation. BACKGROUND: Previous large studies have shown that patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma are at increased risk for basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, and anecdotal case reports have suggested an association with malignant melanoma. It has been postulated that the exposure of cutaneous structures to potentially carcinogenic therapies, such as ionizing radiation or alkylating agents, might be causally associated with the development of these second cutaneous malignancies, but, to date, no study has directly addressed this issue. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of second cutaneous malignancies in a group of patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma treated with total skin electron beam therapy and to examine the additional effects of oral psoralen with UV-A phototherapy, topical mechlorethamine hydrochloride therapy, and further radiation therapy. One hundred sixty-four patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma who had received total skin electron beam therapy between 1974 and 1990 were identified, and information was abstracted from their records., RESULTS: Six patients developed malignant melanoma 12 to 95 months after total skin electron beam therapy. Of the six patients, three had received oral psoralen with UV-A as additional therapy and two had received topical mechlorethamine. None had received additional radiation therapy. Twenty-four patients developed more than 37 basal cell carcinomas and 34 squamous cell carcinomas from 11 months to more than 10 years after total skin electron beam therapy. Of the 24 patients, 15 had received oral psoralen with UV-A and 12 had received mechlorethamine as additional therapy. Additional radiation therapy had been administered to nine patients. During a median follow-up of 6 years, no patients died of any second cutaneous malignancy., CONCLUSION: We found a high rate of both melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer. The additional use of mechlorethamine or oral psoralen plus UV-A, but not radiation, was significantly associated with the development of basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, but not malignant melanoma.",Excluded
2320,"Concomitant cisplatin and radiotherapy in a conventional and modified fractionation schedule in locally advanced head and neck cancer: A randomised phase II EORTC trial. A randomised phase II trial was initiated to explore the feasibility of concomitant cisplatin and radiotherapy with conventional fractionation (CF) or multiple fractions per day (MFD) for patients with locally advanced head and neck malignancies. The MFD schedule was designed to achieve higher tumour concentrations of cisplatin at the time of irradiation by reducing the number of radiation treatment weeks from 7 to 3, allowing recovery from side-effects of both irradiation and cystostatic drugs during the rest periods, while keeping the same total dose and overall treatment time. Patients were randomised between a conventional fractionation scheme (CF) of 70 Gy in 7 weeks with 2 Gy per fraction with a daily dose of 6 mg/m2 cisplatin and a modified fractionation scheme (MFD) delivering three fractions of 1.6 Gy per day, in weeks 1, 4 and 7, keeping the same overall treatment time and total dose. In the modified treatment regime, a daily dose of 10 mg/m2 cisplatin was administered. 53 patients were entered in this trial and radiotherapy was given according to the schedule to all patients in both treatment arms. Cisplatin was given during the whole course of radiotherapy to only one quarter of the patients in the CF arm, stopping mostly after 5-6 weeks due to bone marrow depression and kidney toxicity, while patients in the MFD arm received it according to schedule. No difference was observed in acute and late toxicity in both treatment arms, while a similar or even better tumour response was obtained with MFD. A 67% higher daily dose of cisplatin concomitant with irradiation could be given in a 3-week multiple fractionation per day schedule, as opposed to the cisplatin given in the conventional daily fractionation schedule of 7 weeks with the same total radiation dose. Similar acute and late toxicities were seen in both treatment arms. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2397,"Pleomorphic adenomas: post-operative radiotherapy is unnecessary following primary incomplete excision: a retrospective review. BACKGROUND: Current standard treatment of Pleomorphic Salivary Adenoma (PSA) of the Parotid Gland is by surgical excision. The management of incomplete excision remains undecided with post-operative radiotherapy advocated by some and observation by others., METHODS: 190 patients who underwent resection of PSA of the parotid gland within the West of Scotland region from 1981 to 2008 were identified and data collected., RESULTS: 78/190 patients had a primary incomplete excision. 25/78 received post-operative radiotherapy and 53 were observed. Recurrences occurred in 11/53 in those observed and in 1/25 of those who received radiotherapy. 21/25 complained of significant side effects from the radiotherapy. 38 surgeons performed 190 procedures, with a range of experience from 1 to28 procedures., CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy does appear to reduce recurrence with incomplete excision, however it is associated with significant side effects. We therefore feel radiotherapy should not be routinely recommended. Subspecialisation should be adopted to increase the operating surgeon's experience.

298,"Phase 2 study of preoperative image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy to reduce wound and combined modality morbidities in lower extremity soft tissue sarcoma. BACKGROUND: This study sought to determine if preoperative image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IG-IMRT) can reduce morbidity, including wound complications, by minimizing dose to uninvolved tissues in adults with lower extremity soft tissue sarcoma. METHOD(S): The primary endpoint was the development of an acute wound complication (WC). IG-IMRT was used to conform volumes to avoid normal tissues (skin flaps for wound closure, bone, or other uninvolved soft tissues). From July 2005 to June 2009, 70 adults were enrolled; 59 were evaluable for the primary endpoint. Median tumor size was 9.5 cm; 55 tumors (93%) were high-grade and 58 (98%) were deep to fascia. RESULT(S): Eighteen (30.5%) patients developed WCs. This was not statistically significantly different from the result of the National Cancer Institute of Canada SR2 trial (P =.2); however, primary closure technique was possible more often (55 of 59 patients [93.2%] versus 50 of 70 patients [71.4%]; P =.002), and secondary operations for WCs were somewhat reduced (6 of 18 patients [33%] versus 13 of 30 patients [43%]; P =.55). Moderate edema, skin, subcutaneous, and joint toxicity was present in 6 (11.1%), 1 (1.9%), 5 (9.3%), and 3 (5.6%) patients, respectively, but there were no bone fractures. Four local recurrences (6.8%, none near the flaps) occurred with median follow-up of 49 months. CONCLUSION(S): The 30.5% incidence of WCs was numerically lower than the 43% risk derived from the National Cancer Institute of Canada SR2 trial, but did not reach statistical significance. Preoperative IG-IMRT significantly diminished the need for tissue transfer. RT chronic morbidities and the need for subsequent secondary operations for WCs were lowered, although not significantly, whereas good limb function was maintained.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of 90Y-DOTATOC and 131I-MIBG in treatment of metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). METHOD(S): Twelve histologically confirmed patients with metastatic MTC were included. All patients underwent both 111In-DTPA-octreotide imaging and 131I/ 123I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) imaging. According to the results of the combined imaging, positive patients were selected to be treated with 90Y-DOTA-D-Phe1-Tyr3-octreotide (90Y-DOTATOC) or 131I-MIBG, respectively. The therapeutic procedures of targeted internal radiation were performed with 3.33 GBq 90Y-DOTATOC at 6-week intervals, or 11.1 GBq 131I-MIBG with a minimum interval of three months. RESULT(S): The imaging procedure was positive in all 12 patients: 111In-DTPA-octreotide imaging in eight patients, 131I/ 123I-MIBG imaging in six patients. According to the results of combined imaging, we identified four patients to be treated with 90Y-DOTATOC, and five patients with 131 I-MIBG. After three to five sessions of treatment, three patients with partial remission and six with stable disease were observed. The effective rate was 3/9 (33.3%) and the overall tumor response rate was 9/9 (100%). No relevant toxicity was observed.

The treatment with 90Y-DOTATOC or 131I-MIBG is well tolerated and may improve the fate of patients with metastatic MTC.",Excluded
417,"Clinical features and prognostic factors in patients with bone metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma after liver transplantation. BACKGROUND: Little is known about the clinical features and prognostic factors of bone metastases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following liver transplantation (LT)., METHODS: All adult patients undergoing LT from 2001 to 2010 were reviewed. Patients with HCC bone metastases after LT received external beam radiotherapy(EBRT) during this period. Demographic variables, laboratory values, and tumor characteristics were determined before LT and EBRT. Total radiation dose ranged from 8 to 60 Gy(median dose 40.0 Gy)., RESULTS: The trunk was the most common site of bone metastases with finding of expansile soft-tissue masses in 23.3% of patients. Overall pain relief from EBRT occurred in 96.7% (29/30). No consistent dose-response relationship was found for palliation of with doses between 30 and 56 Gy (P = 0.670). The median survivals from the time of bone metastases was 8.6 months. On univariate and multivariate analyses, better survival was significantly associated with a better Karnofsky performance status (KPS) and well-controlled intrahepatic tumor, but not with lower alpha-fetoprotein levels. The median time from LT to bone metastases was 7.1 months. Patients exceeding the Shanghai criteria presented with bone metastases earlier than those within the Fudan criteria. Patients with soft-tissue extension always had later bone metastases. The majority of deaths were caused by liver failure due to hepatic decompensation or tumor progression., CONCLUSION: The prognostic factors of bone metastases of HCC following LT are KPS and well-controlled intrahepatic.

Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia (ataxia-telangiectasia-like syndrome [AOA]; MIM 208920) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by ataxia, oculomotor apraxia, and choreoathetosis. These neurological features resemble those of ataxia-telangiectasia (AT), but in AOA there are none of the extraneurological features of AT, such as immunodeficiency, neoplasia, chromosomal instability, or sensitivity to ionizing radiation. It is unclear whether these patients have a true disorder of chromosomal instability or a primary neurodegenerative syndrome, and it has not been possible to identify the defective gene in AOA, since the families have been too small for linkage analysis. We have identified a new family with AOA, and we show that the patients have no evidence of chromosomal instability or sensitivity to ionizing radiation, suggesting that AOA in this family is a true primary cerebellar ataxia. We have localized the disease gene, by linkage analysis and homozygosity mapping, to a 15.9-cM interval on chromosome 9q34. This work will ultimately allow the disease gene to be identified and its relevance to other types of autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias to be determined.",Excluded
848,"Increased metabolic activity in the spinal cord of patients with long-standing Lhermitte's sign. PURPOSE: To investigate the pathophysiology of the radiation-induced, chronic Lhermitte's sign (LS) on the basis of long-standing case histories with partial functional recovery., PATIENTS AND METHODS: As radiotherapy in two nasopharyngeal cancer patients, a biologically effective dose (BED) of 103.8 Gy(2) (case 1) and 94.8 Gy(2) (case 2) was delivered to the cervical spinal cord. Neurologic signs relating to the irradiated spinal cord segments developed after 2 months (case 1) and 5 years (case 2), with radiation-induced damage equivalent to grade 3 (case 1) and grade 2 (case 2) toxicity (Common Toxicity Criteria, Version 2.0). The clinical status improved to grade 2 (case 1) and grade 1 (case 2). Positron emission tomography (PET) and fibroblast clonogen assay were applied 25 and 7 years postirradiation, respectively, to characterize this rare clinical picture., RESULTS: PET demonstrated increased [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) accumulation and [(15)O]butanol perfusion, but negligible [(11)C]methionine uptake in the irradiated spinal cord segments in both patients. In clonogenic assays, fibroblasts from case 1 displayed much higher radiation sensitivity than in healthy controls, while in case 2 the fibroblasts sensitivity was normal., CONCLUSIONS: These data suggests a close direct relationship between regional perfusion and metabolism of the spinal cord, similarly as in the brain. The postirradiation recovery may be related to energy-demanding conduction, explaining the increased metabolism and perfusion. The increased radiosensitivity and higher spinal cord BED may have contributed to the more severe sequelae in case 1.",Excluded
181,"Oblique corpectomy for treatment of cervical spine epidural abscesses: Report on four cases. Background Spinal epidural abscesses (SEAs) in cervical locations are particularly life-threatening. Currently, SEAs are widely treated with bony decompression, followed by internal stabilization in purulent osteomyelitis. However, recently, a growing number of studies have reported minimally invasive approaches without internal fixation. Purpose We describe four patients with cervical SEAs that were evacuated by oblique corpectomy (OC) without fusion. Methods This study included two women and two men (aged 44-90) that received operations for removing ventral cervical SEAs. All patients presented with progressively increasing myelopathy, and 3 had severe comorbid conditions. In all cases, a multilevel OC without fusion was performed. The amount of bone resection was tailored to fit the needs of granulation removal, with an effort to retain as much of the vertebral bodies as possible. Then, pus was evacuated and debridement of granulation was performed, followed by rinsing and drainage. Results The neurological status of 3 patients improved significantly after surgery. At the last follow-up examination, one showed full recovery, and in two a minor residual deficit persisted. During mean follow-up of 5.5 years, no internal stabilization was necessary. The oldest patient was tetraplegic, and had several concomitant diseases. That patient died from sudden cardiac arrest on the third postoperative day. Oblique corpectomy did not affect the anterior or posterior column. Additionally, it provided a broad view of the ventral aspect of the spinal canal. Conclusions Oblique corpectomy allows appropriate spinal cord decompression and granulation removal in the case of cervical spine epidural abscess, without sacrificing spinal stability.Copyright © 2016",Excluded

OBJECTIVESFollowing trimodality treatment for superior sulcus tumours (SSTs), the 5-year survival rate has significantly improved. Quality of life and potential negative effects of this strategy have become more important. The objective of this study was to investigate the quality of life and the arm and shoulder function after the resection of superior sulcus tumours following neoadjuvant chemoradiation.METHODSPatients were selected from a thoracic surgery database. Between January 2002 and December 2010, 72 patients received trimodality treatment of whom 39 were alive at the start of this study in 2010. The following arm function tests were used: nine-hole peg test, range of motion test and action research arm test. Quality of life was assessed using the Disability of the arm and shoulder and SF-36 questionnaires. Analyses of the arm function were conducted comparing the treated side with the untreated side. For quality of life, patients treated on their dominant side were compared with those treated on their non-dominant side.RESULTSIn total, 19 patients participated in this study (15 men and 4 women). The median age was 59 years (range 39-73), median radiation dose 50 Gy (range 39-66) and median follow-up 40 months (range 4-101). There was no statistically significant difference in arm and shoulder function between the treated and the untreated arm. However, statistically significantly less pain was found if patients were treated on their dominant side.CONCLUSIONSAfter the resection of SSTs following chemoradiotherapy, the arm and shoulder function on the affected side is comparable with the functions at the contralateral side. Patients treated for an SST on their dominant side are less affected in their quality of life regarding pain compared with those treated on their non-dominant side. © 2012 The Author.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): Retrospective review of patients with thyroid nodules from six referral centers from 2006 to 2010. A total of 3313 adult patients with thyroid nodules and confirmed benign or malignant thyroid diagnoses were included. Result(s): Mean patient age was 54.2 (18-97) years, and the majority were women (n = 2635, 79.8%). A total of 3241 nodules were analyzed, 335 (10.3%) of which were malignant. Thyroid nodule location was an independent risk factor in predicting thyroid cancer (p = 0.005). Thyroid cancer odds were highest in the isthmus (odds ratio [OR] = 2.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6-3.6, p < 0.0001). In a multivariate regression model adjusting for age, sex, family history of thyroid cancer, radiation exposure, nodule size, and American College of Radiology (ACR) TI-RADS (Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System) score, the isthmus nodules had the highest risk of malignancy (OR = 2.4 [CI 1.5-3.9], p = 0.0007), followed by upper thyroid nodules (OR = 1.8 [CI 1.2-2.7], p = 0.005) and then middle thyroid nodules (OR = 1.5 [CI 1.1-2.0], p = 0.01) compared with lower thyroid nodules. Isthmus nodules were significantly smaller in size compared with middle (p < 0.0001) and lower (p = 0.0004), but not upper nodules (p = 0.25), with a mean size of 15.5 mm (+/-10.7). Conclusion(s): Thyroid nodule location is an independent risk factor in predicting the risk of thyroid cancer. Isthmic nodules carry the highest risk of cancer diagnosis and lower lobe nodules carry the lowest risk.© Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.",Excluded
2246,"Cement augmentation method for proximal epiphyseal humeral fracture in osteoporotic elderly patients treated by intramedullary nailing and plates and screws: A 4-year follow-up. Introduction Proximal epiphyseal humeral fractures are common in elderly people and their treatment has a rate of complications due to technical failure (cut out, head rotation). Methods We studied 24 patients (15 females, 9 males) with an average age of 79.42 years (range 69 to 83 years) and severe osteoporotic bone (1 or 2 Singh score). They all had proximal epiphyseal humeral fracture, classified as type II-III following Neer classification, defined as fractures of the surgical humeral neck. Sixteen patients were treated with T2 proximal humeral nail (Stryker Srl) and 8 with Philos plate and screws (Synthes Srl) with a modified technique consisting in augmentation of the proximal screws. Augmentation was done with The Locker system (Tecres SpA) inserted through the tunnel for the cephalic screws. The evaluation is based on: operating time, early functional recovery using the Constant- Murley score, X-ray evaluation, mechanical and biological complications. Results The Constant-Murley average score was 71.3 after 1 month post-operation, 73.4 after 3 months, 76.7 after 12 months, 75.4 after 48 months. No other complications (infection, cut out and humeral head necrosis) have been reported at the follow-up. Discussion The review of the recent literature highlights the augmentation's method benefits in support of fractures due to osteoporosis. Due to the poor quality of the bone tissue, this is not able to provide sufficient substrate in which the means of synthesis can be anchored stably, leading to complications in the subject. Conclusions The observations based on the reported results allow to conclude that the cement augmentation of proximal screws in severe osteoporotic bone treatedwith T2 nail and Philos plate could improve the mechanical stability of the implant, ensuring early functional recovery.",Excluded
597,"Hedgehog pathway inhibitor in combination with radiation therapy for basal cell carcinomas of the head and neck: First clinical experience with vismodegib for locally advanced disease. Background: Definitive radiotherapy and vismodegib, an oral inhibitor of the hedgehog pathway, are both established treatment options for locally advanced basal cell carcinomas (BCC). Both have shown good results in local tumor control; however, the effects concerning advanced tumors are often not of a lasting nature and to date no systematic data about the combination of the two modalities are available. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed four patients who received vismodegib and radiotherapy in combination. Radiation doses varied between 50.4 Gy and 66.0 Gy. Three patients had recurrent BCC. One patient had locoregional lymph node involvement. Vismodegib was taken once a day (150 mg) during the entire time of irradiation and beyond upon instructions of the attending dermatologist. Result(s): In three cases a persistent complete response was observed, in one case the tumor remained stable for approximately 6 months until further tumor progression was documented. The combined therapy was well tolerated in all cases. No exceptional side effects pointing at a drug-radiation interaction were observed. Conclusion(s): The combination of vismodegib and radiation seems feasible and the initial results are promising. In our cohort, there was no increase in unexpected side effects. Further research is needed to evaluate the significance of this combined therapy.Copyright © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
2419,"Individualizing cancer treatment: biological optimization models in treatment planning and delivery. PURPOSE: During the last 30 years radiation therapy has developed from classical rectangular beams via conformation therapy with largely uniform dose delivery, but irregular field shapes, to fully intensity modulated dose delivery where the total dose distribution in the tumor can be fully controlled in three dimensions. This last step has been developed during the last 15-20 years and has opened up the possibilities for truly optimized radiation therapy., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Today it is not only possible to produce almost any desired dose distribution in the tumor volume. It is also possible to deliver the dose distribution, which has the highest probability to cure the patient without inducing severe complications in normal tissues. To fully exploit the advantages of intensity-modulated radiation therapy, quality of life or radiobiologic objectives have to be used, preferably combined with predictive assay of radiation sensitivity., RESULTS: This article will briefly discuss the biologic objective functions and the associated advantages in the treatment outcome using new approaches such as consideration of stochastic variations in sensitivity and optimization of the angle of incidence and fractionation schedule with intensity-modulated beams. Finally, different possibilities for realizing general three-dimensional intensity-modulated dose delivery will be discussed., CONCLUSIONS: Once accurate genetically and/or cell survival based predictive assays become available, radiation therapy will become an exact science allowing truly individual optimization considering also the panorama of side-effects that the patient is willing to accept.",Excluded
252,"Radiation dose to the tongue and velopharynx predicts acoustic-articulatory changes after chemo-IMRT treatment for advanced head and neck cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate to what extent changes in speech after C-IMRT treatment are related to mean doses to the tongue and velopharynx (VP). In 34 patients with advanced hypopharyngeal, nasopharyngeal, or oropharyngeal cancer, changes in speech from pretreatment to 10 weeks and 1 year posttreatment were correlated with mean doses to the base of tongue (BOT), oral cavity (OC) and tonsillar fossa/soft palate (VP). Differences in anteroposterior tongue position, dorsoventral degree of tongue to palate or pharynx constriction, grooving, strength, nasality, and laryngeal rise, were assessed by acoustic changes in three speech sounds that depend on a (post-) alveolar closure or narrowing (/t/, /s/, /z/), three with a tongue to palate/pharyngeal narrowing (/l/, /r/, /u/), and in vowel /a/ at comfortable and highest pitch. Acoustically assessed changes in tongue positioning, shape, velopharyngeal constriction, and laryngeal elevation were significantly related to mean doses to the tongue and velopharynx. The mean dose to BOT predicted changes in anteroposterior tongue positioning from pre- to 10-weeks posttreatment. From pretreatment to 1-year, mean doses to BOT, OC, and VP were related to changes in grooving, strength, laryngeal height, nasality, palatalization, and degree of pharyngeal constriction. Changes in speech are related to mean doses to the base of tongue and velopharynx. The outcome indicates that strength, motility, and the balance between agonist and antagonist muscle forces change significantly after radiotherapy.",Excluded

Objective: To assess the yield of non-contrast enhanced CT (CT KUB) across different ordering specialties and need of developing an algorithm for its rationale use. Material(s) and Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed 1550 consecutive CT KUB studies requested for suspected renal colic carried out at a single institution in a calendar year. The data was analyzed for demographic characteristics, referring clinician and final diagnosis. Only patients with CT as primary imaging for clinically suspected reno-ureteral colic were included. Departments ordering these CT KUB examinations were divided into three divisions: Urologist, emergency room (ER) physician and others. Result(s): Of 1550 CT KUB performed in the study period 766 met the inclusion criteria. Urologists (57%), followed by ER physicians (30%) mostly ordered the examination. The overall positive yield for urolithiasis was 64% (n = 490), rate of incidental/alternate findings was 15% (n = 116) and 21% (n = 160) were negative. Urologist has the highest positive yield of 67.4% (n = 295) followed by ER physician 67% (n = 152) and others 42.5% (n = 43); p < 0.001. Rate of incidental/alternate findings was highest in CT ordered by other specialties 23.7% (n = 24) followed by ER physician 17.6% (n = 40) and urologist 11.8% (n = 52); p = 0.005. Conclusion(s): There is statistically significant difference of yield across specialties. CT KUB as an initial imaging modality for suspected urolithiasis should be ordered in consultation with the urologist and ER physicians.

2552,"Diagnostic impact of bedside chest X-ray features of 2019 novel coronavirus in the routine admission at the emergency department: case series from Lombardy region. PURPOSE: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and the imaging features of routine admission chest X-ray in patients suspected for novel Coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) infection., METHOD: We retrospectively evaluated clinical and X-ray features in all patients referred to the emergency department for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 1st and March 13th. A single radiologist with more than 15 years of experience in chest-imaging evaluated the presence and extent of alveolar opacities, reticulations, and/or pleural effusion. The percentage of lung involvement (range <25 % to 75-100 %) was also calculated. We stratified patients in groups according to the time interval between symptoms onset and X-ray imaging (<= 5 and > 5 days) and according to age (<= 50 and > 50 years old)., RESULTS: A total of 518 patients were enrolled. Overall 314 patients had negative and 204 had positive RT-PCR results. Lung lesions in patients with SARS-Cov2 pneumonia primarily manifested as alveolar and interstitial opacities and were mainly bilateral (60.8 %). Lung abnormalities were more frequent and more severe by symptom duration and by increasing age. The sensitivity and specificity of chest X-ray at admission in the overall cohort were 57 % (95 % CI=47-67) and 89 % (83-94), respectively. Sensitivity was higher for patients with symptom onset > 5 days compared to <= 5 days (76 % [62-87] vs 37 % [24-52]) and in patients > 50 years old compared to <= 50 years (59 % [48-69] vs 47 % [23-72]), at the expense of a slightly lower specificity (68 % [45-86] and 82 % [73-89], respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: Overall chest X-ray sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia was 57 %. Sensitivity was higher when symptoms had started more than 5 days before, at the expense of lesser specificity, while slightly higher in older patients in comparison to younger ones.

2937,"Hypersensitivity of lymphoblastoid lines derived from ataxia telangiectasia patients to the induction of chromosomal aberrations by etoposide (VP-16). Mammalian DNA topoisomerase II represents the cellular target of many antitumor drugs, such as epipodophyllotoxin VP-16 (etoposide). The mechanism by which VP-16 exerts its cytotoxic and antineoplastic actions has not yet been firmly established, although the unique correlation between sensitivity to ionizing radiation and to topoisomerase II inhibitors suggest the involvement of DNA double-strand breaks. In the present study we analyzed the chromosomal sensitivity of lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from ataxia telangiectasia (AT) patients to low concentrations of the drug. Our results indicate that AT derived cells are hypersensitive to the clastogenic activity of VP-16 either when the drug is present for the whole duration of the cell cycle or specifically in the G2 phase, confirming that the induction of DNA double strand breaks, to which AT cells seem typically sensitive, could have an important role in the biological activity of VP-16.",Excluded
1033,"Reduced-dose CT: Effect on reader evaluation in detection of pulmonary embolism. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of reduction in radiation dose on CT detection of pulmonary embolism. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Emergency department patients were evaluated for pulmonary embolism with standard and simulated reduced-dose CT angiography. Simulated lower-dose CT angiograms obtained at 90, 45, 22, and 10 mAseff were reconstructed by mathematical addition of noise to the standard dose (180 mAseff) data from the images of 18 patients with and 20 patients without pulmonary embolism. Four radiologists blinded to the study parameters separately interpreted each CT angiogram. Dose trends for subjective measures (diagnostic certainty, image quality, and perceived technical limitations) were evaluated, test characteristics for the detection of pulmonary embolism were computed, and clot burden was measured. RESULTS. Readers indicated significant reductions in diagnostic certainty (p < 0.02) and image quality (p < 0.02) and an increase in perceived technical limitations (p < 0.01) as the simulated radiation dose was decreased. These subjective measures also showed significant adverse dose trends when the mAseff was reduced (p < 0.001). At reduced radiation doses, the sensitivity and positive predictive value for detection of pulmonary embolism diminished significantly. The sensitivity was 0.94 (lower bound of 0.95 CI, 0.92); specificity, 0.99 (lower bound of 0.95 CI, 0.98); positive predictive value, 0.95 (lower bound of 0.95 CI, 0.92); and negative predictive value, 0.99 (lower bound of 0.95 CI, 0.97). All patients had a low to moderate clot burden. CONCLUSION. Reduction in dose for CT angiography in the detection of pulmonary embolism has a significant adverse effect on readers' subjective assessment of diagnostic confidence and image quality. Detection of pulmonary embolism also decreases as the tube current dose is reduced. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded
1061,"Effect of Yangyin Humo Decoction on oral mucomembranous reaction to radiotherapy. OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of Yangyin Humo Decoction (YHD) on oral mucomembranous reaction in patients with head-neck tumor undergoing radiotherapy., METHODS: Forty-Forty-two patients with head-neck tumor undergoing radiotherapy were randomized equally into two groups. The two conventional Western medical treatment was administered to all, including intravenous dripping of 2% lidocaine 20 mL, dexamethasone 5 mg, gentamycin 80,000 units, vitamin B(12) 5 mg, dissolved in saline 250 mL, and 5% sodium bicarbonate solution for gargling, but to the patients in the tested group, YHD was given additionally. The medication was started simultaneously all through the whole course of the radiotherapy. Patients were examined every day to observe and compare the degree, initiating time, and repairing time of their oral lesions; the dosage of radiation they received was recorded as well., RESULTS: The degree of mucomembranous reaction that appeared in most patients in the test group was of grade 1-2, while in the control group, it was grade 2-3. The average time for oral lesion of 1, 2, 3 grades to be initiated in the test group was 12.0+/-1.1, 11.0+/-1.3 and 10.0+/-0.8 days, respectively, after radiation started, which was later than that in the control group (P<0.01). Moreover, the average repairing time for the lesions of grades 1, 2, and 3 in the test group was 3.0+/-0.7, 10.0+/-1.3 and 19.0+/-0.8 days, which were shorter than those in the control group respectively (P<0.01). The radiation applied on the primary tumor of patients with oral lesion of grade 1-3 in the test group was 24.2+/-2.2, 42.0+/-2.6 and 58.0+/-1.6 Gy on the average, respectively, which were higher than that applied on patients in the control group (P<0.05 or P<0.01)., CONCLUSION: The Chinese herbal preparation YHD could alleviate oral mucomembranous reaction to radiation applied in patients with head-neck tumor.",Excluded
2394,"Accelerated fraction radiotherapy with capecitabine as neoadjuvant therapy for borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. Background: A standard neoadjuvant regimen has not been defined for borderline resectable (BR) pancreatic cancer. This phase II trial was designed to determine the safety of accelerated fraction radiotherapy (AFRT) with capecitabine in patients with BR pancreatic cancer. Method(s): The patients had newly diagnosed BR adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and normal organ function. Intensity-modulated (n = 11) or 3D conformal (n = 2) radiotherapy was given to a dose of 50 Gy in 2.5-Gy fractions with capecitabine 825 mg/m2 twice on radiation days. The primary outcome was the frequency of severe treatment-related adverse events (AEs). The study was stopped before planned interim analysis because of 2 severe (grades 4 and 5) gastric ulcerations. Result(s): Thirteen patients were enrolled with a median age of 66 years. All patients completed treatment. Seven (54%) experienced grade 3+ treatment-related AEs. Severe gastric ulceration occurred in 2 patients despite receipt of >=43 Gy to only 1% (2-3 cm3) of the stomach. Lymphopenia (n = 7) was the only other severe AE that occurred in >1 patient. In 7 of the 13 patients, disease had progressed outside the pancreas at restaging. Five of the 13 underwent resection, and all had >10% viable tumor. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.4 months (95% CI 1.9-5.9), and median survival was 9.1 months (95% CI 5.9-not reached). Among those who underwent resection, median PFS was 13.0 months (95% CI 4.4-not reached). Median survival was not reached. Conclusion(s): Given the limited efficacy signal and severe gastric ulcerations, we do not recommend this regimen for pancreatic cancer. We also do not recommend the use of high doses per fraction outside a clinical trial. © 2014 by International Society of Gastrointestinal Oncology.",Excluded
746,"Cumulative ionizing radiation to image the small bowel: Are we really exceeding the safety limits?. Introduction: Radiation exposure from diagnostic imaging of the small bowel is common in Crohn's disease (CD) patients. Increased risk of malignancy has been associated with radiation exposure. For solid cancers this follows a linear-no-threshold model. Current data (BEIR VII) demonstrates that exposure to 100mGY to population of mixed ages, the life time attributable risk (LAR) of solid organ malignancy is 8 per 1000 of exposed persons for males and 13.1 per 1000 for females. This varies according to age of exposure exposure to 100mGY at age 10 confers a risk of 1.33% for males (2.53% for females); at age 30 this is 0.6% for males (1% for females) and at age 50 it is 0.51% for males (0.68% for females). 100mGY exposure confers a LAR (in a linear-quadratic model) for leukaemia of 1 per 1000 for males and 0.72 per 1000 for females. This varies from 1.2 per 1000 exposed males at age 10 (0.86 for females) to 0.84 per 1000 males exposed at age 30 (0.49 for females). The risk remains the same for males aged 50 and decreases to 0.30 per 1000 females exposed aged 50. Aim and Method: Aim: To determine the cumulative ionizing radiation exposure in mGY secondary to non-acute small bowel (SB) imaging in CD patients. Method(s): Patients were identified from our database. Their SB investigations were extracted. Radiation exposure for the procedures was obtained from the Physics division of the radiology department. Result(s): 80 CD patients (males 42 patient) were identified. The time since the diagnosis of CD varied from 41 years to 5 months (mean 8.6 years). 56 patients (30 males) were exposed to ionizing radiation to image the SB. Table 1 denotes the total number of exposures per age group and gender. 15 male and 5 female patients had SB stricturing disease. 2 female patients had fistulising SB disease. Table 2 demonstrates cumulative ionizing radiation secondary to non-acute small bowel imaging. Conclusion(s): 70% of the CD patients were exposed to diagnostic ionizing radiation as to image the small bowel. This radiation exposure reached more than 50mGY in 15% of patients and more than 100mGY in 8.75% our Study group. These results demonstrate the high ionizing radiation with the possible consequences that CD patients are exposed to throughout their lifetime. Thus we suggest that efforts should be done to image the small bowel by non-ionizing radiation such as MRI. In places where this is not available the request for ionizing radiation should only be done by specialists in close liason with the radiologists. (Table presented).",Excluded

2529,"Application of CareDose 4D combined with Karl 3D technology in the low dose computed tomography for the follow-up of COVID-19. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease caused by the new coronavirus. Previous studies have shown that the chest CT examination plays an important role in the diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19. However, some patients with COVID-19 had low white blood cell counts and reduced lymphocyte ratios. Multiple CT examinations may cause radiation damages as well as increase the apoptosis of peripheral blood lymphocytes. A new low-dose CT method should be developed because the regular CT may aggravate the disease. METHOD(S): Sixty cases were randomly divided into the study group (n=30) and control group (n=30). The lung window was reconstructed by Karl 3D iterative technique in the study group. The image quality was subjectively evaluated by two senior chest group diagnostic physicians using a 5-point double-blind method. The value of CT measurement and its standard deviation (SD) was used as an objective evaluation criteria. The volume of CT dose index (CTDIvol), dose length product (DLP) and effective dose (ED) from the two groups were compared and analyzed statistically. RESULT(S): There was no significant difference in the occurrence rates of ground glass opacities, consolidation, crazy-paving pattern, fiber cable shadow and axial interstitial thickening between the study group and control group (p >0.05). In addition, no significant difference was found for the subjective score of overall image quality and image noise level (SD) between the two groups (p > 0.05). However, significant differences was found in CTDIvol, DLP, and ED between the study group and the control group (p<0.05). The effective dose of the study group was reduced by 76% compared to the control group. CONCLUSION(S): CareDose 4D low-dose scanning combined with Karl 3D iterative reconstruction technology can not only greatly reduce the radiation dose, but also provide images that meet the diagnostic criteria of COVID-19, which can be used as a routine method for the follow-up of COVID-19 patients.",Excluded
137,"Non-invasive diffuse reflectance measurements of cutaneous melanin content can predict human sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation. The diversity of human skin phenotypes and the ubiquitous exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) underscore the need for a non-invasive tool to predict an individual's UVR sensitivity. We analysed correlations between UVR sensitivity, melanin content, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DR) and UVR-induced DNA damage in the skin of subjects from three racial/ethnic groups: Asian, Black or African American and White. UVR sensitivity was determined by evaluating each subject's response to one minimal erythemal dose (MED) of UVR one day after the exposure. Melanin content was measured using DR and by densitometric analysis of Fontana-Masson staining (FM) in skin biopsies taken from unexposed areas. An individual's UVR sensitivity based on MED was highly correlated with melanin content measured by DR and by FM. Therefore, a predictive model for the non-invasive determination of UVR sensitivity using DR was developed. The MED precision was further improved when we took race/ethnicity into consideration. The use of DR serves as a tool for predicting UVR sensitivity in humans that should be invaluable for determining appropriate UVR doses for therapeutic, diagnostic and/or cosmetic devices. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.",Excluded

Purpose: To address the characteristics and the causative factors of radiation-induced cranial nerve palsy (CNP) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients with an extensive period of followed-up. Patients and Methods: A total of 317 consecutive and nonselected patients treated with definitive external-beam radiotherapy between November 1962 and February 1995 participated in this study. The median doses to the nasopharynx and upper neck were 71 Gy (range, 55-86 Gy) and 61 Gy (range, 34-72 Gy), respectively. Conventional fractionation was used in 287 patients (90.5%). Forty-five patients (14.2%) received chemotherapy. Result(s): The median follow-up was 11.4 years (range, 5.1-38.0 years). Ninety-eight patients (30.9%) developed CNP, with a median latent period of 7.6 years (range, 0.3-34 years). Patients had a higher rate of CNP (81 cases, 25.5%) in lower-group cranial nerves compared with upper group (44 cases, 13.9%) (chi2 = 34.444, p < 0.001). Fifty-nine cases experienced CNP in more than one cranial nerve. Twenty-two of 27 cases (68.8%) of intragroup CNP and 11 of 32 cases (40.7%) of intergroup CNP occurred synchronously (chi2 = 4.661, p = 0.031). The cumulative incidences of CNP were 10.4%, 22.4%, 35.5%, and 44.5% at 5, 10, 15, and 20 years, respectively. Multivariate analyses revealed that CNP at diagnosis, chemotherapy, total radiation dose to the nasopharynx, and upper neck fibrosis were independent risk factors for developing radiation-induced CNP. Conclusion(s): Radiation-induced fibrosis may play an important role in radiation-induced CNP. The incidence of CNP after definitive radiotherapy for NPC remains high after long-term follow-up and is dose and fractionation dependent. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency and cryoballoon pulmonary vein isolation are common approaches for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation treatment, showing similar results in recent multicenter studies, including heterogeneous tools and protocols. The aim of this study is to compare prospectively in a single, high-volume center the outcome of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ablation performed specifically by second-generation cryoballoon or contact force radiofrequency ablation., METHODS: Consecutive patients scheduled for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation transcatheter ablation have been included and prospectively followed up. Aiming to reduce potential bias deriving from baseline characteristics, a propensity score matching analysis has been performed to analyze safety and efficacy outcomes., RESULTS: Out of consecutive patients undergoing atrial fibrillation transcatheter ablation between January 2015 and December 2016, 46 patients approached by cryoablation were matched 1 : 1 by propensity score to a similar population treated by last-generation radiofrequency ablation. Freedom from atrial fibrillation after 12 months (76 vs. 78%, P = 0.804) and incidence of complications (4 vs. 6%, P = 0.168) did not differ between the two groups. Radiological exposure was higher for the cryoballoon group (11 vs. 4 min, P < 0.001), whereas procedural duration did not differ (P = 0.174). Aiming to assess the potential impact of a learning curve in patients undergoing cryoablation, the first-third of patients (n = 15) were compared with the remaining, reporting longer radiological exposure (P < 0.001), but similar safety and efficacy., CONCLUSION: In this propensity score analysis, last-generation cryoballoon and radiofrequency catheters for atrial fibrillation ablation present similar efficacy and safety.

2970,"Cataract and latitude. For many years, it has been suggested that exposure to sunlight, particularly its ultraviolet component, may be associated with an increased risk of senile cataract. This paper addresses 1) the physical and geographic variables that affect the entry of ultraviolet light in the eye; 2) the epidemiologic evidence that associates cataract with ultraviolet light exposure; and 3) the effectiveness of personal barrier protection (i.e. sunglasses and hats) in reducing ocular exposure to ultraviolet light. The epidemiologic evidence is drawn from studies in Australia, China, Tibet, and the United States. The U.S. evidence consists of data from the Maryland Watermen study and analyses of cataract surgery under the Medicare program which provides health insurance for nearly all Americans age 65 and over (30 million) and pays for 85% of the 1.3 million cataract extractions performed annually in the U.S. Analysis of the Medicard data shown that, after controlling for age, sex, and race, and income of the population and also controlling for supply of ophthalmologists, optometrists, price of surgery and local practice costs, the strongest predictor of cataract surgery likelihood in a Medicare beneficiary is the person's latitude of residence. Latitude correlates directly with the UV-B content of sunlight, because the incident angle of the sun determines the atmospheric penetration of ultraviolet radiation. Data suggest that the probability of cataract surgery in the U.S. increases by 3% for each 1 degree decrease (i.e. more Southerly) in latitude.",Excluded

Methods From January 2000 to May 2013, we treated 40 patients with large unilateral VS (maximum tumor diameter at least 25 mm) with planned partial tumor removal followed by GKS for functional preservation. The median maximum diameter of the tumors was 32.5 mm (range 25-52 mm). All patients underwent surgery via the retrosigmoid approach, and tumors situated on the ventral and in the internal auditory canal intentionally were not removed, thus preserving cranial nerve functions. GKS was performed 1-12 months after surgical resection (median interval 3 months). The median tumor volume at GKS was 3.3 cm3 (range 0.4-10.4 cm3) and the median prescribed dose was 12 Gy (range 10-12 Gy). The median follow-up period after GKS was 65 months (18-156 months). Results At the final follow-up, facial nerve preservation (House-Brackmann grade I-II) was achieved in 38 patients (95%; House-Brackmann grade I: 92.5%, II: 2.5%). Among the 14 patients with preoperative pure tone average (PTA) less than 50 dB, 6 of them (42.9%) maintained PTA less than 50 dB at the last follow-up. Two patients improved from severe hearing loss to PTA less than 50 dB (1 patient after surgery and 1 patient one and half years after GKS). Five- and 10-year tumor growth control occurred in 86% of patients. Four patients (10%) required salvage surgery; the predictive factor was tumor volume greater than 6 cm3 at GKS (P = 0.01). Conclusions Planned partial removal of large VS followed by GKS achieved a high rate of facial nerve and hearing preservation. To achieve long-term tumor growth control, the tumor volume at GKS after planned partial surgical resection should be smaller than 6 cm3. Our results revealed that patients with hearing preservation postoperatively have a chance of maintaining hearing function, even though the possibility exists of deterioration by long-term follow-up after surgical intervention and GKS. Furthermore, some patients with severe hearing loss before treatment have the chance of hearing improvement, even those with large VS.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1528,"Uncertainty in assessment of radiation-induced diffusion index changes in individual patients. The purpose of this study is to evaluate repeatability coefficients of diffusion tensor indices to assess whether longitudinal changes in diffusion indices were true changes beyond the uncertainty for individual patients undergoing radiation therapy (RT). Twenty-two patients who had low-grade or benign tumors and were treated by partial brain radiation therapy (PBRT) participated in an IRB-approved MRI protocol. The diffusion tensor images in the patients were acquired pre-RT, week 3 during RT, at the end of RT, and 1, 6, and 18 months after RT. As a measure of uncertainty, repeatability coefficients (RC) of diffusion indices in the segmented cingulum, corpus callosum, and fornix were estimated by using test-retest diffusion tensor datasets from the National Biomedical Imaging Archive (NBIA) database. The upper and lower limits of the 95% confidence interval of the estimated RC from the test and retest data were used to evaluate whether the longitudinal percentage changes in diffusion indices in the segmented structures in the individual patients were beyond the uncertainty and thus could be considered as true radiation-induced changes. Diffusion indices in different white matter structures showed different uncertainty ranges. The estimated RC for fractional anisotropy (FA) ranged from 5.3% to 9.6%, for mean diffusivity (MD) from 2.2% to 6.8%, for axial diffusivity (AD) from 2.4% to 5.5%, and for radial diffusivity (RD) from 2.9% to 9.7%. Overall, 23% of the patients treated by RT had FA changes, 44% had MD changes, 50% had AD changes, and 50% had RD changes beyond the uncertainty ranges. In the fornix, 85.7% and 100% of the patients showed changes beyond the uncertainty range at 6 and 18 months after RT, demonstrating that radiation has a pronounced late effect on the fornix compared to other segmented structures. It is critical to determine reliability of a change observed in an individual patient for clinical decision making. Assessments of the repeatability and confidence interval of diffusion tensor measurements in white matter structures allow us to determine the true longitudinal change in individual patients.",Excluded
513,"Stricture of the proximal esophagus in head and neck carcinoma patients after radiotherapy. BACKGROUND. It is well recognized that many patients with head and neck carcinoma have problems with food intake and malnutrition. The objective of the current study was to determine the clinical pattern of patients with nonneoplastic stricture of the upper esophagus after radiotherapy for head and neck carcinoma. METHODS. A retrospective chart study of 22 patients with stricture of the proximal esophagus diagnosed between 1993 and 1999 at Karolinska Hospital was performed. The dose volume histograms of the first 2 cm and 5 cm, respectively, of the proximal esophagus were calculated. RESULTS. Five of the patients (23%) had total obliteration. The first 2 cm of the esophagus received at least 60 grays (Gy) in > 80% of the volume. Radiation injury was not reported to occur at doses < 60 Gy. There was a correlation found between dysphagia during radiotherapy and the development of proximal esophageal stricture. Stricture was diagnosed 1-60 months (median, 6 months) after radiotherapy. In 18 patients, the stricture was treated with single or repeated endoscopic dilation. These treatments allowed a nearly normal diet in 78% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS. Stricture of the upper esophagus is one deglutition disorder that is reported to occur after radiotherapy for head and neck carcinoma. In the current study, the authors emphasize the importance of knowing the tolerance of the normal esophagus to irradiation as well as early diagnosis of stricture of the proximal esophagus because this condition may lead to physical and emotional distress. © 2003 American Cancer Society.",Excluded

Film-screen mammography was used most often (54%) followed by xeromammography (30%) and a combination of film-screen and xeromammography (16%). Of the respondents, 62% had changed their method of performing mammography in the last 10 years. Of these, 50% had switched from xeromammography to film-screen, 23% from direct film to film-screen, 15% from direct film to xeromammography, and 6% from film-screen to xeromammography. Mammographic equipment had been purchased by 71% of respondents after 1983. Most respondents (71%) monitored mammography equipment doses, usually at 6- to 12-month intervals. Manual breast examinations were done at the time of mammography at 42% of the facilities, and breast self-examination was taught at 32%. For screening, 87.4% used a two-view examination, 92% required the name of a referring physician to whom the report could be sent, 28% accepted self-referred patients, and only 12% charged a reduced fee for screening. Breast sonography was performed by 53% (93% hand-held vs 7% automated), but none used sonography for screening. Only one respondent reported using thermography; three used light scanning.

2822,"Hyberbaric oxygen as sole treatment for severe radiation - induced haemorrhagic cystitis. PURPOSE: To examine the safety and efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen as the primary and sole treatment for severe radiation-induced haemorrhagic cystitis., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hyperbaric oxygen was prospectively applied as primary treatment in 38 patients with severe radiation cystitis. Our primary endpoint was the incidence of complete and partial response to treatment, while the secondary endpoints included the duration of response, the correlation of treatment success-rate to the interval between the onset of haematuria and initiation of therapy, blood transfusion need and total radiation dose, the number of sessions to success, the avoidance of surgery and the overall survival., RESULTS: All patients completed therapy without complications with a mean follow-up of 29.33 months. Median number of sessions needed was 33. Complete and partial response rate was 86.8% and 13.2%, respectively. All 33 patients with complete response received therapy within 6 months of the haematuria onset. One patient needed cystectomy, while 33 patients were alive at the end of follow-up., CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests the early primary use of hyperbaric oxygen for radiation-induced severe cystitis as an effective and safe treatment option.

3575,"Treatment efficiency of combining photodynamic therapy and ionizing radiation for Bowen's disease. BACKGROUND: Topical 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy (ALA-PDT) is widely used for treating Bowen's disease (BD), but recurrence and tumour cell persistence after ALA-PDT is sometimes problematic. Radiation therapy (RT) is also effective for BD, but is limited by its side-effects, such as refractory ulcers., OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to observe a synergic effect of combination therapy with ALA-PDT and RT for BD cases that did not respond effectively to prior ALA-PDT., METHODS: Subjects were BD patients whose lesion did not show complete remission or showed recurrence after prior ALA-PDT. A total of four cases involving four lesions were studied (three male and one female, mean age 69.5). ALA ointment (20%) was applied to the lesions. After 4 to 6h, subjects received combination therapy consisting of excimer-pumped dye laser radiation at 630nm (50J/cm(2) ) followed by electron-beam radiation (3Gy). The combination therapy was repeated every 2 to 3days for a total of four treatments. The lesions were evaluated clinically or histologically after the final combination therapy session., RESULTS: Following combination therapy, all of the lesions disappeared. Recurrence was not detected during the observations periods, which averaged 14.0months in duration., CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the cure rate of BD could be improved by combination therapy with ALA-PDT and RT. Compared with conventional RT, the synergetic effect of this therapy might reduce the dose of radiation required, thereby also reducing skin side-effects such as refractory ulcers.

2885,"Comparison of documented and recalled histories of exposure to diagnostic x-rays in case-control studies of thyroid cancer. Most information concerning possible cancer risks attributable to lifetime exposure to diagnostic x-rays comes from studies in which x-ray history was ascertained by interview or questionnaire, but little is known about the accuracy of such information. The authors assessed agreement between medical x-ray histories obtained through interview and by review of medical records from thyroid cancer case-control studies conducted in Sweden (1985-1992; 123 cases and 123 controls) and from members of a prepaid health plan in the United States (1986-1991; 50 cases and 50 controls). In both studies, substantial disagreement was found between the numbers of x-ray examinations reported in the interview and in the medical records. There was an indication of relatively poorer reporting among controls, particularly for certain types of x-ray examinations and for large numbers of such examinations. Estimates of the risk associated with exposure to diagnostic x-rays were similar, regardless of whether interview or medical record data were used, even though ordinal dose classifications based on the two sources differed considerably. In populations with a high frequency of exposure, spurious associations with numbers of x-ray examinations or estimated thyroid dose might arise because of differences in recall. However, in the present data, reporting errors by cases and controls seemed to be largely nondifferential.",Excluded
1210,"Oxygen exposures at NASA's Neutral Buoyancy Lab: a 20-year experience. Astronauts training for extravehicular activity (EVA) operations can spend many hours submerged underwater in a pressurized suit, called an extravehicular mobility unit (EMU), exposed to pressures exceeding 2 atmospheres absolute (ATA). To minimize the risk of decompression sickness (DCS) a 46% nitrox mixture is used. This limits the nitrogen partial pressure, decreasing the risk of DCS. The trade-off with using a 46% nitrox mixture is the increased potential for oxygen toxicity, which can lead to severe neurologic symptoms including seizures. Suited runs, which typically expose astronauts of 0.9-1.1 ATA for longer than six hours, routinely exceed the recommendation for central nervous system oxygen toxicity limits (CNSOTL) published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Fortunately, in over 50,000 hours of suited training dives spanning 20 years of EVA training operations at NASA's Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL) there has never been an occurrence of oxygen toxicity. This lends support to anecdotal sentiment among certain members of the hyperbaric community that the NOAA CNSOTL recommendations might be overly conservative, at least for the oxygen pressure and time regime in which NBL operates. The NOAA CNSOTL recommendations are the result of expert consensus with a focus on safety and do not necessarily reflect rigorous experimental evidence. The data from the NBL suited dive operations provide a foundation of evidence that can help inform the expert discussion on dive-related neurologic oxygen toxicity performance and overnight recovery in young, healthy males.

BACKGROUND: Our aim was to review Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's experience with postoperative intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for paranasal sinus, nasal cavity, and lacrimal gland cancer and report dosimetric measures, toxicity, and outcomes., METHODS: Between September 2000 and June 2006, 37 patients with paranasal sinus, nasal cavity, or lacrimal gland cancer underwent postoperative IMRT. Median values were as follows: prescription dose, 60 Gy (range, 50-70); PTV(D95), 99% (range, 79-101%); optic nerve Dmax, 53 Gy (range, 2-54); optic chiasm Dmax, 51Gy (range, 2-55). Acute and late toxicities were scored by Radiation Therapy Oncology Group morbidity criteria., RESULTS: Median follow-up was 28 months. Two-year local progression-free and overall survivals were 75% and 80%. No early- or late-grade 3/4 radiation-induced ophthalmologic toxicity occurred., CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary results show that adjuvant IMRT in these patients is feasible, allowed for excellent planning target volume (PTV) coverage, and minimized dose delivered to optic structures.

3212,"A pilot study of continuous, hyperfractionated, accelerated radiotherapy in rectal adenocarcinoma. This pilot study investigated the feasibility, toxicity and effect of continuous, hyperfractionated, accelerated radiotherapy (CHART) in 19 patients with adenocarcinoma of the rectum who were treated at Mount Vernon Hospital between April 1992 and April 1994. A total dose of 54 Gy was given in 36 fractions over 12 consecutive days; three fractions of 1.5 Gy were employed each day with an interfraction interval of 6 hours. Of these 19 patients, 13 had local pelvic recurrence from rectal carcinoma, four had a primary rectal carcinoma (which was unsuitable for abdominoperineal resection because of patient frailty), and two had large, fixed, unresectable tumours and were given radiotherapy preoperatively to a lower dose of 42 Gy in 28 fractions over 10 days to facilitate surgery. However, none of the 19 patients subsequently underwent surgical resection. Treatment compliance with radiotherapy was 95%. Acute bowel toxicity was assessed by means of a daily bowel chart for 6 weeks and then at 8, 12 and 26 weeks after the completion of radiotherapy. Patients were subsequently scored using the World Health Organization (WHO) grading system. No toxic deaths were observed in this study. There were five grade 3 and one grade 4 toxicities (WHO scale) observed in six patients. There has been minimal acute bladder toxicity in two patients and skin reactions have been surprisingly minimal in all but three patients. Small bowel obstruction and late bowel damage, possibly attributable to radiotherapy, occurred in three patients. Complete pain relief was achieved in recurrent rectal cancer in 100% of patients, at a median of 15 days since commencing radiotherapy (range 7-63 days), and has been maintained for mean and median durations of 19 and 18 months respectively (range 1.5-45 months). Five patients have had a recurrence of pain at 3, 4, 8, 9 and 18 months respectively. All four patients with primary rectal adenocarcinoma achieved a complete response, which has been sustained for 4 months (until death), 54 and 57 months, although one patient relapsed locally at 8 months. In summary, CHART appears to be a feasible treatment for pelvic tumours with regard to toxicity. Patients with pain from a locoregional recurrence achieved rapid complete pain relief, which was sustained for many months.",Excluded
3215,"A novel ultrafast-low-dose computed tomography protocol allows concomitant coronary artery evaluation and lung cancer screening. Background: Cardiac computed tomography (CT) is often performed in patients who are at high risk for lung cancer in whom screening is currently recommended. We tested diagnostic ability and radiation exposure of a novel ultra-low-dose CT protocol that allows concomitant coronary artery evaluation and lung screening. Method(s): We studied 30 current or former heavy smoker subjects with suspected or known coronary artery disease who underwent CT assessment of both coronary arteries and thoracic area (Revolution CT, General Electric). A new ultrafast-low-dose single protocol was used for ECG-gated helical acquisition of the heart and the whole chest. A single IV iodine bolus (70-90 ml) was used. All patients with CT evidence of coronary stenosis underwent also invasive coronary angiography. Result(s): All the coronary segments were assessable in 28/30 (93%) patients. Only 8 coronary segments were not assessable in 2 patients due to motion artefacts (assessability: 98%; 477/485 segments). In the assessable segments, 20/21 significant stenoses (> 70% reduction of vessel diameter) were correctly diagnosed. Pulmonary nodules were detected in 5 patients, thus requiring to schedule follow-up surveillance CT thorax. Effective dose was 1.3 +/- 0.9 mSv (range: 0.8-3.2 mSv). Noteworthy, no contrast or radiation dose increment was required with the new protocol as compared to conventional coronary CT protocol. Conclusion(s): The novel ultrafast-low-dose CT protocol allows lung cancer screening at time of coronary artery evaluation. The new approach might enhance the cost-effectiveness of coronary CT in heavy smokers with suspected or known coronary artery disease.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).",Excluded

In Japan, a robotic-assisted PCI (R-PCI) system, the CorPath GRX System (Corindus Inc.), has been approved for clinical use in 2018, which is the first introduction of R-PCI into Japan. In this study, the clinical performance of the R-PCI system in the initial year at Kurume University Hospital was evaluated comparing with conventional manual PCI (M-PCI). A total of 30 R-PCI and 77 M-PCI procedures performed between April 2019 and March 2020, were retrospectively included. The primary outcome was the rate of clinical success defined as < 30% residual stenosis without in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). The secondary outcomes were fluoroscopy time, dose area product (DAP), amount of radiation exposure to operators and assistants, procedural time, and contrast volume. Propensity-matching technique was used to match each R-PCI lesion to the nearest M-PCI lesion without replacement. After propensity score matching, 30 R-PCI procedures in 28 patients and 37 M-PCI procedures in 35 patients were analyzed. Clinical success rate with R-PCI was favorable and comparable to M-PCI (93.3 vs. 94.6%, p = 0.97), without any in-hospital MACE. The operator radiation exposure was significantly lower in R-PCI (0 vs. 24.5 microSV, p < 0.0001). Radiation exposure to the patients was tended to be reduced by R-PCI (DAP: 77.6 vs. 100.2 Gycm2, p = 0.07).

The aim of this study was to analyse the temporal evolution of administered activities in patients scheduled for dual-day (99m)Tc tracer gated single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and to compare different dose administration protocols in terms of patients' effective dose., METHODS: Patients evaluated from 1 July 2002 to 31 January 2012 were allocated according to the protocol adopted: group 1: fixed activity according to diagnostic reference level: 740 MBq up to 80 kg (adapted for weight <60 kg); 900 MBq 80-100 kg, 1,110 MBq >100 kg, standard filtered back-projection (FBP) reconstruction; group 2: weight-adjusted activity: 8 MBq/kg up to 1,110 MBq, standard FBP reconstruction; and group 3: 4 MBq/kg, UltraSPECT wide beam reconstruction (WBR) reconstruction. A dual-head Anger camera (GE Helix) was used., RESULTS: A total of 9,060 patients were allocated to different groups: 4,751 in group 1, 2,844 in group 2 and 1,465 in group 3. The stress + rest administered activity was 1,617 +/- 180 in group 1, 1,136 +/- 260 in group 2 and 682 +/- 164 MBq in group 3 (all p < 0.001). Patients' effective dose was 13.7 +/- 3 in group 1, 9.5 +/- 2.8 in group 2 and 5.7 +/- 1.6 mSv in group 3 (all p < 0.001). The 50th percentile was 12.6 in group 1, 9.1 in group 2 and 5.3 mSv in group 3. The effective dose received by the dedicated cardiologists was 2.1, 1.5 and 1.0 muSv/exam in group 1, group 2 and group 3 periods, respectively (all p < 0.001)., CONCLUSION: A significant reduction over time in the administered activity for gated SPECT was achieved; accordingly, a significant reduction in patients' exposure was obtained. A simple weight-adjusted strategy with 8 MBq/kg immediately fulfils the recommendations to limit exposure. In selected group 3 patients, a stress-only strategy allows for studies with <3 mSv exposure. Thus, at least the adoption of a new reconstruction algorithm is strongly encouraged, and suggested tracer activities for cardiac gated SPECT are to be revised.",Excluded

This study sets to evaluate its incidence and clinical predictive factors, and to propose relevant dosimetric constraints for this structure to guide radiotherapy planning., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We undertook a retrospective review of 797 NPC patients who underwent definitive intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) between 2003 and 2011. Cumulative incidence and clinical predictors for radiation-induced hypoglossal nerve palsy were evaluated. Archived radiotherapy plans were retrieved and 330 independent hypoglossal nerves were retrospectively contoured following standardized atlas. Optimal threshold analyses of dosimetric parameters (Dmax, D0.5cc, D1cc, D2cc, Dmean) were conducted using receiver operating characteristic curves. Normal tissue complication probability was generated with logistic regression modeling., RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 8.1years, sixty-nine (8.7%) patients developed radiation-induced hypoglossal nerve palsy. High radiotherapy dose, premorbid diabetes, advanced T-stage and radiological hypoglossal canal involvement were independent clinical risk factors. Maximum dose received by 1cc volume (D1cc) was the best predictor for the development of radiation-induced nerve palsy (AUC=0.826) at 8years after IMRT. Hypoglossal nerves with D1cc of 74Gy EQD2 had an estimated palsy risk of 4.7%. Nerves with D1cc <74Gy EQD2 had significantly lower risk of palsy than those >=74Gy EQD2 (2.4% vs 20.8%, p <0.001)., CONCLUSION: Incidence of radiation-induced hypoglossal nerve palsy was high after definitive IMRT for NPC. D1cc <74Gy EQD2 can serve as a useful dose constraint to adopt during radiotherapy planning to limit palsy risk to <5% at 8years after IMRT. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

PURPOSE: To prospectively assess the accuracy of combined wash-in and washout characteristics at dynamic contrast material-enhanced multi-detector row computed tomography (CT) in distinguishing benign from malignant solitary pulmonary nodules. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained. The study included 107 patients (62 men, 45 women; mean age, 55 years; range, 22-81 years) with a solitary pulmonary nodule. After unenhanced CT (2.5-mm collimation) scans were obtained, dynamic CT was performed by using a helical technique (series of images obtained throughout the nodule, with 2.5-mm collimation, at 30, 60, 90, and 120 seconds and 4, 5, 9, 12, and 15 minutes) after intravenous injection of contrast medium (120 mL). Tissue diagnosis was made in 70 nodules, and follow-up images showed benignancy in the remaining 37 (no change in size, n = 32; decrease in size, n = 5). CT findings were analyzed in terms of wash-in and washout of contrast medium. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for malignant nodules were calculated by considering both the wash-in and washout characteristics at dynamic CT. RESULT(S): There were 49 malignant and 58 benign nodules. When diagnostic criteria for malignancy of both wash-in of 25 HU or greater and washout of 5-31 HU were applied, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for malignancy were 94% (46 of 49 nodules), 90% (52 of 58 nodules), and 92% (98 of 107 nodules), respectively. Of 58 benign nodules, 27 showed less than 25 HU wash-in, 14 showed persistent contrast enhancement without washout and with wash-in of 25 HU or greater, and 11 showed washout greater than 31 HU and wash-in of 25 HU or greater. CONCLUSION(S): Evaluation of solitary pulmonary nodules by analyzing combined wash-in and washout characteristics at dynamic contrast-enhanced multi-detector row CT showed 92% accuracy for distinguishing benign nodules from malignant nodules. © RSNA, 2005.",Excluded
3265,"Abdominal radiographs understimate the prevalence of paget's disease of bone in a fifht of patients. Background The most frequent skeletal localizations of Paget's disease of bone (PDB) are the pelvis, lumbar spine and proximal femur. Thus, an x-ray including these locations, such as an abdominal radiograph, allows the identification of the disease with a high probability. However, according to previous studies, only 60 to 90% of the global skeletal affection by PDB is included in the area of an abdominal radiograph [1]. In order toknow with certainty the real prevalence of PDB in any population, usually assessed by abdominal radiographs, we need to know the percentage of patients with PDB without pagetic affection of bones included in an abdominal x-ray. Objectives To estimate the percentage of PBD patients without skeletal affection in the pelvis, lumbar spine and/or proximal femur to assess the underestimation of the prevalence of PDB assessed by abdominal radiographs. Methods Transversal descriptive study based on medical records of 602 patients from the Spanish National PBD Register [2]. We included consecutive patients with a skeletal radionuclide scintigraphy and alkaline phosphatase measurement in the year of the diagnosis. We excluded patients treated with bisphosphonates or calcitonin in the previous five years. A central lecture of scintigraphies was made by expert rheumatologists, who identified the pagetic bones included in an abdominal radiograph and in the whole skeleton. Results 214 (36%) bone scans were analyzed. There were not significant differences (p>0.25) between the included patients and patients from the Register in age, gender and time from diagnosis. The percentage of patients with PDB in the lumbar spine, pelvis and/or proximal femur was 80% (IC 95%: [74%>85%]), without differences by gender. This implies that 1/5 of patients are not diagnosed of PDB if only abdominal x-rays are analyzed. New PDB prevalence estimation in Spain is 1.2% (0.9%>1.6%), being 1.5% (1%>2.1%) in men and 1% (0.7%>1.5%) in women. Figure 1 shows the percentage of patients with pagetic involvement in each area. Conclusions Evaluation by abdominal x-rays underestimates 1/5 of patients with Paget's disease of bone. According to these data, the prevalence of this disease in Spain is 1.2%.

2175,"Long-Term Outcomes for Patients With Desmoid Fibromatosis Treated With Radiation Therapy: A 10-Year Update and Re-evaluation of the Role of Radiation Therapy for Younger Patients. Purpose: To update our experience with long-term outcomes in patients with desmoid fibromatosis treated with radiation therapy (RT) and to characterize factors associated with increased risk of local recurrence. Methods and Materials: We reviewed the records of 209 consecutive patients with desmoid fibromatosis treated with RT, either alone or as combined-modality therapy (CMT) with surgery, at our institution from 1965 to 2015. Result(s): Median follow-up time was 98 months (range, 1-509 months). The 5- and 10-year local control (LC) was 71% and 69%, respectively. Fifty-nine patients (28%) experienced a local recurrence at a median time of 23 months (interquartile range, 15-38 months). Among all patients, on multivariable analysis, adjusting for anatomic site, size, age, treatment era (>2005 vs <=2005), treatment approach (RT alone vs CMT), and an interaction between age and treatment, we found only age <=30 years (hazard ratio [HR], 2.94; P =.005; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.38-6.27) and large tumor size >10 cm (HR, 2.51; P =.03; 95% CI, 1.09-5.78) to be correlated with poorer LC. Notably, for patients receiving RT alone, the 5-year LC was 43% for patients <=30 years old versus 75% for >30 years old (P <.001). On multivariable analyses, for patients receiving RT alone, the only factor associated with inferior LC was age <=30 years (HR, 2.87; P =.001; 95% CI, 1.51-5.47). The same was true for patients treated with CMT; age <=30 years was the only factor associated with inferior LC (HR, 5.36; P =.01; 95% CI, 1.40-20.58). Conclusion(s): Among all patients with desmoid fibromatosis, RT is an effective local therapy for tumor control. However, young patients <= 30 years have notably high rates of local recurrence regardless of treatment strategy, which requires further study. Treatment decisions should be risk-adapted by large referral centers with multidisciplinary expertise in desmoid management.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1746,"Long term outcome after combined modality treatment for anal cancer. Background. The aim of the retrospective study was to evaluate the effectiveness and toxicity of radiochemotherapy in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal treated at a single institution.Patients and methods. Between 1/2003 and 9/2010, 84 patients were treated with radical radiochemotherapy at the Institute of Oncology Ljubljana, Slovenia. The treatment consisted of 3-dimensional conformal external beam radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil and mytomycin C), followed by brachytherapy or external beam boost. The toxicity of therapy and its effectiveness were assessed.Results. The treatment was completed according to the protocol in 79.8% of patients. The median follow-up time of 55 survivors was 53 months (range: 16-105 months). The 5-year locoregional control (LRC), disease-free survival (DFS), disease-specific survival (DSS), overall survival (OS) and colostomy-free survival (CFS) rates were 71%, 68%, 81%, 67% and 85%, respectively. No treatment-related mortality was observed. The most frequent acute side-effect of the treatment was radiodermatitis (grade 3-4 in 58.2% of patients). LENT-SOMA grade 3-4 late radiation side effects were observed in 15 (18%) patients. In patients with brachytherapy boost a trend of less late side effects was observed compared to patients with external beam boost (P=0.066). On multivariate analysis, complete clinical disease response was identified as an independent prognostic factor for LRC, DFS and DSS, the salvage surgery for LRC and DFS, whereas Hb below 120 g/l retained its independent prognostic value for OS.Conclusions. Radiochemotherapy provides an excellent disease control and the survival with preserving anal sphincter function in majority of patients. Surgical salvage with abdominoperineal resection for persistent or recurrent disease has curative potential.",Excluded
1808,"A hypothetical protocol for the provisional use of perfusion imaging with exercise stress testing. Background: Previous literature suggests that the results of myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) add little to the prognosis of patients who exercise >10 metabolic equivalents (METS) during stress testing. With this in mind, we attempted to determine if a provisional injection protocol could be developed in which a patient would not receive an injection of radioisotope if adequate exercise was achieved without symptoms and a negative ECG response. This protocol would save a substantial amount of time, radiation exposure, and cost. Method(s): All patients who underwent a stress SPECT MPI over a 6.5-year period from 2004 to 2010 were included. Patients who would have been considered for a standby injection protocol were: exercise stress, age < 65, no known coronary artery disease (CAD), and an interpretable ECG. Patients were retrospectively divided into two groups based on whether they would have received radioisotope or not. Criteria for not injecting included a maximal predicted heart rate >= 85%, >=10 METS of exercise, no symptoms of chest pain or shortness of breath, and no ECG changes (ST depression or arrhythmia). The two groups were then compared based on MPI results and all-cause mortality derived from the Social Security Death Index. Result(s): A total of 24,689 patients underwent SPECT MPI during this period, and 5,352 would have been eligible for a provisional injection protocol. There were 3,791 (70.8%), who would have been injected and 1,561 (29.2%), who would not have been. Perfusion results were abnormal in 5.9% of non-injected group compared to 14.4% in those who would have been injected. After a mean follow-up of 60.6 +/- 21.4 months, 1.1% had died in the non-injected cohort compared to 2.2% in the injected group. Conclusion(s): A provisional injection protocol defined as age < 65, normal rest ECG, no history of CAD, and high level exercise with a negative ECG response and no symptoms has a very low 5-year all-cause mortality and low yield of MPI. If adopted it would decrease radiation exposure and save time and health care costs without jeopardizing prognosis. © 2013 American Society of Nuclear Cardiology.",Excluded
2557,"Surgical management of cervical spondylotic myelopathy. Introduction: The surgical procedure by the anterior, posterior and combined antero-posterior approaches had applied for the treatment of cervical spondylotic myelopathy. Method(s): During the treatment process, all patients were pre-operatively as well post-operatively graded according to Japanese Orthopaedics Association. Several surgical methods such as anterior approach, posterior approach, and combined antero-posterior approach have been addressed for CSM patients, with the choice based on the pathogenesis of the myelopathy. The main indications for surgery were evidence of myelopathy on physical examinations, a JOA score below 13 points help with spinal cord compression observed on plain X-ray, CT scan, MRI studies. Result(s): The pre-operative JOA scores were 7.60+/-1.23 in laminoplasty, 8.30+/-1.03 in diskectomy and corpectomy and 7.10+/-1.20 in combined antero-posterior approach patients. At the follow-up after three months the JOA scores were laminoplasty 13.30+/-1.30, diskectomy and corpectomy 13.55+/-1.15 and combined antero-posterior 13.50+/-1.08. The JOA recovery rate averaged, 61.08+/-11.25% in laminoplasty, 60.67+/-10.60% in diskectomy and corpectomy and 64.67+/-10.72% in combined anteroposterior approach. The high- signal intensity changed to normal in 18 out of 28 and no any kyphotic change and instability were found in cervical spine at the follow up. Conclusion(s): Patients with OPLL (continuous, segmental and mixed type), stenosis of cervical spinal canal, multilevel cervical spondylosis, large and high ossification of IVDP with stenosis were improved with laminoplasty. Patients with PIVD, CSM with kyphosis, post laminectomy, OPLL herniated type, unstable vertebral alignment, stenosis by osteophytes, were improved with anterior approach.

Purpose: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of epimacular brachytherapy (EMB) for the treatment of chronic, active, neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Design(s): Prospective, multicenter, interventional, noncontrolled clinical trial. Participant(s): Fifty-three eyes of 53 participants with neovascular AMD requiring frequent anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) retreatment. Method(s): Participants underwent pars plana vitrectomy with a single 24-Gy dose of EMB delivered using an intraocular, handheld cannula containing a strontium 90/yttrium 90 source positioned over the active lesion. Participants were retreated with ranibizumab administered monthly as needed, using predefined retreatment criteria. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was undertaken monthly, with images assessed by an independent reading center. Main Outcome Measure(s): Coprimary outcomes at 12 months were proportion of participants with stable vision (losing <15 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study [ETDRS] letters) and mean number of anti-VEGF retreatments. Result(s): Before enrollment, participants had received an average of 12.5 anti-VEGF injections. After a single treatment with EMB, 81% maintained stable vision, with a mean of 3.49 anti-VEGF retreatments in 12 months. Mean +/- standard deviation change in visual acuity was -4.0+/-15.1 ETDRS letters. Mean +/- standard deviation OCT central retinal thickness increased by 50+/-179 mum. Common adverse events included conjunctival hemorrhage (n = 38), cataract (n = 16), resolving vitreous hemorrhage (n = 6), and eye pain (n = 5).

566,"Dose-response relationships for radium-induced bone sarcomas. The incidence of bone sarcomas among 3055 female radium-dial workers who entered the dial industry before 1950 was used to determine dose-response relationships for the induction of bone sarcomas by radium. Two subpopulations were analyzed: all measured cases who survived at least 5 yr after the start of employment and all cases who survived at least 2 yr after first measurement. The first constituted a group based on year of entry; it contained 1468 women who experienced 42 bone sarcomas; the expected number was 0.4. The second comprised a group based on first measurement; it contained 1257 women who experienced 13 bone sarcomas; the expected number was 0.2. The dose-response function, I = (C + alpha D + beta D2)e-gammaD, and simplifications of this general form, were fit to each data set. Incidence (I) was in units of bone sarcomas per person-yr; (D) was the quantity (muCi) of radium that entered the blood. Two functions, I = (C + alpha D + beta D2)e-gammaD and I = (C + beta D2)e-gammaD, fit the data for year of entry (p greater than or equal to 0.05); both these functions and I = (C + alpha D) fit the data for first measurement. The function I = (C + beta D2)e-gammaD was used to predict the number of bone sarcomas in all other pre-1950 radium cases (medical, laboratory and other exposures); fewer were actually observed than the fit of this function to the female dial workers predicted.",Excluded

This study aimed to detect, analyze, and correlate the clinical characteristics, blood coagulation functions, blood calcium levels, and inflammatory factors in patients with mild and severe COVID-19 infections. The enrolled COVID-19 infected patients were from Wuhan Jin Yin-tan Hospital (17 cases, Wuhan, China), Suzhou Infectious Disease Hospital (87 cases, Suzhou, China), and Xuzhou Infectious Disease Hospital (14 cases, Xuzhou, China). After admission, basic information was collected; X-ray and chest CT images were obtained; and data from routine blood tests, liver and kidney function, myocardial enzymes, electrolytes, blood coagulation function, (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) ESR, C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, procalcitonin (PCT), calcitonin, and other laboratory tests were obtained. The patients were grouped according to the clinical classification method based on the pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan for new coronavirus infection (trial version 7) in China. The measurements from mild (56 cases) and severe cases (51 cases) were compared and analyzed. Most COVID-19 patients presented with fever. Chest X-ray and CT images showed multiple patchy and ground glass opacities in the lungs of COVID 19 infected patients, especially in patients with severe cases. Compared with patients with mild infection, patients with severe infection were older (p = 0.023) and had a significant increase in AST and BUN. The levels of CK, LDH, CK-MB, proBNP, and Myo in patients with severe COVID-19 infection were also increased significantly compared to those in patients with mild cases. Patients with severe COVID-19 infections presented coagulation dysfunction and increased D-dimer and fibrin degradation product (FDP) levels. Severe COVID-19 patients had low serum calcium ion (Ca2+) concentrations and high calcitonin and PCT levels and exhibited serious systemic inflammation. Ca2+ in COVID-19 patients was significantly negatively correlated with PCT, calcitonin, D-dimer, PFDP, ESR, CRP and IL-6. D-dimer in COVID-19 patients was a significantly positively correlated with CRP and IL-6. In conclusion, patients with severe COVID-19 infection presented significant metabolic dysfunction and abnormal blood coagulation, a sharp increase in inflammatory factors and calcitonin and procalcitonin levels, and a significant decrease in Ca2+. Decreased Ca2+ and coagulation dysfunction in COVID-19 patients were significantly correlated with each other and with inflammatory factors.© Copyright © 2021 Qi, Kong, Ding, Wu, Ji, Huang, Li, Wang, Wen, Wu, Wu, Huang, Li, Liu and Tang.",Excluded

The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) when used for patients with intractable cluster headache (CH). Methods. Four participating centers of the North American Gamma Knife Consortium identified 17 patients who underwent GKS for intractable CH between 1996 and 2008. The median patient age was 47 years (range 26-83 years). The median duration of pain before GKS was 10 years (range 1.3-40 years). Seven patients underwent unsuccessful prior surgical procedures, including microvascular decompression (2 patients), microvascular decompression with glycerol rhizotomy (2 patients), deep brain stimulation (1 patient), trigeminal ganglion stimulation (1 patient), and prior GKS (1 patient). Fourteen patients had associated autonomic symptoms. The radiosurgical target was the trigeminal nerve (TN) root and the sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) in 8 patients, only the TN in 8 patients, and only the SPG in 1 patient. The median maximum TN and SPG dose was 80 Gy. Results. Favorable pain relief (Barrow Neurological Institute Grades I-IIIb) was achieved and maintained in 10 (59%) of 17 patients at a median follow-up of 34 months. Three patients required additional procedures (repeat GKS in 2 patients, hypothalamic deep brain stimulation in 1 patient). Eight (50%) of 16 patients who had their TN irradiated developed facial sensory dysfunction after GKS. Conclusions. Gamma Knife surgery for intractable, medically refractory CH provided lasting pain reduction in approximately 60% of patients, but was associated with a significantly greater chance of facial sensory disturbances than GKS used for trigeminal neuralgia.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: The present study sought to explore the role of microRNA-330 (miR-330) in predicting the radiation response and prognosis of patients with brain metastasis (BM) from lung cancer (LC)., METHODS: Patients with BM from LC were identified and classified into radiation-sensitive and radiation-resistant groups according to the overall survival rate, local and distant recurrence rate after conventional whole-brain radiation therapy. Quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect miR-330 expression in serum. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the prognostic value of miR-330 for the radiation sensitivity of brain metastasis from LC. Related clinical factors for radiation sensitivity were assessed by logistic regression analysis, and a survival analysis was conducted using COX regression and the Kaplan-Meier method., RESULTS: MiR-330 exhibited lower expression in the radiation-sensitive group than in the radiation-resistant group. The area under the ROC curve of miR-330 for predicting radiation sensitivity was 0.898 (optimal cut-off value, 0.815), with a sensitivity of 71.7% and a specificity of 90.1%. After radiation therapy, patients with low miR-330 expression, compared to patients with high miR-330 expression, displayed a lower survival rate and a median survival time. MiR-330 expression was correlated with extracranial metastasis, maximum BM diameter, tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage and node (N) stage. Logistic regression and COX regression analyses revealed that extracranial metastasis, TNM stage, N stage and miR-330 expression were factors that influenced both radiation sensitivity and individual prognostic factors in patients with BM from LC., CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the downregulation of miR-330 correlates with radiation sensitivity and poor prognosis in patients with BM from LC.

Background: In a retrospective analysis we investigated the prognostic significance of the interval between first appearance of motoric deficits and the beginning of radiation therapy (RT) with regard to posttreatment motoric function. Material(s) and Method(s): Data of more than 400 consecutive patients being irradiated at our department between 1994 and 1997 because of vertebral metastases were reviewed. Ninety-six patients fulfilled selection criteria including motoric deficits, no preceding surgical or radiotherapeutic treatment of the spine, minimum total dose of 24 Gy referred to spinal cord, and additional treatment with dexamethasone. Two subgroups with a similar number of patients for better comparability were formed according to the time of developing motoric deficits: 1 to 13 days (49 patients) and >=14 days (47 patients). Effect of irradiation on motoric function was evaluated 2 weeks and about 3 months after radiotherapy. Patients with severe deterioration of motoric function within 48 hours before radiation therapy (31 patients) were looked at separately. Result(s): Two weeks after radiotherapy 42/47 patients (89%) developing motoric deficits >= 14 days showed improvement of motoric function in comparison to 6/49 patients (12%) of the other group. Deterioration occurred in 1/47 patients (2%) of the first and in 24/49 patients (49%) of the latter group. In case of severe deterioration of motoric function within 48 hours before radiation therapy only 2/31 patients (6%) showed improvement, but 20/31 (65%) deterioration. About 3 months after radiotherapy comparable results were observed. Median survival time was 4 months. Conclusion(s): A slower development of motoric deficits before beginning of radiotherapy means a better therapeutic effect and a more favorable functional outcome after treatment. The prognosis is extraordinarily poor if severe deterioration of motoric function occurs within 48 hours before radiotherapy.",Excluded
605,"Radiation necrosis versus glioma recurrence: conventional MR imaging clues to diagnosis. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Conventional MR imaging findings are considered to be inadequate for reliably distinguishing radiation necrosis from tumor recurrence in patients with glioma. Despite this belief, we hypothesized that certain conventional MR imaging findings, alone or in combination, though not definitive, may favor one or another of these diagnoses in proton beam-treated patients with new enhancing lesions on serial scanning. METHOD(S): MR imaging findings (axial T1-, T2-, and post-gadolinium T1-weighted) of 27 proton beam radiation therapy patients with high-grade gliomas were retrospectively reviewed. Entry criteria included new MR imaging enhancing lesions after treatment and histologically unequivocal biopsy proof of diagnosis. Readers rated corpus callosum involvement, midline spread, subependymal spread, new discrete multiple enhancing foci, a ""spreading wavefront"" appearance, and septum pellucidum involvement. Statistical analysis was by the Fisher exact test. RESULT(S): Corpus callosum involvement in combination with multiple other findings was highly associated with progressive glioma. These combinations included involvement of the corpus callosum with multiple enhancing foci (P = .02), involvement of the corpus callosum with crossing the midline and multiple enhancing lesions (P = .04), and involvement of the corpus callosum with subependymal spread and multiple enhancing lesions (P = .01). CONCLUSION(S): In proton beam-treated patients with glioma, corpus callosum involvement, in conjunction with multiple enhancing lesions with or without crossing of the midline and subependymal spread, favors predominant glioma progression. Overall, combinations of enhancement patterns were more likely than individual patterns to distinguish necrosis from predominant tumor progression. Together with clinical and functional imaging findings, these results may assist in determining the need for biopsy.",Excluded

The flattened-cell form of cancer with or without keratosis was diagnosed in 82.7%; other forms of cancer-in 17.3% cases. Sarcoma in women was diagnosed 3.5 times as often as in men. Tumours of the I stage were found in 12, of the II stage in 34. of the III stage in 146, of the IV stage in 73 patients. All patients were subjected to combined treatment-telegammatherapy and resection of the tumour with an electroknife. Patients with cancer of the I stage were first operated on with the electroknife and then subjected to radiotherapy with a focal dose of 3000-4000 rad. The 34 patients with cancer of the II stage underwent preoperative radiotherapy with a focal dose of 4500 to 5000 rad, then surgical intervention followed in 2-5 weeks.

357,"Characterization of neurons of the nucleus tractus solitarius pars centralis. Esophageal sensory afferent inputs terminate principally in the central subnucleus of the tractus solitarius (cNTS). Neurons of the cNTS comprise two major neurochemical subpopulations. One contains neurons that are nitric oxide synthase (NOS) immunoreactive (-IR) while the other comprises neurons that are tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-IR. We have shown recently that TH-IR neurons are involved in esophageal-distention induced gastric relaxation. We used whole cell patch clamp techniques in rat brainstem slices combined with immunohistochemical and morphological reconstructions to characterize cNTS neurons. Postrecording reconstruction of cNTS neurons revealed two morphological neuronal subtypes; one group of cells (41 out of 131 neurons, i.e., 31%) had a multipolar soma, while the other group (87 out of 131 neurons, i.e., 66%) had a bipolar soma. Of the 43 cells in which we conducted a neurochemical examination, 15 displayed TH-IR (9 with bipolar morphology, 6 with multipolar morphology) while the remaining 28 neurons did not display TH-IR (18 with bipolar morphology, 10 with multipolar morphology). Even though the range of electrophysiological properties varied significantly, morphological or neurochemical distinctions did not reveal characteristics peculiar to the subgroups. Spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSC) recorded in cNTS neurons had a frequency of 1.5 +/- 0.15 events s(-1) and an amplitude of 27 +/- 1.2 pA (Vh = -50 mV) and were abolished by pretreatment with 30 muM AP-5 and 10 muM CNQX, indicating the involvement of both NMDA and non-NMDA receptors. Some cNTS neurons also received a GABAergic input that was abolished by perfusion with 30-50 muM bicuculline. In conclusion, our data show that despite the heterogeneity of morphological and neurochemical membrane properties, the electrophysiological characteristics of cNTS neurons are not a distinguishing feature.",Excluded

Five-year overall (OS), relapse-free (RFS), locoregional relapse-free (LRFS), and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) were 48.9%, 31.6%, 66.4%, and 40.6%, respectively. A multivariate analysis demonstrated that the presence of symptoms was an independent prognostic factor influencing OS, RFS, LRFS, and DMFS. No statistically significant difference was found in OS (p = 0.181), RFS (p = 0.113), LRFS (p = 0.379), or DMFS (p = 0.335) when comparing clinical outcomes between the chemoradiotherapy with and without surgery groups., CONCLUSIONS: Chemoradiotherapy with or without surgery could be a potential option for an LRRC cure, and the symptoms related to LRRC were a significant prognostic factor predicting poor clinical outcome. The chemoradiotherapy scheme for LRRC patients should be adjusted to the possibility of resectability and risk of local failure to focus on local control.",Excluded
3607,"Concurrent liposomal paclitaxel and cisplatin chemotherapy improved outcomes for locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy. Background: To ascertain whether concurrent chemotherapy using liposomal paclitaxel and cisplatin could improve the outcomes of patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma receiving intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Method(s): A total of 72 patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, which were admitted to our hospital from October 2011 to December 2013, were retrospectively analyzed in this study. Result(s): Thirty-six patients (50%) were treated with IMRT alone, while the other 36 patients (50%) were treated by IMRT combined with chemotherapy containing liposomal paclitaxel and cisplatin. Patients treated with chemoradiotherapy showed significantly superior overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) compared to patients treated with IMRT alone (median OS: respectively, 29.7 vs. 12.9 months, P=0.0287; median PFS: respectively, 14.0 vs. 6.5 months, P=0.0186). Multivariate Cox analysis confirmed the inclusion of chemotherapy as an independent predictor of favorable OS and PFS. Both chemoradiotherapy and IMRT were well-tolerated in our cohort. Conclusion(s): Chemotherapy improved the prognosis of locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated with IMRT. Large prospective studies are needed to confirm the therapeutic value of IMRT combined with chemotherapy in locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.Copyright © Annals of Translational Medicine.

744,"Prolonged minor allograft survival in intravenously primed mice--a test of the veto hypothesis. Experiments were performed to test the hypothesis that veto cells are responsible for the prolonged survival of minor allografts of skin that is observed in recipients primed intravenously with spleen cells from mice syngeneic with the skin donors. This prolonged survival was observed for each of several minor histocompatibility (H) antigens and is antigen-specific. Gamma radiation (3300 rads) abolished the ability of male spleen cells infused i.v. to delay the rejection of male skin grafts (H-Y antigen) on female recipients. However, depletion of Thy-1+ cells from the i.v. infusion failed to abolish the ability to prolong male skin graft survival. Furthermore, the prolonged survival accorded to B6 (H-2b) male skin grafts on CB6F1 (H-2b/H-2d) female recipients given i.v. infusions of B6 male spleen cells extended to BALB/c (H-2d) male skin grafts as well, indicating a lack of MHC restriction. Thus, prolongation of minor allograft survival by i.v. infusion of minor H antigen-bearing spleen cells appears not to depend on veto T cells that others have found to be responsible for the suppression of CTL generation (2, 3, 5).",Excluded
535,"Comparison of phototherapy two times and four times a week with low doses of narrow-band ultraviolet B in Asian patients with psoriasis. Background/Aims: The optimum narrow-band (TL-01) ultraviolet (UV) B weekly treatment frequency for psoriasis has yet to be defined, especially in Asian patients with TL-01. Our purpose was to compare 2x weekly and 4x weekly therapy with narrow-band UVB at low doses for psoriasis vulgaris. Method(s): Sixty-nine patients with moderately severe psoriasis were recruited and allocated to the 2x weekly or 4x weekly treatment group. The patients were treated with a new protocol using low doses of narrow-band UVB with varied exposure increments. Outcomes were evaluated by means of Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) scores, time (weeks), cumulative UVB dose and number of treatments to clearance. Result(s): No significant difference was found between the two regimens in the PASI score at the end of treatment, in the proportion of patients whose skin cleared during treatment and in the time to clearance (8 weeks). Those who completed treatment achieved clearance after a median of 16 exposures with 2x weekly treatment compared with 32 exposures with 4x weekly treatment (P=0.0304), and 12.5 minimal erythema dose multiples (MEDs) compared with 39.7 MEDs (P=0.0470). Acute side effects of the treatment were similar for the two groups (P=0.8462). Conclusion(s): For skin phototype III-V populations, a greater long-term risk is expected, connected with the higher cumulative UVB dose and number of exposures required in the 4x weekly group. Therefore, 4x weekly phototherapy will no longer be used for psoriasis.",Excluded
3231,"Effects of curcumin based PDT on the viability and the organization of actin in melanotic (A375) and amelanotic melanoma (C32) - in vitro studies. Curcumin is a turmeric, antioxidative compound, well-known of its anti-cancer properties. Nowadays more and more effort is made in the field of enhancing the efficiency of the anticancer therapies. Combining the photoactive properties of curcumin with the superficial localization of melanoma and photodynamic therapy (PDT) seems to be a promising treatment method. The research focused on the evaluation of the curcumin effectiveness as an anticancer therapeutic agent in the in vitro treatment of melanotic (A375) and amelanotic (C32) melanoma cell lines. Keratinocytes (HaCat) and fibroblasts (HGF) were used to assess the impact of the therapy on the skin tissue. The aim of the study was to investigate the cell death after exposure to light irradiation after preincubation with curcumin. Additionaly the authors analized the interactions between curcumin and the actin cytoskeleton. The cytotoxic effect initiated by curcumin and increased by irradiation confirm the usefulness of the flavonoid in the PDT approach. Depending on curcumin concentration and incubation time, melanoma cells survival rate ranged from: 93.68 % (C32 cell line, 10 muM, 24 h) and 83.47 % (A375 cell line, 10 muM, 24 h) to 8.98 % (C32 cell line, 50 muM, 48 h) and 12.42 % (A375 cell line, 50 muM, 48 h). Moreover, photodynamic therapy with curcumin increased the number of apoptotic and necrotic cells in comparison to incubation with curcumin without irradiation. The study demonstrated that PDT induced caspase-3 overexpression and DNA cleavage in the studied cell lines. The cells revealed decreased proliferation after the therapy due to the actin cytoskeleton rearrangement. Although effective, the therapy remains not selective towards melanoma cells.

806,"Measurement of lung airways in three dimensions using hyperpolarized helium-3 MRI. Large airway measurement is clinically important in cases of airway disease and trauma. The gold standard is computed tomography (CT), which allows for airway measurement. However, the ionizing radiation dose associated with CT is a major limitation in longitudinal studies and trauma. To avoid ionizing radiation from CT, we present a method for measuring the large airway diameter in humans using hyperpolarized helium-3 (HPHe) MRI in conjunction with a dynamic 3D radial acquisition. An algorithm is introduced which utilizes the significant airway contrast for semi-automated segmentation and skeletonization which is used to derive the airway lumen diameter. The HPHe MRI method was validated with quantitative CT in an excised and desiccated porcine lung (linear regression R(2) = 0.974 and slope = 0.966 over 32 airway segments). The airway lumen diameters were then compared in 24 human subjects (22 asthmatics and 2 normals; linear regression R(2) value of 0.799 and slope = 0.768 over 309 airway segments).

3014,"Chemoradiotherapy and Increased Prescription Dose in Esophageal Squamous Cell Cancer: A Retrospective Study. To analyze the outcomes and adverse events of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) treated with definitive chemoradiation with modified radiotherapy volume and increased radiation dose. This was a retrospective analysis of patients with ESCC treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy at the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (02/2015 to 02/2017). The dose to the planning gross tumor volume (PGTV) and planning clinical tumor volume (PTV1) was 66-68 Gy (2.0-2.2 Gy/fraction). The dose to the planning regional lymph node drainage area volume (PTV2) was 46 Gy (2.0 Gy/fraction). Treatment response, adverse events, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and locoregional failure-free survival (LRFFS) were analyzed. Twenty-six patients were included. The median follow-up was 31 (range, 4.3-51.3) months. Sixteen (61.5%) patients had a complete response, and four (15.4%) achieved a partial response. The objective response rate was 76.9%, and the disease control rate was 80.8%. The median PFS and OS were not achieved. The 4-year PFS was 63.9%, and the 4-year OS was 71.0%. Grade 1-2 and 3-4 radiation-related esophagitis was observed in 15 (57.7%) and one (4.5%) patients, respectively. Grade 1-2 and 3-4 radiation-related pneumonitis was observed in 12 (46.2%) and one (4.5%) patients, respectively. No patients developed radiation-related heart or skin damage. The modified target volume definition and increased dose of definitive radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy in patients with ESCC had low toxicity and might improve survival, but additional trials are necessary to prove the superiority of this strategy.Copyright © 2021 Xiaofen Pan et al.",Excluded

1694,"Radiosurgery Ablation of Medial Branch Nerves of the Lumbar Spine for Facetogenic Back Pain: A Dosimetric Evaluation of Targeting and Safety. Purpose/Objective(s): Low back pain is a common problem across the population and is often multifactorial in etiology. Pain may originate from the facet in 15-40% of cases. Invasive nerve ablation techniques with interventional radiology (IR) targeting the medial branches of the primary dorsal ramus can be effective tools for pain alleviation, though the response may not be durable. Ablative therapies such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and stereotactic ablative radiosurgery (SABR) can be used for nerve ablation in settings such as trigeminal neuralgia. Robotic arm radiosurgery facet rhizotomy has been tested in a pilot series of patients with safe results. We hypothesize that LINAC-based SABR may be a non-invasive option for delivering ablative radiation dose to the medial branch nerves of the lumbar spine, with the goal of prolonged pain control while maintaining low doses to surrounding organs at risk (OARs). Materials/Methods: Anonymized CT images of the lumbosacral spine were obtained from 5 patients immobilized and scanned at our facility with 1.25mm slice thickness and treated for issues unrelated to back pain. With the assistance of an interventional radiologist who regularly performs medial branch nerve blocks and RFA, the branch nerves were contoured for the L2 and L3 levels bilaterally. Four non-coplanar dynamic conformal arcs were used to target the nerves, with both nerves as PTV. We attempted to spare the motor nerve roots and other OARs. In addition, we ran an eight-beam IMRT comparison plan targeting the L2 to L3 facet with a 1mm expansion as PTV. Single fraction SABR was planned with 50Gy dose to the isocenter for each treatment plan. The PTV dose coverage and dose to the OARs were tabulated and compared. Result(s): The following table shows the relevant treatment volumes and OAR doses. We avoided excessive doses to the surrounding structures in the plans for all 5 patients bilaterally. Coverage was acceptable with an average of 45 Gy covering the 90% IDL. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates the feasibility of delivering ablative doses of SABR to the medial branch nerves of the lumbar spine below the level of the cord. OARs received acceptable doses, with lower values obtained from the plans with targeted radiation to the nerves when compared with plans involving radiation to the entire facet. PTV coverage was not compromised. Though efficacy would require in vivo testing, with accurate targeting and the assistance of IR in selecting appropriate patients, SABR may provide a noninvasive, reasonable, and effective treatment option for facetogenic low back pain.

OBJECTIVES: Pre-pectoral breast reconstruction is a less invasive technique compared to dual plane technique and shows promise in improving patient outcomes. This study compares hospital length of stay (LOS) and post-operative outcomes of pre-pectoral (PP) and dual plane (DP) techniques of breast reconstruction. METHOD(S): This single-site, retrospective cohort study included data from breast reconstruction procedures from June 2013 to March 2016. Data collected included demographics, chemotherapy/radiation exposure, surgical technique, LOS, drain usage, post-operative incision care and 90 day post-operative complications. Two-sided T-test and Chi-square or Fisher's Exact tests were performed at alpha = 0.05. RESULT(S): The study included data on 176 patients (DP=117, PP=59) and 335 breasts (DP=225, PP=110). The PP group had a higher BMI (29.5 vs. 26.3 kg/m2; p=0.0017), and a significantly higher proportion of patients with diabetes (13.6% vs. 2.6%; p=0.0073), hypertension (35.6% vs. 17.1%; p=0.0061), and prior breast surgery (36.8% vs. 22.2%; p=0.0415). A higher proportion of PP patients received ciNPT (57.6% vs. 25.6%; p< 0.0001) compared to the DP group. There were no differences in complication rates between the two groups. The PP group had a significantly lower LOS compared to DP (mean: 1.1 vs. 1.8 days, p< 0.0001). Nearly 95% of PP patients were discharged after 1 hospital day compared to only 25.6% of the DP patients (p< 0.0001). Results of multiple regression models were similar to the univariate analyses after controlling for effects of age, BMI, ciNPT use, diabetes, hypertension and prior breast surgery. CONCLUSION(S): This study demonstrated a significantly lower hospital LOS in the PP group compared to DP technique. Complication rates were similar between the two groups even though the PP group was more complex.

The patients were followed for a mean time of 28 months (range, 5-78 months) with periodic Doppler studies, angiography, CT angiography, or clinically., RESULTS: In the total 19 stented carotid arteries, 23 procedures were performed (22 stent placement procedures and one repeat angioplasty). The procedural stroke rate was 1/23 (4%). The procedural transient ischemic attack rate was 0/23 (0%). There was one other observed complication: a puncture site hematoma. The 30-day postprocedure complication rate was 0/23 (0%); no neurologic symptoms were reported. Fifteen of the 19 vessels (79%) developed no new stenosis throughout the follow-up period. Two of 19 (11%) vessels had repeat angioplasty and stent placement; 1/19 (5%) had a repeat angioplasty. One restented vessel has remained patent for 50 months. Another restented vessel required a third stent placement 17 months after the second.

To analyze the treatment results and late complications of high-dose-rate (HDR) interstitial brachytherapy (ISBT) for early (T1N0, T2N0) mobile tongue cancer using the microSelectron-HDR. Methods. From January 1993 through April 2001, a total of 72 patients with early squamous cell carcinomas of the mobile tongue were treated with microSelectron-HDR interstitial brachytherapy at the Department of Radiology, Osaka University Hospital. Of the patients, 18% were treated with a combination of prior external radiation and HDR-ISBT, and 82% were treated with HDR-ISBT alone. For HDR-ISBT alone, all cases were treated with a total dose of 54 Gy/9 fractions every 5 days or 60 Gy/10 fractions every 8 days. In combined therapy with an external dose of 30 to 40 Gy, HDR-ISBT was given at a total dose of 42-50 Gy. The Brinkman and alcohol indexes were used to analyze the incidence of late complications after HDR-ISBT. Results. The 2- and 5-year local control rates were 85% and 82%, respectively. Fifteen of 72 patients (21%) treated with HDR-ISBT had late complications. Ten of 15 patients (67%) with late complications had a Brinkman index exceeding 600. Conclusions. HDR-ISBT is useful and easily applied under local anesthesia to early or superficial lesions of the mobile tongue. However, we found an increase in late complications, such as soft-tissue ulcers and bone exposure, after irradiation of tongue cancer with 60 Gy HDR-ISBT in patients with a Brinkman index greater than 600. © Japanese Society for Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology Springer-Verlag Tokyo 2005.",Excluded

Crossover suppression by tandem duplication may be attributed to intrastrand foldbacks of the type regularly seen in somatic polytene chromosomes. As a consequence, linkage disequilibrium between duplicated elements and normal chromosomes should be more profound than has been supposed.

The experimental group (30 patients) was treated with ""Xinjingjie mouthrinse"" during the full course of radiotherapy, 4 times daily with 5 mL and 5 min each time. The control group (30 patients) rinsed the mouth in the same way with normal saline. Oral mucositis was assessed according to the RTOG criteria. The severity of mucositis and the degree of pain were recorded and photographed. Patients shouldn't be treated with other drugs until the level of oral mucositis reached above grade III. The results were statistically analyzed using Stata 12.0 software packages., RESULTS: Age, gender, radiotherapy techniques and dose showed no significant difference between the 2 groups (P>0.05). The first onset of oral mucositis in the experimental group was later than that in the control group (11.0 times:9.1 times,P<0.05), and the incidence of pain at the early time of radiotherapy was lower (36.7%: 70.0%, P<0.05).

In these illustrative cases, the GdMRI demonstrated intrinsic high signal or contrast enhancement within the cochlea and labyrinth in the absence of a retrocochlear mass. In one patient with meningogenic labyrinthitis, cochlear enhancement on MRI led to prompt cochlear implantation before the potential development of cochlear ossification., CONCLUSION: Our experience suggests that GdMRI plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of cochlear pathology associated with sensorineural hearing loss and may directly impact patient management.",Excluded
105,"Diagnostic radiography and adult acute myeloid leukaemia: an interview and medical chart review study. BACKGROUND: Aetiology of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is not well understood, perhaps because of its distinct subtypes. High-dose ionising radiation is a known risk factor, but less is known about risk from low-dose exposure such as from diagnostic radiography., METHODS: Subjects were 412 matched case-control pairs. Ten-year subject histories of diagnostic radiography were based on interview and medical records., RESULTS: There was no convincing association between AML risk and ionising radiation exposure from diagnostic imaging procedures, either for AML overall or for any AML subtype., CONCLUSION: The association between diagnostic radiography and AML risk remains uncertain.",Excluded
2695,"Exposure of patients to low doses of X-radiation during neuro-interventional imaging and procedures: Dose estimation and analysis of gamma-H2AX foci and gene expression in blood lymphocytes. Radiation has widespread applications in medicine. However, despite the benefits of medical radiation exposures, adverse long-term health effects are cause for concern. Protein and gene biomarkers are early indicators of cellular response after low-dose exposure. We examined DNA damage by quantifying gamma-H2AX foci and expression of twelve candidate genes in the blood lymphocytes of patients exposed to low doses of X-radiation during neuro-interventional procedures. Entrance surface dose (ESD; 10.92-1062.55 mGy) was measured by thermoluminescence dosimetry (TLD). Absorbed dose was estimated using gamma-H2AX focus frequency and gene expression, with in vitro dose-response curves generated for the same biomarkers. gamma-H2AX foci in post-exposure samples were significantly higher than in pre-exposure samples. Among the genes analysed, FDXR, ATM, BCL2, MDM2, TNFSF9, and PCNA showed increased expression; CDKN1A, DDB2, SESN1, BAX, and TNFRSF10B showed unchanged or decreased expression. Absorbed dose, estimated based on gamma-H2AX focus frequency and gene expression changes, did not show any correlation with measured ESD. Patients undergoing interventional procedures receive considerable radiation doses, resulting in DNA damage and altered gene expression. Medical procedures should be carried out using the lowest radiation doses possible without compromising treatment. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1847,"Assessment of ocular exposure to ultraviolet-B for population studies. Salisbury Eye Evaluation Project Team. We have developed an empirical model with which to estimate the ocular exposure in the UVB wavelength band. This model incorporates aspects of personal behavior, geographic location, season and wavelength that have been developed from population-based data. This model, in conjunction with job history interviews, allows the estimate of cumulative exposures from age 30 in our population-based study. We present data on average annual exposure by age, gender, race, education and reported photophobia. The exposures in the general population are considerably lower than exposures reported in previous works based on occupational groups. There is a statistically significant difference between males and females, with females having lower exposures. African-Americans have median exposures similar to whites. Exposures decrease with education and with reported photophobia. These data provide the basis for characterizing lifetime exposure for the general population. The variability of exposure is much greater than found in occupational groups and includes numbers in the lowest exposure. The model should permit determination of a dose-response relationship with eye disease, even to the lower dose ranges.",Excluded
1784,"Tobacco smoke is phototoxic. BACKGROUND: Both cigarette smoke and ultraviolet (UV) radiation are known to cause changes of the skin which can be regarded as premature ageing., OBJECTIVES: To assess the theory that the effects of these two exposures could be linked by a phototoxic action of cigarette smoke., METHODS: A photohaemolysis test was used, in which human erythrocytes were incubated with cigarette smoke condensate, followed by UV irradiation and measurement of exposure-dependent haemolysis., RESULTS: Cigarette smoke condensate was clearly phototoxic. Photohaemolysis depended on the concentration of the condensate and UV dose and was more pronounced after exposure to UVA-rich than UVB-rich radiation., CONCLUSIONS: Phototoxicity may be a mechanism by which cigarette smoking causes premature skin ageing. An enhancing effect on photocarcinogenesis has also to be considered.",Excluded
1174,"Feasibility of an adaptive strategy in preoperative radiochemotherapy for rectal cancer with image-guided tomotherapy: Boosting the dose to the shrinking tumor. Purpose: To investigate the feasibility of preoperative adaptive radiochemotherapy by delivering a concomitant boost to the residual tumor during the last 6 fractions of treatment. Methods and Materials: Twenty-five patients with T3/T4N0 or N+ rectal cancer were enrolled. Concomitant chemotherapy consisted of oxaliplatin 100 mg/m2 on days -14, 0, and +14, and 5-fluorouracil 200 mg/m2/d from day -14 to the end of radiation therapy (day 0 is the start of radiation therapy). Radiation therapy consisted of 41.4 Gy in 18 fractions (2.3 Gy per fraction) with Tomotherapy to the tumor and regional lymph nodes (planning target volume, PTV) defined on simulation CT and MRI. After 9 fractions simulation CT and MRI were repeated for the planning of the adaptive phase: PTVadapt was generated by adding a 5-mm margin to the residual tumor. In the last 6 fractions a boost of 3.0 Gy per fraction (in total 45.6 Gy in 18 fractions) was delivered to PTVadapt while concomitantly delivering 2.3 Gy per fraction to PTV outside PTVadapt. Result(s): Three patients experienced grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity; 2 of 3 showed toxicity before the adaptive phase. Full dose of radiation therapy, oxaliplatin, and 5-fluorouracil was delivered in 96%, 96%, and 88% of patients, respectively. Two patients with clinical complete response (cCR) refused surgery and were still cCR at 17 and 29 months. For the remaining 23 resected patients, 15 of 23 (65%) showed tumor regression grade 3 response, and 7 of 23 (30%) had pathologic complete response; 8 (35%) and 12 (52%) tumor regression grade 3 patients had <=5% and 10% residual viable cells, respectively. Conclusion(s): An adaptive boost strategy is feasible, with an acceptable grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity rate and a very encouraging tumor response rate. The results suggest that there should still be room for further dose escalation of the residual tumor with the aim of increasing pathologic complete response and/or cCR rates. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
124,"Dopaminergic Modulation of Sensory Attenuation in Parkinson's Disease: Is There an Underlying Modulation of Beta Power?. Background and Aims: Pathological high amplitude of beta oscillations is thought as the underlying mechanism of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), in particular with regard to bradykinesia. In addition, abnormality in a neurophysiological phenomenon labeled sensory attenuation has been found in patients with PD. The current study explored the hypothesis that the abnormal sensory attenuation has a causal link with the typical abnormality in beta oscillations in PD. Method(s): The study tested sixteen right-handed patients with a diagnosis of PD and 22 healthy participants, which were matched by age and gender. Somatosensory evoked potentials were elicited through electrical stimulation of the median nerve at the wrist. Electrical activity was recorded at the scalp using a 128 channels EEG. Somatosensory evoked potentials were recorded in 2 conditions: at rest and at the onset of a voluntary movement, which was a self-paced abduction movement of the right thumb. Result(s): Healthy participants showed a reduction of the N20-P25 amplitude at the onset of the right thumb abduction compared to the rest condition (P < 0.05). When patients were OFF medication, they showed mild reduction of the N20-P25 component at movement onset (P < 0.05). On the contrary, they did show greater attenuation of the N20-P25 component at the onset of movement compared to the rest condition when ON medication (P < 0.05). There was no significant evidence of a link between the degree of sensory attenuation and the change in beta oscillations in our cohort of patients. Conclusion(s): These results confirmed a significant link between dopaminergic modulation and sensory attenuation. However, the sensory attenuation and beta oscillations were found as two independent phenomena.© Copyright © 2019 Macerollo, Limousin, Korlipara, Foltynie, Edwards and Kilner.",Excluded

Background and purpose: To define the rate of development of symptomatic chest failures in extensive stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) after undergoing post-chemotherapy chest radiotherapy (RT). Material(s) and Method(s): Patients had ES-SCLC, attained an objective response to chemotherapy and signed study consent. Target accrual was 33 patients. Patients were offered prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) as per department policy. PCI (25 Gy/10 fractions) and chest RT (40 Gy/15 fractions) were given simultaneously 4-8 weeks after chemotherapy completion. Thoracic target volume was the post-chemotherapy residual chest disease plus margin. Patients were evaluated for RT toxicities, local control, disease-free and overall survival. Result(s): Thirty-two patients were evaluable. Twenty-nine patients completed RT without delay. There were 4 complete responses and 28 partial responses to chemotherapy. All study patients received PCI. Maximal acute RT toxicity was grade 2 esophagitis (18 patients). There were no RT-related deaths. Median time to disease progression and overall survival were 4.2 and 8.3 months, respectively (median follow-up = 21.8 months). Of 16 chest recurrences, 7 were in the irradiated region and 5 were symptomatic. Conclusion(s): Post-chemotherapy consolidation chest RT for ES-SCLC patients on this trial was well tolerated and associated with symptomatic chest recurrences in only 5/32 treated patients. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We conducted a 10-week prospective study of a convenience sample of patients transported to a level one trauma center immobilized with a backboard and cervical collar. Total backboard time (TBT) was measured from the time the ambulance left the scene to the time the patient was removed from the backboard, while total ED backboard time (TEDBT) was measured from the time of arrival at the ED to the time of backboard removal. There were 138 patients entered in the study. Insufficient data excluded 36 patients from further analysis. TBT was available for 92 patients and averaged 63.63 (+/-45.87) minutes. Dividing patients into those who were removed from the backboard prior to radiographs (n = 85), the TBT average was 53.9 minutes (+/-30.1), whereas the average for those who had radiographs prior to removal from the backboard (n = 7) was 181.3 minutes (+/-41.6).

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this split-mouth, double blinded, short-term, controlled clinical trial was to study the effect of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) for treatment of chronic periodontitis., BACKGROUND DATA: LLLT is reported to improve the outcome of traditional SRP, but the evidence is still weak., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with a probing pocket depth (PPD) of 4-6 mm involving at least three teeth in each quadrant were recruited for the study. Afterwards, SRP quadrants were randomly assigned for 10 sessions of LLLT., RESULTS: Results showed that when compared to sites treated with SRP alone, those treated with SRP+LLLT (10 sessions, 830 nm, 100 mW, 3 J per point, 3 J/cm(2)) exhibited greater reductions in PPD at 5 weeks and 3 months but not at 6 months. Further, SRP+LLLT-treated sites had a statistically significant increase in mean radiographic bone density when comparing 6- and 12-month data and overall from baseline to 12 months. There was a trend to reduce interleukin (IL)-1beta but the difference between control and laser sites was not statistically significant., CONCLUSIONS: SRP combined with LLLT improved radiographic bone density and short-term PPD reduction in patients with chronic periodontitis, but did not significantly affect either the gingival crevicular fluid of IL-1beta or the gingival or plaque index.",Excluded

Radon exposure is associated with an increased incidence of lung cancer, and elevated levels may be found in as many as 1 out of 15 homes. The U.S. EPA recommends testing homes for radon and mitigating over the advisory level of 4 picocuries per liter (4 pCi L(-1), or 148 Bq m(-3)). A sample population from a list of Vermont residents who had tested their residence for radon through the Vermont Department of Health and who had elevated levels were mailed a survey to assess demographic characteristics, knowledge about radon, mitigation rates, types of mitigation, as well as barriers to mitigation. The response rate was 63%. Forty-three percent of respondents mitigated. Roughly half were not completely knowledgeable of radon based upon the ability to associate radon exposure with lung cancer risk. Reasons not to mitigate radon levels in homes were cost and lack of concern over elevated levels. A multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed factors associated with mitigating: an education level of college or higher (p = 0.02), concern that a high radon level would affect real estate value (p = 0.04), and home age less than 10 y (p = 0.05). In summary, less than half of Vermonters with elevated radon levels participating in the Department of Health program mitigated.

We compared the PET findings with computed tomography (CT), which was available in 21 (55%) patients, and tabulated the changes in the diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic management that were prompted by PET during a follow-up period of 10 to 36 months., RESULTS: Compared with PET, the extent of disease was underestimated by CT in 5 (13%) patients. Planned surgical resection of metastases was canceled in two of these patients. In another patient, surveillance PET detected an unsuspected hypermetabolic abdominal mass that was noted on a subsequent CT to arise from the small bowel. The mass was found to be jejunal metastatic melanoma at the time of resection. Overall, PET influenced surgical management in 3 (8%) patients, but it did not affect the wait-and-watch strategy or decision to initiate immunotherapy in the others., CONCLUSIONS: FDG PET contributes important information not provided by CT and has a substantial effect on the clinical management of patients with malignant melanoma.",Excluded

PURPOSE: The oral complications associated with radiotherapy to the head and neck are a significant dose-limiting factor. The goals of this study were to determine whether oropharyngeal rinsing and ingestion of misoprostol protect mucous membranes from the acute effects of irradiation, and to evaluate the quality-of-life (QOL) outcomes of patients receiving misoprostol. We report the results of the QOL outcomes of patients in this study., METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 33 patients with resected or intact cancer of the oral cavity, oropharynx, supraglottic larynx, or hypopharynx were registered to receive postoperative radiotherapy plus misoprostol or primary radiotherapy plus misoprostol. All patients were scheduled to receive 60-70 Gy at 2 Gy/d within 6-7 weeks. QOL and function were evaluated., RESULTS: A decrease in the QOL and function occurred in all areas covered by the questionnaire at the 6-week interval. This decrease was significant for eating, saliva, taste, and mucous. Of these significant factors, taste, saliva, and mucous consistency had not resolved by 12 weeks., CONCLUSION: Increased understanding of the impact of treatment on QOL and symptoms will formulate the rational design of toxicity interventions and enhance the multidisciplinary care of head-and-neck patients.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of computed tomography (CT) attenuation measurements for assessing bone mineral density (BMD) and predicting osteoporosis in thoracic and abdominal CT scans for various clinical indications using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as reference standard., RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 234 patients (147 women, 87 men) undergoing DXA and CT were examined retrospectively. Mean time between both studies was 0.5 years. CT-attenuation values in Hounsfield units (HU) were measured at the thoracic and lumbar spine (T1, T6, T12, L1-L5), at the femoral neck, and then assigned to their corresponding DXA scores., RESULTS: Patients with DXA-defined osteoporosis or osteopenia showed significantly lower HU values of trabecular bone at all measured levels compared to healthy subjects (p < 0.001). HU values were highest at T1 and T6, lowest at L1-L3 and the femoral neck. There were no significant intraindividual differences between HU values in the sagittal, coronal or transversal plane. Significant differences between normal and abnormal BMD categories were verified for three CT scanners. More than half of all fractures were detected in patients with non-osteoporotic DXA T-scores., CONCLUSIONS: Abdominal and particularly thoracic CT scans obtained for other clinical indications can sensibly be applied toward determining low BMD, detecting osteoporosis and identifying persons at increased fracture risk. Osteoporotic morbidity and mortality might be minimized. Superiorly to DXA, fragility fractures can be found without additional imaging or radiation exposure which can initiate early adequate treatment., LIMITATIONS: Key limitations of the study were as following: a retrospective, single-center study; small patient cohort - larger cohorts are needed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic performance measurements; more complex CT evaluation of the hip for BMD assessment; DXA measurements were used as a reference standard, however, patients with unsuspected compression fractures but showing osteopenic or even normal BMD outline the limitations of DXA.",Excluded

The main purposes of this study were to identify the major determinants of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in the high-background radiation areas (HBRA) in Yangjiang, China and to evaluate their potential confounding effects on the NPC risk associated with exposure to high background radiation. A matched case-control study was conducted using those who died of NPC during the period 1987-1995. Two controls were randomly selected for each case from those who died from causes other than malignancies and external causes. Cases and their controls were matched with respect to sex and the years of birth and death (+/- 5 years). Study subjects' next-of-kin were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire to collect information on socioeconomic status, dietary habits, tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption, disease history, pesticide use, medical X-ray exposure, the family history of NPC and so on. We succeeded in interviewing 97 cases and 192 controls. Univariate conditional logistic regression analysis showed that NPC risk was associated with the consumption of salted fish, homemade pickles, and fermented soy beans, education levels, the history of chronic rhinitis, and the family history of NPC. Multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis revealed that education levels (Odds ratio (OR) for middle school or higher levels vs. no school education = 3.8, 95% CI = 1.2 to 11.8), salted fish intake (OR = 3.2, 95% CI = 1.7 to 6.1), the history of chronic rhinitis (OR = 3.6, 95% CI = 1.3 to 10.1), and the family history of NPC (OR = 14.2, 95% CI = 2.7 to 73.4) were independent risk factors of NPC. Tobacco smoking (OR = 1.2, 95% CI = 0.7 to 2.1), and alcohol consumption (OR = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.5 to 1.9) were not significantly related to NPC risk.

2985,"The Mice Drawer System (MDS) experiment and the space endurance record-breaking mice. The Italian Space Agency, in line with its scientific strategies and the National Utilization Plan for the International Space Station (ISS), contracted Thales Alenia Space Italia to design and build a spaceflight payload for rodent research on ISS: the Mice Drawer System (MDS). The payload, to be integrated inside the Space Shuttle middeck during transportation and inside the Express Rack in the ISS during experiment execution, was designed to function autonomously for more than 3 months and to involve crew only for maintenance activities. In its first mission, three wild type (Wt) and three transgenic male mice over-expressing pleiotrophin under the control of a bone-specific promoter (PTN-Tg) were housed in the MDS. At the time of launch, animals were 2-months old. MDS reached the ISS on board of Shuttle Discovery Flight 17A/STS-128 on August 28(th), 2009. MDS returned to Earth on November 27(th), 2009 with Shuttle Atlantis Flight ULF3/STS-129 after 91 days, performing the longest permanence of mice in space.

BACKGROUND: This registry study evaluated the effects of Pycnogenol on edema and thrombotic complications in long-haul flights; jet lag was also evaluated. METHOD(S): Four hundred and fifty subjects at different risk levels for thrombosis, flying in economy class twice in less than a week for more than 8 hours, were included; 295 completed the registry study and were subdivided in 3 groups according to their risk level - low, moderate, or high. The high-risk group also received Aspirin. Astandard management (SM) was used in all groups. In each risk category, three groups were made according to patient management: A Pycnogenol group, a SM group (control), and a stockings group. The groups were comparable at inclusion. No side effects were observed. RESULT(S): In the low risk group edema were reduced more (P<0.05) with Pycnogenol and stockings compared to control. Ankle circumference was smaller with Pycnogenol (P<0.05). No thrombosis was detected. D-dimer was negative in Pycnogenol subjects; one subject in the control group had increased values, as did two of the 36 subjects in the stockings group. In the group with moderate risk, edema and ankle circumference were lower in the Pycnogenol group (P<0.05). One deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and one minimal superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) was seen in controls. D-dimer was normal in the Pycnogenol group. In high-risk subjects, edema, and ankle circumference were significantly reduced in the Pycnogenol group (P<0.05). There were no SVT or DVT in the Pycnogenol group. One minimal DVT and one SVT were observed in controls. D-dimer was negative in all Pycnogenol subjects (P<0.05); three post-flight values increased in controls and in four of the 32 subjects in the stockings group. The jet lag score was lower in low-, medium-, and high-risk Pycnogenol subjects (P<0.05).

Purpose: The study aimed to compare two successive series of procedure using first pieces of natural madreporic coral, then coralline hydroxyapatite in traumatology. The goal of this work was to evaluate long term radiological features of absorption and influencing factors. Material: Within six years, 65 pieces were used; only impaction articular fracture on the lateral tibial plateau (31) and calcaneum fractures (23) were included 21 cases completed inclusion criteria. As there were 3 secondary infections, 18 had therefore, an aseptic evolution and were included in this series. Method(s): Absorption was evaluated in five degrees according to the volume of the remaining piece on X-rays. We also took into consideration the position of the pieces and the amount of surfaces in contact with cancellous bone. Result(s): Among the 18 pieces followed up for more than 19 months (average 40), there were 4 sequestrations (1 tibia, 3 calcaneum), all were natural madreporic coral, the others presented osteointegration. Only natural madreporic coral pieces were absorbed, but never completely and the absorption was slow (3 to 7 years) and never complete. A radiolucent line was present in 7 out of 10 pieces of madreporic coral and none around coralline hydroxyapatite. Three developed favorably. Four were sequestered. Number of surfaces in contact with cancellous bone was correlated with osteointegration. Discussion(s): The calcium carbonate which makes up the natural madreporic coral pieces is the Site of destruction by osteoclasts. The radiolucent line is the specific witness of this biochemical activity. The radiolucent line preceeds sequestrations. No substitute of coralline hydroxyapatite has presented the same sign of peripheral absorption or sequestration. Coralline hydroxyapatite could be the correct coralline material to fill cancellous defect after elevation of an articular depression. In every case, the piece of coral must be fitted in contact with the cancellous bone in the depth of the bone. Conditions of osteoconduction of madreporic coral must be reconsidered. The degree and speed of peripheral absorption must be controlled before weight bearing is allowed.",Excluded

Background. This study aimed to analyze differences in necrotic changes between cortical and cancellous bone in resection margins after segmental mandibulectomy for advanced mandibular osteoradionecrosis. Methods. Anteroposterior bone specimens from eleven patients who underwent segmental mandibulectomy with simultaneous free fibula flap reconstruction for advanced osteoradionecrosis were analyzed histopathologically for the presence of necrotic bone based on the presence of blood vessels within Haversian canals. Results. Ten of eleven (91%) cortices near the inferior border of the mandible at the anterior margins were necrotic. All cancellous bones at the anterior margins were viable. Seven of eleven (64%) cortices near the inferior border of the mandible at the posterior margins were necrotic. Three of eleven (27%) cancellous bones at the posterior margins were necrotic. Conclusion. Necrotic changes are more prevalent in cortices than in cancellous bones in mandibular osteoradionecrosis, probably due to a decrease of periosteal blood supply caused by radiotherapy.Copyright © 2017 Masaya Akashi et al.",Excluded

Oesophageal cancer, a disease with high morbidity and mortality, has a relatively high incidence in eastern India, usually presenting at advanced stage. The main aim of treatment for majority of patients remains palliation of dysphagia, which can be effectively done by intraluminal brachytherapy with or without external radiotherapy. Between January 2006 to January 2010 a total of 35 patients with advanced/metastatic (24/35) or recurrent (11/35) oesophageal carcinoma were treated with intraluminalhigh dose rate (HDR) iridium192 source brachytherapy at Medical College Hospitals, Kolkata. Selection for palliative brachytherapy includes one or more of the following criteria: Lesion more than 5 cm long on imaging studies or upper GI endoscopy, Karnofsky performance status <50%, Locoregional recurrence. Palliative external radiotherapy (20Gy/5# or 30 Gy/10#) was given to 11 patients (31.42%) before brachytherapy. All patients treated with 2 fractions of high dose rate-intraluminal brachytherapy (HDRILRT) one week apart with 600 cGy per fraction at 1 cm off axis. Thirty-five patients were treated with palliative HDR-ILRT. Significant improvement in swallowing status was seen in 20 patients (57.14%) since just after treatment up to 7.5 months. However, 9 patients (25.71%) showed no improvement, and 6 patients (17.14%) showed no changes in dysphagia scoring.

3543,"RAPID lung cancer diagnostic and care pathway from referral to treatment. Introduction: This was a pilot prospective study which compared RAPID lung cancer pathway with existing arrangements for diagnosis, staging and treatment of lung cancer. Aim(s): Early diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer improves survival. We compared RAPID lung cancer pathway with existing arrangements to reduce the hurdles in early diagnosis and provision of treatment to potential lung cancer patients. Early investigations identify non-cancer patients quicker. Method(s): On existing pathway chest X-ray (CXR) is requested by general practitioner (GP) as a first line investigation on lung cancer suspicion. If CXR is reported as abnormal then radiology requests a CT thorax with urgent request for GP to refer to hospital after discussion with the patient. On RAPID pathway, abnormal X-ray report is highlighted to lung cancer coordinator who Organizes GP referral, speaks to patient directly and organizes them to attend hospital for CT thorax, Lung function test, Respiratory physician appointment and lung cancer specialist nurse review on the same day. We looked at both pathways to see the number of days it took from referral to investigations. Result(s): There was reduction in time over 6 months from GP referral to hospital appointment from a median of 12 days to 4 days on RAPID pathway. It also expedited the CT thorax from a median of 7 days to 4 days on RAPID pathway.

OBJECTIVE: To outline the indications and limits of the myo-mucosal buccinator island flap based on the facial artery in the reconstruction of deficits of the buccal cavity and lateral wall of the oropharynx following oncologic resection or radionecrosis., METHOD: We retrospectively studied 40 patients. Flap is raised using a modified technique without Doppler or skin incision to identify the facial artery. This study identifies causes for failure and limits and indications for this flap., RESULTS: We found a failure rate of 10% and an identical fistula rate. On the other hand success rate is over 95% when (1) permeability of the artery is confirmed preoperatively in post-neck dissection or post-radiation therapy patients and (2) the deficit does not cross the midline., CONCLUSION: The myo-mucosal buccinator flap is a reliable technique. When specific indications are followed and the flap raised appropriately, the succes rate is 95%.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: Chemoradiation is the preferred treatment for advanced stage IV head and neck cancer. Higher doses of chemotherapy yielded promising results in vitro and vivo, confirmed by intra-arterial (IA) cisplatin-based chemoradiation in phase 2 studies. METHOD(S): Two hundred and thirty-nine patients with (functionally) unresectable head and neck cancer were included, from 2000 to 2004, in a multicenter, randomized phase 3 trial, comparing IA and intravenous chemoradiation. Intravenous chemoradiation comprised 3x100 mg/m 2 cisplatin infusion on Days 1, 22, 43 combined with 70 Gy in 35 daily fractions. The IA chemoradiation treatment arm comprised 4x150 mg/m2 cisplatin administered in the tumor-feeding artery on Days 1, 8, 15, 22, immediately followed by systemic rescue with sodium thiosulfate with the same radiotherapeutic regimen. RESULT(S): Two patients were excluded from analysis because of nontreatment-related death immediately after randomization (n=1) and esophageal carcinoma (n=1). The median follow-up was 33 months 1-104 months. Ninety percent of the patients required tube feeding during treatment. Renal toxicity >grade 2 was 9% in the intravenous compared with 1% in the IA treatment arm (P <= .0001). There was no difference in locoregional control, disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS), between the treatment arms. At 3 years, local control, locoregional control, DFS, and OS was .76, .63, .44, .51 in the IA versus .70, .65, .47, .47 in the intravenous treatment arm, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): Cisplatin-based IA chemoradiation was not superior to intravenous chemoradiation for advanced stage IV head and neck cancer regarding locoregional control and survival. © 2010 American Cancer Society.",Excluded
2773,"Reirradiation with robotic stereotactic body radiotherapy for recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma. BACKGROUND: Recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) after previous radiotherapy is challenging. There is no standard approach for salvage treatment. Here we present toxicity and treatment results for recurrent NFC patients who underwent fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT) as second line radiotherapy (RT)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between April 2009 and July 2012, 24 patients, with a male to female ratio of 3:1, were treated with CykerKnife R FSRT for recurrent NFC in our institution. Seven out of 24 patients had metastatic recurrent disease. Median age was 53 years (range, 20-70 years). Initial RT dose was 70Gy. The time period between initial RT and FSRT was a median of 33.2 months. The median prescription dose for FSRT was 30Gy (range, 24-30 Gy) in a median of 5 fractions (range, 4-6)., RESULTS: The median follow-up for all patients was 19.5 months (IQR: 12.2. -29.2 months). The locoregional control; progression free survival and overall survival (OS) rates for 1-, 2- and 3-year were 64%, 38%, 21%; 60%, 30%, 17% and 83%, 43%, 31%, respectively. Median OS for the entire cohort was 22 months (95% CI: 16.5-27.5). On multivariate analysis recurrent tumor stage was the only prognostic factor for OS (p=0.004). One patient exhibited grade III temporal lobe necrosis. One died because of grade IV mucositis and overlapping infection., CONCLUSIONS: The treatment of recurrent NPC is controversial. Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy is promising. However, the published trials are heterogeneous with respect to the selection criteria and treatment details.

889,"Can low-dose unenhanced chest CT be used for follow-up of lung nodules?. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to establish the difference in lung nodule volume between standard-dose contrast-enhanced and low-dose unenhanced CT., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with known pulmonary metastases underwent three CT examinations on 1 day: two unenhanced low-dose (120 kVp and 30 mAs) and a standard-dose (120-140 kVp and 75-200 mAs) contrast-enhanced chest CT examinations. For nodules<1000 mm3, nodule volume was quantified using dedicated software from the CT manufacturer. Wilcoxon's signed rank tests were used for analysis of nodules<=200 mm3 and >200 mm3 (approximately diameter of 8 mm)., RESULTS: One hundred one nodules (n=69<=200 mm3) were analyzed in 15 of these subjects. Measured volume of nodules<=200 mm3 was systematically lower on both low-dose unenhanced CT examinations when compared with standard-dose contrast-enhanced CT (differences, 13.7% and 15.5%, respectively; p<0.0001), but nodule volume was not different between low-dose CT (median difference, 1.0%; p=0.10). Nodule volume was not systematically different between the protocols for nodules>200 mm3 (p>0.30)., CONCLUSION: For lung nodules<=200 mm3 (approximately 8 mm) the measured volume on low-dose unenhanced CT is significantly lower when compared with standard-dose contrast-enhanced CT. This effect is likely due to contrast administration rather than other imaging parameters, which should be taken into account in the follow-up of lung nodules because growth can remain undetected or doubling time underestimated.",Excluded
1304,"Occupational risk factors and reproductive health of women. BACKGROUND: This in-depth review summarizes and interprets the available recent epidemiologic evidence on the relationship between occupational exposures and negative reproductive outcome among women workers. METHODS: The studies examined by the review include those published in the international scientific literature since 1990, and were identified through the search of relevant data banks using selected keywords. RESULTS: From the examination of studies dealing with exposures of women to chemical agents, pesticides, physical agents, ergonomic factors and stress, it appears that at present the evidence is sufficient to warrant the maximum protection of pregnant women to several well-documented occupational risk factors. These include exposures to anaesthetic gases, antineoplastic drugs, heavy metals, solvents, heavy physical work and irregular work schedules. For other work risks, such as exposure to non-ionizing radiation and psychosocial work stress, the evidence is often suggestive but not conclusive. CONCLUSIONS: Policy makers and health professionals should advise women and employers to avoid exposure to the well-known occupational risk factors, while epidemiologic research should pursue methodological improvements and provide more insight into the magnitude of exposures responsible for detrimental effects.

Radiation-induced hemorrhagic proctitis (RIHP) is a serious complication of pelvic irradiation, and a 4% formalin solution has been used for 20 years in treating this sequelae. The first case involving formalin application for treatment of RIHP in Korea was reported in 1996, but there are no additional studies beyond this date. Our study reviews the use of formalin instillation and selective application. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the outcome of such treatments, beginning with the first case at our hospital. From 1996 to 2005, five RIHP patients had received formalin treatment for RIHP symptoms intractable to other medical treatments. All treatments were performed by a single surgeon in the operating room, under spinal anesthesia or intravenous sedation. The mean duration of symptoms before treatment was 15.6 months (which was longer than in other studies), and the transfusion before treatment varied from once per month to twice per week. Using sigmoidoscopy, 100 ml of a 4% formalin solution was instilled directly (or by using a formalin-soaked gauze) and irrigated for five minutes. Formalin-soaked cotton was then applied selectively to focal remnant lesions. Four patients improved after the first treatment, but one patient received the treatment twice because of recurrent symptoms. Complications after treatment included perianal pain (one case), and aggravated incontinence (one case), which improved three months after conservative management. In conclusion, the formalin combination application method in our study is comparable to other formalin treatments for intractable RIHP.",Excluded
1079,"Lack of high-dose radiation mediated prostate cancer promotion and low-dose radiation adaptive response in the TRAMP mouse model. Cancer of the prostate is a highly prevalent disease with a heterogeneous aetiology and prognosis. Current understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying the responses of prostate tissue to ionizing radiation exposure, including cancer induction, is surprisingly limited for both high- and low-dose exposures. As population exposure to radiation increases, largely through medical imaging, a better understanding of the response of the prostate to radiation exposure is required. Low-dose radiation-induced adaptive responses for increased cancer latency and decreased cancer frequency have been demonstrated in mouse models, largely for hematological cancers. This study examines the effects of high- and low-dose whole-body radiation exposure on prostate cancer development using an autochthonous mouse model of prostate cancer: TRansgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate (TRAMP). TRAMP mice were exposed to single acute high (2 Gy), low (50 mGy) and repeated low (5 x 50 mGy) doses of X rays to evaluate both the potential prostate cancer promoting effects of high-dose radiation and low-dose adaptive response phenomena in this prostate cancer model. Prostate weights and histopathology were examined to evaluate gross changes in cancer development and, in mice exposed to a single 2 Gy dose, time to palpable tumor was examined. Proliferation (Ki-67), apoptosis, DNA damage (gamma-H2AX) and transgene expression (large T-antigen) were examined within TRAMP prostate sections. Neither high- nor low-dose radiation-induced effects on prostate cancer progression were observed for any of the endpoints studied. Lack of observable effects of high- or low-dose radiation exposure suggests that modulation of tumorigenesis in the TRAMP model is largely resistant to such exposures. However, further study is required to better assess the effects of radiation exposure using alternative prostate cancer models that incorporate normal prostate and in those that are not driven by SV40 large T antigen. © 2013 by Radiation Research Society.",Excluded
1969,"Radiation exposure in coronary procedures using the radial and femoral approaches. Background: Although the transradial approach had significantly reduced vascular complications, studies have demonstrated that it may be related to higher radiation exposure. The objective of this study is to compare radiation exposure in invasive cardiologic procedures using the transradial and transfemoral approaches. Method(s): Prospective cohort study including patients undergoing diagnostic cardiac catheterization or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) between August 2010 and December 2011. Clinical, angiographic and radiation exposure characteristics were recorded in a dedicated database. Patients were analyzed according to the access route: femoral or radial. Result(s): Of the 1,197 patients included in the study, 782 were submitted to procedures using the femoral access and 415 using the radial access. There was a lower prevalence of females (36.2% vs. 45.6%; P < 0.01), previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery (4% vs. 12.7%; P < 0.01) and severe valvular heart disease (0.3% vs. 1.4%; P = 0.07) in the radial group. The median radiation dose received by the patients was higher with the radial approach, both for diagnostic (621.6 mGy vs 445.7 mGy; P < 0.01) and therapeutic procedures (1,241.6 mGy vs 990.9 mGy; P < 0.01). Less experienced operators in the radial approach exposed patients to higher radiation doses (1,463 mGy vs 1,196 mGy; P = 0.02), which did not occur with the more experienced operators (1,311 mGy vs 1,449 mGy; P = 0.84).

Background: Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC) is the commonest Head & Neck cancer in Saudi Arabia. Concomitant Chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) with cisplatin followed by 3 cycles of adjuvant Cisplatin based chemotherapy is the standard of care in patients with locally advanced disease (LANPC). However, the compliance with adjuvant chemotherapy has been unsatisfactory. Material(s) and Method(s): Between August 2002 and July 2010, fifty-four patients (37 males: 17 females) with locally advanced (AJCC Stage III & IV), non-metastatic NPC were treated using Induction Chemotherapy (IC) with Docetaxel, Cisplatin, and 5-FU (TPF) for 3 cycles, followed by Concomitant chemo-radiation using weekly Carboplatin with conventionally fractionated 3-D conformal radiotherapy to a total dose of 65-70 Gy. Result(s): Median age was 42 year (15 to 72). Twenty-six patients (48%) had stage IV disease, and 17 (31%) had T4 tumours. Undifferentiated Carcinoma Nasopharyngeal Type accounted for 96% of the cases. Fortysix patients had more than 12 months follow-up (median 42) and are the subject of the following analysis. Two patients died during induction chemotherapy. Of the remaining 44 patients, IC resulted in 25% Complete Clinical Remission, and 72% Partial Remission, an overall Response Rate of 97%. Hematological toxicity was frequent, but manageable. In total, there were 2 local and 2 distant relapses, 2 of them appearing beyond 3-years of follow-up. Two patients died of progressive disease, one is alive with disease, and one local relapse was successfully salvaged with further radiotherapy. For the entire series (46 patients) the 4-year Kaplan-Meier Overall Survival (OS) rate is 88%. For the 44 patients who completed the protocol, the 4-year Disease Free Survival (DFS) rate is 84%. All 8 patients under 23 year of age remain disease-free at more than 6 years median follow-up. One patient developed a suspected grade 3 neurologic toxicity, and another had a cerebral-vascular accident one year following salvage local re-irradiation. Conclusion(s): Sequential therapy as used in this group of patients seems well tolerated and yields high remission rate and an encouraging DFS and OS in patients with LANPC. Future development should focus on better risk stratification, and systematic use of Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapylike techniques. Young adults with LANPC may need a different treatment approach that would include IC followed by response-adjusted chemoradiotherapy.",Excluded

Ten patients with lesions of the chest wall amenable to surgical therapy were reconstructed by a transposition flap of the greater omentum. Eight of these patients had been previously treated for cancer of the female breast by mastectomy and irradiation or by irradiation alone (in one instance). Of these 8, 6 had progressive ulceration of the chest wall consistent with radiation necrosis and three had residual carcinoma within the ulcer. One patient had melanoma of the chest wall still persistent after surgical resection and irradiation. Another had epidermoid carcinoma, whereas two sought breast reconstruction after successful mastectomy for cancer. In five patients the omentum was transposed directly on the pleura and lung or chest wall. In three patients prolene mesh was interposed to stabilize the chest wall. In two patients the defect attendant upon a Halsted mastectomy was ameliorated by a one-stage reconstruction using transposed omentum to cover a silastic gel prosthesis and to support an overlying skin graft. In three patients there were mild transient symptoms of gastric outlet obstruction postoperatively. In one patient delayed healing occurred because of partial separation of the omentum from the underlying irradiated pleura and in another there was partial loss of skin graft and omentum due to hematoma.

We performed a prospective phase II trial to investigate the safety and efficacy of radiotherapy combined with capecitabine in patients suffering from a recurrence of a squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) within a previously irradiated field. Patients and methods. A total of 31 evaluable patients with recurrent SCCHN received re-irradiation with a total dose of 50 Gy (25 fractions over 5 weeks) up to a maximum of 60 Gy combined with 900 mg/m2/day capecitabine given on the days of radiotherapy. Results. The median time to relapse after the first course of radiotherapy was 15 months. The overall response rate in our study was 68% including 6 patients with a complete response. The median overall survival was 8.4 months. Grade 3 or 4 mucositis occurred in 4 patients and 1 patient, respectively. No grade 4 hematological toxicities were observed; 1 patient had grade 3 anemia. The cumulative median lifetime dose was 116 Gy. Conclusion. Capecitabine combined with re-irradiation is a well-tolerated treatment in patients with recurrent SCCHN. In light of its good tolerability, it appears to be a potential option for patients with a reduced performance status and may also serve as a basis for novel treatment concepts, such as in combination with targeted therapies. © Springer-Verlag 2012.",Excluded
1123,"Dynamic CT for Parathyroid Adenoma Detection: How Does Radiation Dose Compare With Nuclear Medicine?. OBJECTIVE: Dynamic CT is increasingly used for preoperative localization of parathyroid adenomas, but concerns remain about the radiation effective dose of CT compared with that of 99mTc-sestamibi scintigraphy. The purpose of this study was to compare the radiation dose delivered by three-phase dynamic CT with that delivered by 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT performed in accordance with our current protocols and to assess the possible reduction in effective dose achieved by decreasing the scan length (i.e., z-axis) of two phases of the dynamic CT protocol., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effective dose of a 99mTc-sestamibi nuclear medicine parathyroid study performed with and without coregistration CT was calculated and compared with the effective dose of our current three-phase dynamic CT protocol as well as a proposed protocol involving CT with reduced scan length., RESULTS: The median effective dose for a 99mTc-sestamibi nuclear medicine study was 5.6 mSv. This increased to 12.4 mSv with the addition of coregistration CT, which is higher than the median effective dose of 9.3 mSv associated with the dynamic CT protocol. Reducing the scan length of two phases in the dynamic CT protocol could reduce the median effective dose to 6.1 mSv, which would be similar to that of the dose from the 99mTc-sestamibi study alone., CONCLUSION: Dynamic CT used for the detection of parathyroid adenoma can deliver a lower radiation dose than 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT. It may be possible to reduce the dose further by decreasing the scan length of two of the phases, although whether this has an impact on accuracy of the localization needs further investigation.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To evaluate early swallowing after intensity-modulated radiotherapy for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and determine factors correlating with aspiration and/or stricture., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Consecutive patients treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy between September 2004 and August 2006 at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute/Brigham and Women's Hospital were evaluated with institutional review board approval. Patients underwent swallowing evaluation after completion of therapy; including video swallow studies. The clinical- and treatment-related variables were examined for correlation with aspiration or strictures, as well as doses to the larynx, pharyngeal constrictor muscles, and cervical esophagus. The correlation was assessed with logistic regression analysis., RESULTS: A total of 96 patients were evaluated. Their median age was 55 years, and 79 (82%) were men. The primary site of cancer was the oropharynx in 43, hypopharynx/larynx in 17, oral cavity in 13, nasopharynx in 11, maxillary sinus in 2, and unknown primary in 10. Of the 96 patients, 85% underwent definitive RT and 15% postoperative RT. Also, 28 patients underwent induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemotherapy, 59 received concurrent chemotherapy, and 9 patients underwent RT alone. The median follow-up was 10 months. Of the 96 patients, 31 (32%) had clinically significant aspiration and 36 (37%) developed a stricture. The radiation dose-volume metrics, including the volume of the larynx receiving >or=50 Gy (p = 0.04 and p = 0.03, respectively) and volume of the inferior constrictor receiving >or=50 Gy (p = 0.05 and p = 0.02, respectively) were significantly associated with both aspiration and stricture. The mean larynx dose correlated with aspiration (p = 0.003). Smoking history was the only clinical factor to correlate with stricture (p = 0.05) but not aspiration., CONCLUSION: Aspiration and stricture are common side effects after intensity-modulated radiotherapy for head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma.

BACKGROUND: Carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT) is a promising treatment for locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, especially for patients with inoperable lung cancer. Although the incidence of CIRT-induced radiation pneumonitis (RP) >= grade 2 ranges from 2.5 to 9.9%, the association between CIRT-induced RP and dosimetric parameters is not clear. Herein, we identified prognostic factors associated with symptomatic RP after CIRT for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer., METHODS: Clinical results of 65 patients treated with CIRT between 2000 and 2015 at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical stage II B disease (TNM classification) was the most common stage among the patients (45%). The median radiation dose was 72 Gy (68-76) relative biological effectiveness (RBE) in 16 fractions. In cases involving metastatic lymph nodes, prophylactic irradiation of mediastinal lymph nodes was performed at a median dose of 49.5 Gy (RBE). The median follow-up was 22 months., RESULTS: Grade 2 and grade 3 RP occurred in 6 and 3 patients (9 and 5%), respectively. No patients developed grade 4 or 5 RP. Using univariate analysis, vital capacity as a percentage of predicted (%VC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), mean lung dose (MLD), volume of lung receiving >=5 Gy (RBE) (V5), V10, V20 and V30 were determined to be the significant predictive factors for >= grade 2 RP. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed the cutoff values for %VC, FEV1, MLD, V5, V10, V20 and V30 for >= grade 2 RP, which were 86.9%, 1.16 L, 12.5 Gy (RBE), 28.8, 29.9, 20.1 and 15.0%, respectively. In addition, the multivariate analysis revealed that %VC <86.9% (odds ratio = 13.7; p = 0.0041) and V30 >= 15% (odds ratio = 6.1; p = 0.0221) were significant risk factors., CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated the risk factors for >= grade 2 RP after carbon-ion radiotherapy for patients with locally advanced lung cancer.",Excluded

Background: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of reirradiation using three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) in symptomatic patients with locoregionally recurrent lung cancer. Method(s): Between 2005 and 2012, 15 patients with locoregionally recurrent lung cancer were retreated with 3D-CRT after previously receiving thoracic radiotherapy. The median interval between the initial irradiation and reirradiation was 12 months (range, five to 41 months). The median initial radiotherapy dose was 63Gy (range, 45-70 Gy), and reirradiation doses ranged from 25.2 to 45.2Gy (median, 36Gy), with daily fractions of 1.8-4Gy (median, 2Gy). Result(s): After reirradiation, 80% of the patients experienced resolved or diminished symptoms for one or more of their symptoms, with an 83% improvement in a total of 24 symptoms. The overall tumor response rate to reirradiation was 46.7%, with progressive disease occurring in only one patient. The median overall survival (OS) time was 11 months (range, one to 27 months), and the one-year OS rate was 47%. The progression-free survival time ranged from one to 10 months (median, five months). In univariate analysis, the use of combined chemotherapy and a higher reirradiation dose showed a trend toward improved survival after reirradiation. Treatment-induced toxicity included grade 2 radiation pneumonitis in only one patient, and there were no other complications, such as radiation esophagitis or myelopathy.

2760,"Developmental switch from LTD to LTP in low frequency-induced plasticity. The stimulation of the Schaffer collateral/commissural fibers at low frequency (1 Hz) for 3-5 min can trigger a slow-onset form of low-frequency stimulation (LFS)-long-term potentiation (LTP) (LFS-LTP) in the CA1 area of the adult rat hippocampus. Here we have examined the developmental profile of this plasticity. In 9-15 day-old rats, the application of 1 Hz for 5 min induced long-term depression (LFS-LTD). In 17-21 day-old rats, 1 Hz stimulation had no effect when applied for 5 min but mediated LTD when stimulus duration was increased to 15 min. Over 25 day-old, 1 Hz stimulation mediated LFS-LTP. LFS-LTD was dependent on both N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and mGlu5 receptor activation. Antagonists of mGlu1alpha and cannabinoid type 1 receptor were ineffective to block LTD induction. LFS-LTD was not associated with a change in paired-pulse facilitation ratio, suggesting a postsynaptic locus of expression of this plasticity. Next, we examined whether LFS-LTD was related to 'chemical' LTDs obtained by the direct stimulation of mGlu5 and NMDA receptors. The saturation of LFS-LTD completely occluded NMDA- and (RS)-2-Chloro-5-hydroxyphenylglycine (CHPG)-induced LTD. CHPG-LTD and NMDA-LTD occluded each other. In addition, we observed that NMDA-LTD was dependent on mGlu5 receptor activation in 9-12 day old rats while it was not in animals older than 15 day-old. Therefore we postulate that during LFS application, NMDA and mGlu5 receptor could interact to trigger LTD. Low-frequency-mediated synaptic plasticity is subject to a developmental switch from NMDA- and mGlu5 receptor-dependent LTD to mGlu5 receptor-dependent LTP with a transient period (17-21 day-old) during which LFS is ineffective.",Excluded

The in vivo radiographic features of two commercially available formulations of barium used as contrast media in dedicated small- bowel series were compared. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Fifty-six consecutive outpatients referred for a dedicated small-bowel series were randomly administered either E-Z-Paque or Entrobar. Representative survey radiographs from each examination were randomized and reviewed by six gastrointestinal radiologists from three institutions. Each observer assigned a numeric score (1 = poor, 2 = fair, 3 = good, and 4 = excellent) that rated the quality of the radiograph with respect to these characteristics: definition of fold pattern, translucency, distention, and integrity of the barium column. Statistical analysis was performed for each characteristic using Wilcoxon's two-sample rank sum test. RESULTS. All six observers found a statistically significant difference between the two barium formulations for mean scores for definition of fold pattern and translucency. Mean scores for fold pattern were 3.3, 3.0, 3.2, 3.6, 3.3, and 3.4 for Entrobar and 2.1, 2.3, 2.4, 3.2, 2.6, and 2.7 for E-Z-Paque. Mean scores for translucency were 2.5, 2.7, 2.8, 3.1, 2.7, and 3.3 for Entrobar and 1.6, 1.7, 2.1, 2.3, 1.9, and 2.7 for E-Z- Paque. No statistically significant difference was found for mean score for distention or integrity of the barium column. CONCLUSION. On radiographs, Entrobar was found to have superior characteristics for visualization of fold pattern and translucency but offered no advantages for distention or integrity of the barium column. Improved translucency and definition of fold pattern may translate into improved sensitivity and confidence in diagnosing small-bowel abnormality.",Excluded

Aim: The presentation of our results using the Dornier lithotripter (Doli) S electromagnetic shockwave emitter (EMSE) 220 F-XP for the strategic management of staghorn renal calculi. Method(s): Sixteen patients with renal staghorn stones of more than 35 mm in maximum length on plain X-rays were treated by shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) monotherapy with the Doli S EMSE 220 F-XP. Double-J ureteral stent was inserted to all prior to the first SWL treatment. Shock wave counts varied from 2,500 to 3,600 with a shock release frequency of 70-80 pulses per minute. The number of sessions varied from 2 to 6. The interval between the SWL sessions was around 1 month. Fragmentation rate of 20-25% of the stone load per session was considered a valid criterion for progressing to further SWL sessions. Result(s): Nine patients became stone free at the end of SWL sessions and two patients had renal stone fragments smaller than 4 mm, which were eliminated 6 months later. Two patients developed streinstrasse that was managed with ureteroscopy. Auxiliary SWL was also performed on three patients with residual ureteral calculi. The mean follow up period was 12 months.

897,"Identification of a novel three-column classification for double-column die-punch fractures of the distal radius. The present study aimed to classify double-column die-punch fractures of the distal radius according to imaging data, and to evaluate their clinical features. A retrospective analysis of imaging data derived from 498 patients diagnosed with a double-column die-punch fracture of the distal radius was performed. The fractures were divided into those with middle-column avulsion with fracture of the radial-column articular surface (type I), those with middle-column collapse with fracture of the radial-column articular surface (type II), those with middle-column collapse with fracture of epiphysis of the radial column (type III) or mixed-type fractures (type IV). The intra- and inter-observer consistency between assessors was analyzed with kappa statistics. The patients with double-column die-punch fractures of the distal radius were followed up. There were 21 cases of type I fracture, 135 cases of type II fracture, 130 cases of type III fracture and 212 cases of type IV fracture. The intra-observer kappa coefficient ranged from 0.810-0.861, whereas the inter-observer kappa coefficient range was 0.830-0.876, with high consistency. Following 13 months of follow-up, the patients were assessed for functional recovery of the wrist and hand using the Gartland-Werley scoring system. The analysis indicated that in 95.78% of the patients, wrist function was rated as excellent or good (n=477), while in 4.22% of patients it was rated as fair (n=21), mainly due to the development of post-traumatic arthritis of the wrist following inappropriate therapy. All of the cases were type IV and type III fractures. These data demonstrated the application of a novel classification system named the Three-Column Classification, used to classify double-column die-punch fractures of the distal radius. This method reflected the mechanisms and severity of the fractures, conforming to the principle of AO fracture classification. Furthermore, it exhibited high consistency and may provide reference values for clinical diagnosis, treatment and prognostic evaluation.Copyright © 2020 Spandidos Publications.

2167,"Efficacy of therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: Intra-arterial 5-fluorouracil and subcutaneous interferon with image-guided radiation. Background and Aim: To evaluate the efficacy of intra-arterial 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and subcutaneous interferon (IFN) combined with image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT). Method(s): Twenty HCC patients with PVTT were treated with 5-FU and IFN combined with image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) (IGRT group), and as controls, 20 patients with PVTT were treated with 5-FU and IFN alone (non-IGRT group). Overall survival (OS) time, response rates, time to progression (TTP) and safety were compared across groups. Result(s): Complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD) of PVTT were 5%, 55%, 40% and 0% in the IGRT group and 0%, 30%, 35% and 35%, in the non-IGRT group, respectively. CR, PR, SD, and PD of the whole tumor were 0%, 35%, 45% and 20% in the IGRT group and 0%, 30%, 35% and 35%, in the non-IGRT group, respectively. Overall median survival was significantly longer in the IGRT group (12.0months 95% confidence interval [CI], 9.3-17.6months) than in the non-IGRT group (9.1months [95% CI, 5.5-11.1months]) (P=0.041). TTP was significantly longer in the IGRT group (6.9months [95% CI, 5.6-10.2months]) than in the non-IGRT group (4.0months [95% CI, 3.3-6.4months]) (P=0.034). Conclusion(s): The response rates, median OS time and TTP in patients with advanced HCC with PVTT who received this novel combination therapy of intra-arterial 5-FU and subcutaneous IFN with IGRT are encouraging, and this combination therapy warrants further investigation. © 2011 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.",Excluded
530,"CT findings of KUB injury in Hemodynamically stable blunt abdominal injury patients with microscopic hematuria. Background: According to controversial guideline for management in case of hemodynamically stable blunt abdominal injury with microscopic hematuria. Most of the patients could be omitted for abdominal computed tomography (CT). Despite high sensitivity and specificity of abdominal CT, in addition to high medical cost, there are risks from radiation exposure and adverse reaction from use of contrast media. Objective(s): To evaluate the prevalence of KUB injury on abdominal CT in case of hemodynamically stable blunt abdominal injury with microscopic hematuria. Material(s) and Method(s): Forty-one studies of abdominal CT performed during 1 January 2010 and 30 June 2012 were retrospectively reviewed for KUB injury (categorized by AAST organ injury scale) by consensus of two experienced radiologists. Result(s): KUB injury was found in 36.6% from all selected CT studies. Almost all cases could be managed conservatively. The cutoff point of microscopic hematuria at 20 cells/hpf has sensitivity 80% and specificity 46.15%. Conclusion(s): One-third of the patients have KUB injury but almost all of them could be conservatively managed. We proposed that the cutoff point of hematuria be equivalent to or greater than 20 cells/hpf to be one of the indicators for predicting KUB injury that needs radiological evaluation; but it should be carefully considered along with clinical information.Copyright © 2015 Medical Association of Thailand.

858,"Low contrast and radiation dose coronary CT angiography using a 320-row system and a refined contrast injection and timing method. BACKGROUND: Among CT scanners, 320-row instruments feature decreased photon energy and yield strong contrast enhancement. Consequently, the contrast medium (CM) dose can be reduced. The results of low-tube-voltage coronary CT angiography (CCTA) performed on 320-row scanners have not been adequately assessed., OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effects of a low-contrast-dose protocol on the image quality of CCTA using 80 kVp tube voltage, iterative reconstruction (IR), and a 320-row scanner., METHODS: We randomly assigned 90 patients (mean body weight, 56.5 +/- 11.0 kg) to 1 of 3 CCTA protocols. Under protocol A, 30 were scanned using a conventional 120-kVp protocol and a standard CM dose (280 mg iodine/kg body weight [mgI/kg]). Another 30 underwent scanning at 80 kVp with a 25% CM dose reduction (210 mgI/kg; protocol B). Under protocol C, the remaining 30 patients were scanned at 80 kVp with a 50% CM dose reduction (140 mgI/kg). The 120 and 80 kVp images were processed with IR. Images obtained under the 3 protocols were subjected to quantitative and qualitative analysis., RESULTS: The amount of CM used in protocol A, B, and C was 43.6 +/- 10.1, 30.3 +/- 4.4, and 21.0 +/- 4.0 mL, respectively. Mean CT attenuation of the coronary arteries tended to be higher under protocol B than the other 2 protocols. The contrast-to-noise ratio was significantly higher under protocol B. The mean visual scores were significantly higher for protocols A and B than protocol C. The mean effective radiation dose was significantly lower under the 80-kVp protocol., CONCLUSION: With a 320-row scanner and our refined CM injection and timing protocol, it is technically feasible to obtain sufficient vascular enhancement with a reduction in the CM and/or radiation dose at 80-kVp CCTA with IR.

2533,"RADIATION DOSE TO PATIENTS IN CORONARY INTERVENTIONAL PROCEDURES: A SURVEY. The objective of this study was to evaluate dose-area product (DAP) and peak skin dose (PSD) for coronary angiography (CA) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The DAP and PSD of 300 randomly selected patients who were referred to CA and/or PCI, over a period of 3 months were recorded and analyzed. The mean DAP of 32 Gy cm2 and mean PSD of 412 mGy for CA were lower than 118 Gy cm2 and 857 mGy, respectively, for PCI. The DAP range of 2-84 Gy cm2 for CA and 12-378 mGy for PCI were also established. The maximum value of PSD for PCI procedures reached above the 2 Gy threshold for erythema. However, these values are similar to those available in literature. Periodic surveys may be required to monitor and/or reduce radiation doses in coronary interventional procedures.

1656,"The Association of Socioeconomic Status with the Burden of Cataract-related Blindness and the Effect of Ultraviolet Radiation Exposure: An Ecological Study. Objective: To assess the association of socioeconomic status with the burden of cataract blindness in terms of year lived with disability (YLD) rates and to determine whether ultraviolet radiation (UVR) levels modify the effect of socioeconomic status on this health burden. Method(s): National and subnational age-standardized YLD rates associated with cataract-related blindness were derived from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2017. The human development index (HDI) from the Human Development Report was used as a measure of socioeconomic status. Estimated ground-level UVR exposure was obtained from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) dataset of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Result(s): Across 185 countries, socioeconomic status was inversely associated with the burden of cataract blindness. Countries with a very high HDI had an 84% lower age-standardized YLD rate [95% confidence interval ( CI): 60%-93%, P < 0.001] than countries with a low HDI; for high-HDI countries, the proportion was 76% (95% CI: 53%-88%, P < 0.001), and for medium-HDI countries, the proportion was 48% (95% CI: 15%-68%, P = 0.010; P for trend < 0.001). The interaction analysis showed that UVR exposure played an interactive role in the association between socioeconomic status and cataract blindness burden ( P value for interaction = 0.047). Conclusion(s): Long-term high-UVR exposure amplifies the association of poor socioeconomic status with the burden of cataract-related blindness. The findings emphasize the need for strengthening UVR exposure protection interventions in developing countries with high-UVR exposure.Copyright © 2021 The Editorial Board of Biomedical and Environmental Sciences.

3609,"Maternal effects of the scid mutation on radiation-induced transgenerational instability in mice. The results of a number of recent studies show that mutation rates in the offspring of irradiated parents are substantially elevated, however, the effect of parental genotype on transgenerational instability remains poorly understood. Here, we have analysed the mutation frequency at an expanded simple tandem repeat (ESTR) locus in the germline and bone marrow of the first-generation male offspring of control and irradiated male mice. The frequency of ESTR mutation was studied in the offspring of two reciprocal matings male symbol scid x female symbol BALB/c and male symbol BALB/c x female symbol scid, which were compared with that in BALB/c mice. In the offspring of the BALB/c x BALB/c and male symbol scid x female symbol BALB/c matings, which were conceived after paternal sperm irradiation, the frequency of ESTR mutation was significantly elevated in both tissues. In contrast, ESTR mutation frequency was only slightly elevated in the offspring of male symbol BALB/c x female symbol scid mating conceived after paternal irradiation. The results of this study suggest that the oocytes of scid females are unable to fully support the repair of double-strand breaks induced in paternal sperm which may in turn result in the elimination of cells/embryos containing high levels of DNA damage, thus partially preventing the manifestation of genomic instability.",Excluded
576,"Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for operable Stage i non-small-cell lung cancer: Can SBRT be comparable to surgery?. Purpose: To review treatment outcomes for stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in medically operable patients with Stage I non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), using a Japanese multi-institutional database. Patients and Methods: Between 1995 and 2004, a total of 87 patients with Stage I NSCLC (median age, 74 years; T1N0M0, n = 65; T2N0M0, n = 22) who were medically operable but refused surgery were treated using SBRT alone in 14 institutions. Stereotactic three-dimensional treatment was performed using noncoplanar dynamic arcs or multiple static ports. Total dose was 45-72.5 Gy at the isocenter, administered in 3-10 fractions. Median calculated biological effective dose was 116 Gy (range, 100-141 Gy). Data were collected and analyzed retrospectively. Result(s): During follow-up (median, 55 months), cumulative local control rates for T1 and T2 tumors at 5 years after SBRT were 92% and 73%, respectively. Pulmonary complications above Grade 2 arose in 1 patient (1.1%). Five-year overall survival rates for Stage IA and IB subgroups were 72% and 62%, respectively. One patient who developed local recurrences safely underwent salvage surgery. Conclusion(s): Stereotactic body radiotherapy is safe and promising as a radical treatment for operable Stage I NSCLC. The survival rate for SBRT is potentially comparable to that for surgery. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
3221,"[Adaptive response of blood lymphocytes as a marker of hemopoiesis status in exposed persons]. An obvious correlation between the type of reaction manifested by peripheral blood lymphocytes to low dose irradiation in vitro (adaptive potential), the RBM cell composition (during the period of the major exposure), and the peripheral blood cell composition (at a late time period coincident with the studies of induced radioresistance) has been found in the Techa riverside residents in the later periods after the onset of a long-term low-dose rate radiation exposure (55-60 years later) within a range of individual red bone marrow doses from 0.01 to 1.79 Gy. The nature of these dependences observed in chronically exposed individuals differs from that revealed in the controls. It can be suggested based on the results of the study that the capacity for the adaptive response shown by peripheral blood lymphocytes donated by exposed persons in the remote period after exposure can be regarded as a biological marker of the functional state of the hemopoietic stem cell pool.",Excluded
1399,"Pantoprazole for the prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding in high-risk patients with acute coronary syndromes. Purpose: The aim of this study is to evaluate the preventive effect of proton pump inhibitors on gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) who are at high risk for GI bleeding. Material(s) and Method(s): We enrolled 665 patients with ACS who had one or more of the following risk factors for GI bleeding: 75 years of age or older, history of peptic ulcer disease, history of GI bleeding, cardiogenic shock, and chronic renal dysfunction (serum creatinine, >2 mg/dL). Patients were randomly assigned to receive 40 mg of pantoprazole or placebo twice daily for 7 days, in addition to standard treatment of ACS. The primary end point was the occurrence of GI bleeding during hospitalization. Result(s): During a median time of hospitalization of 12 days, 12 (3.6%) of 332 patients in the placebo group had an occurrence of GI bleeding, as compared with 4 (1.2%) of the 333 patients in the pantoprazole group (P =.046, Fisher exact test). The log-rank test showed a significant difference between the 2 groups in the time to the occurrence of GI bleeding (P =.015). Major GI bleeding occurred in 5 (1.5%) patients in the placebo group but only in 1 (0.3%) in the pantoprazole group (P =.12). Pneumonia developed in 22 (6.6%) patients in the placebo group and 24 (7.2%) in the pantoprazole group (-2 = 0.077, P =.88). The 30-day mortality was 10.2% (34/332) in the placebo group and 10.5% (35/333) in the pantoprazole group. Conclusion(s): In patients with ACS who are at high risk for GI hemorrhage, prophylactic treatment with pantoprazole could reduce the risk of GI bleeding with no significant effects on the incidence of hospital-acquired pneumonia and 30-day mortality. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

PURPOSE: The purpose of this work was to assess the utility of low-dose spiral CT for three-dimensional imaging of the central airways., METHOD: Spiral CT was performed in 15 patients using two tube currents (50 and 240 mA), producing 30 CT data sets. Surface-rendered virtual bronchoscopy (VB) and shaded surface display (SSD) images were assessed by three radiologists for image quality. The radiologists were also asked to compare 15 matched pairs each of 50 and 240 mA VB and SSD images, blindly select the 240 mA image, and record differences in diagnostic quality between the matched images., RESULTS: No significant difference in image quality was noted with 50 or 240 mA. Only 51.1% of 240 mA SSD and 51.1% of 240 mA VB images were correctly identified. Differences in diagnostic quality, noted in 84.4% of SSD and 33% of VB image pairs, were not ascribed to image noise., CONCLUSION: Image quality of surface-rendered three-dimensional images of the central airways is preserved using a lower tube current.",Excluded

1861,"Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy of rectal carcinoma: Baseline hematologic parameters influencing outcomes. Background: The link between the blood count and a systemic inflammatory response (SIR) is indisputable and well described. Pretreatment hematological parameters may predict the overall clinical outcomes in many types of cancer. Thus, this study aims to systematically evaluate the relationship between baseline blood count levels and treatment response in rectal cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Patients and Methods: From 2009-2015, 173 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer were retrospectively enrolled in the study and analyzed. The baseline blood count was recorded in all patients 1 week before chemoradiation. Tumor response was evaluated through pathologic findings. Blood count levels which included RBC (red blood cells), Hb (hemoglobin), PLT (platelet count), neutrophil count, WBC (white blood cells), NLR (neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio), and PLR (platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio) were analyzed in relation to tumor downstaging, pCR (pathologic complete response), OS (overall survival), and DFS (disease-free survival). Result(s): Hb levels were associated with a response in logistic regression analysis: pCR (p = 0.05; OR 1.04, 95 % CI 1.00-1.07); T downstaging (p = 0.006; OR 1.03, 95 % CI 1.01-1.05); N downstaging (p = 0.09; OR 1.02, 95 % CI 1.00-1.04); T or N downstaging (p = 0.007; OR 1.04, 95 % CI 1.01-1.07); T and N downstaging (p = 0.02; OR 1.02, 95 % CI 1.00-1.04); Hb and RBC were the most significant parameters influencing OS; PLT was a negative prognostic factor for OS and DFS (p = 0.008 for OS); an NLR value of 2.8 was associated with the greatest significance for OS (p = 0.03) and primary tumor downstaging (p = 0.02).

3307,"BMI1-KLF4 axis deficiency improves responses to neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with rectal cancer. Purpose: Neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is a gold standard treatment for patients with stage II/III rectal cancer. B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion site 1 (BMI1) is a member of the polycomb group of proteins that are involved in regulating gene expression. High levels of BMI1 have been demonstrated to contribute to the malignant phenotypes of several cancers; however, its relevance in rectal cancer treated with CCRT is largely unknown. Methods and materials: We used two patient cohorts to address the clinical relevance of BMI1 in human cancers. In addition, HT-29 and HCT-116 cells were chosen as our in vitro models to verify the role of BMI1 in cell response to ionizing radiation. Stemness-related proteins were analyzed by western blotting and cell survival was determined using clonogenic assays. Result(s): BMI1 overexpression was found to significantly correlate with advanced pre-treatment nodal status (N1-N2; p < 0.001), post-treatment tumor stage (T1-T2; p = 0.015), inferior tumor regression grade (p = 0.001), and also an independent prognosis factor in 172 rectal cancer patients receiving CCRT. Serial cell-based functional examination indicated that BMI1 deficiency sensitized cells to radiation treatment by modulating the gene expression of Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) and enhanced radiosensitivity in microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal cancers. Overexpression of KLF4 partially overcame BMI1-deficiency-mediated gamma-H2AX expression after ionizing radiation exposure. Consistent with in vitro data, an analysis of an additional 30 rectal cancer tissue specimens revealed a positive correlation between BMI1 and KLF4 (p = 0.02). Conclusion(s): Higher levels of BMI1 are associated with poor therapeutic response and adverse outcomes in rectal cancer patients receiving CCRT.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
3710,"Definitive Management of Presumed Synchronous Early Stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancers: Outcomes and Utility of Stereotactic Ablative Radiation Therapy. Purpose: Management of synchronous early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains controversial because resection is not always feasible. This study evaluates efficacy and patterns of failure after SABR for synchronous early-stage NSCLC. Methods and Materials: From 2005 to 2015, patients presenting with >=2 synchronous NSCLC tumors (T1a-T2b) and receiving SABR to >=1 lesion were reviewed. The most common prescriptions were 50 Gy in 4 or 70 Gy in 10 fractions. Patients underwent multidisciplinary management with workup including chest computed tomography and positron emission tomography/computed tomography, plus brain imaging and endoscopic bronchial ultrasound for most patients to rule out mediastinal and distant disease. Synchronous lesions were defined as multiple ipsilateral or contralateral intrapulmonary lesions diagnosed within 6 months. Result(s): Of 912 patients treated with SABR for early-stage NSCLC at our institution, 82 (9%) presented with synchronous disease, with a total of 169 lesions. SABR was delivered to 142 lesions (84%), with 57 patients (69.5%) receiving SABR for all sites. Median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 5.1 and 2.7 years, respectively. At a median follow-up of 58 months, OS was 67% and 52% at 3 and 5 years, and corresponding PFS was 47% and 29%. Thirty-nine patients (48%) had progression, with 21 (26%) experiencing distant failure, and intralobar recurrence was among the first failure for 15 patients (18%). Of the 142 SABR-treated sites, these included 6 in-field (4%) and 4 marginal (3%) recurrences. There were no grade >=3 adverse events. Among patients receiving SABR for all sites, there were no differences in OS (P = .946), PFS (P = .980), local control (P = .683), regional and distant control (P = .656), or toxicity (P = .791). On multivariable analysis, ipsilateral synchronous disease was associated with greater regional and distant failure (hazard ratio, 2.691; P = .025). Conclusion(s): Synchronous NSCLC can be managed with definitive local therapy. With high control rates and favorable outcomes, SABR is an effective and feasible treatment for synchronous early-stage NSCLC.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

Background: Acoustic radiation force impulse imaging is used to assess stages of liver fibrosis. The aim of our study was to evaluate liver stiffness changes in patients with biliary obstruction with or without sclerosing cholangitis after biliary drainage. Method(s): A total of 71 patients were enrolled in this prospective study (cohort N= 51, control group N= 20); 51 patients with obstructive cholestasis, indicated for endoscopic retrograde cholangiography, received stiffness measurement by acoustic radiation force impulse imaging before and 1-2 days after endoscopic retrograde cholangiography. Seventeen patients with obstructive cholestasis had primary or secondary sclerosing cholangitis. Forty one patients had a follow-up acoustic radiation force impulse imaging measurement after 3.0 +/- 9.31 weeks. Result(s): In all patients with obstructive cholestasis, stiffness decreased significantly after biliary drainage (p< 0.001). The main decrease was observed within 2 days after endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (1.92-1.57 m/s, p< 0.001) and correlated with the decrease of bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase (p= 0.04 and p= 0.002, respectively). In patients with sclerosing cholangitis, the initial decrease of stiffness after biliary drainage was weaker than in those without (2.1-1.85 m/s vs. 1.81-1.43 m/s, p= 0.016). Conclusion(s): Acoustic radiation force impulse imaging elastography shows that liver stiffness is increased by biliary obstruction, and decreases after endoscopic retrograde cholangiography irrespective of the aetiology. In patients with sclerosing cholangitis the reduction in stiffness after biliary drainage is impaired. © 2014 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.",Excluded

OBJECTIVES: This study reports the outcome of patients who failed intracoronary radiation therapy (IRT) for the treatment of in-stent restenosis (ISR)., BACKGROUND: Intracoronary radiation therapy has demonstrated a reduction in the recurrence rate of restenosis for patients with ISR. However, 10% to 30% of these patients require repeat intervention to the irradiated site., METHODS: Of 961 patients who were assigned to gamma or beta radiation for the treatment of diffuse ISR, we evaluated the outcome of 282 (29%) consecutive patients who failed IRT and compared them with the 679 (71%) patients who had successful IRT. For patients who failed radiation, the mean time to the first target vessel revascularization (TVR) was 173 +/- 127 days after the index procedure and the total duration of follow-up was 494 +/- 304 days., RESULTS: Patients who failed IRT were younger (60 +/- 10 vs. 63 +/- 11 years, p = 0.002) and had a higher incidence of restenting (51% vs. 41%, p = 0.003). The majority (55%) of the restenotic lesions after IRT failure were focal (< or =10 mm), with a mean lesion length of 11.9 +/- 1.9 mm. Of the 257 patients who had subsequent TVR after failed IRT, 68 (26%) underwent coronary artery bypass grafting and 189 (74%) underwent percutaneous coronary intervention using balloon in 61%, restenting in 26%, atheroablation in 11%, and the cutting balloon in 2% of cases. At six months, 6% of patients died, 1% had Q-wave MI, 17% had repeat TVR, and the overall rate of major adverse cardiac events was 21%., CONCLUSIONS: The predominant angiographic pattern of lesions in patients who failed IRT is focal restenosis, with these lesions responding well to conventional revascularization methods.",Excluded
2294,"18F-fluorocholine versus 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose for PET/CT imaging in patients with suspected relapsing or progressive multiple myeloma: a pilot study. Purpose: Hybrid positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) has now become available, as well as whole-body, low-dose multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The radioactive glucose analogue 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is the most widely used tracer but has a relatively low sensitivity in detecting multiple myeloma (MM). We compared FDG with a more recent metabolic tracer, 18F-fluorocholine (FCH), for the detection of MM lesions at time of disease relapse or progression. Method(s): We analyzed the results of FDG and FCH imaging in 21 MM patients undergoing PET/CT for suspected relapsing or progressive MM. For each patient and each tracer, an on-site reader and a masked reader independently determined the number of intraosseous and extraosseous foci of tracer and the intensity of uptake as measured by their SUVmax and the corresponding target/non-target ratio (T/NT). Result(s): In the skeleton of 21 patients, no foci were found for two cases, uncountable foci were observed in four patients, including some mismatched FCH/FDG foci. In the 15 patients with countable bone foci, the on-site reader detected 72 FDG foci vs. 127 FCH foci (+76 %), whereas the masked reader detected 69 FDG foci vs. 121 FCH foci (+75 %), both differences being significant. Interobserver agreement on the total number of bone foci was very high, with a kappa coefficient of 0.81 for FDG and 0.89 for FCH. Measurement of uptake in the matched foci that took up both tracers revealed a significantly higher median SUVmax and T/NT for FCH vs. FDG. Almost all unmatched foci were FCH-positive FDG-negative (57/59 = 97 % on-site and 56/60 = 93 % on masked reading); they were more frequently observed than matched foci in the head and neck region. Conclusion(s): These findings suggest that PET/CT performed for suspected relapsing or progressive MM would reveal more lesions when using FCH rather than FDG.Copyright © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded

Background(s): ICBT was commonly used to treat coronary ISR prior to the availability of drug-eluting stents (DES). The long-term outcomes of ICBT for ISR remain unknown. Method(s): Six hundred and eighty consecutive patients who underwent ICBT treated for ISR between September 1998 and April 2005 were included in the study. Clinical and angiographic data were collected and the long-term MACE were measured for all-cause death, myocardial infarction (MI), and target vessel revascularization (TVR) at 10-year follow-up. Result(s): Patients were 63 +/- 11 years old (66% male). The majority of patients were treated with a bare metal stent 670/680 (99%) prior to ICBT. Significant baseline clinical findings include high incidence of smokers 479/680 (70%), hyperlipidemia 638/680 (94%), and multivessel disease 526/680 (77%). The majority of target lesions were diffuse 407/680 (60%), and either in the left anterior descending 258/680 (38%) or right coronary artery 215/680 (32%). At 10-year follow-up, the rate of death was 25%, MI was 22.4%, and TVR was 48%. Conclusion(s): MACE at 10-year follow-up following ICBT for ISR indicates steady rate of death and MI and declining rate of TVR after 5 years.Copyright © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
918,"Epidemiological and clinical aspects in 1100 patients with plasmacytoma. 1,100 patients at University of Freiburg Medical Center and at the Institute of Pathology with newly diagnosed plasmacytoma between 1943 and 1989 were identified. Records for these patients were reviewed and the incidence, association with age and employment, distribution of the sexes, tumor stage and survival time and development of secondary tumors were analyzed. The incidence rate of plasmacytoma is increasing within the last decades. Average annual incidence rate at the early 90ies was 6 per 100,000 population. Plasmacytoma mainly occurs in older patients and increases in incidence with age. The median age for diagnosis was 65 years for males and 68 years for females. 10% of patients are under 50 years of age at time of diagnosis. Neither significant association with employment nor association with exposure to hazardous goods could be seen. Males and females are affected 1:1. Secondary malignant tumors could be detected in 7,6%. If plasmacytoma is the secondary tumor, 50% of patients were treated before with ionizing radiation because of their first tumor. Prognosis for plasmacytoma depends among other things upon the age at diagnosis and the clinical tumor stage. 10-year-survival time is 13%.",Excluded

A prospective study to evaluate the efficacy of human amniotic membrane dressings in the treatment of chronic leg ulcers was conducted on 15 patients. Patients with two ulcers were selected. One ulcer was treated with human amnion and the other, treated with standard dressings, served as a control. The rate of healing of the two ulcers was observed and compared. Chronic ulcers of post-phlebitic, post-irradiation and post-burn origin responded to treatment with human amnion and healed more rapidly than the control ulcer. Ulcers associated with rheumatoid arthritis and vasculitis showed no improvement. It was observed that all ulcers treated with human amnion quickly became pain-free.",Excluded
1432,"CT follow-up in patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs): combined radiation and contrast dose reduction. Background Frequent computed tomography (CT) follow-ups involve significant radiation related risks for patients with low-grade neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Contrast agent (CA) application is essential for diagnostic evidence and has additional risks especially in patients with limited renal function. Purpose To investigate if a combination of dose and contrast agent (CA) reduction affects image quality and diagnostic evidence in neuroendocrine tumor (NET) patients. Material and Methods A total of 51 NET patients were enrolled in the study and 153 CT scans were analyzed. Patients underwent a baseline CT scan (A = 120 kVp, filtered back projection [FBP]) and two follow-up CTs (B = 120 kVp, adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction [ASIR] 40%; C1 = 100 kVp, ASIR 40%; C2 = 100 kVp, ASIR 60%; the latter two protocols were applied with a 30% reduction in CA volume). We evaluated image quality and applied dose. Results In C1/2, the combination of low kV (100 kVp) with ASIR 40%/60% reduced the mean applied dose significantly by 28% compared to B and by 57% compared to A. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) of tumor to liver/muscle were significantly increased by using C1/2 compared to B and A. With respect to subjective image quality, a slight loss of diagnostic confidence in C1 could be counterbalanced by the higher ASIR blending in C2. Conclusion Combined dose reduction techniques can be used to reduce radiation dose and CA volume without sacrificing image quality and diagnostic confidence in staging CT of NET patients.",Excluded
3455,"Effectiveness of Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography as a Guide for Palliative Radiation Therapy for Spinal Metastases. Objective: As back pain is the presenting symptom in 95% of patients with epidural spinal metastases, appropriately identifying and treating the most symptomatic levels can provide significant palliation. The purpose of this study was to analyze the ability of combined positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) to identify spinal metastases with high metabolic activity and guide radiotherapy. We sought to correlate improvement in back pain with reduction in standard uptake value (SUV) after treatment. Method(s): Retrospective review was performed of 72 patients with spinal metastases treated with stereotactic ablative radiation therapy at a single center between 2002 and 2014. PET/CT was used to calculate SUVs for spinal metastases, and treatment planning was based on PET/CT results. Preoperative and postoperative pain levels were assessed in all patients. Result(s): Reduction in pain scores was found in 78% of treated patients. A significant reduction in pain was identified in patients with >5 metastases compared with fewer lesions (P < 0.05). Degree of change in SUV did not correlate significantly with pain relief. However, comparing pretreatment and posttreatment PET/CT, patients with improved pain consistently displayed decreased SUV. Conclusion(s): PET/CT was shown to be a useful adjunct in radiation treatment planning with change in SUV correlating with symptomatic improvement. This study paves the way for future prospective studies to further assess utility and cost-effectiveness of this imaging modality in radiation treatment planning for spinal metastases.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
841,"Solar radiation, lip protection, and lip cancer risk in Los Angeles County women (California, United States). A population-based case-control study of 74 women with lip cancer diagnosed from 1978 to 1985 in Los Angeles County (California, United States) and frequency matched to 105 controls investigated the risk of solar radiation and protection from lip sunscreening agents to explore the hypothesis that excess incidence of lip cancer seen in men is due partly to lower rates in women, conferred by frequent use of lip protection. We confirm the importance in women of risk factors similar to those found in men, i.e., fair complexion, sun exposure, and smoking. Risk was related strongly to lifetime solar radiation (odds ratio [OR] = 13.5 for highest quartile of exposure, 95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 4.5-40.6, P trend < 0.0001) and time spent outdoors (OR = 4.7 for highest quartile of average yearly hours, CI = 1.9-12.1, P trend = 0.01). Further, among women with high lifetime solar-radiation exposure, those who used lip protection once a day or less had twice the risk of lip cancer than women who used lip protection more than once a day (OR = 7.3, CI = 1.9-27.2 cf OR = 3.2, CI = 1.1-9.2). These findings show that solar radiation is a major risk factor for lip cancer and suggest that lip sunscreening is protective, thereby supporting the hypothesis that use of lipstick and other sunscreening agents by women has contributed to their lower incidence of this disease.",Excluded
2417,"Treatment of type I endoleaks using transcatheter embolization with onyx. Purpose: To report a single-center experience with transcatheter embolization of type I endoleaks using the liquid embolic agent Onyx, an ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer. Method(s): Eight patients (4 men; mean age 74.8 years, range 63-86) with 10 type I endoleaks (6 abdominal and 4 thoracic) diagnosed 2 days to 9 years after endovascular repair were treated with Onyx embolization because cuff extension was precluded by an insufficient landing zone in 6 cases and an unsuitable aortic diameter in 2. Endoleaks were accessed with a 4-F diagnostic catheter and a coaxially introduced dimethylsulfoxide- compatible microcatheter. Onyx-34 was predominantly applied due to its high viscosity; patent side branches were coil embolized prior to Onyx delivery in 3 cases. Result(s): Technical success of the procedure was achieved in all cases. The mean volume of Onyx used for abdominal endoleaks was 11.8 mL (range 3.0-25.5) and 19.4 mL (range 4.5- 31.5) for thoracic endoleaks. The average duration of the procedure was 76.7 minutes (range 34.5-110.6), and the average radiation dose area product was 18.8 cGy*cm2 (range 10.6-55.8). Reperfusion of the endoleak was detected in one case 2 days after the procedure. A second case showed an occluded endoleak but a small trace of contrast between the aortic wall and the stent-graft. Non-target embolization was not found in any case. Mean follow-up was 13.2 months (range 8-24). The mean reduction in diameters for thoracic aneurysms after 6 and 12 months was 0.4 and 0.9 cm, respectively, and 0.6 and 1.2 cm, respectively, for abdominal aneurysms. Conclusion(s): Transcatheter embolization of type I endoleaks using Onyx is a simple, safe, and sustainable treatment option with a high primary success rate for cases in which stentgraft extension is not possible. The benefit of additional coil embolization remains uncertain. © 2014 by the INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF ENDOVASCULAR SPECIALISTS.",Excluded
1560,"DART-bid: dose-differentiated accelerated radiation therapy, 1.8 Gy twice daily: High local control in early stage (I/II) non-small-cell lung cancer. Background: While surgery is considered standard of care for early stage (I/II), non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), radiotherapy is a widely accepted alternative for medically unfit patients or those who refuse surgery. International guidelines recommend several treatment options, comprising stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for small tumors, conventional radiotherapy >= 60 Gy for larger sized especially centrally located lesions or continuous hyperfractionated accelerated RT (CHART). This study presents clinical outcome and toxicity for patients treated with a dose-differentiated accelerated schedule using 1.8 Gy bid (DART-bid). Patients and Methods: Between April 2002 and December 2010, 54 patients (median age 71 years, median Karnofsky performance score 70 %) were treated for early stage NSCLC. Total doses were applied according to tumor diameter: 73.8 Gy for < 2.5 cm, 79.2 Gy for 2.5-4.5 cm, 84.6 Gy for 4.5-6 cm, 90 Gy for > 6 cm. Result(s): The median follow-up was 28.5 months (range 2-108 months); actuarial local control (LC) at 2 and 3 years was 88 %, while regional control was 100 %. There were 10 patients (19 %) who died of the tumor, and 18 patients (33 %) died due to cardiovascular or pulmonary causes. A total of 11 patients (20 %) died intercurrently without evidence of progression or treatment-related toxicity at the last follow-up, while 15 patients (28 %) are alive. Acute esophagitis <= grade 2 occurred in 7 cases, 2 patients developed grade 2 chronic pulmonary fibrosis. Conclusion(s): DART-bid yields high LC without significant toxicity. For centrally located and/or large (> 5 cm) early stage tumors, where SBRT is not feasible, this method might serve as radiotherapeutic alternative to present treatment recommendations, with the need of confirmation in larger cohorts.Copyright © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded

Summary: Identify prognostic factors for survival and patterns of treatment failure after definitive radiochemotherapy for esophageal cancer. Between 2003 and 2006, 143 patients with squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus were retrospectively reviewed. Median age was 65 years (42-81). Median radiation dose was 62.5Gy (38-72) with 1.8-2Gy fraction. Median follow-up was 20.8 months (2.8-92.4). Three and 5-year local recurrence-free survival rates were 58.3% and 50.9%. In univariate analysis, traversable esophageal stricture was a prognostic factor. Three, 5-year locoregional recurrence-free survival rates were 42.4% and 34.9%. In multivariate analysis, traversable esophageal stricture and stage = 97.5 and performance status (PS) = 0 were independent prognostic factors. Median, 3, and 5-year overall survival rates were 22.1 months, 34.4%, and 19.8%. In multivariate analysis, independent prognostic factors were NRI >= 97.5 and PS = 0. Median survival times for the NRI classes (no denutrition, moderate and severe denutrition) were 29.5, 19.7, and 12 months (P = 0.0004), respectively. A major impact of baseline NRI was found in terms of survival; it should be included in future prospective trials. © 2012, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the International Society for Diseases of the Esophagus.",Excluded
659,"A decision support tool for early detection of knee OsteoArthritis using X-ray imaging and machine learning: Data from the OsteoArthritis Initiative. This paper presents a fully developed computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system for early knee OsteoArthritis (OA) detection using knee X-ray imaging and machine learning algorithms. The X-ray images are first preprocessed in the Fourier domain using a circular Fourier filter. Then, a novel normalization method based on predictive modeling using multivariate linear regression (MLR) is applied to the data in order to reduce the variability between OA and healthy subjects. At the feature selection/extraction stage, an independent component analysis (ICA) approach is used in order to reduce the dimensionality. Finally, Naive Bayes and random forest classifiers are used for the classification task. This novel image-based approach is applied on 1024 knee X-ray images from the public database OsteoArthritis Initiative (OAI). The results show that the proposed system has a good predictive classification rate for OA detection (82.98% for accuracy, 87.15% for sensitivity and up to 80.65% for specificity).

3375,"Low-dose semi-coronal CT of the sacroiliac joints in the early diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis. Background: Imaging modalities are essential for the diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Radiographic sacroiliitis is the requirement of 1984 modified New York (mNY) criteria for AS but with the disadvantage of low sensitivity. MRI has the advantage of detecting active inflammatory lesions but was criticized for low specificity. Computerized tomography (CT) has higher diagnostic accuracy than radiography in detecting structural changes, but its application has been limited for high radiation dose. The reduction of radiation dose can be achieved by decreasing the tube current[1] and previous study has demonstrated that effective dose (ED) of semi-coronal sacroiliac joint (SIJ) CT is at least six times lower in female or nearly four times lower in male than that of axial SIJ CT[2]. Objective(s): To evaluate the value of low-dose semi-coronal SIJ CT in the early diagnosis of AS. Method(s): Thirty-three patients diagnosed by mNY criteria who had pre-existing axial SIJ CT in past two years with visible structural damage were enrolled. These patients underwent low-dose semi-coronal SIJ CT examination which was obtained at 3-mm slices, 140 kV and 120 mAs, with the gantry tilted 20-25degree cranially. The ED of the low-dose semi-coronal CT and the pre-existing conventional axial CT were compared. Image qualities of the low-dose semicoronal CT were blind-graded separately by 2 rheumatologists into poor, fair, good or excellent. And the correlation between image quality and body mass index (BMI) was analyzed. The CT scans were read in a blinded manner by 2 rheumatologists who had been trained by radiologists. CT scans of the two groups were graded respectively by mNY criteria, the criteria established by Lee[3] and the Innsbruck criteria[4]. The kappa coefficient was used to assess the consistency of grading between the two groups. Result(s): Thirty-three patients received low-dose semi-coronal CT examination with an average ED of 3.37 mSv, which meant a 49% reduction in radiation compared to the pre-existing CT. The quality of images of male patients with BMI<25 kg/m2 and all female patients were good or excellent. Image qualities were assessed as poor or fair in 58% (7/12) male patients whose BMI>25 kg/m2. There was a significant negative correlation between image quality and BMI (r=-0.784,P=0.000). The grading of low-dose semi-coronal CT showed no differences as compared with the pre-existing CT by mNY criteria (see below). For the other two classification criteria, the consistency of grading between the two groups were satisfactory (kappa=0.897 by Lee criteria; kappa=0.814 by Innsbruck criteria; P>0.05). Conclusion(s): The radiation dose of low-dose semi-coronal SIJ CT was reduced significantly compared with the conventional axial SIJ CT with acceptable diagnostic efficacy.

2646,"[Characteristics of postural corrective responses before and after long-term spaceflight]. Balance function is dramatically deteriorated after exposure to microgravity. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the role and the contribution of different gravity sensory systems to the development of balance impairment after long-term spaceflights. Postural perturbations (pushes to the chest) of the threshold, medium, and sub-maximal intensities were produced in eight cosmonauts before, and on the day 3, 7, and 11 following spaceflight. Postural corrective responses were analyzed by anterior-posterior body sway fluctuation and electromyographic activity of leg muscles. The characteristics of the postural corrective responses changed significantly on the day 3 following spaceflight: the amplitude of posterior sway caused by perturbation of threshold intensity was increased reaching 135% ofpreflight value; the corrective responses lasted more than 6 s in 50% of all trials, while it did not last more than 4 s in 96% before spaceflight. The EMG responses were characterized by increased contribution of medium- and long-latency reactions. On the day 11 following spaceflight, most of the characteristics of postural corrective responses were close to preflight values. We assumed that the balance alterations after spaceflight are caused by changes in weightlessness of functions of two main gravity sensory systems, namely, weight-bearing and vestibular one. The deficit of weight-bearing afferentation triggers a decline of the extensors' muscle tone, while changes of vestibular function cause a decline of accuracy of postural corrections.",Excluded
3475,"Brachytherapy in lip carcinoma: Long-term results. Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of low-dose-rate brachytherapy for local control and relapse-free survival in squamous cell and basal cell carcinomas of the lips. We compared two groups: one with tumors on the skin and the other with tumors on the lip. Patients and Methods: All patients had been treated at Claudius Regaud Cancer Centre from 1990 to 2008 for squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma. Low-dose-rate brachytherapy was performed with iridium 192 wires according to the Paris system rules. On average, the dose delivered was 65 Gy. Result(s): 172 consecutive patients were included in our study; 69 had skin carcinoma (squamous cell or basal cell), and 92 had squamous cell mucosal carcinoma. The average follow-up time was 5.4 years. In the skin cancer group, there were five local recurrences and one lymph node recurrence. In the mucosal cancer group, there were ten local recurrences and five lymph node recurrences. The 8-year relapse-free survival for the entire population was 80%. The 8-year relapse-free survival was 85% for skin carcinoma 75% for mucosal carcinoma, with no significant difference between groups. The functional results were satisfactory for 99% of patients, and the cosmetic results were satisfactory for 92%. Maximal toxicity observed was Grade 2. Conclusion(s): Low-dose-rate brachytherapy can be used to treat lip carcinomas at Stages T1 and T2 as the only treatment with excellent results for local control and relapse-free survival. The benefits of brachytherapy are also cosmetic and functional, with 91% of patients having no side effects. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1002,"Human dosimetry and preliminary tumor distribution of 18F- fluoropaclitaxel in healthy volunteers and newly diagnosed breast cancer patients using PET/CT. 18F-fluoropaclitaxel is a radiolabeled form of paclitaxel, a widely used chemotherapy agent. Preclinical data suggest that 18F-fluoropaclitaxel may be a reasonable surrogate for measuring the uptake of paclitaxel. As a substrate of P-glycoprotein, a drug efflux pump associated with multidrug resistance, 18F-fluoropaclitaxel may also be useful in identifying multidrug resistance and predicting tumor response for drugs other than paclitaxel. Method(s): After informed consent was obtained, 3 healthy volunteers and 3 patients with untreated breast cancer (neoadjuvant chemotherapy candidates, tumor size > 2 cm) received an intravenous infusion of 18F-fluoropaclitaxel and then underwent PET/CT. Healthy volunteers underwent serial whole-body imaging over an approximately 3-h interval, and organ 18F residence times were determined from the time-activity curves uncorrected for decay to determine dosimetry. Radiation dose estimates were calculated using OLINDA/EXM software. For breast cancer patients, dynamic imaging of the primary tumor was performed for 60 min, followed by static whole-body scans at 1 and 2 h after injection. Result(s): Dosimetry calculations showed that the gallbladder received the highest dose (229.50 muGy/MBq [0.849 rad/mCi]), followed by the small and large intestines (161.26 muGy/MBq [0.597 rad/mCi] and 184.59 muGy/MBq [0.683 rad/mCi]). The resultant effective dose was 28.79 muGy/MBq (0.107 rem/mCi). At approximately 1 h after injection, an average of 42% of the decay-corrected activity was in the gastrointestinal system, with a mean of 0.01% in the tumor. All 3 breast cancer patients showed retention of 18F-fluoropaclitaxel and ultimately demonstrated a complete pathologic response (no invasive cancer in the breast or axillary nodes) to chemotherapy that included a taxane (either paclitaxel or docetaxel) at surgical resection. The tumor-to-background ratio increased with time to a maximum of 7.7 at 20 min. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates the feasibility of using 18F-fluoropaclitaxel PET/CT tumor imaging and provides radiation dosimetry measurements in humans. Although further study is needed, it is hoped that the measured intratumoral 18F-fluoropaclitaxel distribution can serve as a surrogate for paclitaxel, and potentially other chemotherapeutic agent retention, in solid tumors.

Purpose: To evaluate the predictive factors of radiation pneumonitis (RP) and associated changes in pulmonary function after definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Material(s) and Method(s): Medical records of 60 patients with NSCLC who received definitive CCRT were retrospectively reviewed. Dose volumetric (DV) parameters, clinical factors, and pulmonary function test (PFT) data were analyzed. RP was graded according to the CTCAE ver. 4.0. Percentage of lung volume that received a dose of threshold (Vdose) and mean lung dose (MLD) were analyzed for potential DV predictors. PFT changes were calculated as the difference between pre-RT and post-RT values at 3, 6, and 12 months after RT. Result(s): Twenty-two patients (37%) developed grade >=2 RP. Among clinical factors, tumor location in lower lobe was associated with RP. Among the DV parameters, only MLD >15 Gy was associated with grade >=2 RP. There were statistically significant decreases in PFT at all points compared with pre-RT values in grade >=2 RP group. MLD was associated with forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) changes at 6 and 12 months. V10 was associated with FVC changes at 12 months. V20 and V30 were associated with FEV1 changes at 6 months and FVC changes at 12 months. Conclusion(s): After definitive CCRT in patients with NSCLC, MLD >15 Gy and lower lobe tumor location were predictors of grade >=2 RP. Pulmonary functions were decreased after CCRT and the magnitude of changes was associated with DV parameters. © 2013. The Korean Society for Radiation Oncology.",Excluded
3148,"Phase 1 Fractional Dose-Escalation Study of Equipotent Stereotactic Radiation Therapy Regimens for Early-Stage Glottic Larynx Cancer. PURPOSE: Early-stage glottic larynx squamous cell carcinoma (GLC) is a relatively common disease with excellent oncologic control, but treatment is associated with acute dysphagia and long-term voice quality changes. This phase 1 study of hypofractionated radiation therapy for early-stage GLC increased the fraction size while reducing the number of fractions until 5-fraction stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SABR) was delivered., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eligible patients had received a diagnosis of stage Tis to T2 GLC. Patients who had undergone prior curative-intent surgery were excluded. The equipotent dose levels were as follows: (1) level 0, 50 Gy in 15 fractions (n = 4); (2) level 1, 45 Gy in 10 fractions (n = 13); and (3) level 2, 42.5 Gy in 5 fractions (SABR level, n = 12). Grade 3 or 4 laryngeal edema, voice, dyspnea, stridor, or cough were the predefined dose-limiting toxicities., RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were enrolled from November 2013 to March 2017. The median and minimum follow-up times were 39.2 and 13 months, respectively. Two actively smoking patients, 1 treated in level 1 (grade 4 laryngeal edema, grade 3 dysphagia) and 1 treated in level 2 (grade 3 laryngeal necrosis, dysphagia), developed dose-limiting toxicities. The former patient soon developed a local recurrence, and the latter patient recovered. There were a total of 5 local recurrences: 2 in level 0 and 3 in level 1. The Voice Handicap Index results showed robust long-term voice quality with median values of 7 and 0 at 6 and 12 months, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Given the tolerability, excellent voice outcomes, and preliminary efficacy data of 5-fraction glottic larynx SABR, this regimen warrants further study.

1208,"Predictors of toxicity associated with stereotactic body radiation therapy to the central hepatobiliary tract. PURPOSE: To identify dosimetric predictors of hepatobiliary (HB) toxicity associated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for liver tumors., METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively reviewed 96 patients treated with SBRT for primary (53%) or metastatic (47%) liver tumors between March 2006 and November 2013. The central HB tract (cHBT) was defined by a 15-mm expansion of the portal vein from the splenic confluence to the first bifurcation of left and right portal veins. Patients were censored for toxicity upon local progression or additional liver-directed therapy. HB toxicities were graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. To compare different SBRT fractionations, doses were converted to biologically effective doses (BED) by using the standard linear quadratic model alpha/beta = 10 (BED10)., RESULTS: Median follow-up was 12.7 months after SBRT. Median BED10 was 85.5 Gy (range: 37.5-151.2). The median number of fractions was 5 (range: 1-5), with 51 patients (53.1%) receiving 5 fractions and 29 patients (30.2%) receiving 3 fractions. In total, there were 23 (24.0%) grade 2+ and 18 (18.8%) grade 3+ HB toxicities. Nondosimetric factors predictive of grade 3+ HB toxicity included cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) histology (P<.0001), primary liver tumor (P=.0087), and biliary stent (P<.0001). Dosimetric parameters most predictive of grade 3+ HB toxicity were volume receiving above BED10 of 72 Gy (VBED1072) >= 21 cm(3) (relative risk [RR]: 11.6, P<.0001), VBED1066 >= 24 cm(3) (RR: 10.5, P<.0001), and mean BED10 (DmeanBED10) cHBT >=14 Gy (RR: 9.2, P<.0001), with VBED1072 and VBED1066 corresponding to V40 and V37.7 for 5 fractions and V33.8 and V32.0 for 3 fractions, respectively. VBED1072 >= 21 cm(3), VBED1066 >= 24 cm(3), and DmeanBED10 cHBT >=14 Gy were consistently predictive of grade 3+ toxicity on multivariate analysis., CONCLUSIONS: VBED1072, VBED1066, and DmeanBED10 to cHBT are associated with HB toxicity.

404,"Safety and accuracy of spinal instrumentation surgery in a hybrid operating room with an intraoperative cone-beam computed tomography. Although spinal instrumentation technique has undergone revolutionary progress over the past few decades, it may still carry significant surgery-related risks. The purpose of the present study was to assess the radiological accuracy of spinal screw instrumentation using a hybrid operating room (OR) and quantify the related radiation exposure. This retrospective study included 33 cases of complex spine fusion surgeries that were conducted using a hybrid OR with a flat panel detector (FPD) angiography system. Twelve cases (36.4%) were cervical, and 21 (63.6%) were thoracolumbar. The average number of spine fusion levels was 3 and 4.8, respectively, at the cervical and thoracolumbar spine levels. A FPD angiography system was used for intraoperative cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) to obtain multi-slice spine images. All operations were conducted under optimized radiation shielding. Entrance surface doses (ESDs) and exposure times were recorded in all cases. A total of 313 screws were placed. Satisfactory screw insertion could be achieved in all cases with safe screw placement in 97.4% and acceptable placement in 2.6%. None of the cases showed any significant anatomical violation by the screws. The radiation exposure to the patients was absolutely consistent with the desired ESD value, and that to the surgeons, under the annual dose limit. These results suggest that the hybrid OR with a FPD angiography system is helpful to achieve safe and precise spinal fusion surgery, especially in complex cases.",Excluded
424,"Magnetic resonance spectroscopic study of radiogenic changes after radiosurgery of cerebral arteriovenous malformations with implications for the differential diagnosis of radionecrosis. Background: The incidence of radionecrosis after radiosurgery is 5-20%. That radionecrosis after radiosurgery may be confused with a malignant tumor is a known phenomenon and problem. Method(s): Three similarly treated patients with cAVM, 1 patient with symptomatic radionecrosis and 2 patients with normal post-radiation MRI changes, were selected and studied in detail with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). 2 cAVM were located in eloquent locations and were classified as Spetzler-Martin grade (SM) III such that interdisciplinary radiosurgery was recommended; a third patient with a left frontal SM II cAVM refused surgery. 1 patient was male, and 2 were female. The patient's ages ranged from 38 to 62 years (median, 39 years). The nidus volume (= planning target volume = PTV) ranged from 2.75 to 6.89 ccm (median, 6.41 ccm). The single dose was 20 Gy at the isocenter of the PTV encompassing the 80 - 90% isodose. The median follow-up period was 20 months (range, 16 - 84 months). Toxicities were evaluated with the Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) for adverse events version 3.0. Result(s): No patient suffered a bleeding from cAVM during the study period. A complete nidus occlusion was shown in all patients with time-resolved MRA. All patients showed radiogenic MRI changes, 1 patient showed excessive radionecrosis. This patient was oligosymptomatic and under temporary corticoid therapy symptoms resolved completely.Following patterns associated with radionecrosis in the MRS studies were identified in our collective:. * 2D spectroscopic imaging (2D-SI) revealed much lower concentrations of metabolites in the lesion as compared to contralateral healthy tissue in all patients.* Whereas regions with regular post-radiosurgery effects showed almost normal levels of Cho and a Cho/Cr ratio < 2.0, regions with radionecrosis were characterized by increased lipid levels and a Cho/Cr ratio > 2.0 in conjunction with decreased absolute levels of all metabolites, especially of Cr and NAA. Conclusion(s): MRS is an increasingly valuable tool for the differential diagnosis of radiation reactions. Specific patterns of MRS spectra in radionecrosis were identified; in synopsis with clinical parameters, these changes have to be taken into account to avoid misdiagnosis. © 2013 Bostrom et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
1299,"Effects of gamma radiation on development, sterility, fecundity, and sex ratio of Dermanyssus gallinae (DeGeer) (Acari: Dermanyssidae). Protonymphal Dermanyssus gallinae were irradiated with 0.50, 0.75, 1.0, 3.0, and 6.0 krad of gamma radiation and subsequently monitored regarding their developmental, feeding, and mating success. Also, sex ratios of adults treated as protonymphs were recorded as were sex ratios of embryos and F1 adults produced by these adults. Doses up to 1.0 krad did not prevent development of treated protonymphs to the adult stage or stop mating. Three krad reduced the number of treated protonymphs attaining adulthood and 6.0-krad treatment prevented all mites from developing to the adult stage. Egg (embryo) production was normal for mites treated with 0.50 krad, but significantly curtailed by doses of 0.75 krad and greater. Radiation doses used in this study did not appear to affect the normal variable sex ratios observed in untreated mites.",Excluded
780,"Prognosis of severe lymphopenia after postoperative radiotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer: Results of a long-term follow up study. Purpose: To investigate the incidence and prognosis of severe radiation-induced lymphopenia (sRIL) after postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) for resected NSCLC. Patients and Methods: Between 1998 and 2017, 170 patients treated with PORT for NSCLC were retrospectively reviewed. Lymphopenia was divided into tertiles with severe lymphopenia defined as absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) < 0.37 x 103/ul. Result(s): sRIL was observed in 32.3% of patients. Multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated sRIL was associated with planning target volume radiation fraction numbers (OR 1.09, p = 0.005) and total lung mean dose (OR 1.12, p = 0.006). With a median follow-up time of 12.2 years, the median progression-free survival and overall survival were 14.8 months and 28.4 months respectively in patients with sRIL, vs. 21.7 months (p = 0.008) and 48.3 months (p = 0.01) respectively in patients without sRIL. Multivariable analyses indicated sRIL significantly decreased OS (HR 1.95, p < 0.01). Since PORT for stage I-II NSCLC was done largely for positive margins, which may confound the contribution of severe RIL, we analyzed stage III separately and found that sRIL also significantly decreased OS (HR 1.88, p = 0.004) in multivariable analysis. Conclusion(s): For this long-term outcome study, severe RIL correlated with total lung mean dose and radiation fractionation numbers, and was a strong prognostic factor for poor survival in PORT patients, particularly in patients with stage III NSCLC, highlighting the importance of an intact immune system for post-radiation immunologic disease surveillance.Copyright © 2021 The Authors",Excluded

Radiotherapy is effective for the palliation of pain associated with primary and metastatic bony neoplasia in dogs and humans, but no standard treatment protocol has been established. The goal of this study was to evaluate a 3 x 8 Gy and a 4 x 6 Gy protocol using electrons with a betatron or linear accelerator for the treatment of appendicular osteosarcoma in 54 dogs. Thirty-three dogs received chemotherapy consisting of carboplatin IV concurrently with radiotherapy. Eighty-three % (n = 45) of the dogs experienced pain relief during or following treatment. The median duration of pain relief from treatment start was 53 days. In conclusion, both protocols are effective for palliation of clinical signs of canine appendicular osteosarcoma. The outcome reported here is similar to the results of other studies using Co photons. The use of chemotherapy did not improve the response to radiotherapy.",Excluded
1974,"Tuberculosis among migrant populations in sicily: A field report. Background. In the EU, tuberculosis (TB) mainly affects vulnerable people, including migrants. From 2014 to 2017, we have estimated the frequency of both tuberculosis and latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) among the migrant population hosted in 41 reception centers in western Sicily (ITaCA network). Materials and Methods. All migrants were consecutively recruited for the screening of TB infection with physical examination and TST in 1,020 migrants and with IGRA in the others 2,690. The screening was carried out 4-8 weeks after landing in Sicily. For all migrants with a positive screening test, chest X-ray and smear examination were performed. LTBI was defined by positivity of TST or IGRA with negative X-ray chest, clinical, and smear examination. Active TB was defined by radiological and/or clinical and/or sputum positivity in a patient with a TST or IGRA positivity. Results. We evaluated a total of 3,710 migrants, of which 89% came from Sub-Saharan countries; 2,811 were males, 899 were females, with a median age of 22 years (IQR: 18-25). TB infection was diagnosed in 501 persons (13.5%) of which 440 (11.8%) had LTBI and 61 had active TB (1.6%): 1 had lymph node TB, 1 had intestinal TB, and 59 had pulmonary TB (38 sputum smear positive TB; no drug-resistant TB were observed).

1692,"Determination of physical parameters associated with self-efficacy in patients with chronic mechanic low back pain. BACKGROUND: Self-efficacy that is associated with various pain-related disabilities such as chronic low back pain (LBP), should be questioned besides physical assessments. OBJECTIVE(S): To investigate the physical factors associated with self-efficacy in patients with chronic mechanic LBP. METHOD(S): One hundred nine patients diagnosed as chronic mechanic LBP (65 females, 44 males) between 20-50 years old were included to this study. The intensity of LBP was assessed by using a 10-cm Visual Analogue Scale. For musculoskeletal fitness measurement; muscle strength, muscle endurance, and flexibility tests were applied. Functional Reach Test for balance evaluation, Self-Efficacy Scale for self-efficacy measurement, Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire for disability level evaluation were used. RESULT(S): We found a moderate negative correlation between self-efficacy and pain intensity (r=-0.506); a negative and strong correlation between self-efficacy and disability level (r=-0.654) (p< 0.05). Self efficacy had a significant association with right (r= 0.265) and left (r= 0.290) lateral side bending flexibility (p< 0.05). According to multiple regression analysis results, it was found that disability level had a significant effect on self-efficacy (beta=-2.014; p< 0.01). CONCLUSION(S): Poor musculoskeletal fitness and pain intensity may cause decreasing self-efficacy but the major determinant of decreased self-efficacy was low-back related disability scores.Copyright © 2018 - IOS Press and the authors.

2486,"Correlation of bone mineral density with skeletal muscle content and physical activity. BACKGROUND: Bone mineral density is the most important indicator for bone level. Osteoporosis is a worldwide problem, and there is no safe and effective radical treatment. It can only be prevented, so bone mineral density arise more attention. OBJECTIVE(S): To explore the relationship between skeletal muscle content, physical activity level and bone mineral density in older adults, so as to provide theoretical basis for preventing osteoporosis treatment. METHOD(S): Totally 111 subjects aged 40 to 84 years were recruited randomly. The bone mineral density was measured by double energy X-Ray bone density meter, and the human skeletal muscle content, fat content and percentage of skeletal muscle were measured by human body component analyzer. The variance analysis was used for multiple group comparisons in different age groups, LSD method for comparisons between groups, and Pearson correlation analysis for correlation analysis. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION(S): Bone mineral density was significantly related to the physical activity, body mass, and skeletal muscle content (r=0.30, 0.41, and 0.45, P < 0.01). For middle and older adults, skeletal muscle content, physical activity level and body mass were positively related to bone mineral density. Age and bone mineral density had a negative relationship. These results indicate that physical activity is an important factor affecting bone density, and higher level of physical activity is beneficial to maintain and improve bone mineral density. Increasing muscle mass and improving body composition can improve bone mineral density.Copyright © 2018, Journal of Clinical Rehabilitative Tissue Engineering Research. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2893,"Stereotactic body radiation therapy for lung metastases from soft tissue sarcoma. Purpose: To appraise the role of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in patients with lung metastasis from primary soft tissue sarcoma. Method(s): Twenty-eight patients (51 lesions) were analysed. All patients were in good performance status (1-2 eastern cooperative oncology group (ECOG)), unsuitable for surgical resection, with controlled primary tumour and the number of lung metastases was <=4. In a risk adaptive scheme, the dose prescription was: 30 Gy/1 fr, 60 Gy/3 fr, 60 Gy/8 fr and 48 Gy/4 fr. Treatments were performed with Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy. Clinical outcome was evaluated by thoracic and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan before SBRT and than every 3 months. Toxicity was evaluated with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) scale version 4.0. Result(s): Leiomyosarcoma (36%) and synovial sarcoma (25%) were the most common histologies. Five patients (18%) initially presented with pulmonary metastasis, whereas 23 (82%) developed them at a median time of 51 months (range 11-311 months) from the initial diagnosis. The median follow-up time from initial diagnosis was 65 months (5-139 months) and from SBRT was 21 months (2-80 months). No severe toxicity (grades III-IV) was recorded and no patients required hospitalisation. The actuarial 5-years local control rate (from SBRT treatment) was 96%. Overall survival at 2 and 5 years was 96.2% and 60.5%, respectively. At last follow-up 15 patients (54%) were alive. All other died because of distant progression. Conclusion(s): SBRT provides excellent local control of pulmonary metastasis from soft tissue sarcoma (STS) and may improve survival in selected patients. SBRT should be considered for all patients with pulmonary metastasis (PM) and evaluated in a multidisciplinary team.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
3568,"Pattern of care and outcome in elderly patients with glioblastoma: Data in 151 patients from 3 Lombardia Hospitals. The appropriate treatment approach for elderly patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is unclear, although different studies suggest survival benefit in fit patients treated with radiotherapy and chemiotherapy after surgery. We performed a retrospective analysis of 151 patients older than 65 years with GBM treated in 3 Lombardia Hospitals. In univariate regression analysis higher KPS (p = 0.02), macroscopical total resection (p < 0.003), radiotherapy (p < 0.0001), chemotherapy (p < 0.0001) and second line chemotheraphy (p = 0.02) were of positive prognostic value. On the contrary older age (> 70 years), presence of seizure at onset and additional resection after tumor recurrence did not influence OS. Multivariate analysis revealed radiotherapy (HR 0.2 p < 0.0001) and extent of surgery (HR 0.3, p = 0,0063) as positive independent prognostic factors. Patients receiving radio-chemiotherapy displayed more treatment-related toxicities with a slightly prolonged OS versus those receiving hypofractionated radiotherapy. With the limits of a retrospective study, our data suggest that in elderly fit patients extensive surgery should be considered, moreover adjuvant treatments led to an increase in OS. Randomized controlled study are needed to develop treatment guidelines for elderly GBM patients and to assess whether the combination of post-surgical radio and chemiotherapy may be superior to hypofractionated radiotherapy and chemiotherapy in fit patients.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
2832,"A specific melon concentrate exhibits photoprotective effects from antioxidant activity in healthy adults. Skin is the largest body organ and the first barrier to exogenous threats. This organ is constantly exposed to external factors such as ultraviolet radiation, which induces many adverse effects including sunburn, depigmentation, photo aging, photo immune suppression, and even skin cancer. Antioxidants seem to be good candidates in order to reduce ultraviolet-mediated damages and to prevent the health consequences of ultraviolet exposure. The present investigation aims to further characterize the potential skin photoprotective effects of a food supplementation and a topical administration of a melon concentrate alone or in combination. A clinical study assessing the Minimal Erythema Dose (MED) was first set up to evaluate photoprotection. Afterward, an independent in vitro study was performed on human skin explants from a donor to evaluate the effect of the melon concentrate at different levels including on the sunburn cells formation and on the endogenous antioxidant enzymes and its influence on melanin. Clinical study results demonstrate that melon concentrate application and/or supplementation increased MED. It also increased the endogenous antioxidant enzymes and reduced sunburn cells and melanin level on irradiated skin explants. Therefore, it is suggested that melon concentrate administration (oral and/or topical) could be a useful strategy for photoprotection due to its antioxidant properties.Copyright © 2018 by the authors.

1812,"Potential values of metabolic tumor volume and heterogeneity measured with 18F-FDG PET/CT pretreatment to evaluate local control for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated with nonsurgical therapy. Objectives: The aim of the study was to evaluate the predictive value of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET/computed tomography (CT) pretreatment on local control (LC) and survival after radical radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and to discuss its potential value for establishing optimal radiation treatment plans. Method(s): Fifty-eight patients with pathologically proven esophageal SCC who underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT pretreatment in our center were retrospectively reviewed. We examined the correlation between the PET parameters of primary tumors and LC and overall survival. The coefficient of variation was used to estimate the 18F-FDG uptake in heterogeneity. Result(s): The mean duration of follow-up for surviving patients was 38 months, and 36 patients died because of tumor recurrence or other diseases. The rates of 3-year overall survival and LC were 40.4 and 50.4%, respectively. Multivariate analysis of LC revealed that metabolic tumor volume (MTV) greater than 16.08ml was the only predictor of outcome, with a lower 3-year LC (P = 0.017, hazard ratio: 1.608, 95% confidence interval: 1.090-2.371). The coefficient of variations of their primary lesion were higher compared with those of patients who had smaller MTVs. Conclusion(s): In this study, MTV assessed by PET/CT might be an adverse factor for predicting LC in esophageal SCC. For those with higher MTVs, higher intratumor heterogeneity suggests that irradiation may need to be boosted in stable high-uptake regions to improve LC. These results need to be prospectively validated in larger cohorts.Copyright © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

1816,"A new recombined double low restorer line for the Ogu-INRA cms in rapeseed (Brassica napus L.). A major objective of breeders using the Ogu-INRA cytoplasmic male sterility (cms) system in rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) is to obtain double low restorer lines with a shorter introgression and a good agronomic value. The development of low glucosinolate content (low GC) restorer lines often occurs through the deletion of a part of the introgression. One of these lines has lost the radish Pgi-2 allele expression, without recovering that of the rapeseed Pgi-2 allele. This line shows a defect in the meiotic transmission of the restorer gene Rfo and a very poor agronomic value. We initiated a programme to force non-spontaneous recombination between this Rfo-carrying introgression and the rapeseed homologous chromosome from a low GC B. napus line. Gamma ray irradiation was used to induce chromosome breakage just prior meiosis aiming at just such a recombination. Low GC cms plants were crossed with the pollen of irradiated plants that were heterozygous for this introgression. The F 2 families were scored for their vigour, transmission rate of Rfo and female fertility. One family of plants, R2000, showed an improved behaviour for these three traits. This family presented a unique combination of molecular markers when compared to other rapeseed restorers analysed, which suggests that the recombination event allowed the recovery of B. oleracea genetic information that was originally replaced by the radish introgression in the original restorers. This resulted in a duplicated region (originating from radish and B. oleracea) on the chromosome carrying the introgression in the R2000 family. © Springer-Verlag 2005.",Excluded

Materials and methods Phase-1 enrolled 118 patients. Bilateral ureteral lengths were measured by CT scan from the level of the renal vein to VUJ. They were grouped according to body height and median length for each were obtained. Phase-2 was a prospective randomisedtrial involving 60 patients undergoing ureteral stenting. 6F Double-J stents were used and choice of length in Group A was based on the devised guide; and using intraoperative ureteral length measurement with 5F catheter in Group B. Fluoroscopy time was recorded. Intravesical position of stent was determined by postoperative X-ray. USSQ score, were analysed two-weeks postoperatively. Results The median right and left ureteral length for male patients were 20.9 cm (18-27) and 21.3 cm (17-27); for female patients they were 20.7 cm (16-24) and 22.0 (17-25) respectively. Phase one concluded that double-J stents of 22 cm in length were suitable for all but men >=170 cm and women >=160 cm where a 24 cm stent is more appropriate. In Phase-2, median age was 49 (17-71) and median height of male and female patients were 165 cm (152-175) and 149 cm (140- 172) respectively. Fluoroscopy time is significantly shorter in Group A (3.03 vs 6.43 s, P = 0.001) and incidence of the distal loop crossing the midline was lower (0 vs 11, P < 0.001).

2734,"Effectiveness of gene expression profiling for response prediction of rectal cancer to preoperative radiotherapy. Background: Our aim was to determine whether the expression levels of specific genes could predict clinical radiosensitivity in human colorectal cancer. Method(s): Radioresistant colorectal cancer cell lines were established by repeated X-ray exposure (total, 100 Gy), and the gene expressions of the parent and radioresistant cell lines were compared in a microarray analysis. To verify the microarray data, we carried out a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of identified genes in clinical samples from 30 irradiated rectal cancer patients. Result(s): A comparison of the intensity data for the parent and three radioresistant cell lines revealed 17 upregulated and 142 downregulated genes in all radioresistant cell lines. Next, we focused on two upregulated genes, PTMA (prothymosin alpha) and EIF5a2 (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A), in the radioresistant cell lines. In clinical samples, the expression of PTMA was significantly higher in the minor effect group than in the major effect group (P = 0.004), but there were no significant differences in EIF5a2 expression between the two groups. Conclusion(s): We identified radiation-related genes in colorectal cancer and demonstrated that PTMA may play an important role in radiosensitivity. Our findings suggest that PTMA may be a novel marker for predicting the effectiveness of radiotherapy in clinical cases. © Springer-Verlag Tokyo 2007.",Excluded
2573,"Comparative evaluation of radiation therapy techniques for mediastinum irradiation in lymphoma patients using IMRT, B-VMAT, 3DCRT. Introduction: Radiation therapy is effective in treating mediastinal lymphomas, but the question of its long-term radiation effects, such as induced breast cancer, lung cancer, and heart disease, has been increasingly raised in recent years. The aim of our work was to compare the radiation doses that receive heart, lungs, and mammary glands (MG) during irradiation of mediastinal lymphomas by 3 different techniques: IMRT, B-VMAT, 3DCRT. Method(s): A radiation therapy plan was calculated for each of the indicated techniques for 7 mediastinal lymphoma patients. Photon energy: 6 MV, target dose: 30 Gy/15 fractions, planned target volume (PTV) coverage: 98% PTV covered by at least 95% isodose. IMRT and B-VMAT plans were calculated by inverse planning, and 3DCRT by direct planning using the Monte Carlo algorithm. Each IMRT plan consists of 7 coplanar fields almost equally spaced around a patient, using the ability not to pass through MG. B-VMAT plan is a composition of 3 non-coplanar VMAT arcs, couch 0degree G330degree/G30degree, couch 0degree G150degree/G180degree+G181degree/G210degree and couch 270degree G330degree/G30degree. 3DCRT plan is a couple of AP-PA fields with an addition of small portion of posterior oblique fields that lead to maximum dose outside PTV avoidance without adding any significant dose to lungs. An extra sub-volume ""heart inside PTV"" was created for inverse optimization in order to keep its dose theraputical and avoid any possible maximum inside the heart. Result(s): With a probability of p < 0.05, the following parameters were estimated. Average volumes of PTV (620 +/- 170) cc, MG (710 +/- 660) cc, total lung (2950+/-420) cc and heart (590 +/- 90) cc. Dose-Volume relations are given in following table Conclusion(s): With the stated above PTV coverage, the IMRT technique can significantly increase the conformity index of the plan and lead to the lowest dose to the heart in all studied parameters, but showed the highest dose to the lungs-both mean dose and V20. The B-VMAT technique can significantly reduce V4 MG while maintaining minimum V25 heart and V20 lungs. At the same time, despite the low mean dose to the heart-inside-PTV, the mean dose to the whole heart with this technique is higher compared to the IMRT technique due to the increase in V5 heart. The standard 3DCRT technique achieves the lowest average dose to the lungs, but has not shown any advantages in the rest of considered critical organs. The scatter of the data is due to the large variability of the physiological parameters of the patients, in order to specify the obtained data the study is proceeded. .",Excluded

Cancer centers provided data on oncological outcomes, including survival, and disease and colostomy status at one-year. EORTC-QLQ core (C30) and colorectal (CR29) questionnaires were completed at baseline and one-year followup. The PRO scores at baseline and one year were compared., RESULTS: 40 UK Cancer Centers returned data with a total of 187 patients included in the analysis. 92% received mitomycin with 5-fluorouracil or capecitabine. One-year overall survival was 94%; 84% were disease-free and 86% colostomy-free at one-year followup. At one year, PRO results found significant improvements in buttock pain, blood and mucus in stools, pain, constipation, appetite loss, and health anxiety compared to baseline. No significant deteriorations were reported in diarrhea, bowel frequency, and flatulence. Urinary symptom scores were low at one year. Moderate impotence symptoms at baseline remained at one year, and a moderate deterioration in dyspareunia reported., CONCLUSIONS: With national anal cancer IMRT implementation, at this early pre-defined time point, one-year oncological outcomes were reassuring and resulted in good disease-related symptom control. one-year symptomatic complications following CRT for anal cancer using IMRT techniques appear to be relatively mild. These PRO results provide a basis to benchmark future studies. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1553,"The advantage of 3D conformal treatment of lumbar spine metastases in comparison to traditional PA or AP-PA techniques: Restoring an intermediate niche of therapeutic sophistication. Background: To evaluate the effect of the 3D radiation field design on normal tissues compared with commonly used appositional fields in patients with lumbar spine metastases.Methods and materials: Ten comparative treatment plans for radiation of lumbar spine metastases were compared for posterior and anterior- posterior fields with 3D plans. Result(s): The PTV coverage in all comparative plans was similar. V 15 of the bowel in 3D, AP-PA and PA plans was 6.7 Gy (SD 6.47), 39.8 Gy (SD 11.4) and 37.3 Gy (SD15.7), respectively (p < 0.0001). The mean dose to both kidneys was 9.6 Gy (SD 4.8), 4.1 Gy (SD 3.9) and 4.6 Gy (SD 4.4) for appropriate plans (p = 0.002). Maximal dose to the spinal cord was 30.6 Gy (SD 2.1), 33.1 Gy (SD 9.8) and 37.7 Gy (SD 2) for 3D, AP-PA and PA plans. Conclusion(s): 3D conformal treatment planning of lumbar vertebral metastases was significantly better in term of bowel and spinal cord exposure compared to AP-PA and PA techniques. The exposure of the kidneys in 3D plans, while greater than in the comparative plans, did not violate accepted dose-volume thresholds. © 2013 Soyfer et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
915,"Age assessment by magnetic resonance imaging of the knee: A preliminary study. The authors developed an original magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) staging system for epiphyseal fusion of growth plate maturation of the knee and evaluated its reliability and validity for age assessment of living individuals. A total of 290 MRI scans of the knee were reviewed retrospectively in patients aged from 10 to 30 years old (138 males, 152 females). Five original MRI stages were defined to assess the degree of maturation of the distal femoral and proximal tibial epiphyses. Intra-observer variability was excellent and inter-observer variability was good, demonstrating the reliability and the validity of this original MRI staging system. In both sexes, the changes of growth plates (proximal tibial or distal femoral) were associated with age (p < 0.001). Our results agreed with classic data on skeletal maturation of the knee, with globally earlier maturation in females than in males, and also earlier maturation of the proximal tibial epiphysis than of the distal femoral epiphysis. MRI of the knee is an efficient non-invasive method of age assessment, without the disadvantage of X-ray exposure. Further studies with larger groups are needed to support our results. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
775,"Resource use in intensive care unit: A cost analysis in surgical intensive care medicine. Background: Since 2004 surgical procedures done in German hospitals have been paid for by a flat-rate reimbursement scheme based on diagnosis-related groups (DRGs). The aim of the present detailed cost analysis study was to identify the major factors that determine the costs of intensive care medicine. Method(s): In a patient-based investigation lasting 6 months, 104 patients (mean age 64.6 years) on an interdisciplinary surgical intensive care unit were analyzed over 309 hospital occupancy days. Demographic data, drugs administered, infusions, nutrition, blood and coagulation products, invasive measures and monitoring, artificial respiration parameters, other measures and diagnostic services (laboratory, microbiology, x-ray, etc.), as well as four intensive scores (SAPS II, APACHE II, SOFA, TISS 28) were recorded daily. Result(s): The overall cost of 309 occupancy days (n=104) amounted to 457,564.11 euros, the average cost per day being 1,480.78 euros, and the mean case-specific cost 4,747.48 euros. 49 % of the overall cost was generated by medical staff, with medication and material each accounting for 18 %. Of the personnel costs, 70 % were caused by the nursing staff, 22 % by the medical staff and 8 % by cleaning and other personnel. During the course of hospitalisation, an non-significant increase in the costs generated by personnel was observed. A linear correlation was found between cumulated TISS 28 and the mean case costs. While there was no significant relationship between patient-specific score levels and individual case cost, the correlation between length of stay (LOS) and case cost was highly significant. Conclusion(s): The determining factor in the cost calculation of intensive care medicine are personnel costs. Overall cost is determined largely by the LOS, with such additional factors as age, diagnosis, comorbidity, etc. playing only an insignificant role. © Anasth Intensivmed 2010.",Excluded
2122,"Low-Dose Coronary CT Angiography in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation: Comparison of Image Quality and Radiation Exposure with Two Different Approaches. Rationale and Objectives: To evaluate image quality, coronary interpretability and radiation exposure of coronary CT angiography (CCTA)performed in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF)with the latest scanner generation, comparing two different technical approaches. A new scanner that combines a 0.23 mm spatial resolution, a new generation of iterative reconstruction, fast gantry rotation time and the intracycle motion-correction algorithm to improve the temporal resolution was recently introduced in the clinical field. Material(s) and Method(s): We enrolled 105 consecutive patients with chronic AF who performed CCTA with a whole-heart coverage high-definition CT scanner (16-cm z-axis coverage with 256 detector rows, 0.28 s gantry rotation time). Five of them were excluded for impaired renal function. Patients were randomized between a double acquisition protocol (50 patients, group 1)or a single acquisition protocol (50 patients, group 2). The image quality, coronary segment interpretability and effective dose (ED)of CCTA were assessed. Result(s): The mean HR during the scan was 85.6+/-21 bpm in group 1 vs. 83.7+/-23 bpm in Group 2, respectively (p < ns). In group 2, overall image quality was high and comparable with that of group 1 (Likert scale =3.2 +/- 1.4 vs. 3.3 +/- 1.2, p = ns, in group 1 and 2, respectively). Coronary interpretability was high and similar between the two groups (97.5% and 97.1% in group 1 and 2, p = ns, respectively). Mean ED was significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2 (5.3 +/- 1.8 mSv vs. 2.7 +/- 0.7 mSv, p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): The novel whole-heart coverage CT scanner allows to perform CCTA with a single-acquisition protocol with high image quality and low radiation exposure in AF patients.Copyright © 2018 The Association of University Radiologists",Excluded
2857,"Outcomes of a COVID-19 respiratory follow up clinic in a large tertiary referral centre. Introduction Current guidelines for follow up of COVID-19 patients are based on experience with outbreaks with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), with the aim to identify patients likely to develop post infectious fibrosis. The COVID-19 pandemic is on a much larger scale and requires investigation regarding the most effective way to follow up these patients. Methods We set up a pathway to allow us to screen selected discharged patients to identify those who required further investigations. Discharged patients were identified following admission between March and June 2020 using electronic hospital records. Patients who were not suitable to be called were excluded, and a letter was written to their GP explaining this. All other patients were called approximately 6 weeks after discharge. Information was collected including ongoing symptoms, admission radiological changes, and selected questionnaires. Patients with ongoing symptoms were invited back for investigations and face-to-face appointment, and anyone without symptoms but x-ray changes was invited for repeat X-ray at 10 weeks. Results Of the 828 admissions, 281 died, and a further 182 were unsuitable to call. Of those called, 88% (321) answered, and 65 remained symptomatic and were seen in clinic. 154 people required a repeat chest x-ray, 8 subsequently had a CT thorax and clinic review. 56 people did not attend for follow-up x-ray and were discharged. Of the 73 people seen, 59 had interstitial changes based on radiological criteria; 29 of these were resolving inflammation which did not require further follow up as the patients were also clinically improving. 30 patients, 11 with fibrotic changes, required observation or treatment. Four patients received oral prednisolone and 7 had received intravenous methylprednisolone earlier. In the symptomatic group, PEs, pulmonary hypertension, adenocarcinoma in situ and breathing pattern disorders were also diagnosed. Conclusion Less than 10% of patients required treatment with steroids after admission with COVID-19 infection. This is lower than previous estimates following MERS/SARS infection. Interestingly, severe radiology changes did not predict the likelihood of developing fibrosis. The screening telephone clinic was a useful way of identifying those with ongoing symptoms who required further investigation.",Excluded
1486,"Painful radiation thyroiditis after 131I therapy for graves' hyperthyroidism: Clinical features and ultrasonographic findings in five cases. Background: Radiation thyroiditis caused by 131I therapy for Graves' hyperthyroidism is asymptomatic in most patients and is rarely associated with pain or fever. Currently, there are few reports on the ultrasonographic findings of radiation thyroiditis after 131I therapy for Graves' hyperthyroidism. Case Report: We herein report 5 cases with painful radiation thyroiditis (including 2 febrile cases) after 131I therapy for Graves' hyperthyroidism. The cases included 4 women, aged 49, 50, 76, and 81 years, and 1 man, aged 60 years. Anterior neck pain developed 0-10 days after 131I administration (fixed dose of 481 MBq). Each patient visited our clinic 0-4 days after the development of anterior neck pain. The thyroid glands were noticeably enlarged (increasing from 18 g at 131I administration to 35 g after the development of anterior neck pain in 1 patient, and from 20 to 33 g, 21 to 39 g, 21 to 51 g, and 40 to 51 g in the other patients) and tender. The echogenicity of the thyroid parenchyma was increased, and the parenchyma was more heterogeneous. Granular hyperechoic lesions were scattered throughout the thyroid gland in the most severe case. The border between the thyroid gland and the surrounding tissue was blurred, and the surrounding tissue was hyperechoic. Conclusion(s): Painful radiation thyroiditis should be reacknowledged as one of the complications of 131I therapy for Graves' hyperthyroidism. Ultrasonography demonstrated the characteristic changes caused by 131I-induced radiation thyroiditis.Copyright © 2016 European Thyroid Association Published by S. Karger AG, Basel.",Excluded
2174,"Evaluation and treatment results of trimodality therapy for advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Objectives: The prognosis for highly advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains poor, and there is currently no standard treatment. The purpose of this study was to examine the benefits of trimodality therapy [chemoradiation plus surgery, (CRT + S)] by evaluating the surgical outcomes of patients with ESCC in Keiyukai Sapporo Hospital, Japan. We assessed the preoperative and postoperative adverse events, treatment effects of preoperative CRT, metastatic diagnosis of the dissected lymph nodes, and survival. Patients and Methods: Between 2012 and 2018, 148 patients with highly advanced ESCC who underwent preoperative CRT + S were analyzed for diagnosis and staging, preoperative complications, clinical and histopathological effects of CRT in the resected specimens, survival rates, and recurrences. Result(s): The grade 3 and higher complications of preoperative CRT were neutropenia in 3 cases and thrombocytopenia in 1 case. Among the postoperative complications, there were 2 cases (1.4%) of direct surgical death, only tracheobronchial bleeding and liver failure. Using the 11th edition of the classification of esophageal cancer by the Japanese Esophageal Society, 60 patients (40.5%) were classified as grade 3 (negative for cancer cells, pathological complete response). However, 20 of them (33.3%) had metastatic tumor cells in the lymph nodes. The overall 5-year survival rate was 58.5%. Including references to the pathological findings and recurrence patterns, there is no effective diagnostic method for selecting the subsequent approach based on the effectiveness of CRT. Conclusion(s): Planned surgery following CRT was the only solution for achieving better treatment results. CRT + S is a promising treatment with low direct surgical mortality.Copyright © 2020, The Japan Esophageal Society.",Excluded
654,"Serial ultraviolet B exposure and serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D response in young adult American blacks and whites: no racial differences. We tested the hypothesis that repeated whole body suberythemal ultraviolet B (UVB) exposure would result in less increase of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentrations in black compared with white young adults with no significant change or racial differences in serum calciotropic hormones concentrations. Thirteen white and 7 black adults ranging from 22 to 35 years of age were submitted to sequential total body suberythemal doses of UVB (280-315 nm) biweekly for 6 weeks. Initial UVB dose was 5% below the minimal erythemal dose for the most sensitive skin, followed by 10% increase per exposure for 4 weeks. Blood samples were drawn weekly. Baseline 25OHD concentrations were significantly lower in blacks compared to whites, but the increases in serum 25OHD concentrations were similar in both groups; there were no significant differences by sex or age. Serum 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [24,25-(OH)2D] concentrations paralleled the serum 250HD response. Mean serum calcium (total and ionized), magnesium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, vitamin D binding protein, C-terminal parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25-(OH)2D], and osteocalcin concentrations did not differ between blacks and whites at any time. The ratio of the concentration of 1,25-(OH)2D to 25OHD in their serum was initially higher in blacks compared to whites (p less than 0.0001); the ratios decreased to levels similar to whites by the third UVB exposure. We conclude that, in blacks and whites, sequential suberythemal UVB exposure produces similar elevations of serum 25OHD concentrations and unchanged calciotropic hormones concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Excluded
1468,"Postoperative clinical radiosensitivity in patients with Fanconi anemia and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Objective: To describe the complications and adverse effects of postoperative radiotherapy in patients with Fanconi anemia (FA). Design(s): Cohort study. Setting(s): Patients with FA treated at community and tertiary care hospitals throughout the United States. Patient(s): The study included patients with FA whowere enrolled in the International FA Registry (IFAR) and who developed head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and received postoperative radiotherapy. Main Outcome Measure(s): Demographics of patients with FA and adverse effects and dosages of radiotherapy. Result(s): Twelve patients with FA (7 men and 5 women) were identified. They developed cancers at a mean age of 35.5 years (age range, 20-48 years). The sites of primary cancer were the oral cavity (n=8), larynx (n=2), pharynx (n=1), and unknown (n=1). The median radiation dose was 5590 cGy (range, 2500-7020 cGy). The most common adverse effects were mucositis (n=9), dysphagia (n=8), and pancytopenia (n=6). Other complications included esophageal stenosis, laryngeal edema, and wound breakdown. Radiotherapy could not be completed in 5 cases. Overall, 8 patients died, 4 during the course of radiotherapy. The postoperative disease-free survival time ranged from 0 to 55 months. Conclusion(s): Patients with FA have a high rate of complications from radiotherapy. Common adverse effects, particularly mucositis, are especially prevalent and difficult to manage in this population. Pancytopenia is common and may lead to further complications, particularly bleeding and infection. Overall survival is poor. Further study of the response to radiotherapy in patients with FA should be attempted to establish appropriate dosages to balance treating disease while limiting adverse effects. ©2011 American Medical Association.

2471,"Value ofadditional magnetic resonance myocardial perfusion imaging in patients with high calcium score or intermediate stenoses detected by computed tomography coronaryangiography. Objectives: Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and cardiac magnetic resonance myocardial perfusion imaging (CMR-MPI) are established diagnostic tools for non-invasive assessment of coronary artery disease (CAD). While CCTA offers highresolution images of coronary anatomy, CMR-MPI is able to give valuable functional information. Aim of this study was to evaluate the burden of myocardial ischemia in patients with intermediate stenosis assessed by CCTA and in patients, which were not eligible to CTA due to high calciumscore or unfavourable calciumplaque location. Method(s): 102 patients with known CAD (n=15) and suspected CAD (n=87) were included at one centre (CCB). All patients underwent a standardized CCTA protocol and a standardized adenosine stress CMR-MPI study (1.5 T). Intermediate stenoses were defined as>30 and<= 70% luminal narrowing in CCTA. Both, CCTA and CMR-MPI were analysed by highly experienced readers (radiologist and/or cardiologist). Result(s): Mean Agatston coronary artery calcium score (CAC) was 970 +/- 881. In 47 patients (46%) no CTA was performed due to the high CAC or an unfavourable plaque location. In the remaining patients CCTA affirmed at least one intermediate stenosis with unknown relevance regarding myocardial ischemia. CMR-MPI revealed a visual assessed ischemia in 27 (26.5%). In summary 34 patients (33%) were referred to coronary angiography (XA) due to CMR results and clinical decision; +/- patients denied XA. In 21 of the remaining 28 patients significant CAD was diagnosed. In patients with ischemia in CMR, XA confirmed significant CAD (89.5%) in 17 patients, in 2 patients significant CAD was excluded. In both patients no CCTA was done due to high CAC. Of the remaining patients, which underwent XA; only 4 had relevant CAD (36.4%). Overall, the stepwise approach of imaging modalities would help to reduce the costs by around 9% in contrast to an alternative invasive strategy XA with fractional flow reserve (FFR)measurement. Conclusion(s): Our results indicate that CMR-MPRI is a highly valuable tool to evaluate patients at risk for myocardial ischemia with unclear CCTA results and can avoid radiation exposure and reduce cost efforts.",Excluded
1854,"Patterns of nodal involvement for clinically N0 salivary gland carcinoma: Refining the role of elective neck irradiation. Background. The purpose of this study was to analyze the pattern of occult cervical lymph node metastasis among patients with clinically N0 salivary gland carcinoma. Methods. One hundred nineteen patients underwent primary surgery and ipsilateral neck dissection for clinically N0 carcinomas of the major and minor salivary glands. Eighty patients (67%) had parotid tumors. Distribution of T classification was: T1 (18%), T2 (28%), T3 (23%), and T4 (32%). Results. Twenty-five patients (21%) had pathological cervical disease. The incidence was highest among patients with adenocarcinoma (35%) and high-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma (35%). The most common site of cervical lymph node metastasis was level II (71%), followed by level III (15%), and level IB (8%). On multivariate analysis, histological subtype was independently predictive of occult pathological lymph node metastasis (p < .001). Conclusion. The likelihood of occult cervical lymph node metastasis for patients with salivary gland carcinoma is driven predominantly by histological subtype.

56,"Cardiac computed tomography previous to atrial fibrillation ablation - effects of technological improvements and protocol optimization. BACKGROUND: Cardiac computed tomography (CT) can provide a precise tridimentional anatomic map and exclude intra-cardiac thrombus. We aimed to access the impact of CT protocol optimization and technological evolution on the contrast and radiation dose as well as on image quality previous to atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation., METHODS: From a prospective registry of consecutive patients who underwent cardiac CT in a single center, we selected 270 patients in whom the CT was done for evaluation prior to AF ablation and they were distributed in 3 groups: Group1: the first 150 patients included; Group2: the last 60 patients performed with the same CT scanner; Group3: the first 60 exams performed with the new CT scanner. Quality of the protocol was access based on radiation dose, contrast volume used, the use of a second (delayed) acquisition, and on quantitative image quality analisis (signal to noise and contrast to noise ratios; density homogeneity racio between LA and LAA)., RESULTS: We found a significant radiation dose as well as contrast dose reduction between the first and last subgroups (G1: 5,6mSv and 100ml; G2: 1,3mSv and 90ml; G3: 0,6mSv and 65ml). Even though group 3 had less radiation and contrast used it still had better quantitative image quality (signal/noise of 13,5; contrast/noise 14,8; density homogeneity racio of 0,92)., CONCLUSION: Protocol optimization and technology both contributed to significant lower radiation dose and contrast volume used on cardiac CTs prior to AF ablation, without compromising image quality.

581,"T1/T2 matching to differentiate tumor growth from radiation effects after stereotactic radiosurgery. Objective: We define magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical criteria that differentiate radiation effect (RE) from tumor progression after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Method(s): We correlated postoperative imaging and histopathological data in 68 patients who underwent delayed resection of a brain metastasis after SRS. Surgical resection was required in these patients because of clinical and imaging evidence of lesion progression 0.3 to 27.7 months after SRS. At the time of SRS, the median target volume was 7.1 mL (range, 0.5-26 mL), which increased to 14 mL (range, 1.3-81 mL) at the time of surgery. After initial SRS, routine contrast-enhanced MRI was used to assess tumor response and to detect potential adverse radiation effects. We retrospectively correlated these serial MRIs with the postoperative histopathology to determine if any routine MRI features might differentiate tumor progression from RE. Result(s): The median time from SRS to surgical resection was 6.9 months (range, 0.3-27.7 months). A shorter interval from SRS to resection was associated with a higher rate of tumor recurrence (P = .014). A correspondence between the contrast-enhanced volume on T1-weighted images and the low signal-defined lesion margin on T2-weighted images (""T1/T2 match"") was associated with tumor progression at histopathology (P < .0001). Lack of a clear and defined lesion margin on T2-weighted images compared to the margin of contrast uptake on T1-weighted images (""T1/T2 mismatch"") was significantly associated with a higher rate of RE in pathological specimens (P < .0001). The sensitivity of the T1/T2 mismatch in identifying RE was 83.3%, and the specificity was 91.1%. Conclusion(s): We found that time to progression and T1/T2 mismatch were able to differentiate tumor progression from RE in most patients. When REs are suspected, surgery may not be necessary if patients respond to conservative measures. When tumor progression is suspected, resection or repeat radiosurgery can be effective, depending on the degree of mass effect. © 2010 by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.",Excluded
716,"The acute side effects of bright light therapy: a placebo-controlled investigation. Despite the emergence of numerous clinical and non-clinical applications of bright light therapy (LT) in recent decades, the prevalence and severity of LT side effects have not yet been fully explicated. A few adverse LT effects-headache, eye strain, irritability, and nausea-have been consistently reported among depressed individuals and other psychiatric cohorts, but there exists little published evidence regarding LT side effects in non-clinical populations, who often undergo LT treatment of considerably briefer duration. Accordingly, in the present study we examined, in a randomized sample of healthy young adults, the acute side effects of exposure to a single 30-minute session of bright white light (10,000 lux) versus dim red light (< 500 lux). Across a broad range of potential side effects, repeated-measures analyses of variance revealed no significant group-by-time (Pre, Post) interactions. In other words, bright light exposure was not associated with a significantly higher incidence of any reported side effect than was the placebo control condition. Nevertheless, small but statistically significant increases in both eye strain and blurred vision were observed among both the LT and control groups. Overall, these results suggest that the relatively common occurrence of adverse side effects observed in the extant LT literature may not fully extend to non-clinical populations, especially for healthy young adults undergoing LT for a brief duration.",Excluded
2095,"Quantitative impact of small angle forward scatter on whole blood oximetry using a Beer-Lambert absorbance model. It is well known that red blood cell scattering has an impact on whole blood oximetry as well as in vivo retinal oxygen saturation measurements. The goal of this study was to quantify the impact of small angle forward scatter on whole blood oximetry for scattering angles found in retinal oximetry light paths. Transmittance spectra of whole blood were measured in two different experimental setups: one that included small angle scatter in the transmitted signal and one that measured the transmitted signal only, at absorbance path lengths of 25, 50, 100, 250 and 500 microm. Oxygen saturation was determined by multiple linear regression in the 520-600 nm wavelength range and compared between path lengths and experimental setups. Mean calculated oxygen saturation differences between setups were greater than 10% at every absorbance path length. The deviations to the Beer-Lambert absorbance model had different spectral dependences between experimental setups, with the highest deviations found in the 520-540 nm range when scatter was added to the transmitted signal. These results are consistent with other models of forward scatter that predict different spectral dependences of the red blood cell scattering cross-section and haemoglobin extinction coefficients in this wavelength range.",Excluded
3355,"Oncogenic N-Ras Mitigates Oxidative Stress-Induced Apoptosis of Hematopoietic Stem Cells. Leukemic relapse is believed to be driven by transformed hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) that harbor oncogenic mutations or have lost tumor suppressor function. Recent comprehensive sequencing studies have shown that mutations predicted to activate Ras signaling are highly prevalent in hematologic malignancies and, notably, in refractory and relapsed cases. To better understand what drives this clinical phenomenon, we expressed oncogenic NrasG12D within the hematopoietic system in mice and interrogated its effects on HSC survival. N-RasG12D conferred a survival benefit to HSCs and progenitors following metabolic and genotoxic stress. This effect was limited to HSCs and early progenitors and was independent of autophagy and cell proliferation. N-RasG12D-mediated HSC survival was not affected by inhibition of canonical Ras effectors such as MEK and PI3K. However, inhibition of the noncanonical Ras effector pathway protein kinase C (PKC) ameliorated the protective effects of N-RasG12D. Mechanistically, N-RasG12D lowered levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which correlated with reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP levels. Inhibition of PKC restored the levels of ROS to that of control HSCs and abrogated the protective effects granted by N-RasG12D. Thus, N-RasG12D activation within HSCs promotes cell survival through the mitigation of ROS, and targeting this mechanism may represent a viable strategy to induce apoptosis during malignant transformation of HSCs. SIGNIFICANCE: Targeting oncogenic N-Ras-mediated reduction of ROS in hematopoietic stem cells through inhibition of the noncanonical Ras effector PKC may serve as a novel strategy for treatment of leukemia and other Ras-mutated cancers.

2029,"Individual consistency in exploratory behaviour and mating tactics in male guppies. While behavioural plasticity is considered an adaptation to fluctuating social and environmental conditions, many animals also display a high level of individual consistency in their behaviour over time or across contexts (generally termed 'personality'). However, studies of animal personalities that include sexual behaviour, or functionally distinct but correlated traits, are relatively scarce. In this study, we tested for individual behavioural consistency in courtship and exploratory behaviour in male guppies (Poecilia reticulata) in two light environments (high vs. low light intensity). Based on previous work on guppies, we predicted that males would modify their behaviour from sneak mating tactics to courtship displays under low light conditions, but also that the rank orders of courtship effort would remain unchanged (i.e. highly sexually active individuals would display relatively high levels of courtship under both light regimes). We also tested for correlations between courtship and exploratory behaviour, predicting that males that had high display rates would also be more likely to approach a novel object. Although males showed significant consistency in their exploratory and mating behaviour over time (1 week), we found no evidence that these traits constituted a behavioural syndrome. Furthermore, in contrast to previous work, we found no overall effect of the light environment on any of the behaviours measured, although males responded to the treatment on an individual-level basis, as reflected by a significant individual-by-environment interaction. The future challenge is to investigate how individual consistency across different environmental contexts relates to male reproductive success. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
568,"Cone-beam computed tomography-hepatic arteriography as a diagnostic tool for small hypervascular hepatocellular carcinomas: Method and clinical implications. Objective: This study proposes a novel reference standard for hypervascular hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), established by cone-beam computed tomography-hepatic arteriography (CBCT-HA) and two-year imaging follow-up, and discusses its clinical implication on tumor staging and understanding the intrahepatic distant recurrence (IDR) in relation to dynamic computed tomography (CT). Material(s) and Method(s): In this retrospective study, 99 patients were enrolled, who underwent CBCT-HA during initial chemoembolization for HCC suspected on CT. All patients underwent chemoembolization and regular clinical and imaging follow-up for two years. If IDR appeared on follow-up imaging, initial CBCT-HA images were reviewed to determine if a hypervascular focus pre-existed at the site of recurrence. Pre-existing hypervascular foci on CBCT-HA were regarded as HCCs in initial presentation. Initial HCCs were classified into three groups according to their mode of detection (Group I, detected on CT and CBCT-HA; Group II, additionally detected on CBCT-HA; Group III, confirmed by interval growth). We assessed the influence of CBCT-HA and two-year follow-up on initial tumor stage and calculated the proportion of IDR that pre-existed in initial CBCT-HA. Result(s): A total of 405 nodules were confirmed as HCCs, and 297 nodules initially pre-existed. Of the initial 297 HCCs, 149 (50.2%) lesions were in Group I, 74 (24.9%) lesions were in Group II, and the remaining 74 (24.9%) lesions were in Group III. After applying CBCT-HA findings, 11 patients upstaged in T stage, and 4 patients had a change in Milan criteria. Our reference standard for HCC indicated that 120 of 148 (81.1%) one-year IDR and 148 of 256 (57.8%) two-year IDR existed on initial CBCT-HA. Conclusion(s): The proposed method enabled the confirmation of many sub-centimeter-sized, faintly vascularized HCC nodules that pre-existed initially but clinically manifested as IDR. Our reference standard for HCC helped in understanding the nature of IDR and the early development of HCC as well as the clinical impact of tumor staging and treatment decision.Copyright © 2020 The Korean Society of Radiology.",Excluded
1333,"Super-enhancers modulate interleukin-6 expression and function in cancers. Background: It is widely accepted that inflammatory cytokine, interleukin 6 (IL-6), was not only elevated in cancer but also important in carcinogenesis. But how did IL-6 be produced in tumor microenvironment remains to be addressed. Method(s): Both bioinformatics tools and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to examine the expression of IL-6 in cancer cells. To map super-enhancers of IL-6, sgRNAs were constructed. Stable knockout cells were established and subsequently used for cell proliferation and colony formation assay. The correlation between mapped super-enhancers and IL-6 expression was studied by ATAC-seq analysis. Result(s): The expression of IL-6 was high in multiple cancers, including pancreatic cancer (PAAD). The elevated expression of IL-6 in PAAD was further confirmed by transcriptional data and in a panel of pancreatic cancer cell lines (one immortal HPDE6-C7 cell line and four PDAC cell lines: BxPC-3, PANC-1, AsPC-1 and CFPAC-1). When treated with JQ-1 and I-BET-762, two inhibitors of super-enhancers, the expression of IL-6 in multiple cancer cells including CFPAC-1, HeLa and SUM-159 cells was significantly reduced. By analyzing the H3K27Ac profiling, BRD4 binding, Med1 binding and DNA conservation in CFPAC-1, HeLa and SUM-159 cells, we identified a potential super-enhancer (IL6-SE) that might be important for IL-6 expression in cancer. The super-enhancer (IL6-SE) can be further divided into two elements (IL6-SEa and IL6-SEb). Genetic deletion of IL6-SEa in cancer cells greatly reduces the expression of IL-6. IL6-SEa deficient cells also showed low proliferation and colony formation ability. In patients, the epigenetic activation (ATAC signal) of IL6-SEa is correlated with the expression of IL-6. Conclusion(s): In summary, we not only provide convincing experimental evidence to demonstrate that IL-6 expression in cancer is dependent on super-enhancers but also identified IL6-SEa as a critical DNA regulatory element. Our findings provide new insights to understand the epigenetic regulation of IL-6 expression in cancers.Copyright © Translational Cancer Research. All rights reserved.",Excluded

1495,"Tumour size in cancer of the cervix. In a randomized trial comprising 204 patients with operable cervical carcinomas stages I and II, two low-dose rates in gynaecological brachytherapy were compared. Treatment consisted of Cs-137 uterovaginal application followed by surgery (either immediate or delayed). The results for the two dose rates have been published previously. The present paper concerns the correlation between outcome and tumour size. Tumour size was carefully estimated in two ways: by clinical examination under general anaesthesia and by measurements on the customized vaginal mould used for the brachytherapy. Ninety-one patients (45%) were classified as stage I, and 113 were classified as stage II proximal. The mean tumour size was 39 mm (range 15-64 mm). Cox's multivariate analysis indicated that the factors with a poor prognostic value were for survival: node involvement (N +) (p < 0.001), large tumour size (T +) (p < 0.001) and involvement of the endocervix (E +) (p <0.01); for event-free survival: N + (p <0.001), T + (p < 0.001); for local control; N + (p = 0.0001); for metastasis and regional relapse: N + (p < 0.001) and T + (p < 0.001). Stage was not a prognostic factor over the present range in either univariate or multivariate analysis. In this series tumour size is a powerful independent prognostic factor. It is therefore suggested that for the classification of cervical cancer and the indications for surgical staging and adjuvant treatment, tumour size should be taken into account.",Excluded
271,"Infrastructure of radiotherapy in the Netherlands: Evaluation of prognoses and introduction of a new model for determining the needs. Background and purpose: In the Netherlands, the radiotherapy infrastructure is regulated by a Governmental license system. This requires timely and realistic prognostication of the needs for radiotherapy. In the present study, the latest prognoses (1993) and the realized changes in infrastructure are evaluated and a new prognosis for the period until 2010, which has been calculated using a new model, is presented. Material(s) and Method(s): Data on cancer incidence and use of radiotherapy were obtained from various published national reports and from a survey of all radiotherapy departments. Result(s): The cancer incidence over the period 1993-1997 was about 10% higher than predicted. In 1996 and 1997, the percentage of new cancer patients treated with radiotherapy was 45.6 and 48.2%, respectively. The absolute number of newly irradiated patients was about 10% higher than foreseen in the prognosis. The needs for radiotherapy infrastructure not only depend on epidemiological data and changes in indications for radiotherapy, but also on changes in types of treatment with different workloads. A new model, which uses four categories for teletherapy and four categories for brachytherapy is described and a new prognosis for the required number of linear accelerators and staff up to the year 2010 is presented. Conclusion(s): The original prognosis on cancer incidence and radiotherapy patients underestimated the actual figures considerably. The new prognosis, based on a model, which not only accounts for an increase in number of patients, but also for changes in treatment techniques, is expected to more accurately predict and acquire the required radiotherapy capacity. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

1546,"Antitumor, hematostimulative and radioprotective action of water-soluble derivative of propolis (WSDP). Several studies suggest that dietary supplementation with antioxidant can influence the response to chemotherapy as well as the development of adverse side effects caused by treatment with chemotherapeutic agents. Using CBA mouse model, we investigated a clinically potential use of a water-soluble derivative of propolis (WSDP) in the treatment of various cytopenias induced by radiation and/or chemotherapy. Also, the antimetastatic efficiency of WSDP given intraperitoneally alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents and their effects on the blood leukocytes count as well as on hematopoiesis were studied. Tumor was a transplantable mammary carcinoma (MCa) of CBA mouse. Metastases in the lung were generated by injecting viable tumor cells intravenously (iv). WSDP (50 or 150 mg/kg) exerted a significant antimetastatic effect (P < 0.001) when given either before or after tumor cell inoculation. In combined treatment WSDP and Epirubicin profoundly inhibited metastasis formation; this synergistic effect is maximal when Epirubicin and WSDP were administrated after tumor cell inoculation. Positive outcome of combined treatment with WSDP and Epirubicin was also found regarding the number of red and white blood cells in peripheral blood while in mice treated with Epirubicin alone the significant drop in all hematological parameters was noticed on day 13 after tumor cell inoculation. Furthermore, when WSDP (50 mg/kg) was given perorally (po) for 20 consecutive days an increased number of exogenous CFUs was found in treated mice. WSDP given either for 20 or 40 days increased cellularity of hematopoietic tissue and the number of leucocytes in peripheral blood; prolonged treatment with WSDP also elevated myeloid and megakaryocytic types of CFUs. To conclude, these findings indicate that the combination of WSDP with chemotherapeutics could increase the antimetastatic potential of chemotherapeutic agents; these findings suggest the benefits of potential clinical trials using WSDP combined with chemotherapeutic agents in order to maximize their antitumor activity and minimize postchemotherapeutic or radiotherapeutic deteriorated reactions.",Excluded
1494,"Dosimetric analysis and clinical outcomes in CT-based mould brachytherapy in early oral cancers in patients unfit for surgery. Purpose: Brachytherapy in the oral cavity is an important alternative to conventional treatment, and provides a high localized dose and short overall treatment time. A rapid fall of dose beyond radioactive source makes it possible for increased tumour control and sparing surrounding tissue, while short overall treatment duration reduces risk of tumour repopulation. Moulds are fabricated to hold the catheters in position as closely as possible to tumour surface to provide adequate dose coverage of tumour volume and increase distance to other normal surrounding structures. Image based planning and dose optimisation help in better defining target volume and dose coverage. Material(s) and Method(s): A retrospective analysis of patients of early squamous cell carcinomas of lip and buccal mucosa from September 2011 to June 2014 to study response to mould brachytherapy. Double plane moulds were prepared for all lip cancer cases and single plane for buccal mucosa cases. Patients are being followed up till disease recurrence. In this study evaluation was done of the technique used, planning details, response to therapy, and reactions encountered. Result(s): Nine patients treated by mould therapy were reviewed; seven cases were of lip and two of buccal mucosal cancers. Dose delivered ranged from 12.5-48 Gy in fraction sizes of 2.5-3.5 Gy. Equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions (EQD2) ranged from 18-64 Gy. Maximum dose to organs at risk (OAR) was 91% of prescribed dose. Local mucositis was only reaction in all cases, which resolved in 3-6 weeks. Median follow-up was 19 months. Eight out of nine patients are in remission at a minimum of 7 months (1 case, rest over 14 months) post therapy and only one patient had nodal recurrence at 18 months. Conclusion(s): Mould therapy is an effective treatment method for selected early and superficial squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity, although indications are limited.Copyright © 2015, Termedia Publishing House Ltd.

1851,"Transverse depth-dependent changes in corneal collagen lamellar orientation and distribution. It is thought that corneal surface topography may be stabilized by the angular orientation of out-of plane lamellae that insert into the anterior limiting membrane. In this study, micro-focus X-ray scattering data were used to obtain quantitative information about lamellar inclination (with respect to the corneal surface) and the X-ray scatter intensity throughout the depth of the cornea from the centre to the temporal limbus. The average collagen inclination remained predominantly parallel to the tissue surface at all depths. However, in the central cornea, the spread of inclination angles was greatest in the anterior-most stroma (reflecting the increased lamellar interweaving in this region), and decreased with tissue depth; in the peripheral cornea inclination angles showed less variation throughout the tissue thickness. Inclination angles in the deeper stroma were generally higher in the peripheral cornea, suggesting the presence of more interweaving in the posterior stroma away from the central cornea. An increase in collagen X-ray scatter was identified in a region extending from the sclera anteriorly until about 2 mm from the corneal centre. This could arise from the presence of larger diameter fibrils, probably of scleral origin, which are known to exist in this region. Incorporation of this quantitative information into finite-element models will further improve the accuracy with which they can predict the biomechanical response of the cornea to pathology and refractive procedures.",Excluded
879,"Radiographic joint damage and mortality in rheumatoid arthritis patients: 20 years survival study. Background Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with increased mortality and reduced life expectancy compared with the general population. This mortality gap has increased in the last years since mortality rates for RA have remained constant throughout time while mortality rates for the general population have decline. Excess mortality has been associated with disease activity. Radiographic joint destruction reflects the cumulative burden of inflammation and it is conceived as an objective measure of RA severity. Objectives The objective of our study is to analyze the influence of radiological joint damage in the mortality rate in a cohort of RA patients. Methods We included 783 RA patients in a retrospective longitudinal study, from May 1993 to November 2013, attending the rheumatology outpatient clinic of the Hospital Clinico San Carlos (Madrid, Spain). Subjects were included at the moment of their first X-ray, until October 2012, and followed until patients' death, loss of follow up or November 2013. Clinical records were examined and demographic and clinical data was collected. Radiographic joint damage of hands and wrists was assessed with the Sharp vand-der-Heijde score [total (SHS), erosion (ES) and narrowing/(sub)luxation (NSLS) components]. Survival techniques were applied to estimate the mortality rate (MR; expressed per 1000 patients-years with a 95% of Confidence Interval [95% CI]). Cox bivariate and multivariate regression models were conducted to examine risk factors for death. Interaction terms between radiological damage and rheumatoid factor (RF) positivity, and the elapsed time from RA onset to X-ray, were introduce in the models. Proportional hazard assumption was tested using Schoenfeld residuals and the scaled Schoenfeld residuals. Results were expressed as hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI. Results Most of the patients included were women (74%), with a median age of 61 years old (interquartile range [IQR]: 47-71), 67% were RF positive, and the median (IQR) elapsed time between RA symptoms onset and the X-ray was 2 (0-7) years. The median (range) followed up time per patient was 5 [0.4-20] years. 92 patients died during a follow up time of 4758 person-years. Mortality rate was 19 per 1000 patient-year [95% CI 16-24]. We observed in the bivariate analysis that older age, male sex, higher elapsed time from RA onset to X-ray, SHS, ES, NSLS, number of hospital admissions (used as a surrogate measure of comorbidity), basal Health Assessment Questionnaire, RF positivity, earlier RA onset (in calendar time), and no treatment with biological therapy, were associated with a higher MR. 3 multivariate models were constructed, using SHS, ES or NSLS as measures for joint destruction, and adjusted by the previous variables. In none of the models radiographic damage was associated with MR. However, we observed that the interaction between ES and RF positivity and with elapsed time from RA onset to X-ray were both significant (p=0.001, p=0.03, respectively): the lower elapsed time, the greater the effect of ES in the MR. On the other hand, ES was associated to MR only in RF negative patients. Conclusions Erosive joint damage seems to be a risk factor for all cause mortality among RF negative RA patients. Early radiographic damage seems to better predict mortality.",Excluded

1409,"18F-sodium fluoride pet bone scans. Background Information: 18 F-fluoride is a bone seeking positron emitting tracer with high sensitivity and specificity for detection of osseous lesions, and in particular osteolytic lesions. It is characterized by rapid localization and clearance from the circulation with twice the skeletal uptake and better target to background ratio as compared with the conventional 99m Tc-MDP (methyl diphosphonate) bone scan agent. Additionally, 18 F-flouride PET/CT scans provide higher spatial resolution, shorter imaging time, and slightly less radiation. Furthermore, attenuation correction using CT provides better characterization of morphology and therefore increased accuracy. An analysis of 11 cases of 18 F-fluoride PET bone scans performed between June 2009 and July 2010 demonstrated accurate characterization and localization of osseous lesions as well as nonosseous metastatic lesions. The study population consisted of seven male and four female patients between the ages of 48-68 years with primary cancers of the prostate, kidney, colon, breast, bladder, lung, and the adrenal gland. The administered dose ranged from 7.7-13.6 mCi. Eight out of eleven scans were positive for metastatic disease and three were negative. All findings were correlated with CT. Early detection of bone metastases is significant in therapy planning and monitoring. Accurate demonstration of osseous metastases helps improve patient care and patient outcome. We believe 18 F-fluoride PET/CT can provide more thorough and conclusive evaluation of bone disease than the conventional 99m Tc-MDP. Educational Goals/Teaching Points: Overview of physiology, dosimetry, and clinical advantages of 18 F-NaF bone imaging compared with conventional Tc-MDP bone imaging. Key Anatomic/Physiologic Issues and Imaging Findings/Techniques: Role of 18 F-NaF PET imaging in detection of malignant and benign osseous disease.

2348,"Tolerance and dose-volume relationship of intrathoracic stomach irradiation after esophagectomy for patients with thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Purpose: To identify the tolerance of radiation with a high prescribed dose and predictors for the development of intrathoracic stomach toxicity in patients with thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) after esophagectomy followed by gastric conduit reconstruction. Methods and Materials: From 2011 to 2013, 105 patients after esophagectomy were treated with postoperative radiotherapy. The intrathoracic stomach was outlined with the calculation of a dose-volume histogram (DVH) for the initial intended treatment of 6020 cGy or 6300 cGy. The volume of the intrathoracic stomach receiving each dose was recorded at 10-Gy intervals between 10 and 40 Gy and at 5-Gy intervals between 40 and 60 Gy. The grade of toxicities was defined by the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 4.0. Result(s): The mean and maximum doses of the intrathoracic stomach were 2449 +/- 986 cGy and 6519 +/- 406 cGy, respectively. Sixteen (15.2%) and three (2.9%) experienced Common Toxicity Criteria Grade 2 and Grade 3 acute gastric toxicity. There were no Grade 4 toxicities. Fourteen patients (13.3%) exhibited late gastric complications possibly related to radiation. The volume percent of the intrathoracic stomach receiving at least 50 Gy (V50) was strongly associated with the degree of toxicity (p = 0.024, respectively). Multivariate analysis of patient and treatmentrelated factors revealed no other significant predictors of severe toxicities. Conclusion(s): The intrathoracic stomach is well tolerated with a high-dose irradiation for patients with esophageal SCC receiving radiotherapy after esophagectomy. A strong dose-volume relationship exists for the development of Grade 2 acute intrathoracic stomach toxicity in our study.",Excluded
2591,"Subacute haematotoxicity after PRRT with (177)Lu-DOTA-octreotate: prognostic factors, incidence and course. PURPOSE: In peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT), the bone marrow (BM) is one of the dose-limiting organs. The accepted dose limit for BM is 2 Gy, adopted from (131)I treatment. We investigated the incidence and duration of haematological toxicity and its risk factors in patients treated with PRRT with (177)Lu-DOTA(0)-Tyr(3)-octreotate ((177)Lu-DOTATATE). Also, absorbed BM dose estimates were evaluated and compared with the accepted 2 Gy dose limit., METHODS: The incidence and duration of grade 3 or 4 haematological toxicity (according to CTCAE v3.0) and risk factors were analysed. Mean BM dose per unit (gigabecquerels) of administered radioactivity was calculated and the correlations between doses to the BM and haematological risk factors were determined., RESULTS: Haematological toxicity (grade 3/4) occurred in 34 (11 %) of 320 patients. In 15 of the 34 patients, this lasted more than 6 months or blood transfusions were required. Risk factors significantly associated with haematological toxicity were: poor renal function, white blood cell (WBC) count <4.0 x 10(9)/l, age over 70 years, extensive tumour mass and high tumour uptake on the OctreoScan. Previous chemotherapy was not associated. The mean BM dose per administered activity in 23 evaluable patients was 67 +/- 7 mGy/GBq, resulting in a mean BM dose of 2 Gy in patients who received four cycles of 7.4 GBq (177)Lu-DOTATATE. Significant correlations between (cumulative) BM dose and platelet and WBC counts were found in a selected group of patients., CONCLUSION: The incidence of subacute haematological toxicity after PRRT with (177)Lu-DOTATATE is acceptable (11 %). Patients with impaired renal function, low WBC count, extensive tumour mass, high tumour uptake on the OctreoScan and/or advanced age are more likely to develop grade 3/4 haematological toxicity. The BM dose limit of 2 Gy, adopted from (131)I, seems not to be valid for PRRT with (177)Lu-DOTATATE.",Excluded
1968,"The Impact of Hypoxia on Out-of-Field Cell Survival after Exposure to Modulated Radiation Fields. Advanced radiotherapy techniques such as intensity modulated radiation therapy achieve highly conformal dose distributions within target tumor volumes through the sequential delivery of multiple spatially and temporally modulated radiation fields and have been shown to influence radiobiological response. The goals of this study were to determine the effect of hypoxia on the cell survival responses of different cell models (H460, DU145, A549, MDA231 and FADU) to modulated fields and to characterize the time dependency of signaling under oxic conditions, following reoxygenation and after prolonged hypoxia. Hypoxia was induced by incubating cells at 95% nitrogen and 5% carbon dioxide for 4 h prior to irradiation. The out-of-field response in MDA231 cells was oxygen dependent and therefore selected for co-culture studies to determine the signaling kinetics at different time intervals after irradiation under oxic and hypoxic conditions. Under both oxic and hypoxic conditions, significant increases in cell survival were observed in-field with significant decreases in survival observed out-of-field (P < 0.05), which were dependent on intercellular communication. The in-field response of MDA231 cells showed no significant time dependency up to 24 h postirradiation, while out-of-field survival decreased significantly during the first 6 h postirradiation (P < 0.05). While in-field responses were oxygen dependent, out-of-field effects were observed to be independent of oxygen, with similar or greater cell killing under hypoxic conditions. This study provides further understanding of intercellular signaling under hypoxic conditions and highlights the need for further refinement of established radiobiological models for future applications in advanced radiotherapies.",Excluded

PURPOSE: In the most advanced, non-resectable primary rectal cancers, conventional long-course radiotherapy (RT) (1.8-2Gyx25-28), frequently combined with chemotherapy, has been used since tumour regression is needed in order to allow a radical (R0) resection. In Uppsala, short-course 5x5Gy with planned delayed surgery has been used in patients with contraindications to long-course RT (+/-chemotherapy). The aim is to describe our experience of using this approach in patients not eligible for standard treatment., PATIENTS AND METHODS: During 2002 and 2005, 46 patients with non-resectable rectal cancer (+/-synchronous distant metastases) were treated with 5x5Gy and delayed surgery if possible. The clinical records were retrospectively evaluated. The first group (A) had no metastases (T4NXM0), whereas the other two groups (B+C) had metastases (T4NXM1). In group (B), the patients had predominantly loco-regional disease and were not candidates for combination chemotherapy (high age, co-morbidities), and in group (C) up-front combination chemotherapy was given, with the intention to have surgery of both the primary and the secondaries if sufficient regression at both sites were seen., RESULTS: The patients in the first two groups (A+B) were old (median 79 and 76 years, respectively), and had several co-morbidities. In group (C), median age was 63 years. The 5x5Gy RT was well tolerated by most patients, but grade IV diarrhoea was recorded in three elderly patients. One patient in the group (C) died from neutropenic fever. Many patients were reported to have less local symptoms after the treatment given. Delayed surgery was performed in all but nine patients. Radical surgery (R0+R1) was performed in 22 (92%) (group A), 4 (44%) (group B), and 6 (46%) (group C) patients, respectively. A pCR was seen in four patients (two in group A and two in group C). No postoperative deaths occurred., CONCLUSIONS: Considering the very high age and presence of co-morbidity, the 5x5Gy schedule is well tolerated. Further, considering the very advanced local stage, the schedule has considerable anti-tumour activity and can result in radical surgery in a high proportion of patients.",Excluded

Background: Re-irradiation is a reasonable second treatment option for patients with recurrent malignant glioma (MG) after previous radio(chemo)therapy. However, only limited data is available allowing for a precise selection of patients suitable for re-treatment in regard to safety and efficacy. Method(s): Using the department database, 58 patients with two courses of percutaneous radiation were identified. Besides classical dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters equivalent uniform dose (EUD) values were calculated for the tumor and organs at risk (OARs), retrospectively analyzed and correlated to survival outcome parameters. Cumulative EUD values were also calculated in all cases where previous OAR DVHs were available. Result(s): Median follow-up was 265 days and no relevant toxicity was observed after re-irradiation in our patient cohort during follow-up. Time interval between first and second irradiation was regularly above 6 months. As a conservative estimation of the cumulative EUD to the OARs, the EUDs of first and second irradiation were added. Median cumulative EUD to the optic chiasm was 48.8 Gy (range, 2.5-76.5 Gy), 57.4 Gy (range, 2.7-75.3 Gy) to the brainstem, 20.9/22.1 Gy (range, 0.0-68.3 Gy) to the right/left optic nerve and 73.8 Gy (range, 64.9-77.3 Gy) to the brain. No correlation between treated volume and survival was seen. Conclusion(s): This study provides retrospective estimates on cumulative doses at the OARs. EUD values are derived and may serve as reference for further studies, including planning studies where specific constraints are needed. © 2013 Niyazi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded

A total of 4995 sequential patients undergoing CCTA for suspected coronary artery disease were enrolled; 4862 patients (97.3%) had complete radiation data for analysis., INTERVENTION: A best-practice CCTA scan model was used, which included minimized scan range, heart rate reduction, electrocardiographic-gated tube current modulation, and reduced tube voltage in suitable patients., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes included dose-length product and effective radiation dose from all phases of the CCTA scan. Secondary outcomes were image quality assessed by a 4-point scale (1 indicated excellent; 2, good; 3, adequate; and 4, nondiagnostic) and frequency of diagnostic-quality scans., RESULTS: Compared with the control period, patients' estimated median radiation dose in the follow-up period was reduced by 53.3% (dose-length product decreased from 1493 mGy x cm [interquartile range {IQR}, 855-1823 mGy x cm] to 697 mGy x cm [IQR, 407-1163 mGy x cm]; P < .001) and effective dose from 21 mSv (IQR, 12-26 mSv) to 10 mSv (IQR, 6-16 mSv) (P < .001). The greatest reduction in dose occurred at low-volume sites. There were no significant changes in median image quality assessment during the control period compared with the follow-up period (median image quality of 2 [images rated as good] vs median image quality of 2; P = .13) or frequency of diagnostic-quality scans (554/620 patients [89%] vs 769/835 patients [92%]; P = .07)., CONCLUSION: Consistent application of currently available dose-reduction techniques was associated with a marked reduction in estimated radiation doses in a statewide CCTA registry, without impairment of image quality., TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00640068.",Excluded

Subjects were tested in-flight, as well as on ground in normal gravity in both the upright and supine orientations to provide baseline measurements. The subjects wore a goggle device and were in total darkness. They used knobs to rotate two luminous lines until they were parallel to the subjective direction of their longitudinal body axis, in the roll (right/left) and the pitch (forward/backward) planes. Results showed that the error between the perceived and the objective direction of the longitudinal body axis was significantly larger in microgravity than in normal gravity. This error in this egocentric frame of reference is presumably due to the absence of somatosensory cues when free-floating. Mechanical pressure on the chest using an airbag reduced the error in perception of the longitudinal body axis in microgravity, thus improving spatial orientation.",Excluded
1245,"Role of aortic calcification, stiffness and wave reflections in cardiovascular risk in dialysis patients: Baseline data from the CORD study. Background: Accurate cardiovascular risk estimation in dialysis patients remains challenging because different pathogenetic mechanisms act simultaneously in this heterogeneous population. Radiographic calcification, aortic stiffness and wave reflection, have each individually been proven to be reliable surrogate markers for outcome. We aimed to explore to what extent these parameters intermutually provide complementary or overlapping information. Method(s): Abdominal aortic calcification scoring of a plain lateral abdominal X-ray, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), and central augmentation index (AIx) were measured in 1084 dialysis patients, recruited from 47 European dialysis centers. Result(s): Abdominal calcification correlated well with PWV (R = 0.44, P < 0.001) but poorly with AIx (R = 0.07, P = 0.04). Next to abdominal calcification, tertiles of PWV were associated with a stepwise increase age, blood pressure, and cardiovascular history, and tertiles of AIx with age, heart rate, and anthropometric factors. In multivariate analysis, only PWV remained significantly associated with calcification score. In addition to age and blood pressure, stiffness was mainly related to diabetes and calcification score (R2 = 0.39, P < 0.001), whereas AIx was more dependent on anthropometry, gender and heart rate (R2 = 0.36, P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Information on aortic calcification and arterial abnormalities can be obtained by simple and inexpensive methodologies. Variation in wave reflections was mainly explained by anthropometric parameters. Stiffness and calcification partly provided complementary information, particularly in low-risk patients. In this group, likely to benefit most from preventive strategies and commonly considered for renal transplantation, evaluation of cardiovascular risk could be made more accurate by the assessment of both aortic calcification and arterial stiffness. © 2010 Association for Research into Arterial Structure and Physiology.",Excluded
352,"Current attitudes of Turkish anesthesiologists to radiation exposure. Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the attitudes of anesthesiologists to radiation exposure and current safety practice in Turkey. Method(s): The study enrolled anesthesiologists from all over Turkey, including all levels of academic degrees and all types of different institutions. Questionnaire forms were sent via e-mail to 505 anesthesiologists. The survey collected demographic data such as age, gender, position, and the institution at which the participant worked, and data about the frequency of radiation exposure during procedures and the participant's attitudes concerning radiation safety measures during these procedures. Result(s): The questionnaire forms were delivered to 491 anesthesiologists, and 301 (61.3 %) of these were returned. Of these, 9 had not completed the questionnaire because of a lack of exposure to radiation. Among the remaining 292 personnel, the weekly frequencies of radiation exposure were more than five times (36.7 %), one to five times (50.3 %), and less than once (13 %) per week, respectively. Only a few anesthesiologists regularly wore a lead apron (30.11 %) and a thyroid shield (11.3 %) during procedures involving radiation exposure. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrated that nearly all anesthesiologists are regularly exposed to radiation and that few anesthesiologists in Turkey wear protective clothing, which is essential for radiation protection. Therefore, if it is not, increasing awareness about radiation protection should be an integral part of medical training and education. © 2013 Japanese Society of Anesthesiologists.",Excluded
3103,"High thyroid radiation dose associated with 131-I-19-iodocholesterol adrenal scanning. We have examined two patients undergoing 131I-19-iodocholesterol adrenal scans in order to assess thyroidal radiation dose. Thyroid uptakes of 3--5% of the administered 2 mCi dose were found despite prior administration of Lugol's iodine. Analysis of serum samples over a ten day period after iodocholesterol injection indicated that less than 10% of the radioactivity was free iodide. Kinetic results showed a high value for the thyroid/plasma 131I ratio indicating thyroid retention of 131I. This was substantiated by thyroid scintigrams. The thyroid radiation dose was estimated to be 200--250 rad for the two patients. The associated carcinogenic risk is of sufficient magnitude, in our opinion, to warrant regular follow-up of all patients who have undergone 131I-19-iodocholesterol adrenal scanning.",Excluded

396,"Low-dose multidetector-row CT-angiography of abdominal aortic aneurysm after endovascular repair. PURPOSE: To investigate the possibility of reducing radiation dose exposure while maintaining image quality using multidetector computed tomography angiography (MDCTA) with high-concentration contrast media in patients undergoing follow-up after endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) to treat abdominal aortic aneurysm., MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective, single center, intra-individual study, patients underwent two consecutive MDCTA scans 6 months apart, one with a standard acquisition protocol (130 mAs/120 kV) and 120 mL of iomeprol 300, and one using a low dose protocol (100 mAs/80 kV) and 90 mL of iomeprol 400. Images acquired during the arterial phase of contrast enhancement were evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively for image noise and intraluminal contrast enhancement., RESULTS: Thirty adult patients were prospectively enrolled. Statistically significantly higher attenuation values were measured in the low-dose acquisition protocol compared to the standard protocol, from the suprarenal abdominal aorta to the common femoral artery (p<0.0001; all vascular segments). Qualitatively, image quality was judged significantly (p=0.0002) better with the standard protocol than with the low-dose protocol. However, no significant differences were found between the two protocols in terms of contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) (13.63+/-6.97 vs. 11.48+/-8.13; p=0.1058). An overall dose reduction of up to 74% was observed for the low-dose protocol compared with the standard protocol., CONCLUSION: In repeat follow-up examinations of patients undergoing EVAR for abdominal aortic aneurysm, a low-dose radiation exposure acquisition protocol provides substantially reduced radiation exposure while maintaining a constant CNR and good image quality.

2763,"MR-Angiography in assessing the anatomy of the renal arteries before renal sympathetic denervation. The paper presents comparative analysis of preoperation MR-angiography and X-ray angiography carried out before renal denervation of sympathetic plexus of renal arteries in patients with resistant arterial hypertension. Purpose. To compare the data of MRA and diagnostic X-ray angiography of the renal arteries to determine a method that allows you to plan in detail the renal denervation procedure. Materials and methods. 44 patients (16 men, 28 women; average age was 59.18 years) with a verified diagnosis: resistant hypertension, admitted to treatment (renal denervation). All patients underwent standard preoperative laboratory and instrumental diagnostics. Survey aortography with selective renal angiography and MR angiography were performed in all 44 (100%) patients. Results and conclusion. It has been shown that both methods are comparable in the detection of renal arteries stenosis, as well as in visualization of the main renal artery and of segment branches of arteries, and in measurement of their diameters. In most cases MR-angiography a little bit exaggerates the diameter of the artery for as low as 0.6-0.8 mm. Also MR-angiography do not deliver radiation exposure to a patient. Moreover, MRA provides the opportunity of sequential thin-slice imaging, and may separate branches of the renal arteries up to segment branches of 3-4 classes with high accuracy. In total, the MRA predicts the anatomic imaging with invasive catheter X-ray angiography and allows to plan it in details before renal sympathetic denervation.Copyright © 2019 Russian Electronic Journal of Radiology.

3331,"Atypical fibroxanthoma in a young female misdiagnosed clinically as a malignant melanoma- An unusual presentation. Atypical fibroxanthoma (AFX) is an uncommon spindle cell tumor with intermediate or borderline malignant potential. Clinically, it may be misdiagnosed as a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) or malignant melanoma. Solar irradiation has been implicated in its pathogenesis. The diagnosis of AFX rests on a combination of histopathological features and a negative immunohistochemical profile. AFX is a rare tumor usually found in sun exposed skin of head and neck region in elderly Caucasian men. Rarely, it has a second peak in young adults, where it is found in trunk and extremities. The present case is reported as AFX is quite unusual in a young female with a nodule in the leg which was clinically diagnosed as a malignant melanoma. Only a few cases of AFX have been reported in young women. This case highlights the fact that accurate diagnosis of atypical fibroxanthoma is very crucial so as to avoid overenthusiastic and overzealous treatment as required for a malignant tumor.Copyright © 2015 Journal of Cancer Research and Therapeutics Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",Excluded

910,"Image quality and radiation dose of dual-energy CT of the head and neck compared with a standard 120-kVp acquisition. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: DECT offers additional image datasets with potential benefits, but its use for H&N imaging is not justified unless image quality is preserved without increased radiation dose. The aim of this work was to compare image quality and radiation dose between a DE-derived WA image dataset and a standard SECT acquisition of the H&N. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two patients underwent DECT of the H&N (tube voltages 80 and Sn140 kVp) and were compared with the last 32 patients who underwent standard SECT (120 kVp) on the same dual-source scanner. WA images from the 2 DE tubes were compared with images obtained with an SE mode. Radiation doses and attenuation measurements of the internal jugular vein, submandibular gland, and sternomastoid and tongue muscles were compared. Objective image noise was compared at 5 anatomic levels. Two blinded readers compared subjective image quality by using 5-point grading scales. RESULT(S): CTDIvol was 12% lower with DE than with SECT, a difference of 1.5 mGy, (P < .0001). Objective noise was not significantly different between DE and SECT at any of the anatomic levels (P > .05). No significant differences in attenuation measurements were observed between DE and SECT (P > .05). No significant differences in subjective image quality scores were observed between DE and SECT at any of the 5 anatomic levels (P > .05). CONCLUSION(S): DE-derived WA images of the H&N are equivalent to standard SE acquisitions and thus can be used for routine diagnostic purposes.

Stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT) of brain metastases is used with good effect around the world, but no consensus exists regarding which prognostic factors that are related to favourable or unfavourable prognosis after the treatment. A better definition of these factors will ensure a more precise application of the treatment. Material and methods. A consecutive cohort of the 198 patients treated for brain metastases with SRT without concurrent whole-brain radiation therapy at our department from 2001 to 2012 was retrospectively analysed. Results. Median survival was seven months and median time to clinical cerebral progression was eight months. The multivariate analysis revealed age >= 65 years, Performance Status >= 2, extracranial metastases and size of metastasis > 20 mm as independent prognostic factors related to shorter survival. No factors were independently related to clinical cerebral progression. Conclusion. We identified four prognostic factors related to survival after SRT for brain metastases. The grouping of patients by these factors is useful to determine the level of treatment. We discourage the delivery of SRT to patients with 3-4 unfavourable prognostic factors because of the very short median survival of two months.Copyright © 2015 Informa Healthcare.",Excluded

The aim of the current paper was to review the clinical presentation of actinic cheilitis and demonstrate the development of management plans using a series of cases. These are designed to provide immediate treatment where required but also to address the medium and long-term requirements of the patient. The authors suggest that the clinical examination of lips and the assessment of actinic cheilitis and other lip pathology become a regular part of the routine soft tissue examination undertaken as a part of the periodic examination of dental patients. Early recognition of actinic cheilitis can allow the development of strategies for individual patients that prevent progression. These are based on past sun exposure, future lifestyle changes and the daily use of emollient sunscreens, broad-brimmed hats and avoidance of sun exposure during the middle of the day. This is a service that is not undertaken as a matter of routine in general medical practice as patients are not seen with the regularity of dental patients and generally not under the ideal examination conditions available in the dental surgery.",Excluded

Aims: In recent years, the optimum primary management of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) has evolved from combined modality chemoradiotherapy to chemotherapy alone. We describe a single-centre case series of PCNSL with a view to assessing the role of radiotherapy in primary disease management. Material(s) and Method(s): West of Scotland PCNSL cases between 2001 and 2010 were identified by neuropathology. Observational data were collected retrospectively from case notes and electronic systems. Result(s): Forty-nine patients fulfilled the eligibility criteria. The median age was 61 years. Chemotherapy with a view to consolidation radiotherapy on completion was delivered to 61% (. n=30). Regimens varied, but were generally methotrexate-based. Chemotherapy was discontinued prematurely in 80% (. n=24) due to progressive disease (. n=12), intolerable toxicity (. n=7) or death (. n=4). In all patients who progressed or did not tolerate chemotherapy, treatment was changed to immediate salvage radiotherapy; modal irradiation was 40Gy. Radiotherapy alone was delivered to those not suitable for chemotherapy (18%, n=9) and best supportive care to those with poor performance status (18%, n=9). The overall median survival was 8 months. In those receiving single modality radiotherapy or chemotherapy, the median survival was 5 and 8 months, respectively. For those completing chemoradiotherapy in its entirety, 3 year survival was 100%; in groups receiving salvage radiotherapy despite progressive disease or chemotherapy toxicity, moderate survival was maintained with immediate radiotherapy with 3 year survival rates of 33 and 60%, respectively. Conclusion(s): Although chemotherapy alone remains the optimal treatment of PCNSL, out with clinical trials only a minority of patients complete chemotherapy due to toxicity and disease progression; in such patients, immediate salvage radiotherapy provides an effective and safe alternative with maintenance of good outcomes. © 2013 The Royal College of Radiologists.",Excluded
1620,"Increased occurrence of exfoliation in the male, Spanish American population of New Mexico. Exfoliation syndrome was found to occur much more frequently in the male Spanish American population of New Mexico. This was based on a Veterans Administration Medical Center study in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The prevalence of exfoliation in the Spanish Americans was estimated to be from 3-6 percent and this is consistent with many other such studies performed in the United States and other countries. The Spanish American population is 5.8 times more likely to develop exfoliation than the non-Spanish American population of New Mexico. Exfoliation was found on such eye structures as the lens, iris, ciliary processes, posterior capsule, vitreous face, posterior corneal surface, and arterial chamber angle. Glaucoma capsulare was also studied and it was found that there was not a significant difference between the Spanish American and the non-Spanish American population for developing the condition. However, there was a strong association of glaucoma with the presence of exfoliation in both groups. Based on our results, patients with exfoliation are 22 times more likely to develop glaucoma than are their age-matched controls. Also, 40 percent of the exfoliation patients had glaucoma compared with only 5 percent of the age-matched controls (p less than .001). The patients with glaucoma capsulare were found to have a more medically resistant type of glaucoma, which was consistent with other reports of this condition. There are two theories we propose for the existence of exfoliation in the Spanish American population of New Mexico. The first is a geographic climatic theory that relates exfoliation to greater solar radiation levels due to a high overall altitude and sunny weather in New Mexico.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Excluded

Background: Although hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is used to treat chronic radiation tissue injury, clinical evidence supporting its use in maxillary bone osteoradionecrosis (ORN) is lacking. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to report our results of collected patient outcomes from a single center's large experience using HBOT to treat maxillary bone ORN. Method(s): From 1999 to 2015, 21 patients received treatment for maxillary bone ORN at our center.

3668,"An examination of radon awareness, risk communication, and radon risk reduction in a Hispanic community. Purpose: Radiation risk communication is a critical component of radiation protection and the public's understanding of radiation risks and benefits. Risk communication becomes even more complicated when considering cultural and language differences. In the US, many diverse communities face risk communication challenges. We obtained radon testing data to evaluate patterns of radon testing in Allentown, the third largest city in Pennsylvania. Radon exposure is the second leading cause of lung cancer after smoking and is associated with over 21,000 lung cancer deaths in the US annually. It is estimated that 1 in every 15 homes in the US has elevated radon levels above the recommended action level set by the US Environmental Protection Agency. Allentown has some of the highest reported levels of indoor radon in the country, yet only a small portion of the population has tested their homes. This is true particularly among self-identified Hispanics, who make up nearly half of the city's population. This study seeks to (1) characterize the difference in testing rates between self-identified Hispanics and non-Hispanics in Allentown, (2) quantify the level of radon awareness and knowledge, (3) identify potential obstacles to radon testing among the Allentown population that self-identifies as Hispanic, and (4) determine whether more effective risk communication is needed. Method(s): Radon test results in Allentown were analyzed to better understand the nature of radon testing. To evaluate radon awareness and knowledge, a cross-sectional study was conducted using a face-to-face survey. This data was informative in assessing testing and mitigation practices, ethnicity, income level, age, education level, homeowner status, zip code and primary language. Result(s): Ethnicity was an independent predictor of radon awareness and knowledge. Statistically significant differences were found between the number of self-identified Hispanics (39%) and non-Hispanics (84%) who indicated that they had ever heard of radon; 13% of Hispanics and 49% of non-Hispanics knew that they lived in an area with typically high radon levels. There was a statistically significant association between self-reported ethnicity and radon testing with non-Hispanics (43%) more likely to test their homes for radon than Hispanics (32%). Conclusion(s): Individual and community understanding of the risks of exposure to radiation sources such as radon is dependent upon communication that informs and spurs appropriate action. This study demonstrates the need for culturally appropriate radon risk communication strategies targeted to a Hispanic population. Successful communication will raise awareness and knowledge that can lead to better public health protection.© 2020, Copyright © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group LLC.",Excluded
465,"Serum cystatin C and risk of hip and nonvertebral fractures in older men. Serum cystatin C is a biomarker of renal function; higher levels indicate poorer function. Previous studies have reported an increased risk of hip fracture among postmenopausal women with higher cystatin C, but there is a paucity of data in men and it is uncertain whether the association persists after adjustment for BMD. To test the hypothesis that older community-dwelling men with higher cystatin C are at increased risk of fracture, we conducted a case-cohort analysis in MrOS, a prospective study of 5994 men aged 65 years and older. We measured serum cystatin C in baseline serum specimens from all 435 men who experienced any non-vertebral fracture from baseline until February 2007 (average follow-up 4.7 years), all 168 men with first hip fracture from baseline until August 2010 (average follow-up 7.6 years), and a sample of 1602 men randomly selected from the cohort. Cystatin C was measured using a particle-enhanced immunonepholometric assay (inter- and intra-assay CV 3.1% and 2.8%, respectively). Fractures were confirmed with x-ray reports. Modified proportional hazards models were used to estimate the relative hazards (RH) of fracture in men across quartiles of cystatin C (cutpoints 0.80, 0.90, 1.03 mg/L). In a model adjusted for age, race, site and body mass index, higher cystatin C was not related to risk of nonvertebral fracture (p-trend 0.88), but was associated with an increased risk of hip fracture (RH (95% CI): 1.0 [Q1, referent group]; 0.9 (0.5-1.7) [Q2]; 1.1 (0.6-1.9) [Q3]; and 1.6 (0.9-2.8) [Q4]; p-trend 0.04). The majority of the effect of cystatin C on hip fracture was observed among men in Q4 who had a 1.6-fold (95% CI 1.1-2.3) increase in risk compared with men in Q1-3 (Table). Adding potential confounders (including fall history, prior fracture, prevalent cardiovascular disease, frailty status and total hip BMD) one at a time to the base model modestly attenuated the association, with frailty status having the greatest impact. After simultaneous adjustment for multiple confounders, the association no longer reached significance (RH (95% CI) Q4 versus Q1-3: 1.3 (0.9-1.9)). In conclusion, older men with higher serum cystatin C are at increased risk of hip (but not any nonvertebral) fracture. The association between cystatin C and hip fracture is due at least in part to the greater prevalence of frailty among men with higher cystatin C levels.",Excluded
939,"Randomized Phase II Study of Preoperative Chemoradiotherapy +/- Panitumumab Followed by Consolidation Chemotherapy in Potentially Operable Locally Advanced (Stage IIIa, N2+) Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: NRG Oncology RTOG 0839. Introduction Multimodality therapy has curative potential in locally advanced NSCLC. Mediastinal nodal sterilization (MNS) after induction chemoradiotherapy (CRT) can serve as an intermediate marker for efficacy. NRG Oncology Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 0229 demonstrated the feasibility and efficacy of combining full-dose radiation (61.2 Gy) with chemotherapy followed by resection and chemotherapy. On the basis of that experience and evidence that EGFR antibodies are radiosensitizing, we explored adding panitumumab to CRT followed by resection and consolidation chemotherapy in locally advanced NSCLC with a primary end point of MNS. Methods Patients with resectable locally advanced NSCLC were eligible if deemed suitable for trimodality therapy before treatment. Surgeons were required to demonstrate expertise after CRT and adhere to specific management guidelines. Concurrent CRT consisted of weekly carboplatin (area under the curve = 2.0), paclitaxel (50 mg/m2), and 60 Gy of radiation therapy delivered in 30 fractions. There was a 2:1 randomization in favor of panitumumab at 2.5 mg/kg weekly for 6 weeks. The mediastinum was pathologically reassessed before or at the time of resection. Consolidation chemotherapy was weekly carboplatin (area under the curve = 6) and paclitaxel, 200 mg/m2 every 21 days for two courses. The study was designed to detect an improvement in MNS from 52% to 72%. With use of a 0.15 one-sided type 1 error and 80% power, 97 patients were needed. Results The study was opened in November 2010 and closed in August 2015 by the Data Monitoring Committee after 71 patients had been accrued for futility and excessive toxicity in the experimental arm. A total of 60 patients were eligible: 19 patients (86%) who received CRT and 29 (76%) who received CRT plus panitumumab and underwent an operation. With regard to postoperative toxicity, there were three grade 4 adverse events (13.6%) and no grade 5 adverse events (0%) among those who received CRT versus six grade 4 (15.8%) and four grade 5 adverse events (10.5%) among those who received CRT plus panitumumab. The MNS rates were 68.2% (95% confidence interval: 45.1-86.1) and 50.0% (95% confidence interval: 33.4-66.6) for CRT and CRT plus panitumumab, respectively (p = 0.95). Conclusion The addition of panitumumab to CRT did not improve MNS. There was an unexpectedly high mortality rate in the panitumumab arm, although the relationship to panitumumab is unclear. The control arm had outcomes similar to those in NRG Oncology RTOG 0229.Copyright © 2017 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer",Excluded

This study deals with 4971 implants (Branemark system) installed in 1315 patients, either fully or partially edentulous, and followed from implant installation up to the last control. A predominance of female patients (61%) and a nearly equal number of upper and lower jaws characterised the study group. Patients were scheduled each 6-12 months for recall. The observation time varied from 0.5 to 15 years (mean 5.1). The whole cohort was split up into compromised (n = 59) and non-compromised (n = 1256) patients. The former are defined as grafted (autologous bone) and patients irradiated in the head and neck area. In the compromised patients 24 out of 59 patients (40.6%) showed failures, in whom 59 out of 310 (19%) implants failed. In the non-compromised patients, implant failures were observed in 11.6% of the patients, which corresponds to 5.9% of the installed implants, excluding iatrogenic failures. Failures were further divided chronologically into early (up to 1 year after abutment connection) and late failures. There were early implant failures in 12.5% of the compromised patients and in 3.4% of the others. Late implant failures occurred in 7.4 and 2% of the two patients groups, respectively. While gender did not affect the failure rate, implant lengths, corresponding to the available bone height did, since a 21.5% failure rate for the 7-mm implants contrasts with 4.1 and 3.8% for 13- and 15-mm implants, respectively. Early as well as annual late failures are more frequently found in the maxilla. Implant fractures only occurred in the fixed (both partial and full) prosthesis group but never surpassed the 0.2% annual level. Marginal bone loss, exceeding the third screw thread occurred in 1.8% of the implants at the last control. It appears that this type of implant configuration offers a high long-term predictability. Failures occur before, at or during the first year after abutment connection and in very short implants. Marginal bone as a whole is very stable over the years.",Excluded
1243,"Optimum fractionation in X ray treatment of C3H mouse mammary tumours. The doses required to control 50% of tumors at 150 days after irradiation were determined for eight fractionated X ray schedules. The tumors were first generation transplants from spontaneous mammary tumors in C3H/He mice. The schedules were: single doses, 5, 9 or 15 fractions given daily excluding weekends, and 2, 3, 5 or 9 fractions at the two day interval known to be optimal for reoxygenation in these tumors after a priming dose of 1,500 rads. For comparison, skin reactions on the feet of albino mice were determined, using the same fractionation schedules, in order to plot the tumor control probability (TCP) against skin reactions for corresponding schedules. Two optimum schedules were found which gave maximum local control of tumors for the lowest skin reaction: nine fractions in ten days (9F/10d) and 5F/9d. The treatments given in shorter overall times were fairly good if the two day intervals were used but were poor for 'daily' doses. Both schedules employing overall times of 18 days gave poor results. The results are discussed in relation to the time course of reoxygenation and cell proliferation. A substantial difference in TCD 50 was found between male and female mice, the females being easier to cure. (16 references.)",Excluded

Sagittal and coronary Cobb angles, pelvic parameters and sagittal profile were evaluated using a web-based analysis tool. Operation duration, complications, and blood loss were compared. Postoperatively, the clinical outcome was determined using standardized questionnaires (SRS22, EQ 5D) after 3, 12 and 24 months. Result(s): Thoracic structural kyphosis (UEV-LEV) was preoperatively measured with 75.11degree with a correction to 48.54degree (p<0.001). The Stagnara angles had an extent of 68.87degree with a correction to 38.68degree (p<0.001). Compensatory lumbar lordosis (LL) showed a correction from 68.24degree to 46.70degree (p<0.001). Using the highly negative pelvic incidence (PI) - LL mismatch (PI-LL pre-OP - 23.6 to PI-LL post-OP -1.3; p<0.001) we demonstrated significant compensatory hyperlordosis pre-OP with good spontaneous correction post-OP. The number of fused segments (11.2) correlated significantly with the degree of kyphosis (p<0.005) and kyphosis correction (p<0.001). The pelvic parameters (PI, pelvic tilt, sacral slope) were physiologically preoperatively and without changes in the follow-up X-rays. The most frequently uppermost and lowest instrumented vertebra was T2 (33 patients, 45.2%) and L3 (29 patients, 39.7%), respectively. Number of fused segments correlated significantly with surgery duration (mean 263.73 min, p=0.012) and blood loss (mean 750.56 ml, p=0.016). The initial degree of kyphosis showed significant correlation with the SRS mental health subscore(p=0.043). The degree of kyphosis had no influence on the other subscores and on the total SRS 22. Furthermore, the clinical outcome showed a gradual and significant improvement of SRS 22 and EQ 5D after 3 and 12 months. Postoperatively we recorded the following complications: neurological complication without neurological deficit (3.2%), implant-associated complication (6.3%) and wound healing issues (3.2%). Discussion(s): Using PSF we corrected the thoracic hyperkyphosis of M. Scheuermann from 75degree to 48degree and the lumbar hyperlordosis from 68degree to 47degree. We could achieve an almost physiological reconstruction of the sagittal alignment. The first clinical followup results were convincing with a significant improvement of SRS 22 and the EQ 5D already after 3 months. Complication rates were moderate (14.2%) and the risk of proximal junctional kyphosis with sufficiently long instrumentation after PSF alone is rare with 1.6% of cases.",Excluded
2276,"Role for the mammalian Swi5-Sfr1 complex in DNA strand break repair through homologous recombination. In fission yeast, the Swi5-Sfr1 complex plays an important role in homologous recombination (HR), a pathway crucial for the maintenance of genomic integrity. Here we identify and characterize mammalian Swi5 and Sfr1 homologues. Mouse Swi5 and Sfr1 are nuclear proteins that form a complex in vivo and in vitro. Swi5 interacts in vitro with Rad51, the DNA strand-exchange protein which functions during HR. By generating Swi5(-/-) and Sfr1(-/-) embryonic stem cell lines, we found that both proteins are mutually interdependent for their stability. Importantly, the Swi5-Sfr1 complex plays a role in HR when Rad51 function is perturbed in vivo by expression of a BRC peptide from BRCA2. Swi5(-/-) and Sfr1(-/-) cells are selectively sensitive to agents that cause DNA strand breaks, in particular ionizing radiation, camptothecin, and the Parp inhibitor olaparib. Consistent with a role in HR, sister chromatid exchange induced by Parp inhibition is attenuated in Swi5(-/-) and Sfr1(-/-) cells, and chromosome aberrations are increased. Thus, Swi5-Sfr1 is a newly identified complex required for genomic integrity in mammalian cells with a specific role in the repair of DNA strand breaks.",Excluded
2745,"Dose escalation of gemcitabine concomitant with radiation and cisplatin for nonsmall cell lung cancer: A phase 1-2 study. BACKGROUND: The current study was conducted to evaluate the maximum tolerable dose of weekly gemcitabine administered simultaneously with radiation and cisplatin in patients with locally advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHOD(S): Patients with stage IIIA/B NSCLC received concurrently 63 grays radiation and 20 mg/m2 cisplatin Day 1 to 3 in Weeks 1 and 5, plus weekly gemcitabine at escalating doses (150-700 mg/m2) on Fridays after radiation to avoid radiosensitization. The authors assessed dose-limiting toxicities according to Common Toxicity Criteria. The primary endpoint was maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of gemcitabine. Tumor resectability, survival, and disease-free survival (DFS) were also determined. RESULT(S): Forty-two patients were accrued, of whom 95% received radiation and 66% cisplatin as above. Weekly doses of gemcitabine were escalated to 700 mg/m 2. Grade 3 dysphagia and 1 case of fatal, probably treatment-related pulmonary deterioration established the MTD of gemcitabine at 550 mg/m2 weekly. Twenty-five patients underwent surgery, and histopathological complete regression was documented in 26% of these patients. Overall, median actuarial survival and DFS were 23.8 and 12.4 months, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): Gemcitabine at doses up to 550 mg/m2 weekly can be given simultaneously with radiation and cisplatin to patients with locally advanced NSCLC. Radical resection thereafter is feasible. The impact of this aggressive therapy should be evaluated further. © 2010 American Cancer Society.",Excluded

INTRODUCTION: The optimal patient positioning for percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) based on the complexity of stone burden is not yet defined. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the intraoperative parameters, effectiveness and complications of patients undergoing PCNL between the endoscopic-guided prone split-leg PCNL (ePSL) and the supine PCNL by stratifying patients according to Guy's stone score (GSS)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted of patients undergoing PCNL at two high-volume tertiary referral centers. At one center, patients underwent PCNL using the ePSL technique, while at the second center, patients underwent PCNL in supine. Patient demographics and stone characteristics, operative details, complications and effectiveness were compared between groups. The impact of obesity was also investigated., RESULTS: Of 830 subjects, a total of 449 (54%) underwent PCNL in ePSL and 381 (46%) in supine. The ePSL group had a greater mean age and body mass index. No statistical differences were found in gender, serum chemistry and Charlson comorbidity index. After stratifying patients by GSS, the differences in baseline stone burden between PSL and supine lost significance and both groups could be compared. Complications were not statistically different between both groups. Univariate analysis demonstrated that multiple tracts and lower pole access were more prevalent in supine. In addition, for GSS1-3, ePSL was correlated with reduced operative time, radiation exposure, length of hospital stay and need for secondary procedure. Multivariate analysis correlated ePSL with lower radiation exposure and need for secondary procedures (p = 0.01). In comparison to the whole trial population, the same tendencies were appreciated for obese cohort., CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report focusing on the performance differences between ePSL and supine PCNL stratified by GSS. Both techniques are safe, with a low rate of complications. For GSS1-3, ePSL reduces radiation exposure and requires less need for both multiple access and secondary procedure.",Excluded
184,"A Comparative Evaluation of 3 Different Free-Form Deformable Image Registration and Contour Propagation Methods for Head and Neck MRI: The Case of Parotid Changes During Radiotherapy. Purpose: To validate and compare the deformable image registration and parotid contour propagation process for head and neck magnetic resonance imaging in patients treated with radiotherapy using 3 different approaches-the commercial MIM, the open-source Elastix software, and an optimized version of it. Material(s) and Method(s): Twelve patients with head and neck cancer previously treated with radiotherapy were considered. Deformable image registration and parotid contour propagation were evaluated by considering the magnetic resonance images acquired before and after the end of the treatment. Deformable image registration, based on free-form deformation method, and contour propagation available on MIM were compared to Elastix. Two different contour propagation approaches were implemented for Elastix software, a conventional one (DIR_Trx) and an optimized homemade version, based on mesh deformation (DIR_Mesh). The accuracy of these 3 approaches was estimated by comparing propagated to manual contours in terms of average symmetric distance, maximum symmetric distance, Dice similarity coefficient, sensitivity, and inclusiveness. Result(s): A good agreement was generally found between the manual contours and the propagated ones, without differences among the 3 methods; in few critical cases with complex deformations, DIR_Mesh proved to be more accurate, having the lowest values of average symmetric distance and maximum symmetric distance and the highest value of Dice similarity coefficient, although nonsignificant. The average propagation errors with respect to the reference contours are lower than the voxel diagonal (2 mm), and Dice similarity coefficient is around 0.8 for all 3 methods. Conclusion(s): The 3 free-form deformation approaches were not significantly different in terms of deformable image registration accuracy and can be safely adopted for the registration and parotid contour propagation during radiotherapy on magnetic resonance imaging. More optimized approaches (as DIR_Mesh) could be preferable for critical deformations.Copyright © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",Excluded

2426,"Three-dimensional surface imaging for detection of intra-fraction setup variations during radiotherapy of pelvic tumors. PURPOSE: Surface-based image guided radiotherapy (IGRT) allows positioning and/or monitoring patients in 3 dimensions (3D), without the use of ionizing radiation. In this study, we report on intra-fraction motion measured by acquisition of multiple images of 3D body surfaces., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine patients treated for pelvic tumors were enrolled. Setup variations (SV) through three consecutive body surfaces acquired by the optical IGRT system Align-RT (Vision-RT, London, UK) were analyzed before, during and at the end of treatment delivery. Displacements along the main axes (X, Y and Z) from initial (I) to mid-treatment (MT) and final (F) acquisitions were recorded. Time and direction of SV were assessed., RESULTS: A total of 6272 images from 792 fractions of 29 patients were available. The main source of misalignment was between I and MT acquisition (p < 0.001). The dominant SV direction was the vertical one (Z axis), with mean SV of -1.20 +/- 0.06 mm and -1.55 +/- 0.06 mm for I-MT and I-F acquisitions, respectively. The Y mean components of SV were, respectively, -0.95 +/- 0.10 mm and -1.0 +/- 0.10 for I-MT and I-F acquisitions, while the X deviations were 0.07 +/- 0.08 mm for I-MT and 0.26 +/- 0.08 mm I-F., CONCLUSION: Three-D surface imaging for patient setup monitoring highlighted remarkable mobility of patients during RT session, especially in the anterior-posterior direction (Z axis). The largest magnitude in patient movements occurred during the first part of delivery. These findings suggest that the initial setup control cannot not to be sufficient to guarantee treatment reproducibility, especially for long-lasting RT treatments.",Excluded
2461,"Reliability and validity of a telephone questionnaire for estimating lifetime personal sun exposure in epidemiologic studies. Our Australia-wide case-control study of ocular melanoma diagnosed in 1996 to 1997 needed a short telephone interview on sun exposure. We constructed one by examining data from 700 controls ages 40 to 64 years in the Geraldton Skin Cancer Survey in 1988; they had answered a ""whole-of-life"" questionnaire in a face-to-face interview. Sun exposure in their first 4 decade years of age best predicted their lifetime annual average sun exposure, so the shortened questionnaire asked about sun exposure in these 4 decade years only. Retesting 60 participants 1 year later with the whole-of-life questionnaire gave an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.65 (95% confidence interval, 0.48-0.78) for ranked total sun exposure between the two interviews; the intraclass correlation coefficient was higher in men (0.73) than in women (0.54). Correlations were also high between parallel measurements of sun exposure on working days in the decade years and in outdoor occupations throughout life in the telephone interview of the ocular melanoma study (Spearman's R = 0.75) and in another study of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (R = 0.71). Agreement between simultaneous parallel measures of total exposure (nonworking + working day and recreational + occupational exposure) was slightly weaker and of nonworking day and recreational exposure much weaker. Occupational exposure in women was much less strongly correlated with total exposure than it was in men possibly because of their frequently combined work and family roles, which the questionnaires did not try to separate. Research is needed into how this might be done to improve sun exposure measurement in women.",Excluded

Diagnostic scans were performed with 111 MBq of (123)I-MIBG. Therapeutic doses of (131)I-MIBG (5.55-7.40 GBq) were administrated and whole-body scans were obtained at 2-5 days after (131)I-MIBG administrations. We compared the number of lesions and the lesion-to-referent count ratios at 6 and 24 h of (123)I-MIBG and at 2-5 days of (131)I-MIBG., RESULTS: In comparison with the 6-h images of (123)I-MIBG, the 24-h images of (123)I-MIBG could detect more lesions in eight patients. Posttreatment (131)I-MIBG scans revealed new lesions in eight patients compared with the 24-h images of (123)I-MIBG. The lesion-to-referent count ratios at 6 and 24 h of (123)I-MIBG and at 3 days of (131)I-MIBG were increasing at later scanning time. There were significant differences in the lesion-to-referent count ratios between 6 and 24 h of (123)I-MIBG (P = 0.031), 6 h of (123)I-MIBG and 3 days of (131)I-MIBG (P = 0.020), and 24 h of (123)I-MIBG and 3 days of (131)I-MIBG (P = 0.018)., CONCLUSION: Low-dose diagnostic (123)I-MIBG whole-body scan is inferior to posttreatment (131)I-MIBG whole-body scan in malignant pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of regional fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (F-FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) in patients with skull base osteomyelitis (SBO) and to compare with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) whenever available., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 77 patients (male:female = 56:21; mean age 66.4 +/- 9.4 years) with clinically suspected SBO, who underwent regional F-FDG PET-CT were included in this retrospective study. F-FDG PET-CT images were analyzed for presence, localization and intensity of FDG uptake. Diagnostic performance of F-FDG PET-CT was analyzed based on histopathology, culture, and clinical/imaging follow-up. The agreement analysis between F-FDG PET-CT and MRI findings was performed in 56 patients., RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of F-FDG PET-CT for diagnosing SBO were 96.7, 93.3, 98.3, 87.5, and 96.1%, respectively. The average SUVmax of the lesions was 5.9 +/- 3.5. The SUVmax of the fungal lesions was lower than that of bacterial lesions with P-value of <0.001. On comparing variables like C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and SUVmax for prediction of recurrence/progression, by plotting an ROC curve, the SUVmax was found to be an independent prognostic marker. 56 out of 77 patients had undergone both F-FDG PET-CT and MRI. The agreement analysis between the modalities showed almost perfect agreement for delineation of soft tissue and bony involvement with kappa values of 0.82 and 0.81, respectively., CONCLUSION: F-FDG PET-CT is a sensitive tool in evaluation of patients with SBO.

Background/Purpose: High titers of rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (ACCP) are poor prognostic factors for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Only few studies have investigated the detailed clinical subtypes or radiographic changes based on serologic status; double (RF/ACCP) positive (+ve), RF or ACCP +ve, double negative (-ve) (seronegative, SN). We aimed to analyze the clinical and radiographic features of RA patients with robust disease activity, based on their serologic status. Method(s): RA patients registered in the Korean College of Rheumatology Biologics Registry (KOBIO), a nationwide inception cohort, were analyzed. Data regarding patient demographics, comorbidity, disease activity, medication, imaging and laboratory exams were utilized. After adjusting for gender, age, disease duration, and smoking history, we analyzed the association of seropositivity and bony erosion (hands and feet X-ray), and the association of the ACCP titer and joint damage, both at baseline (initiation of biologics) presented as odd ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval [95% CI]. Result(s): Data of 1198 RA patients were investigated. Mean age was 57.2 years, and disease duration was 8.3 +/- 7.6 years. Mean DAS28-ESR was 5.71, and erosion were found in 40.1% of patients. Being ACCP+ve was significantly associated with bony erosions (OR 1.69 [95% CI 1.13-2.52], p= 0.0096), compared with RF+ve (OR 1.03 p= 0.83), or RF+ve/ACCP+ve (OR 2.19 [95% CI 1.19-4.01], p= 0.012). Of note, being ACCP+ve/RF-ve was strongly associated with radiographic damage (OR 4.93 [95% CI 2.29-10.61], p< 0.0001) in our analysis (figure). In contrast, a multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that baseline ACCP titers were not positively associated with joint damage; a multivariate linear regression model revealed disease duration (estimate -3.95, p< 0.0001) and RF titer (estimate +0.0665, p= 0.0157) were associated with ACCP titers. Conclusion(s): Our data demonstrate the significance of ACCP in predicting radiographic damage in established Korean RA patients with persistently high disease activity. Longitudinal studies would be needed to clarify the impact of ACCP titers on radiographic progression. (Figure Presented).",Excluded

Thermoluminescence dosimeters were used to directly monitor the dose to 550 measuring points in the phantom. The effective dose and associated risk from transmission scans acquisition were estimated and compared to those associated to the radiopharmaceutical injected. The maximum effective dose from a typical transmission measurements acquisition was 1.3 muSv and 1.9 muSv for male and female patients, respectively. The contribution of the typical transmission scans acquisition to total patient radiation risk from a cardiac SPECT study is less than 10-3. Thus, radiation exposure may not be considered as a limiting factor for the clinical application of attenuation correction methods based on transmission measurements in cardiac SPECT.",Excluded
3505,"Sex-specific differences in fetal germ cell apoptosis induced by ionizing radiation. BACKGROUND: We have previously shown that male human fetal germ cells are highly radiosensitive and that their death depends on p53 activation. Male germ cell apoptosis was initiated with doses as low as 0.1 Gy and was prevented by pifithrin alpha, a p53 inhibitor. In this study, we investigated the radiosensitivity of early female and male fetal proliferating germ cells.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Both male and female fetal germ cells displayed a similar number of gamma H2AX foci in response to ionizing radiation (IR). In organ culture of human fetal ovaries, the germ cells underwent apoptosis only when exposed to high doses of IR (1.5 Gy and above). Accumulation of p53 was detected in irradiated male human fetal germ cells but not in female ones. Inhibition of p53 with pifithrin alpha did not affect oogonia apoptosis following irradiation. IR induced apoptosis similarly in mouse fetal ovaries in organ culture and in vivo during oogonial proliferation. Germ cell survival in testes from p53 knockout or p63 knockout mice exposed to IR was better than wild-type, whereas female germ cell survival was unaffected by p53 or p63 knockout.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that pre-meiotic male and female fetal germ cells behave differently in response to a genotoxic stress--irradiation--with oogonia being less sensitive and undergoing p53-independent apoptosis.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility, image quality, and radiation dose of automatic spectral imaging protocol selection (ASIS) and adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) with reduced contrast agent dose in abdominal multiphase CT., METHODS: One hundred and sixty patients were randomly divided into two scan protocols (n = 80 each; protocol A, 120 kVp/450 mgI/kg, filtered back projection algorithm (FBP); protocol B, spectral CT imaging with ASIS and 40 to 70 keV monochromatic images generated per 300 mgI/kg, ASIR algorithm. Quantitative parameters (image noise and contrast-to-noise ratios [CNRs]) and qualitative visual parameters (image noise, small structures, organ enhancement, and overall image quality) were compared., RESULTS: Monochromatic images at 50 keV and 60 keV provided similar or lower image noise, but higher contrast and overall image quality as compared with 120-kVp images. Despite the higher image noise, 40-keV images showed similar overall image quality compared to 120-kVp images. Radiation dose did not differ between the two protocols, while contrast agent dose in protocol B was reduced by 33 %., CONCLUSION: Application of ASIR and ASIS to monochromatic imaging from 40 to 60 keV allowed contrast agent dose reduction with adequate image quality and without increasing radiation dose compared to 120 kVp with FBP., KEY POINTS: * Automatic spectral imaging protocol selection provides appropriate scan protocols. * Abdominal CT is feasible using spectral imaging and 300 mgI/kg contrast agent. * 50-keV monochromatic images with 50 % ASIR provide optimal image quality.",Excluded

1032,"Reducing intraoperative duration and ionising radiation exposure during the insertion of distal locking screws of intramedullary nails: a small-scale study comparing the current fluoroscopic method against radiation-free, electromagnetic navigation. BACKGROUND: Intramedullary nailing is the standard surgical treatment for mid-diaphyseal fractures of long bones; however, it is also a high radiation dose procedure. Distal locking is regularly cited as a demanding element of the procedure, and there remains a reliance on X-ray fluoroscopy to locate the distal holes. A recently developed electromagnetic navigation (EMN) system allows radiation-free distal locking, with a virtual on-screen image., OBJECTIVE: To compare operative duration, fluoroscopy time and radiation dose when using EMN over fluoroscopy, for the distal locking of intramedullary nails., METHOD: Consecutive patients with mid-diaphyseal fractures of the tibia and femur, treatable with intramedullary nails, were prospectively enrolled during a 9-month period. The sample consisted of 29 individuals, 19 under fluoroscopic guidance and 10 utilising EMN. Participants were allocated depending on the type of intramedullary nail used and surgeon's preference. These were further divided into tibial and femoral subcategories, relative to the fracture site., RESULTS: EMN reduced fluoroscopy time by 49 (p = 0.038) and 28 s during tibial and femoral nailings, respectively. Radiation dose was reduced by 18 cGy/cm2 (p = 0.046) during tibial and 181 cGy/cm2 during femoral nailings when utilising EMN. Operative duration was 11 min slower during tibial nailings using EMN, but 38 min faster in respect of femoral nailings., CONCLUSIONS: This study has evidenced statistically significant reductions in both fluoroscopy time and radiation dose when using EMN for the distal locking of intramedullary nails. It is expected that overall operative duration would also decrease in line with similar studies, with increased usage and a larger sample.",Excluded

2706,"Oral green tea catechin metabolites are incorporated into human skin and protect against UV radiation-induced cutaneous inflammation in association with reduced production of pro-inflammatory eicosanoid 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid. Green tea catechins (GTC) reduce UV radiation (UVR)-induced inflammation in experimental models, but human studies are scarce and their cutaneous bioavailability and mechanism of photoprotection are unknown. We aimed to examine oral GTC cutaneous uptake, ability to protect human skin against erythema induced by a UVR dose range and impact on potent cyclo-oxygenase- and lipoxygenase-produced mediators of UVR inflammation, PGE2 and 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE), respectively. In an open oral intervention study, sixteen healthy human subjects (phototype I/II) were given low-dose GTC (540 mg) with vitamin C (50 mg) daily for 12 weeks. Pre- and post-supplementation, the buttock skin was exposed to UVR and the resultant erythema quantified. Skin blister fluid and biopsies were taken from the unexposed and the UVR-exposed skin 24 h after a pro-inflammatory UVR challenge (three minimal erythema doses). Urine, skin tissue and fluid were analysed for catechin content and skin fluid for PGE2 and 12-HETE by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem MS. A total of fourteen completing subjects were supplement compliant (twelve female, median 42.5 years, range 29-59 years). Benzoic acid levels were increased in skin fluid post-supplementation (P= 0.03), and methylated gallic acid and several intact catechins and hydroxyphenyl-valerolactones were detected in the skin tissue and fluid. AUC analysis for UVR erythema revealed reduced response post-GTC (P= 0.037). Pre-supplementation, PGE2 and 12-HETE were UVR induced (P= 0.003, 0.0001). After GTC, UVR-induced 12-HETE reduced from mean 64 (sd 42) to 41 (sd 32) pg/mul (P= 0.01), while PGE2 was unaltered. Thus, GTC intake results in the incorporation of catechin metabolites into human skin associated with abrogated UVR-induced 12-HETE; this may contribute to protection against sunburn inflammation and potentially longer-term UVR-mediated damage.",Excluded
1046,"Establishing locoregional control of malignant pleural mesothelioma using high-dose radiotherapy and 18F-FDG PET/CT scan correlation. Introduction: The management of malignant pleural mesothelioma represents one of the most challenging issues in oncology, as there is no proven long-term benefit from surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy alone or in combination. Locoregional progression remains the major cause of death, but radical surgical resection may produce major postoperative morbidity. While radical or postoperative radiotherapy using conventional techniques has resulted in severe toxicity with no impact on survival, recent advances in radiotherapy delivery may be more effective. Method(s): We treated patients with locally advanced mesothelioma whose tumours had been sub optimally resected with high-dose three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) or intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) to large volumes of one hemithorax, using CT and positron emission tomography (PET) scan-based treatment planning. Clinical outcomes were assessed by determining patterns of failure and metabolic changes in total glycolytic volume (TGV) between pre- and post-irradiation18F-FDG PET/CT scans and by recording acute and late toxicity grades. Result(s): Fourteen patients were analysed with 40 PET scans performed before and up to 4.5 years after radiotherapy. Eleven patients had pleurectomy/decortications, one had an extrapleural pneumonectomy and two had no surgery. Four patients who received chemotherapy had all progressed prior to radiotherapy. After radiotherapy, the in-field local control rate was 71%. No progression occurred in two patients, one was salvaged with further radiotherapy to a new site, four recurred inside the irradiated volume all with concurrent distant metastases and the other seven had distant metastases only. The TGVs were reduced by an average of 67% (range 12-100%) after doses of 45 to 60 Gy to part or all of one hemithorax. There were no serious treatment-related toxicities. Median survival was 25 months from diagnosis and 17 months after starting radiotherapy. Conclusion(s): We have established that mesothelioma can be locally controlled with high radiation doses using 3DCRT or IMRT, and that strict normal tissue dose constraints have limited radiation toxicities. Radiotherapy should be considered to prevent or delay the local manifestations of progressive disease in suitable patients after surgery including extrapleural pneumonectomy and pleurectomy/decortication. Higher radiation doses may allow more effective palliation. © 2011 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists.",Excluded
1386,"Rehabilitation program in secondary knee osteoarthritis with GENU recurvatum in hemi-paretic patients. Background It is known that the knee is divided into 3 compartments: medial, lateral and femuro-patelar. The medial compartment is more exposed to stress due to the knee biomechanics where the weight of load is in biggest proportion. The hemi-paretic patient supports modified forces in the knee-joint due to the muscle spasticity, fact which determines a redistribution of forces, so that through quadriceps failure and gastrocnemian muscle spasticity it would generate genu recurvatum, with modified biomechanics and redistributed areasof taking weight, making a vicious circle. Objectives We propose to prevent the formation of genu recurvatum at patients who suffered a stroke with hemi-paresis and reduce the changes at those who have already developed these modifications. Methods There were 26 patients selected for this study (14 women and 12 men, all over 45 years old) with a 2-year-old stroke, with secondary developed knee osteoarthritis at hemi-paretic lower limb. The patients were evaluated both through muscular and joint tests as well as knee front and profile X-rays. These patients were divided in 2 study groups. Both groups followed a rehabilitation program - physiotherapy, peripheral magnetic stimulation on the muscle motor points -18 days, when we followed the toning of the failing muscles to correct the knee muscle balance: quadriceps and tibialis anterioris muscles - to counteract the gastrocnemianus muscle spasticity, correcting position of genu recurvatum and ankle orthotic. The patients of the Study Group A followed this program while being hospitalized - 18 days, repeated and adjusted at 3 months. The patients of Study Group B of followed this program for 6 months with adjustedkineticprogram, the magnetic stimulation being applied 10 days/month. The evaluation was also initially made at 6 months with joint testing scale, and VAS pain scale, the 6MWD (6 Minute Walking Distance test), the WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index), and Ashworth spasticity testing scale (from 0 to 5). Results Group A did not obtain any improvement at the joint testing. The pain in the knee was reduced from 70.2 to 51.4 mm on VAS scale. The 6 MWD test made by moving with crutch recorded an average improvement of 15.6 m. The WOMAC scale recorded a score drop from 74.2 to 41.4. The Ashworth scale dropped from 3.5 to 3. Group B presented better results, a reduction of genu recurvatum observed and proved by the improvement with 5 degrees at the joint testing for extension. The VAS scale improved from 71.3 to 34.5. The 6 MWD test proved a growth in the walking capacity with 23.4 m. The WOMAC scale recorded a significant drop from 78.4 to 32.3, and Ashworth scale dropped from 3.6 to 2.7. Conclusions Sustained physical therapy correctly executed with periodical adjustment of the program as well as the repetitive magnetic stimulation peripherally applied on the failing muscle groups prove that the invalidity induced by genu recurvatum at this special category ofpatients is reduced functional as well as by objective assessment through evaluation tests.",Excluded
1038,"Efficacy and safety of 3D-conformal half body irradiation in patients with multiple bone metastases. Half-body irradiation (HBI) represented a standard treatment for multiple painful bone metastases (BMs). However, its use has progressively reduced due to the associated toxicity rates. The aim of this paper was to evaluate HBI delivered by conformal radiotherapy (RT) technique in a large patients population with widespread BMs. HBI was delivered in 3 Gy fractions, bid, >= 6 h apart, on 2 consecutive days (total dose: 12 Gy) using 3-dimensional conformal RT (3D-CRT) box technique. The target included pelvic bones, lumbar-sacral vertebrae and upper third of femurs. Acute and late toxicity was scored based on RTOG and EORTC-RTOG scales, respectively. Pain was evaluated using the Pain-Drug scores and the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). One hundred and eighty patients were eligible for inclusion in this retrospective analysis. Grade 3 and 4 acute toxicity rates were 1.1% and 0.0%, respectively. Mean VAS before and after HBI was 5.3 versus 2.7, respectively (p: 0.0001). Based on VAS, 37.5% of patients showed complete pain relief (VAS: 0) while 38.1% had partial response (>= 2-point VAS reduction). Overall, Pain and Drug Score reduction was observed in 76.3% and 50.4% of patients, respectively. 1-, 2-, and 3-year pain progression free survival was 77.0%, 63.4%, and 52.7%, respectively. Thirty patients (16.7%) underwent RT retreatment on the same site with median 15.9 months interval (range 2-126 months). HBI delivered with 3D-CRT technique is safe and effective. It provides long lasting pain control in patients with multiple BMs with negligible rates of relevant toxicity.Copyright © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.",Excluded
3345,"Radiation exposure and cost influence physician medical image decision making: a randomized controlled trial. BACKGROUND: It is estimated that 20%-40% of advanced medical imaging in the United States is unnecessary, resulting in patient overexposure to radiation and increasing the cost of care. Previous imaging utilization studies have focused on clinical appropriateness. An important contributor to excessive use of advanced imaging may be a physician ""knowledge gap"" regarding the safety and cost of the tests., OBJECTIVES: To determine whether safety and cost information will change physician medical image decision making., RESEARCH DESIGN: Double-blinded, randomized controlled trial. Following standardized case presentation, physicians made an initial imaging choice. This was followed by the presentation of guidelines, radiation exposure and health risk, and cost information., RESULTS: Approximately half (57 of 112, 50.9%) of participants initially selected computed tomography (CT). When presented with guideline recommendations, participants did not modify their initial imaging choice (P=0.197). A significant reduction (56.3%, P<0.001) in CT ordering occurred after presentation of radiation exposure/health risk information; ordering changed to magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasound (US). A significant reduction (48.3%, P<0.001) in CT and magnetic resonance imaging ordering occurred after presentation of Medicare reimbursement information; ordering changed to US. The majority of physicians (31 of 40, 77.5%) selecting US never modified their ordering. No significant relationship between physician demographics and decision making was observed., CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that physician decision making can be influenced by safety and cost information and the order in which information is provided to physicians can affect their decisions.",Excluded
3189,"Involved-field radiation therapy for patients with stage III non-small-cell lung cancer: Early results of hypofractionated involved-field radiation therapy. Objective. To evaluate the outcomes after treating patients with stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using involved-field radiation therapy (IFRT) without elective nodal irradiation and to evaluate the effects of hypofractionated IFRT. Methods. From December 2004 to November 2015, 51 patients with advanced NSCLC underwent IFRT. Of these, 45 patients were enrolled and evaluated. The median age was 69 years (range, 50-89 years), and 42 patients were men and women. Eleven patients (24.4%) presented with adeno-carcinoma, 30 (66.7%) with squamous cell carcinoma, and (8.9%) with other types. Twenty-four (53.3%) had stage IIIA and 21 (46.7%) had stage IIIB. In patients treated by conventional IFRT, normal fractionation was used (2 Gy/fraction), and the total prescribed dose ranged from 60 to 66 Gy. In patients treated by hypofractionated IFRT, 2.5 Gy/fraction was used, and the total prescribed dose ranged from 65 to 70 Gy. Results. The 1- and 2-year overall survival rates were 78.4% and 53.7% , respectively. The 1- and 2-year local control rates were 72.2% and 57.7% , respectively. The patients in the conventional IFRT group had a 1-year local control rate of 61.2% and a 2-year local control rate of 47.6%, while the patients in the hypofractionated IFRT group achieved higher local control rates of 87.1% and 72.5%, respectively (P = 0.0465) Conclusions. IFRT for patients with stage III NSCLC is feasible, and the incidence of elective nodal failure was low. Hypofractionated IFRT may therefore contribute to improvements in local control and overall survival.",Excluded

A change is produced in the metabolism of vitamin D in elderly people although its study has received little attention in many countries., METHODS: With the aim of evaluating vitamin D and its metabolites in the elderly people with hip fracture in our geographic environment (Madrid, Spain), 58 patients with hip fracture over the age of 70, and 39 subjects without a fracture or the similar age were studied. Both groups were evaluated during the season of minimum solar irradiation. The plasma concentrations of intact PTH and the serum concentrations of calcidiol and calcitriol were studied in all the patients., RESULTS: The patients with hip fracture presented significantly lower concentrations of calcidiol (11.7 +/- 6.4 vs. 18.4 +/- 12.7 nmol/l) and calcitriol (60.1 +/- 24.7 vs. 76.1 +/- 25.0 pmol/l) than in elderly persons without fracture, with similar PTH values being observed in both groups (4.8 +/- 1.9 vs. 5.1 +/- 2.3 pmol/l)., CONCLUSIONS: Although Madrid, Spain is considered to be a geographical area of high solar irradiation, the elderly population studied presented a vitamin D deficiency which was found to be greater in those with hip fracture.",Excluded

394,"Radiation dose response estimation with emphasis on low dose range using restricted cubic splines: application to all solid cancer mortality data, 1950-2003, in atomic bomb survivors. Using the all solid cancer mortality data set of the Life Span Study (LSS) cohort from 1950 to 2003 (LSS Report 14) data among atomic bomb survivors, excess relative risk (ERR) statistical analyses were performed using the second degree polynomial and the threshold and restricted cubic spline (RCS) dose response models. For the RCS models with 3 to 7 knots of equally spaced percentiles with margins in the dose range greater than 50 mGy, the dose response was assumed to be linear at less than 70 to 90 mGy. Due to the skewed dose distribution of atomic bomb survivors, the current knot system for the RCS analysis results in a detailed depiction of the dose response as less than approximately 0.5 Gy. The 6 knot RCS models for the all-solid cancer mortality dose response of the whole dose or less than 2 Gy were selected with the AIC model selection criterion and fit significantly better (p < 0.05) than the linear (L) model. The usual RCS includes the L-global model but not the quadratic (Q) nor linear-quadratic (LQ) global models. The authors extended the RCS to include L or LQ global models by putting L or LQ constraints on the cubic spline in the lower and upper tails, and the best RCS model selected with AIC criterion was the usual RCS with L-constraints in both the lower and upper tails. The selected RCS had a linear dose-response model in the lower dose range (i.e., < 0.2-0.3 Gy) and was compatible with the linear no-threshold (LNT) model in this dose range. The proposed method is also useful in describing the dose response of a specific cancer or non-cancer disease incidence/mortality.",Excluded
22,"Cetuximab plus cisplatin, irinotecan, and thoracic radiotherapy as definitive treatment for locally advanced, unresectable esophageal cancer: A phase-II study of the SWOG (S0414). Introduction: The specific aims of the study were to evaluate the 2-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), toxicity profile, and best objective response rate in patients with locally advanced, clinically unresectable esophageal cancer receiving cetuximab, cisplatin, irinotecan, and thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) within a multi-institutional cooperative-group setting. Method(s): Eligible patients (cT4 M0 or medically unresectable, biopsy proven, and noncervical esophageal cancer) were to receive four 21-day cycles of cetuximab 400 mg/m2 (day 1, cycle 1), cetuximab 250 mg/m2 (day 8, 15, cycle 1; then days 1, 8, and 15 for subsequent cycles), cisplatin 30 mg/m2 (days 1 and 8, all cycles), and irinotecan 65 mg/m 2 (days 1 and 8, all cycles). TRT was administered at 1.8 Gy in 28 daily fractions to a total dose of 50.4 Gy, to begin with on day 1 of cycle 3. The primary endpoint was 2-year OS, with an accrual goal of 75 patients with adenocarcinoma. Result(s): The study was closed because of slow accrual, with 21 eligible patients (11 squamous, 10 adenocarcinoma) enrolled from May 2005 to September 2007. Two-year OS and PFS (95% confidence interval [CI]) were 33.3% (14.6-57.0%) and 23.8% (8.2-47.2%), respectively. Kaplan-Meier estimates of median (95% CI) OS and PFS were 11.2 (6.4-43.6) and 6.4 (3.7-12.0) months, respectively. The overall response rate (95% CI) among 17 evaluable patients was 17.6% (3.8-43.4%), including 6% confirmed complete responders and 12% unconfirmed partial responders. Two deaths resulted from protocol treatment (sudden death and gastrointestinal necrosis). Ten (47.6%) and 6 (28.6%) patients had grade-3 or -4 toxicity, respectively: 52.4% were hematologic, 23.8% had fatigue, 19.0% had nausea, 19.0% had dehydration, and 19.0% had anorexia. Conclusion(s): Concomitant cetuximab, cisplatin, irinotecan, and TRT were poorly tolerated in the first North American cooperative group trial testing this regimen for locally advanced esophageal cancer as treatment-related mortality approached 10%. Single-institution phase-II cetuximab-based combined modality trials have yielded encouraging results in preliminary analyses.

3479,"Vertebral fracture assessment: A valid tool to detect vertebral fractures in elderly community. Introduction: Vertebral fractures (VFx) are associated with higher morbidity and mortality, increasing the risk of incident fractures. Although only 30% of the VFx cause symptoms, this finding is a relevant issue for managing patients with high fracture risk, as well prevention of new fractures, independently of bone mineral density. Studies have shown effectiveness of Vertebral Fracture Assessment (VFA) to detect prevalent VFx comparable to the spine X-ray, considered as gold standard method. The aim of this study was to compare the performance between VFA and X-ray to identify VFx in healthy elderly men and women from community. Patients and Methods: 429 non-institutionalized subjects (60% women), aged over 65 years, from community (Butanta area, Sao Paulo, Brazil) were enrolled in this cohort. VFA by DXA measurements and spine X-ray (T4 to L4) were analyzed according to semiquantitative method (Genant HK, 1993). The first one was evaluated by two expert rheumatologists by consensus between them. The second one was evaluated by one expert radiologist. The interobserver correlation between VFA and spine X-ray to identify VFx was analyzed by kappa (k) scores. P<0.05 was set as significant. Result(s): The prevalence of VFx in both methods was 29.4%, without significant difference between men and women. Unavailable vertebrae were significantly lower in spine X-ray than VFA (1% and 5.5% respectively, p<0.001), especially among T4-T6. According to VFA, 5013 (96%) vertebrae were considered as normal, 144 (2.7%) had grade 1 fractures, 58 (1.1%) with grade 2 fractures and 12 (0.2) grade 3 fractures. To identify VFx, the sensitivity of VFA was 73% and the specificity was 99.1%. After excluding deformities grade 1, the sensitivity increased to 93% and specificity to 99.6%. The correlation between VFA and X-ray was good (k=0.74). Again, without grade 1, the agreement was also better (k=0.84). The correlation vertebrae by vertebrae between VFA and spine X-ray was lower in T5-T7. There was not significant difference between methods, according by gender (k=0.72 in men, k=0.75 in women). Conclusion. In elderly community, VFA had similar performance to conventional spine X-ray to identify VFx in visible vertebrae. The sensitivity increased after excluding of mild deformities. Thus, this methodology is easy and feasible to be performed during routine DXA measurements, in order to improve the management of patients with higher risk of osteoporotic fractures.",Excluded
1575,"Creating percutaneous radiocephalic arteriovenous fistulas at the wrist. Background: The first arteriovenous fistulas were created at the wrist more than 60 years ago. Basic surgical construction techniques remain unchanged with mobilization and repositioning of the vessels followed by a sutured anastomosis. We used the Ellipsys device to construct percutaneous radiocephalic-arteriovenous fistulas at the wrist and report the results. Method(s): Data were reviewed retrospectively for all patients who had a percutaneous radiocephalic-arteriovenous fistula created during a 6-month period. Each individual underwent ultrasound vessel mapping in addition to physical examination. When a radiocephalic-arteriovenous fistula was feasible and a communicating vein 2 mm in diameter was noted in the distal forearm along with a radial artery 2 mm, a percutaneous radiocephalic-arteriovenous fistula was considered and reviewed with the patient. Result(s): Four individuals met the criteria to consider a percutaneous radiocephalic-arteriovenous fistula and all elected to have the procedure performed. Ages were 54-85 years. Three were diabetic and one was female. All percutaneous radiocephalic-arteriovenous fistulas were technically successful. Two individuals had not yet started dialysis therapy. Successful and repetitive cannulation for the two individuals with catheters was initiated at 4 and 8 weeks post procedure. The two pre-dialysis patients had physiologic arteriovenous fistula maturation (6 mm vein diameter and >500 mL/min flow) at 4 and 12 weeks. There were no procedural or late complications and none required intervention. Follow-up was 8-23 months (mean 16 months). Conclusion(s): The success of these percutaneous radiocephalic-arteriovenous fistulas suggests that use of the Ellipsys device will be applicable at the wrist in selected patients where appropriate vessel sizes and configurations are found.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.",Excluded

Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy in patients with inoperable endobronchial carcinoma. Methods and Materials: We retrospectively reviewed the records (April 1991 - May 2004) of patients with non-small-cell carcinoma, with no extrabronchial spread on computed tomography scans, who underwent HDR brachytherapy because of contraindications to surgery and external beam radiation therapy. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were compared by the log-rank test. Prognostic factors were analyzed by multivariate analysis. Result(s): 226 patients (223 men, 3 women, mean age: 62.2 years (range, 40-84)) were included. Of those, 217 (97%) had squamous cell carcinoma (Tis/T1/T2/Tx: 60/153/9/4). Dose was prescribed at 1 cm from the radius (24-35 Gy in 4-6 fractions). Mean follow-up was 30.4 months (range, 9-116). Complete endoscopic response rate was 93.6% at 3 months. One hundred twenty-eight patients (56%) died of intercurrent disease (n = 45), local failure (n = 36), metastasis (n = 10), local failure and metastasis (n = 11), complications (n = 13), and other causes (n = 12). The 2-year and 5-year survival rates were, respectively, 57% and 29% (overall) (median, 28.6 months), 81% and 56% (cancer-specific), and 68% and 50% (local disease-free). Acute toxicity included pneumothorax (1.5%) and mucosal inflammation (10%). Late complications were hemoptysis (6.6% with 5% of fatalities), bronchitis (19.5%), and necrosis (3.5%). In multivariate analysis, a distal tumor location and the use of two catheters were associated with improved local disease-free survival (p = 0.003 and p = 0.007, respectively) and a distal tumor location with improved overall survival (p = 0.0001).

1785,"Response-driven imaging biomarkers for predicting radiation necrosis of the brain. Radiation necrosis is an uncommon but severe adverse effect of brain radiation therapy (RT). Current predictive models based on radiation dose have limited accuracy. We aimed to identify early individual response biomarkers based upon diffusion tensor (DT) imaging and incorporated them into a response model for prediction of radiation necrosis. Twenty-nine patients with glioblastoma received six weeks of intensity modulated RT and concurrent temozolomide. Patients underwent DT-MRI scans before treatment, at three weeks during RT, and one, three, and six months after RT. Cases with radiation necrosis were classified based on generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD) of whole brain and DT index early changes in the corpus callosum and its substructures. Significant covariates were used to develop normal tissue complication probability models using binary logistic regression. Seven patients developed radiation necrosis. Percentage changes of radial diffusivity (RD) in the splenium at three weeks during RT and at six months after RT differed significantly between the patients with and without necrosis (p = 0.05 and p = 0.01). Percentage change of RD at three weeks during RT in the 30 Gy dose-volume of the splenium and brain gEUD combined yielded the best-fit logistic regression model. Our findings indicate that early individual response during the course of RT, assessed by radial diffusivity, has the potential to aid the prediction of delayed radiation necrosis, which could provide guidance in dose-escalation trials.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) and percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) are widely used in the treatment of Kummell's disease. The purpose of this article is to investigate the clinical efficacy of PVP and PKP for Kummell's disease., METHODS: The clinical data that 56 cases of Kummell's disease treated with either PVP (28 cases) or PKP (28 cases) from December 2015 to December 2017 were prospectively analyzed. Gender, age, course of disease, injury segment, bone mineral density (BMD), visual analogue scale (VAS), Oswestry disability index (ODI), imaging measurement indexes before surgery between the two groups showed no significant difference (all P > 0.05). The bone cement leakage rate, bone cement injection amount, operation time, VAS, ODI, the rate of vertebral compression, correction rate of kyphosis and refracture rate of adjacent vertebra in 2 years were compared between the two groups to calculate clinical efficacy., RESULTS: The two groups were followed up for 24-48 months. There was no significant difference in the follow-up time, amount of bone cement injected, incidence of bone cement leakage and refracture rate of adjacent vertebrae between the two groups (all P > 0.05). The operation time, intraoperative blood loss and fluoroscopy times of the PVP group were significantly lower than those of the PKP group (all P = 0.000). VAS score and ODI of the two groups were significantly lower at 1 day, 1 year and 2 years after surgery than before surgery (all P < 0.05), but there was not statistically significant difference between the two groups at each time point after surgery (all P > 0.05). The rate of vertebral compression and kyphosis correction in the two groups were significantly corrected (P < 0.05, respectively) and decreased significantly with time (all P < 0.05), But there was not significant difference between the two groups at any time point (all P > 0.05)., CONCLUSION: Both PVP and PKP can achieve similar effects in the treatment of Kummell's disease. Because the cost, operation time, blood loss, radiation exposure and surgical procedure of PVP are less than those of PKP, PVP has more clinical priority value.",Excluded

To compare the value of diagnostic methods in measuring the degree of malrotation we estimated this degree using clinical examination and calculated the anteversion of the femoral neck, taking radiographs in the technique of Dunn and Rippstein, and a modified method of computed tomography. Only in twelve cases the direction of malrotation was corresponding in all three methods, although considerable variations in quantitative results were noted. Maintaining the exact position of the patient, necessary to get reproducible results using conventional X-ray technique, was impossible in most cases of patients with posttraumatic joint-stiffness and malalignment. Determination of femoral neck anteversion using this modified method of CT is a quick, reproducible technique to calculate the degree of malrotation, insensitive to the position of the patient. By means of this CT method it was possible to approach the highest accuracy in precise preoperative planing. Furthermore the radiation exposure could be reduced in a range of 20%-40%.",Excluded

Sialoliths are common in the submandibular gland and its duct system. The exact cause of formation of a sialolith is still a matter of debate. The aim of this study was to analyze 6 sialoliths ultrastructurally to determine their development mechanism in the submandibular salivary glands. Six sialoliths retrieved from the hilus and duct of the submandibular salivary glands of 6 patients with sialadenitis were analyzed ultrastructurally by scanning electron microscope and x-ray diffractometer. Scanning electron microscope revealed mainly irregular, partly rudely hexagonal, needle-like and plate-shaped crystals. The cross-section from the surface to the inner part of the sialoliths showed no organic material. X-ray diffraction showed that the sialoliths were composed of hydroxyapatite crystals. Energy dispersive x-ray microanalysis showed that all of the samples contained high levels of Ca and P, and small amounts of Mg, Na, Cl, Si, Fe, and K. The main structures of the submandibular sialoliths were found to be hydroxyapatite crystals. No organic cores were observed in the central parts of the sialoliths.

Background: Clinical complete response (cCR) in rectal cancer is being evaluated as a tool to identify patients who would not require surgery in the curative management of rectal cancer. Our study reviews mucosal changes after neoadjuvant therapy for rectal cancer in patients treated at our center. Method(s): Pathology reports were retrieved for patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (CRT) or high-dose rate brachytherapy (HDRBT). The macroscopic appearance of the specimen was compared with pathologic staging. Result(s): This study included 282 patients: 88 patients underwent neoadjuvant CRT and 194 patients underwent HDRBT; all patients underwent total mesorectal excision (TME). There were 160 male and 122 female patients with a median age of 65 years (range 29-87). The median time between neoadjuvant therapy and surgery was 50 and 58 days. Sixty patients (21.2%) were staged as ypT0N0, 21.2% had a pathologic complete response (pCR), and only 3.2% had a cCR. Of the 67 patients with initial involvement of the circumferential radial margin (CRM), 44 converted to pathologic CRM-. Two hundred seventy-three patients (96.8%) had mucosal abnormalities. Of the 222 patients with residual tumor, 70 patients had no macroscopic tumor visualized but an ulcer in its place.

366,"Radiosurgery for re-irradiation of brain metastasis: Results in 54 patients. Purpose: To evaluate in terms of probabilities of local-regional control and survival, as well as of treatment-related toxicity, results of radiosurgery for brain metastasis arising in previously irradiated territory. Patients and Methods: Between January 1994 and March 2000, 54 consecutive patients presenting with 97 metastases relapsing after whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) were treated with stereotactic radiotherapy. Median interval between the end of WBRT and radiosurgery was 9 months (range 2-70). Median age was 53 years (24-80), and median Karnofski performance status (KPS) 70 (60-100). Forty-seven patients had one radiosurgery, five had two and two had three. Median metastasis diameter and volume were 21 mm (6-59) and 1.2 cc (0.1-95.2), respectively. A Leksell stereotactic head frame (Leksell Model G, Elektra, Instrument, Tucker, GA) was applied under local anesthesia. Irradiation was delivered by a gantry mounted linear accelerator (linacs) (Saturne, General Electric). Median minimal dose delivered to the gross disease was 16.2 Gy (11.8-23), and median maximal dose 21.2 Gy (14- 42). Result(s): Median follow-up was 9 months (1-57). Five metastases recurred. One- and 2-year metastasis local control rates were 91.3 and 84% and 1- and 2-year brain control rates were 65 and 57%, respectively. Six patients died of brain metastasis evolution, and three of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. One- and 2-year overall survival rates were 31 and 28%, respectively. According to univariate analysis, KPS, RPA class, SIR score and interval between WBRT and radiosurgery were prognostic factors of overall survival and brain free-disease survival. According to multivariate analysis, RPA was an independent factor of overall survival and brain free-disease survival, and the interval between WBRT and radiosurgery longer than 14 months was associated with longer brain free-disease survival. Side effects were minimal, with only two cases of headaches and two of grade 2 alopecia. Conclusion(s): Salvage radiosurgery of metastasis recurring after whole brain irradiation is an effective and accurate treatment which could be proposed to patients with a KPS > 70 and a primary tumour controlled or indolent. We recommend that a dose not exceeding 14 Gy should be delivered to an isodose representing 70% of the maximal dose since local control observed rate was similar to that previously published in literature with upper dose and side effects were minimal. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.",Excluded
2436,"FANCD2 depletion sensitizes cancer cells repopulation ability in vitro. Inactivation of Fanconi anemia/BRCA pathway in some cancers causes increased sensitivity to various drugs used for chemo-therapy. Several approaches have been suggested to artificially disrupt this pathway for better treatment. In our study, we have utilized RNA interference technique to knock-down the expression of FANCD2 and sensitize cancer cells undergoing treatment with DNA damaging agents. For this purpose, we transiently depleted FANCD2 by siRNA in a number of breast, bladder, or liver cancer cell lines and screened for mitomycin C or gamma-irradiation sensitivity changes. We could show that knocking-down FANCD2 gene expression increases sensitivity of cancer cells to mitomycin C and to less extent to gamma-rays. Importantly, this effect strongly correlates to repopulation ability of cancer cells and those cell lines with significant FANCD2 depletion revealed decreased recurrence capacity. In summary, the results we presented show proof of principle that opens new possibilities for further preclinical trials.",Excluded
883,"8 Gy single-dose radiotherapy is effective in metastatic spinal cord compression: Results of a phase III randomized multicentre Italian trial. Background and purpose: In a previous randomized trial we showed that the short-course radiotherapy (RT) regimen of 8 Gy x 2 was feasible in patients with metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC) and short life expectancy. This phase III trial was planned to determine whether in the same category of patients 8 Gy single-dose is as effective as 8 Gy x 2. Material(s) and Method(s): Three hundred and twenty-seven patients with MSCC and short life expectancy were randomly assigned to a short-course of 8 Gy x 2 or to 8 Gy single-dose RT. Median follow-up was 31 months (range, 4-58). Result(s): A total of 303 (93%) patients are assessable, 150 treated with the short-course and 153 with the single-dose RT. No difference in response was found between the two RT schedules adopted. Median duration of response was 5 and 4.5 months for short-course and single-dose RT (p = 0.4), respectively. The median overall survival was 4 months for all cases. Light acute toxicity was registered in a minority of cases. Late toxicity was never recorded. Conclusion(s): Both RT schedules adopted were effective. As already shown in several trials evaluating RT regimens in uncomplicated painful bone metastases, also MSCC patients may achieve palliation with minimal toxicity and inconvenience with a single-dose of 8 Gy. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

2984,"Stage i Lung SBRT Clinical Practice Patterns. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has become increasingly utilized over the last decade in the treatment of inoperable stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, although no standardized dosing guidelines exist. In this retrospective study, we investigated the dose prescription pattern use in the United States for patients receiving SBRT. Method(s): Patients with stage I NSCLC treated with SBRT between 2004 and 2011 were identified within the National Cancer Database (NCDB). Trends in SBRT use and dose prescriptions were analyzed. Result(s): A total of 5246 patients met criteria as receiving SBRT. The overall mean and median BED 10 were 134.5 and 132 Gy, respectively. Of these patients, 94.5% were prescribed a regimen with a BED 10 >=100 Gy. The most common prescriptions overall were 60 Gy in 3 fractions (24.1%), 48 Gy in 4 fractions (17.8%), 50 Gy in 5 fractions (13.0%), and 54 Gy in 3 fractions (12.8%). Analysis of prescription trends revealed decreased utilization of 54 to 60 Gy in 3 fractions (47.9% in 2006 to 27.9% in 2011, combined) and increased utilization of 50 Gy in 5 fractions (3.1% in 2006 to 20.4% in 2011). Conclusion(s): Our findings suggest increasing use of SBRT over the last decade with a majority of patients being treated with regimens employing a BED 10 >=100 Gy. Since 2006, there has been a decline in the use of 54 to 60 Gy in 3 fractions, with an increase in the use of 50 Gy in 5 fractions. Possible explanations include concern for increased toxicity with higher BED regimens and increasing treatment of centrally located tumors.Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",Excluded
817,"Phase I/II study of induction chemotherapy using carboplatin plus irinotecan and sequential thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) for elderly patients with limited-disease smallcell lung cancer (LD-SCLC): TORG 0604. Background: The role of irinotecan for elderly patients with LD-SCLC has been unclear, and the timing of TRT combined with chemotherapy has not been fully evaluated. Method(s): Patients aged > 70 years with untreated, measurable, LD-SCLC, performance status (PS) 0-2, and adequate organ function were eligible. Treatment consisted of induction with carboplatin on day 1 and irinotecan on days 1 and 8, every 21 days for 4 cycles, and sequential TRT (54Gy in 27 fractions). Carboplatin doses were based on AUC of 4 and 5 (levels 1 and 2, respectively), with a fixed irinotecan dose (50 mg/m2). Primary objective of the phase II study was overall responce rate. Result(s): Forty-three patients were enrolled and forty-one were finally analyzed (median age: 75 years [range 70-86 years); males 31; PS 0/1/2, n = 22/18/1]. Two patients were excluded because of protocol violation (ascertained to be extensive disease). Twelve patients were accrued at phase I and the number of patients with carboplatin dose-limiting toxicities at levels-1 (n = 6) and -2 (n = 6) were 1(grade 3 hypertension) and 2 (grade 4 thrombocytopenia), respectively. The phase II trial was expanded to 29 additional patients receiving the level 1 carboplatin dose, total of 35 patients. The median number of chemotherapy cycles was 4 (range 1-4), and the median radiation dose was 54Gy (range 36-60). Toxicities were generally mild. There were 4 complete and 27 partial responses (response rate 88.6%). With a median follow-up of 52 months, the median progression-free and overall survival times of phase II were 11.2 and 27.1 months, respectively.

PURPOSE: To study efficacy and toxicity of radiochemotherapy in esophageal cancer including initial endoluminal high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT)., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 01/1995 and 06/2005, 61 patients with esophageal cancer were treated preoperatively with definitive and palliative intent. Treatment started with intraluminal HDR-BT for recanalization of the esophagus (single fraction size of 8 Gy in 0.5 cm depth, three times, q7d) followed by external-beam radiation therapy (50 Gy total dose, 5 x 2 Gy/week, 25 fractions in 5 weeks). Chemotherapy was started simultaneously with external irradiation (three courses of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil, q21d)., RESULTS: Swallowing function improved in 55/61 patients (dysphagia classification according to the RTOG), and worsened in 6/61 patients, respectively. Median duration of symptomatic improvement was 11 months, median follow-up 12 months (range 3-68 months). Following simultaneous radiochemotherapy, tumor resectability was achieved in 7/25 patients of the neoadjuvant group, and the histological specimen showed complete remission in 6/7 patients., CONCLUSION: These results indicate a favorable effect of simultaneous radiochemotherapy starting with endoluminal HDR-afterloading-( AL-)BT in esophageal cancer.",Excluded
2810,"Medical diagnostic radiation exposures and risk of gliomas. High-dose ionizing radiation is an established risk factor for glioma, but it remains unknown whether moderate- and low-dose radiation increase glioma risk. In this analysis, we assessed the evidence that self-reported exposures to diagnostic ionizing radiation, including computerized tomography (CT) scans, is associated with increased risk of adult glioma. While no independent association was observed for CT scans alone (3+ scans compared to none P = 0.08 and 1-2 scans compared to none P = 0.68), our findings suggest an increased risk of adult gliomas with cumulative exposure to three or more CT scans to the head and neck region (OR = 1.97, 95% CI: 0.92-4.23) limited to those who reported a family history of cancer: the P value for the interaction between having three or more CT scans and family history of cancer was 0.08. The stratum-specific adjusted OR for those with family history of cancer was more than three times that for the sub-group without family history of cancer. While there is some potential for symptom-related bias, one might expect this to be present for all diagnostic procedures rather than specific to one procedure. The interaction between CT scans and glioma with family history of cancer supports the biological plausibility of our findings, because similar results have been found for breast cancer and radiation. This observational data will increase awareness about potential risks associated with CT scans and the need to minimize the use of unnecessary examinations.",Excluded
3034,"Delivered dose and vascular response after beta-radiation for in-stent restenosis: retrospective dosimetry and volumetric intravascular ultrasound analysis. BACKGROUND: Observations from previous intracoronary radiation therapy trials noted a considerable discrepancy between the prescribed radiation dose and the dose actually delivered. The aims of this study were to investigate the effect of actual delivered dose on vascular changes and to test the appropriateness of the current dose prescription., METHODS AND RESULTS: Serial volumetric intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) analysis was performed in 30 in-stent restenosis cases treated with a 40-mm (90)Sr/Y source train. The fixed dose was prescribed at 2 mm from the centerline of the source train (18.4 Gy at 2 mm for reference diameter or =3.36 mm). Only stent segments with full radiation coverage and device injury were enrolled and divided into 2-mm-long subsegments (n=202). D(S90)EEM (the minimum dose absorbed by 90% of the external elastic membrane surface) was calculated as the delivered dose corresponding to each segment, assuming that the radiation catheter occupied the same position in the vessel as the IVUS catheter. Mean D(S90)EEM of 23.5+/-5.82 Gy (range 12.3 to 41.7 Gy) was delivered to these subsegments. Overall, intimal hyperplasia volume remained constant from postintervention to follow-up (2.23+/-1.10 to 2.32+/-1.09 mm3/m; P=NS). Regression analysis revealed there was no correlation between delivered dose intensity and changes in intimal hyperplasia volume. No particular dose-dependent complications were appreciated in this delivered dose range., CONCLUSIONS: The current dose-prescription protocol of (90)Sr/Y radiation to native in-stent restenosis lesions may provide substantial inhibition of neointimal reproliferation regardless of the actual delivered dose intensity.",Excluded
1449,"Severity of radiation pneumonitis, from clinical, dosimetric and biological features: a pilot study. Background and objective: Radiation pneumonitis (RP) could be a lethal complication of lung cancer treatment. No reliable predictors of RP severity have been recognized. This prospective pilot study was performed to identify early predictors of high grade lung toxicity and to evaluate clinical, biological or dosimetric features associated with different grades of toxicity. Method(s): Sixteen patients with non-small cell lung cancer with indication of concurrent chemoradiotherapy using 60 Gy/2 Gy/fraction starting at cycle one of platinum based chemotherapy were included. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), pulmonary function testing (PFT), and 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron-emission tomography was performed before radiotherapy (RT), after three weeks of treatment, and two months post-RT. For analysis, patients were grouped by grade (low [G1-G2] vs. high [G3-G5]). The two groups were compared to identify predictors of RP. Protein expression BAL and lung tissue metabolism was evaluated in two patients (RP-G1 vs. RP-G3). Categorical variables such as comorbidities, stages and locations were summarized as percentages. Radiation doses, pulmonary function values and time to RP were summarized by medians with ranges or as means with standard deviation. Longitudinal analysis PFT was performed by a T-test. Result(s): All 16 patients developed RP, as follows: G1 (5 pts; 31.3%); G2 (5 pts; 31.3%); G3 (5 pts; 31.3%); and G5 (1 pts; 6.1%). Patients with high grade RP presented significant decrease (p = 0.02) in diffusing lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) after three weeks of RT. No correlation between dosimetric values and RP grades was observed. BAL analysis of the selected patients showed that CXCL-1, CD154, IL-1ra, IL-23, MIF, PAI-1 and IFN-gamma were overexpressed in the lungs of the RP-G3 patient, even before treatment. The pre-RT SUVmax value in the RP-G3 patient was non-significantly higher than in the patient with RP-G1. Conclusion(s): RT induces some degree of RP. Our data suggest that decrease in DLCO% is the most sensitive parameter for the early detection of RP. Moreover, we detect biological differences between the two grades of pneumonitis, highlighting the potential value of some cytokines as a prognostic marker for developing high grade lung toxicity. Further multicenter studies with larger sample size are essential to validate these findings.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded
1169,"Diffraction enhanced imaging of articular cartilage and comparison with micro-computed tomography of the underlying bone structure. The goal of this study was to explore the role of diffraction enhanced X-ray imaging (DEI) for assessing changes in osteoarthritic cartilage and correlating the findings with concurrent changes in the underlying bone imaged using micro-computed tomography (microCT). DEI was used to image femoral head specimens at various beam energies. DEI utilizes a monochromatic, highly collimated beam, with an analyzer crystal that selectively weights out photons according to the angle they have been deviated with respect to the original direction. This provides images of very high contrast, with the rejection of X-ray scatter. The underlying bone was imaged using microCT and measures quantifying the bone structure were derived. Confirmation of cartilage degeneration was obtained from histology and polarized light microscopy. DEI allowed the visualization of articular cartilage and reflected the fibrillations and fissures in tissues from degenerated joints. The trabecular bone underlying the most degenerated articular cartilage showed increased bone volume fraction and more plate-like characteristics, compared with that underlying normal appearing cartilage. The histology and polarized light microscopy images reflected the DEI based features of cartilage architecture. These data reflect the ability of X-ray based emerging technologies to depict cartilage-bone interactions in joint degeneration.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To study the efficacy of the integration of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging tractography data into stereotactic radiosurgery clinical practice., METHODS AND MATERIALS: fMRI and tractography data sets were acquired and fused with corresponding anatomical MR and computed tomography images of patients with arteriovenous malformation (AVM), astrocytoma, brain metastasis, or hemangioma and referred for stereotactic radiosurgery. The acquired data sets were imported into a CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery system and used to delineate the target, organs at risk, and nearby functional structures and fiber tracts. Treatment plans with and without the incorporation of the functional structures and the fiber tracts into the optimization process were developed and compared., RESULTS: The nearby functional structures and fiber tracts could receive doses of >50% of the maximum dose if they were excluded from the planning process. In the AVM case, the doses received by the Broadmann-17 structure and the optic tract were reduced to 700 cGy from 1,400 cGy and to 1,200 cGy from 2,000 cGy, respectively, upon inclusion into the optimization process. In the metastasis case, the motor cortex received 850 cGy instead of 1,400 cGy; and in the hemangioma case, the pyramidal tracts received 780 cGy instead of 990 cGy. In the astrocytoma case, the dose to the motor cortex bordering the lesion was reduced to 1,900 cGy from 2,100 cGy, and therefore, the biologically equivalent dose in three fractions was delivered instead., CONCLUSIONS: Functional structures and fiber tracts could receive high doses if they were not considered during treatment planning. With the aid of fMRI and tractography images, they can be delineated and spared. Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Purpose: To estimate the dose response relationship for submandibular gland (SMG) recovery using salivary scintigraphy in patients diagnosed with head and neck cancer treated with curative image guided chemoradiation. Material(s) and Method(s): Ninety newly diagnosed head and neck cancer patients (T1-3, N0-2c, M0) treated with intensity modulated radiotherapy on a prospective clinical trial were assessed for salivary toxicity at predefined intervals using dynamic salivary scintigraphy. The SMG function was measured using salivary excretion fraction (SEF) ratios at baseline and 6 monthly. Tolerance dose (TD) 50 for submandibular gland was estimated from dose response curves. Result(s): The mean SEF ratio of 180 SMGs decreased at 6 months with a nadir at 12 months after treatment (SEF ratio 15%) and progressively recovered over time reaching 38% over 24 months. There was significant inverse correlation between SEF ratio and mean SMG dose at 6 months (r = -0.18, p = 0.04); 12-months (r = -0.36, p < 0.001); 18-months (r = -0.48, p < 0.001); 24-months (r = -0.42, p < 0.001); and more than 24-months (r = -0.56, p < 0.001). The estimated TD 50 values at 1 year and 2 year post treatment were 36 Gy and 44 Gy respectively with SEF ratio of <=45% used to define severe xerostomia. For every 1 Gy reduction in mean dose below 54 Gy, there is 2-2.5% reduction in the probability of severe xerostomia. Conclusion(s): The submandibular gland function declines after radiotherapy with a nadir at 12 months and there is incomplete recovery over time with continued improvement over 24 months.

2432,"Massive introgression drives species radiation at the range limit of Anopheles gambiae. Impacts of introgressive hybridisation may range from genomic erosion and species collapse to rapid adaptation and speciation but opportunities to study these dynamics are rare. We investigated the extent, causes and consequences of a hybrid zone between Anopheles coluzzii and Anopheles gambiae in Guinea-Bissau, where high hybridisation rates appear to be stable at least since the 1990s. Anopheles gambiae was genetically partitioned into inland and coastal subpopulations, separated by a central region dominated by A. coluzzii. Surprisingly, whole genome sequencing revealed that the coastal region harbours a hybrid form characterised by an A. gambiae-like sex chromosome and massive introgression of A. coluzzii autosomal alleles. Local selection on chromosomal inversions may play a role in this process, suggesting potential for spatiotemporal stability of the coastal hybrid form and providing resilience against introgression of medically-important loci and traits, found to be more prevalent in inland A. gambiae.",Excluded
2152,"Preoperative isolated limb infusion of doxorubicin and external irradiation for limb-threatening soft tissue sarcomas. Background: At present, limb-sparing surgery is the most appropriate and acceptable treatment option for soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities. To increase the number of limb-sparing resections in the treatment of locally advanced soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities, preoperative radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy are often used. Isolated limb perfusion of cytostatic agents is an effective alternative option but technically complex. Isolated limb infusion, essentially a low-flow isolated limb perfusion without oxygenation via a percutaneous catheter, had been developed as a simple alternative. Objective(s): The objective of this study was to achieve limb-sparing surgery in patients with locally advanced soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities that would otherwise have required an amputation or a functionally mutilating surgery by performing preoperative isolated limb infusion with doxorubicin and external beam irradiation to obtain local control and make limb-sparing surgery feasible. Method(s): A total of 40 patients with locally advanced soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities were evaluated between 2002 and 2005. Tumors were located in the lower limb in 28 patients (70%) and in the upper limb in 12 patients (30%). All of these patients were felt to be unresectable and were referred because amputation was considered the only available treatment option. They underwent preoperative isolated limb infusion with doxorubicin (0.7 and 1.4 mg/kg for the upper and lower limbs, respectively). Preoperative external beam radiotherapy started within 3-7 days after isolated limb infusion was administered. The total dose was 35 Gy in ten fractions. After 3-7 weeks, surgery was performed aiming at limb preservation. Result(s): Tumor response was seen in 85% of patients, rendering these large sarcomas resectable in most cases. The mean values of pretreatment tumor volume and post-treatment volume were 2797 cm3 and 1781 cm3, respectively, with a significant p value of 0.0001. Histologic response was seen in 80% of patients. At a median followup of 15 months (range = 5-35), limb salvage was achieved in 82.5%. Procedure-related complications were limited and easily managed. Conclusion(s): Isolated limb infusion with doxorubicin is a simple and safe method of regional chemotherapy.

3137,"Overexpression of AIB1 predicts resistance to chemoradiotherapy and poor prognosis in patients with primary esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. AIB1 (amplified in breast cancer 1) is frequently overexpressed in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), but the significance of AIB1 expression in chemoradiotherapy (CRT) sensitivity and its effect on prognosis are still unclear. In this study, the expression of AIB1 was examined by immunohistochemistry in 98 biopsy specimens of primary ESCC patients treated with definitive CRT. AIB1 overexpression was found in 63/98 (64.3%) of the ESCCs. There was a significant association between AIB1 overexpression and distant lymph node metastases (P = 0.011), but not regional lymph node metastases. In the M0 subgroup, overexpression of AIB1 was observed more frequently in stage T4 than in stage T2-3 (66.7%vs 38.5%, P = 0.031). In addition, AIB1 expression was the only factor that showed a significant correlation with CRT response, in which overexpression of AIB1 was observed more frequently in the CRT resistant group than in the CRT effective group (86.5%vs 50.8%, P < 0.001). Univariate analysis revealed that AIB1 overexpression was associated with poor progression-free survival (PFS) (P < 0.001) and poor disease-specific survival (DSS) (P <0.001). Furthermore, AIB1 expression could stratify patient survival in stages T2-3, T4, N1, and M0 (P < 0.05), as well as in the CRT effective group (P < 0.05), and AIB1 overexpression and CRT resistance were evaluated as significant independent prognostic factors for both PFS and DSS in multivariate analysis. These findings suggest that overexpression of AIB1 is a useful predictor of CRT resistance and an independent molecular marker of poor prognosis for ESCC patients.",Excluded
522,"A comparison of the semiflexed (MTP) view with the standing extended view (SEV) in the radiographic assessment of knee osteoarthritis in a busy routine X-ray department. Objective. To compare the reproducibility of the standing extended view (SEV) (also known as the standing anteroposterior view) with the semiflexed, postero-anterior view [the 'metatarsophalangeal' (MTP)] view for assessing joint space width (JSW) and osteophytes in osteoarthritis of the knee when used in a busy routine X-ray department. Methods. Forty-seven patients (24 men) had both SEV and MTP views taken on the same day in a busy National Health Service radiography department. Repeat views were taken as entirely separate procedures some time over the following 2 weeks, in the same department and with no special arrangements for the selection of radiographers, time of day, or X-ray machine. The first 24 patients had second views in the SEV position whilst the remaining 23 had second MTP views. Radiographs were read independently by two experienced observers who measured JSW with a transparent ruler to the nearest 0.5 mm at the narrowest point in both medial and lateral compartments of the tibiofemoral joint in both knees. Osteophytes were graded 0-2 according to a standard atlas. Ten SEV and 10 MTP radiographs selected randomly were re-read by one observer. Results. Mean (95% confidence interval) JSW in the medial compartment measured on SEV radiographs was 3.54 mm (3.08, 3.99) and on MTP radiographs it was 2.80 mm (2.37, 3.23); in the lateral compartment it was 6.04 mm (5.71, 6.37) when measured on SEV radiographs and 5.47 mm (5.09, 5.85) on MTP radiographs. The estimated variances for the medial compartment were 2.0 mm2 for SEV and 0.2 mm2 for MTP (P < 0.001) and for the lateral compartment 1.4 mm2 for SEV and 0.5 mm2 for MTP (P < 0.001). The proportion of radiographs for which there was disagreement between observers regarding osteophyte grade was not statistically different between SEV and MTP views (SEV, medial 40%, lateral 44%; MTP, medial 39%, lateral 39%). Conclusions. Even when radiographs are taken in a busy National Health Service radiography department, measurement of JSW from the MTP view is more reproducible than from the SEV view, the MTP view gives a slightly lower measurement of JSW, and there is no advantage in using either view in recording osteophyte grade. We recommend the wider adoption of the MTP method. © British Society for Rheumatology 2004; all rights reserved.",Excluded
764,"Clinical efficacy of 2-phase versus 4-phase computed tomography for localization in primary hyperparathyroidism. BACKGROUND: Four-dimensional computed tomography is being used increasingly for localization of abnormal glands in primary hyperparathyroidism. We hypothesized that compared with traditional 4-phase imaging, 2-phase imaging would halve the radiation dose without compromising parathyroid localization and clinical outcomes., METHODS: A transition from 4-phase to 2-phase imaging was instituted between 2009 and 2010. A pre-post analysis was performed on patients undergoing operative treatment with a parathyroid protocol computed tomography, and relevant data were correlated with operative findings. Sensitivity, positive predictive value, technical success, and cure rates were calculated. The Fisher exact test or chi(2) test assessed the significance of 2-phase and 4-phase imaging and operative findings., RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients had traditional four-dimensional computed tomography and 35 had modified 2-phase computed tomography. Effective radiation doses were 6.8 mSy for 2-phase and 14 mSv for 4-phase. Four-phase computed tomography had a sensitivity and positive predictive value of 93% and 96%, respectively. Two-phase computed tomography had a comparable sensitivity and positive predictive value of 97% and 94%, respectively. Eight patients with discordant imaging had an average parathyroid weight of 240 g compared with 1,300 g for all patients. Technical surgical success (90% for 4-phase computed tomography versus 91% 2-phase computed tomography) and normocalcemia rates at 6 months (88% for both) did not differ between computed tomography protocols. Computed tomography correctly predicted multiglandular disease and localization for reoperations in 88% and 90% of cases, respectively, with no difference by computed tomography protocol., CONCLUSION: With regard to surgical outcomes and localization, 2-phase parathyroid computed tomography is equivalent to 4-phase for parathyroid localization, including small adenomas, reoperative cases, and multiglandular disease. Two-phase parathyroid computed tomography for operative planning should be considered to avoid unnecessary radiation exposure. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
713,"Phase II study of preoperative helical tomotherapy with a simultaneous integrated boost for rectal cancer. PURPOSE: The addition of concomitant chemotherapy to preoperative radiotherapy is considered the standard of care for patients with cT3-4 rectal cancer. The combined treatment modality increases the complete response rate and local control (LC), but has no impact on survival or the incidence of distant metastases. In addition, it is associated with considerable toxicity. As an alternative strategy, we explored prospectively, preoperative helical tomotherapy with a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 108 patients were treated with intensity-modulated and image-guided radiotherapy using the Tomotherapy Hi-Art II system. A dose of 46 Gy, in daily fractions of 2 Gy, was delivered to the mesorectum and draining lymph nodes, without concomitant chemotherapy. Patients with an anticipated circumferential resection margin (CRM) of less than 2 mm, based on magnetic resonance imaging, received a SIB to the tumor up to a total dose of 55.2 Gy. Acute and late side effects were scored using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0., RESULTS: A total of 102 patients presented with cT3-4 tumors; 57 patients entered the boost group and 51 the no-boost group. One patient in the no-boost group developed a radio-hypersensitivity reaction, resulting in a complete tumor remission, a Grade 3 acute and Grade 5 late enteritis. No other Grade >=3 acute toxicities occurred. With a median follow-up of 32 months, Grade >=3 late gastrointestinal and urinary toxicity were observed in 6% and 4% of the patients, respectively. The actuarial 2-year LC, progression-free survival and overall survival were 98%, 79%, and 93%., CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative helical tomotherapy displays a favorable acute toxicity profile in patients with cT3-4 rectal cancer. A SIB can be safely administered in patients with a narrow CRM and resulted in a promising LC. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

2665,"Automated synthesis and dosimetry of 6-deoxy-6-[18F]fluoro-D-fructose (6-[18F]FDF): A radiotracer for imaging of GLUT5 in breast cancer. 6-Deoxy-6-[18F]fluoro-D-fructose (6-[18F]FDF) is a promising PET radiotracer for imaging GLUT5 in breast cancer. The present work describes GMP synthesis of 6-[18F]FDF in an automated synthesis unit (ASU) and dosimetry calculations to determine radiation doses in humans. GMP synthesis and dosimetry calculations are important prerequisites for first-in-human clinical studies of 6-[18F]FDF. The radiochemical synthesis of 6-[18F]FDF was optimized and adapted to an automated synthesis process using a Tracerlab FXFN ASU (GE Healthcare). Starting from 30 GBq of cyclotron-produced n.c.a. [18F]fluoride, 2.9 +/- 0.1 GBq of 6-[18F]FDF could be prepared within 50 min including HPLC purification resulting in an overall decay-corrected radiochemical yield of 14 +/- 3% (n = 11). Radiochemical purity exceeded 95%, and the specific activity was greater than 5.1 GBq/mumol. Sprague-Dawley rats were used for biodistribution experiments, and dynamic and static small animal PET experiments. Biodistribution studies served as basis for allometric extrapolation to the standard man anatomic model and normal organ-absorbed dose calculations using OLINDA/EXM software. The calculated human effective dose for 6-[18F]FDF was 0.0089 mSv/MBq. Highest organ doses with a dose equivalent of 0.0315 mSv/MBq in a humans were found in bone. Injection of 370 MBq (10 mCi) of 6-[18F]FDF results in an effective whole body radiation dose of 3.3 mSv in humans, a value comparable to that of other 18F-labeled PET radiopharmaceuticals. The optimized automated synthesis under GMP conditions, the good radiochemical yield and the favorable human radiation dosimetry estimates support application of 6-[18F]FDF in clinical trials for molecular imaging of GLUT5 in breast cancer patients.",Excluded
2035,"The epidemiology of vitamin D and colorectal cancer: recent findings. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To highlight the human studies published over the past year examining the influence of vitamin D on risk of colorectal cancer., RECENT FINDINGS: Studies over the past year have added more support to the idea that higher levels of vitamin D may decrease risk of colorectal cancer. Further, typical dietary intakes such as 200-400 IU/day may be too low to exert appreciable benefits, and protection may occur with higher levels of vitamin D associated with exposure to sunshine. Recent studies also suggest a potential benefit of vitamin D on other digestive-tract cancers, and that vitamin D status at the time of diagnosis and treatment may influence survival of cancer. However, the evidence for these latter findings is based on limited data and needs to be confirmed. Higher vitamin D levels may also be associated with a higher rate of apoptosis in colorectal mucosa., SUMMARY: Recent studies add more support to a potential role of vitamin D on risk of colorectal cancer, but suggest that intakes higher than customary are required if solar ultraviolet-B exposure is low. More studies are required to determine the optimal levels and intakes of this vitamin to reduce cancer risk. Potential benefits of vitamin D on other digestive-tract cancers and on survival in patients with colorectal cancer have been suggested by recent studies, but require confirmation.",Excluded
2830,"Is the modified Mann Assessment of Swallowing Ability useful for assessing dysphagia in patients with mild to moderate dementia?. Dysphagia is an important causative factor of aspiration pneumonia among the elderly, particularly in patients with dementia. The modified Mann Assessment of Swallowing Ability (mMASA) is commonly used as a physician-administered screening protocol for assessing dysphagia due to its merits as a clinical test that does not involve special equipment or radiation exposure. The present study investigated whether the mMASA would reflect the dysphagia state as estimated by videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) findings and cognitive function in patients with dementia. This study included 25 subjects with mild to moderate dementia. In all subjects, swallowing function was evaluated with the mMASA and VFSS and cognitive function was evaluated using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Global Deterioration Scale (GDS), and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scales. The Spearman correlation and linear regression tests were conducted with the mMASA values and other tests for swallowing and cognition. The mMASA values were correlated with the Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS) of the VFSS as well as scores on the MMSE, MoCA, GDS, and CDR. In addition, the Judgment and Problem Solving and Community Affairs subscales of the CDR were correlated with mMASA values. The assessments of dysphagia using the mMASA were consistent with the VFSS findings and were reflected by cognitive function. Taken together, the present findings suggest that the mMASA would be useful for the routine evaluation of swallowing function in patients with mild to moderate dementia for the detection of dysphagia.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
1837,"Preparation and evaluation of the rhenium-188-labelled anti-NCA antigen monoclonal antibody BW 250/183 for radioimmunotherapy of leukaemia. Anti-NCA antigen antibody BW 250/183 (Anti-Granulocyte) localizes more than 50% of injected antibody dose to the bone marrow. Therefore, this antibody is promising for adjuvant conditioning radioimmunotherapy of bone marrow before bone marrow transplantation. To examine its potential use for radioimmunotherapy, we developed an efficient and reproducible technical protocol for labelling anti-NCA antigen antibody BW 250/183 with generator-produced rhenium-188, aiming at both high radiochemical yield and high specific activity. 188Re-labelled BW 250/183 antibody was used in 12 patients with advanced leukaemia. Labelling of BW 250/183 with 188Re was accomplished by the direct radiolabelling method using tris-(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) as the reducing agent. Twelve patients with recurrent acute or chronic leukaemia were treated with activities of 6.5-12.4 GBq of 188Re-labelled BW 250/183. Standard gamma camera scintigraphy was used to evaluate the biodistribution, and a region of interest analysis together with the MIRDOSE 3.1 software was applied to determine the radiation doses to relevant tissues. The 188Re-BW 250/183 antibody was labelled in high radiochemical yield, with high radiochemical purity (94% +/- 3%) and specific activity (5.55-7.4 GBq/mg) within 1 h. The preliminary biodistribution studies showed persistent uptake of 188Re-BW 250/183 in bone marrow. The radiation absorbed doses (mGy/MBq) delivered to the total body, red marrow, liver, spleen and kidneys were 0.13 +/- 0.02, 1.45 +/- 0.71, 0.43 +/- 0.21, 1.32 +/- 0.99 and 0.71 +/- 0.17, respectively. TCEP reduction enabled the direct, fast and effective labelling of the monoclonal antibody BW 250/183 with 188Re.

881,"Analysis of intrafractional organ motion by megavoltage computed tomography in patients with lung cancer treated with image-guided stereotactic body radiotherapy using helical tomotherapy. Aim: To analyze intrafractional organ motion in patients with lung cancer treated with image-guided stereotactic body radiotherapy using helical tomotherapy (SBRT-HT). Patients and Methods: Data from 25 patients with lung cancer who received 50 Gy/5 fractions of SBRT-HT were analyzed. Slow-scan megavoltage computed tomography (MVCT) images were acquired before (pre-MVCT) and after (post-MVCT) each fraction. We analyzed the imaging quality of the 124 post-MVCT images to identify tumor contours using low-density settings. Next we examined tumor contour deviations from the planning target volume (PTV) in post- MVCT images for intrafractional tumor displacement. Result(s): Image quality was determined as good in 111/124 images from 22 patients (92%). None of the upper lung tumor images were of poor quality (74 images in 15 patients), whereas lower lung tumors yielded 14 poor-quality images out of the 50 images (3/10 patients). The difference in image quality between upper and lower lung tumors was statistically significant (p<0.01), especially when accompanied by interstitial lung shadows. Deviations in tumor position in post-MVCT images were analyzed in 110 images from 23 patients and revealed 99 images (90%) with tumor contours confined to PTV. In upper lung tumors, 4/74 images in 15 patients (5.4%) showed tumor contour deviations outside PTV. Lower lung tumors showed a higher rate of deviation with 7/36 images in 8 patients (19.4%) showing tumor contour deviations outside PTV (p<0.05). The maximum deviation was 1 mm for upper lung tumors and 2 mm for lower lung tumors. Conclusion(s): Upper lung tumors are good candidates for MVCT image-guided SBRT-HT. However, lower lung tumors, especially those adjacent to the diaphragm or pleura, can be difficult to assess, warranting precise dose delivery by MVCT image-guided SBRT-HT.",Excluded

Aim: To probe into the clinical effects of concurrent 3DCRT (3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy) and XELOX treatment for postoperative local recurrence of rectal carcinoma in the elderly patients. Material(s) and Method(s): Fifty-seven elderly patients with postoperative local recurrence of rectal carcinoma were randomly divided into a clinical group and a control group. The clinical group had 31 patients, who received 6 Mv X-ray 3DCRT, 2 Gy per time, 5 times every week. After radiotherapy for the total pelvis until target dose (DT) in tumor focus reached 40 Gy/20f, the tumor focus was intensified up to DT 60-64 Gy with 8 Mv X-ray DT 20-24 Gy. During radiotherapy, the patients were treated with XELOX (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2, dl, Xeloda 850 mg/m2, p.o. d1-14) for two periods. The control group had 26 pa tients, who were only treated with XELOX. Result(s): The responder rate (RR) of the clinical group was 87.1%. The survival rates within 1, 2 and 3 years were 67.7%, 51.6% and 41.9% respectively, which were higher than the control group (p < 0.05).

3303,"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy in 16 patients with locally advanced papillary thyroid carcinoma-a phase 1 study. Background and Objectives: It is believed that chemotherapy (ChT) is ineffective in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). The aim of our retrospective chart review was to find out if neodjuvant ChT before thyroid surgery had any effect on the size of primary tumor in patients with PTC. Method(s): In the period 1976-2006, 1,207 patients were treated for PTC at our Institute. The study included 16 patients (13 women, 3 men; mean age 63.5 years) with PTC, who were treated with neoadjuvant ChT from 1988-2005. Poorly differentiated PTC, classical PTC, follicular variant of PTC and Hurthle cell variant of PTC was diagnosed in five cases, five, three and three cases, respectively. A mean tumor diameter was 9.9 cm (range 5-22 cm). Seven patients had pT4 tumor. Regional metastases were detected in ten patients and distant metastases in seven patients. ChT consisted of Vinblastine in eleven cases, Vinblastine with Adriamyin in two cases and other schedules in three cases. Three patients were treated also with preoperative external irradiation. Result(s): Altogether, 40 cycles of ChT were given. After ChT tumor size decreased in all 16 patients: for more than 50% in seven (= 44%) patients and for less than 50% in nine patients. R0, R1 and R2 resection was performed in two, ten and four cases, respectively. Median survival of our patients was 92 (range 11-240) months. Six patients are still alive (median survival 157 months) and two of them have no evidence of disease. Two patients died of causes not related to carcinoma, while eight patients died of PTC (five of distant metastases, one of locoregional disease, two of distant metastases and locoregional disease). Conclusion(s): Neoadjuvant ChT before thyroid surgery may be effective in patients with locally advanced PTC. After neoadjuvant ChT, in 44% of our patients the tumor size decreased for more than 50%.",Excluded

551,"Differentiation of functionally active mouse T lymphocytes from functionally inactive bone marrow precursors II. Limited recovery of T-cell responses from mouse bone marrow in tissue culture. The limited differentiation of mature T cell function from mouse bone marrow in tissue culture is described and compared with similar differentiation occuring in vivo in irradiated bone marrow protected mice. Data are presented to show that a pool of precursors, similar in size to that able to produce early (transient?) regeneration in thymectomized recipients, is responsible for the development of mitogen responsive T cells active in MLC (proliferation) and CML (development of cytotoxic cells) assays. In contrast, a helper cell population which augments antibody formation from T-depleted normal spleen cells derives from a pool of similar precursors yet does not seem to be theta positive. Similarly, larger cells (perhaps typical of those giving rise to suppressor T cells in vivo) give rise to a suppressor cell pool after 4 days of culture, though again only a fraction of this suppressor activity could be attributed to theta positive cells. It is suggested that much of the data for regenration of T lymphocytes in vitro from T-depleted sources needs to be re-interpreted in terms of this evidence for a pool of post-thymic precursors of T cells in such T-deficient cell populations.",Excluded
2666,"Different pedicle osteosynthesis for thoracolumbar vertebral fractures in elderly patients. Introduction: Pedicle screws' stability, especially in osteoporotic fractures, is a really problem for spinal surgeons. Nowadays, little is known about the influence of different screw types and amount of cement applied. This single-center retrospective observational study has the aim of evaluating the middle- to long-term mechanical performances of different types of screws in elderly patients with thoracolumbar fractures. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 91 patients (37 males and 54 females), treated between 2011 and 2016, affected by somatic osteoporotic fractures aged over 65 years were treated. We divided patients into three different populations: solid screws, cannulated screws and cannulated screws augmented with poly methyl methacrylate cement (PMMA). Patients were radiologically evaluated with X-rays in pre- and post-surgery and at the follow-up (FU). Clinical evaluations were made with VAS and Oswestry Disability Index. Result(s): A total of 636 screws were implanted (222 pedicle screws, 190 cannulated and 224 cannulated screws with PMMA augmentation). At FU, we found significative differences between populations in terms of mechanical performances. We founded five cases of loosening; these were reported in solid screws group and in cannulated screws one. No mechanical failures were reported in cannulated screws with augmentation of PMMA. No rods breakage cases were reported. Conclusion(s): All stabilization methods showed good clinical results, but cannulated screws augmented with PMMA seem to provide better implant stability with the lowest rate of loosening.

The relationship between bowel dose volume data and late bowel toxicity in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer treated with radical radiotherapy was assessed., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The bowel was contoured retrospectively on radiotherapy plans of 47 patients recruited to the BC2001 trial (CRUK/01/004). The relationship between bowel volume at various dose levels and prospectively collected late bowel toxicity was explored., RESULTS: Fifteen per cent and 6% of patients experienced grade 1 and grade 2 or more late bowel toxicity, respectively. The mean bowel volume was significantly less at doses >=50 Gy in those treated with reduced high dose volume radiotherapy compared with standard radiotherapy. The probability of late bowel toxicity increased as bowel volume increased (P <= 0.05 for dose levels 30-50 Gy). No grade 2 or more late bowel toxicity was observed in patients with bowel volumes under the thresholds given in the model that predict for 25% probability of late bowel toxicity., CONCLUSIONS: There is a dose volume effect for late bowel toxicity in radical bladder radiotherapy. We have modelled the probability of late bowel toxicity from absolute bowel volumes to guide clinicians in assessing radical bladder radiotherapy plans. Thresholds predicting for a 25% probability of late bowel toxicity are proposed as dose volume constraints. Copyright © 2014. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",Excluded
818,"Laboratory selection for an accelerated mosquito sexual development rate. BACKGROUND: Separating males and females at the early adult stage did not ensure the virginity of females of Anopheles arabiensis (Dongola laboratory strain), whereas two years earlier this method had been successful. In most mosquito species, newly emerged males and females are not able to mate successfully. For anopheline species, a period of 24 h post-emergence is generally required for the completion of sexual maturation, which in males includes a 180° rotation of the genitalia. In this study, the possibility of an unusually shortened sexual maturity period in the laboratory-reared colony was investigated.
METHODS: The effect of two different sex-separation methods on the virginity of females was tested: females separated as pupae or less than 16 h post-emergence were mated with males subjected to various doses of radiation. T-tests were performed to compare the two sex-separation methods. The rate of genitalia rotation was compared for laboratory-reared and wild males collected as pupae in Dongola, Sudan, and analysed by Z-tests. Spermatheca dissections were performed on females mated with laboratory-reared males to determine their insemination status.
RESULTS: When the sex-separation was performed when adults were less than 16 h post-emergence, expected sterility was never reached for females mated with radio-sterilized males. Expected sterility was accomplished only when sexes were separated at the pupal stage. Observation of genitalia rotation showed that some males from the laboratory strain Dongola were able to successfully mate only 11 h after emergence and 42% of the males had already completed rotation. A small proportion of the same age females were inseminated. Wild males showed a much slower genitalia rotation rate. At 17 h post-emergence, 96% of the laboratory-reared males had completed genitalia rotation whereas none of the wild males had.
CONCLUSION: This colony has been cultured in the laboratory for over one hundred generations, and now has accelerated sexual maturation when compared with the wild strain. This outcome demonstrates the kinds of selection that can be expected during insect colonization and maintenance, particularly when generations are non-overlapping and similar-age males must compete for mates.",Excluded
2045,"Validation of a decision instrument for selective chest imaging in blunt trauma. IMPORTANCE Chest radiography (chest x-ray [CXR] and chest computed tomography [CT]) is the most common imaging in blunt trauma evaluation. Unnecessary trauma imaging leads to greater costs, emergency department time, and patient exposure to ionizing radiation. OBJECTIVE To validate our previously derived decision instrument (NEXUS Chest) for identification of blunt trauma patients with very low risk of thoracic injury seen on chest imaging (TICI).We hypothesized that NEXUS Chest would have high sensitivity (>98%) for the prediction of TICI and TICI with major clinical significance. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS From December 2009 to January 2012, we enrolled blunt trauma patients older than 14 years who received chest radiography in this prospective, observational, diagnostic decision instrument study at 9 US level I trauma centers. Prior to viewing radiographic results, physicians recorded the presence or absence of the NEXUS Chest 7 clinical criteria (age >60 years, rapid deceleration mechanism, chest pain, intoxication, abnormal alertness/mental status, distracting painful injury, and tenderness to chest wall palpation). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Thoracic injury seen on chest imagingwas defined as pneumothorax, hemothorax, aortic or great vessel injury, 2 or more rib fractures, ruptured diaphragm, sternal fracture, and pulmonary contusion or laceration seen on radiographs. An expert panel generated an a priori classification of clinically major, minor, and insignificant TICIs according to associated management changes. RESULTS Of 9905 enrolled patients, 43.1%had a single CXR, 42.0% had CXR and chest CT, 6.7%had CXR and abdominal CT (without chest CT), 5.5%had multiple CXRs without CT, and 2.6%had chest CT alone in the emergency department. The most common trauma mechanisms were motorized vehicle crash (43.9%), fall (27.5%), pedestrian struck by motorized vehicle (10.7%), bicycle crash (6.3%), and struck by blunt object, fists, or kicked (5.8%). Thoracic injury seen on chest imaging was seen in 1478 (14.9%) patients with 363 (24.6%) of these having major clinical significance, 1079 (73.0%) minor clinical significance, and 36 (2.4%) no clinical significance. NEXUS Chest had a sensitivity of 98.8% (95%CI, 98.1%-99.3%), a negative predictive value of 98.5%(95%CI, 97.6%.6-99.1%), and a specificity of 13.3%(95%CI, 12.6%-14.1%) for TICI. The sensitivity and negative predictive value for TICI with clinically major injury were 99.7%(95%CI, 98.2%-100.0%) and 99.9% (95%CI, 99.4%-100.0%), respectively.

METHOD(S): Ninety-three potential liver donors who underwent preoperative contrast-enhanced 64 multidetector CTA and CTC were retrospectively divided into 2 groups: at 80 and at 120 kVp. An institutional review board waiver was obtained. Signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio of the hepatic artery and common bile duct were obtained. The dose-length product was recorded. Image quality and visibility of hepatic artery and biliary tract anatomy were evaluated. Mann-Whitney U test was used for statistical evaluation. RESULT(S): Mean hepatic artery/common bile duct signal-to-noise ratio was 28.9/28.6 (SD, 14.2/10.0) at 80 kVp and 27.6/25.8 (SD, 8.0/6.2) at 120 kVp (P = 0.61/0.099). Mean hepatic artery/common bile duct contrast-to-noise ratio was 24.8/23.3 (SD, 12.9/8.6) at 80 kVp and 22.2/19.3 (SD, 7.7/5.0) at 120 kVp (P = 0.76/0.005).

INTRODUCTION: The literature has recently underlined the interest of pelvic and acetabular component orientation measurements in the standing and sitting position. Radiographic follow-up of total hip arthroplasty (THA) is based on standard AP and lateral X-rays. The use of EOS TM 2D imaging system reduces patient's radiation exposure compared to conventional X-rays. However, using this system, the validity and reproducibility of angular measurements, have not been studied yet for the measurement of pelvic and acetabular parameters in patients with THA., HYPOTHESIS: The EOS TM 2D imaging system offers similar advantages to conventional X-rays in the measurement of pelvic and acetabular orientation parameters which are commonly used., PATIENTS AND METHOD: Five angular parameters characterizing pelvic tilt and acetabular cup orientation were determined using the same digital measurement Imagika TM software based on two series of standard X-rays and EOS TM 2D images acquired in both standing and sitting positions. Radiographs from 50 patients with unilateral THA were measured three times by two observers. Intra- and interobserver reproducibility using each method was independently studied then paired comparison was performed., RESULTS: The ICC and Spearman rank correlation coefficient demonstrated an excellent EOS/conventional X-ray correlation. According to the parameters, the mean difference between these two imaging modalities ranged from 0.30degree to 3.43degree (P<0.05). The intra- and interobserver variability ranged from +/- 2.97degree to +/- 6.46degree using the EOS TM imaging system and from +/- 4.26degree to +/- 10.22degree using conventional X-rays (P<0.05)., DISCUSSION: The EOS TM 2D imaging system may replace conventional X-rays in the assessment and monitoring of pelvic and acetabular cup orientation in THA., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.

2000,"Influence of nerve radiation dose in the incidence of trigeminal dysfunction after trigeminal neuralgia radiosurgery. OBJECTIVE: The authors conducted a comparative study to analyze dosimetry and results to understand the significant difference in the rate of trigeminal dysfunction after gamma knife radiosurgery for trigeminal neuralgia between two centers using the same target., METHODS: The data of 358 patients (109 patients from Brussels and 259 patients from Marseilles) were analyzed. Three different dosimetric strategies were found: treatment with less than 90 Gy and no selective beam channel blocking (Group 1; patients from Marseilles only), treatment with 90 Gy and no selective beam channel blocking (Group 2; patients from Brussels and Marseilles), or treatment with 90 Gy and use of selective beam channel blocking (Group 3; patients from Brussels only)., RESULTS: The prescription dose and the use of selective beam channel blocking have been significantly associated with a higher energy received by the retrogasserian trigeminal nerve root. The different radiation dose delivered to the nerve root in these three groups of patients was significantly associated with the incidence of mild (15, 21, and 49% for Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively) and bothersome (1.4, 2.4, and 10% for Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively) trigeminal dysfunction. The good and excellent rates of pain relief were 81 and 66%, respectively, for Group 1, 85 and 77%, respectively, for Group 2, and 90 and 84%, respectively, for Group 3, and were also related to the amount of energy received by nerve root volume., CONCLUSION: Using a similar target, the incidence of trigeminal dysfunction and the pain relief rate can vary according to the radiation energy received by the retrogasserian part of the trigeminal nerve root. The prescription dose and the use of beam channel blocking modify the integrated dose delivered to the nerve and may contribute to the different rates of trigeminal numbness and pain outcome. The radiobiological effect of gamma knife radiosurgery may be related to the energy delivered to nerve root volume, rather than to the maximal dose delivered.",Excluded

Artemis and Lig4 are the only known V(D)J/NHEJ factors found deficient in human genetic disorders. Null mutations of the Artemis gene result in a complete absence of T and B lymphocytes and increased cellular sensitivity to ionizing radiations, causing radiosensitive-SCID. Mutations of Lig4 are exclusively hypomorphic and have only been described in six patients, four exhibiting mild immunodeficiency associated with microcephaly and developmental delay, while two patient had leukemia. Here we report a SCID associated with microcephaly caused by compound heterozygous hypomorphic mutations in Lig4. Residual activity of Lig4 in these patients is underscored by a normal pattern of TCR-alpha and -beta junctions in the T cells of the patients and a moderate impairment of V(D)J recombination as tested in vitro. These observations contrast with the severity of the clinical immunodeficiency, suggesting that Lig4 may have additional critical roles in lymphocyte survival beyond V(D)J recombination.",Excluded

2089,"Head and neck angiography at 70 kVp with a third-generation dual-source CT system in patients: comparison with 100 kVp. Purpose: This study was conducted in order to evaluate the image quality of 70 kVp and 25 mL contrast medium (CM) volume for head and neck computed tomographic angiography (CTA) and assess the diagnostic accuracy for arterial stenosis. Method(s): Fifty patients were prospectively divided into two groups randomly: group A (n = 25), 70 kVp with 25 mL CM, and group B (n = 25), 100 kVp with 40 mL CM. CT attenuation values, noise, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the shoulder, neck, and cerebral arteries were measured for objective image quality. Subjective image quality of the shoulder and cerebral arteries was also evaluated. For patients undergoing digital subtracted angiography (DSA), diagnostic accuracy of CTA was assessed with DSA as reference standard. Result(s): The SNRs of the shoulder, neck, and cerebral arteries in group A were higher than those in group B (P < 0.05). The CNRs of the shoulder and neck arteries in group A were higher than those in group B (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in subjective image quality of arteries between group A and group B (P > 0.05). The accuracy was noted as 94.0% (156/166) in group A and 97.1% (134/138) in group B for >= 50% stenosis. The accuracy of intracranial arterial stenosis was lower than that of extracranial arterial stenosis in group A. The radiation dose of group A was significantly decreased by 56% than that of group B. Conclusion(s): Head and neck CTA at 70 kVp using 25 mL CM can obtain diagnostic image quality with lower radiation dose while maintaining high accuracy in detecting the arterial stenosis compared with the 100-kVp and 40-mL CM.Copyright © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",Excluded
1162,"Transanal minimally-invasive surgery for treating patients with regressed rectal cancer after preoperative chemoradiotherapy. Purpose: Although the standard treatment for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer managed by preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is a radical resection, local excisions are used in highly-selective cases. Recently, transanal minimally-invasive surgery (TAMIS) has emerged as a feasible technique for local excision of midrectal lesions. We assess the feasibility of using TAMIS to treat patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who showed good response to CRT. Method(s): From October 2010 to June 2013, 35 consecutive patients with rectal cancer managed by using preoperative CRT underwent TAMIS. After a single-incision laparoscopic surgery port had been introduced into the anal canal, a fullthickness local excision with conventional laparoscopic instruments was performed. We retrospectively reviewed a prospectively collected database of these cases. Result(s): Of the 35 patients analyzed, 18 showed pathologic complete responses and 17 had residual lesions (2 ypTis, 4 ypT1, 9 ypT2, and 2 ypT3); 34 (97.1%) showed clear deep, lateral margins. The median distance of lesions from the anal verge was 5 cm. All procedures were completed laparoscopically, and the median operating time was 84 minutes. No intraoperative events or morbidities were seen in any of the patients, except one with wound dehiscence, who was treated conservatively. The median postoperative hospital stay and follow-up period were 4 days and 36 months, respectively. During the study period, no patients died, but 5 (14.3%) experienced recurrence, including one recurrence at the TAMIS site. Conclusion(s): TAMIS seems to be a feasible, safe modality for treating patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who show good response to preoperative CRT.Copyright © 2017 The Korean Society of Coloproctology.",Excluded
3558,"Olecranon fractures in adults: Factors influencing outcome. In a retrospective, non-randomized study, we reviewed our experience with the operative treatment of olecranon fractures to find out which factors correlate with subjective complaints and functional outcome. A total of 95 consecutive olecranon fractures were operatively treated in our level I trauma institution between 1 March 1992 and 1 March 2000. Medical records and X-rays of all patients were evaluated. Three patients died, 23 were lost to follow-up. Fifty-eight of 69 available patients (84.0%) were reviewed clinically and/or radiologically after a mean time of 36 months. Fracture type, fracture classification, associated lesions, technical correctness of osteosynthesis, age and comorbidity were analysed. Radiological end result (intraarticular steps, gaps, arthrosis), subjective complaints, mobility of the elbow joint and muscle strength were evaluated. Patients with an unstable elbow (Mayo classification Type III and Schatzker-Schmeling classification Type D) had a higher loss of elbow function than others. There was a correlation between fracture morphology (fractures Type C and Type D in the Schatzker-Schmeling classification) and arthrosis. There also was a correlation between suboptimal osteosynthesis and arthrosis. There was no correlation between suboptimal osteosynthesis, implant loosening and secondary procedures. Patients more often expressed subjective complaints and loss of function in activities of daily life before than after metal removal. Primary elbow instability and fracture morphology are prognostic factors for elbow function and development of arthrosis after operative treatment of olecranon fractures. We, therefore, recommend the classification systems of the Mayo-clinic or of Schatzker-Schmeling. As many patients have complaints related to the implants, we recommend metal removal after fracture healing. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
3456,"Detection of Upper Tract Urothelial Malignancies by Computed Tomography Urography in Patients Referred for Hematuria at a Large Tertiary Referral Center. Objective To evaluate the age-stratified prevalence of upper tract urothelial malignancies diagnosed on computed tomography urography in a large cohort of patients referred for initial evaluation of hematuria. Materials and Methods A total of 1123 consecutive adults without a history of urothelial cancer underwent initial computed tomography urography for gross hematuria (n = 652), microscopic hematuria (n = 457), or unspecified hematuria (n = 14) at a single institution from October 2006 to October 2012. Imaging findings suggestive of urothelial lesions were correlated with clinical information, including cystoscopy, cytology, and surgical pathology reports. Patients subsequently diagnosed with urothelial cancer following a normal radiographic evaluation were identified and analyzed. Age, gender, smoking history, and location and type of malignancy were analyzed. Results Upper tract urothelial cancer was detected in 4 (0.36%) patients, with a mean age of 66.5 years. All 4 patients presented with gross hematuria and were current or former smokers. None of the 535 patients under age 55 who underwent computed tomography urography were diagnosed with upper tract disease regardless of age, smoking history, or degree of hematuria. Likewise, no upper tract cancers were detected in patients referred for microscopic hematuria, regardless of age. Conclusion Detection of upper tract urothelial cancer by computed tomography urography is exceedingly rare in patients presenting at a tertiary referral center with hematuria, particularly in the lower risk strata (younger age, microscopic hematuria). Further investigation into risk-stratified approaches to imaging for hematuria workup is warranted to minimize unnecessary costs and radiation exposure.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

Although uncertainties are inherent in this risk assessment, the present evidence warrants identifying homes that have unacceptably high concentrations.",Excluded
2196,"Radical chemoradiotherapy for elderly patients with bladder carcinoma invading muscle. BACKGROUND: Chemoradiotherapy is becoming an alternative to radical cystectomy among patients with bladder carcinoma invading muscle. In 1988, the authors began a protocol with methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (M-VAC regimen) and radiotherapy for these patients. Traditionally, age has been considered a determinant factor thereby excluding the older patients from the oncologic protocols that are considered to be more aggressive. The authors analyzed 20 patients (age > 70 years) who were treated during this period with the same protocol as the authors' other patients., METHODS: The study included 20 patients (age range, 70-78 years; median age, 74 years) including 4 patients with T2 disease, 9 with T3 disease, and 7 with T4 disease. All patients had a Karnofsky performance status of > 60. Treatment protocol included cytoreductive transurethral resection, 2 cycles of M-VAC chemotherapy, and radiotherapy (45 grays [Gy] on pelvic volume) with concurrent cisplatin (20 mg/m2 on Days 1-5. Response was determined by cystoscopic evaluation. If there was a complete response, radiotherapy continued until a total dose of 65 Gy; if there was not a complete response, cystectomy was performed., RESULTS: Tumor response after a dose of 45 Gy included 11 complete responses (55%), 5 partial responses (25%), and 4 nonresponses (20%). Overall survival was 75%, 34%, and 27% in the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th years of follow-up, respectively. Cause specific survival was 79%, 54%, and 38%, respectively. Survival for patients with complete response was 100%, 60%, and 48%, respectively. Severe toxicity was uncommon, with the most frequent toxicities being leukopenia and cystitis. No treatment-related death occurred with either treatment protocol., CONCLUSIONS: The age of the individual must not become a strict exclusion criterion for the radical treatment of old patients with invasive bladder carcinoma.",Excluded
1460,"Effect analysis of Gamma knife radiosurgery for cavernous sinus cavernous hemangioma. Objective: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of Gamma knife radiosurgery for the treatment of cavernous sinus cavernous hemangioma. Method(s): From June 2010 to July 2016, 35 consecutive patients with cavernous sinus cavernous hemangioma treated with Gamma knife radiosurgery at the Department of Neurosurgery, West China Hospital, Sichuan University were enrolled retrospective, including 22 females and 13 males. All patients were diagnosed by MRI before procedure. They were confirmed by postoperative histopathology or further verification by MRI. The irradiation dose of Gamma knife around tumors were 11-16 Gy (mean 14.3 +/-1.1 Gy), covered by 45%-50% isodose line and ensured that the exposure dose of the optic cross was less than 8 Gy. In the first year after operation, they were followed up at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, and after that, the clinical efficacy, surgical complications and tumor volume were evaluated once a year. Result(s): Thirty-five patients were followed up for 12-77 months (mean 36 +/-4months). No surgery-related optic nerve injury and new cranial nerve injury occurred in all cases. Symptomatic patients were 28 (80%) and symptomatic improvement rate was 96. 4% (n = 27), among them, the symptoms were improved in 15 cases (53. 6%), and the symptoms disappeared in 12 cases (42. 9%), did not have any change in 1 (3. 6%) case, and no symptom deterioration occurred. The symptom improvement time was 2-7 months after surgery (mean 3.7 +/-0.3 months). Imaging follow-up revealed that in 35patients with cavernous sinus cavernous hemangioma treated by gamma knife radiosurgery, the tumor volume was significantly reduced after treatment compared with that before treatment, and the difference was statistically significant (8.8 +/-0.9 cm3 vs. 32. 6 +/-3. 6 cm3, t = 8. 492, P < 0. 01). The rates of tumor volume change were <=25%, 26%-50%, 51%-75%, and >=75%. There were 3 patients (8.6%), 2 (5.7%), 8 (22.9%), and 22 (62. 9%).respectively. Conclusion(s): Gamma knife radiosurgery is safe and effective in the treatment of cavernous sinus cavernous hemangioma. It can be used as the preferred treatment modality for this disease, but long-term follow-up is needed to observe its long-term efficacy.Copyright © 2018 Society of China University Journals in Natural Sciences.

1135,"Mental Space Travel: Damage to Posterior Parietal Cortex Prevents Egocentric Navigation and Reexperiencing of Remote Spatial Memories. The ability to navigate in a familiar environment depends on both an intact mental representation of allocentric spatial information and the integrity of systems supporting complementary egocentric representations. Although the hippocampus has been implicated in learning new allocentric spatial information, converging evidence suggests that the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) might support egocentric representations. To date, however, few studies have examined long-standing egocentric representations of environments learned long ago. Here we tested 7 patients with focal lesions in PPC and 12 normal controls in remote spatial memory tasks, including 2 tasks reportedly reliant on allocentric representations (distance and proximity judgments) and 2 tasks reportedly reliant on egocentric representations (landmark sequencing and route navigation; see Rosenbaum, Ziegler, Winocur, Grady, & Moscovitch, 2004). Patients were unimpaired in distance and proximity judgments. In contrast, they all failed in route navigation, and left-lesioned patients also showed marginally impaired performance in landmark sequencing. Patients' subjective experience associated with navigation was impoverished and disembodied compared with that of the controls. These results suggest that PPC is crucial for accessing remote spatial memories within an egocentric reference frame that enables both navigation and reexperiencing. Additionally, PPC was found to be necessary to implement specific aspects of allocentric navigation with high demands on spontaneous retrieval. © 2010 American Psychological Association.",Excluded
119,"Narrow band ultraviolet B 311 nm in the treatment of vitiligo: Two right-left comparison studies. Aim: Evaluation of narrow band ultraviolet B (NB UVB 311 nm) in the treatment of vitiligo by two independent studies. The first study compared NB UVB with a well-established therapeutic modality, psoralen ultraviolet A (PUVA), and the second study was conducted to find out whether psoralen might add to its efficacy. Method(s): In the first study, 15 patients were exposed on the left half of their body to UVB 311 nm and then exposed on their right half to UVA after ingestion of psoralen. In the second study, 20 patients were exposed to UVB 311 nm on the left side of the body, followed by ingestion of psoralen and exposure to NB UVB 311 nm 90 min later to the right side of the body. In both studies, while exposing one side, the other was protected by an UV-proof gown. Thus two right-left comparative studies were carried out simultaneously, namely: UVB 311 nm vs. PUVA and UVB 311 nm vs. PUVB 311 nm. Result(s): In the first study, comparison of PUVA and NB UVB 311 nm showed no difference either in the degree of response or in the incidence of complications. In the second study, comparison of PUVB and UVB showed equal clinical improvement on both sides. The cumulative dose needed to achieve the same response on the PUVB side was lower than that on the UVB side, but the difference was not statistically significant. The incidence of phototoxic reactions was significantly higher on the PUVB treated body half. Conclusion(s): NB UVB 311 nm has similar repigmentary effects as PUVA. The addition of psoralen does not increase its efficacy. Copyright © Blackwell Munksgaard 2006.",Excluded
251,"The impact of margin reduction on outcome and toxicity in head and neck cancer patients treated with image-guided volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Background and purpose: In recent decades, outcomes of patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) have improved as a result of implementing several strategies, such as chemoradiation. However, these improvements were achieved at the cost of increased toxicity. One way to reduce radiation-related toxicity is by reducing the margins. Material(s) and Method(s): Between 2013 and 2016, 206 consecutive patients were treated with CTV-PTV margin of 5 mm and subsequently 208 patients with 3 mm margin. This study evaluates the impact of reducing clinical target volume (CTV) to planning target volume (PTV) margin on outcome and toxicity. Result(s): All patients were treated with volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) with daily-image guidance using cone-beam CT (CBCT). Overall acute grade 3 toxicity was significantly lower in 3 mm-group, compared to 5 mm-group (53.8% vs. 65%, respectively, p = 0.032). The same was true for acute grade 3 mucositis (30.8% vs. 42.2%, p = 0.008) and for acute grade 3 dysphagia (feeding tube-dependence) (22.1% vs. 33.5%, p = 0.026). The incidence of ongoing feeding tube-dependence after 3 months of radiotherapy was 11.1% and 20.4%, respectively (p = 0.012). The 2-year incidence of late grade >=2 xerostomia was 15.8% and 19.4% (p = 0.8). The 2-year loco-regional control rates of patients treated in 3 mm and 5 mm-groups were 79.9% and 79.2% (p = 1.0). The figures for disease-free survival were 71.5% and 72.7 (p = 0.6) and for overall survival were 75.2% and 75.1% (p = 0.9).

3425,"The clinical role of X-ray computed tomography to predict the clinical efficiency of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. Aim: To evaluate the clinical efficiency of computed tomography for diagnostics of patients with urolithiasis and the choice of treatment strategy. Material(s) and Method(s): The study was carried out at the Urological Clinic of I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University and included 1044 patients with urinary stones. The ultimate goal of this study was to predict the clinical efficiency of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy using a combination of computed tomography and densitometry. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy was performed on ""Siemens Lithostar Plus,"" ""Siemens Modularis Uro,"" and ""Dornier Gemini"" lithotripters. Statistical analysis of clinical data included evaluation of individual sampling groups and calculation of weighted arithmetic mean (M). Result(s): The efficiency of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy has been determined primarily using X-ray analysis of the concrement outlines and the structure (homogeneous or heterogeneous) of its central zone. However, in terms of efficiency and repetition rate (the number of fragmentation procedures required for complete clearance) of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, the mean density of the concrement along the whole length of its three-dimensional structure (expressed in Hounsfield units) appeared to be the most reliable and informative predictive index in this study. Conclusion(s): The combination of computed tomography with densitometry in the treatment of patients with urolithiasis allows one (1) to determine the exact localization, size, X-ray structure, and structural density of urinary stones and (2) to predict, on the basis of densitometric data histograms, the clinical efficiency and repetition rate of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy with due regard to the X-ray structure of peripheral and central zones, and mean density (in Hounsfield units) of urinary concrements.Copyright © The Author(s) 2018.",Excluded

1652,"The effects of exposure to microgravity and reconditioning of the lumbar multifidus and anterolateral abdominal muscles: implications for people with LBP. BACKGROUND CONTEXT: One of the primary changes in the neuromuscular system in response to microgravity is skeletal muscle atrophy, which occurs especially in muscles that maintain posture while being upright on Earth. Reduced size of paraspinal and abdominal muscles has been documented after spaceflight. Exercises are undertaken on the International Space Station (ISS) during and following space flight to remediate these effects. Understanding the adaptations which occur in trunk muscles in response to microgravity could inform the development of specific countermeasures, which may have applications for people with conditions on Earth such as low back pain (LBP). PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to examine the changes in muscle size and function of the lumbar multifidus (MF) and anterolateral abdominal muscles (1) in response to exposure to 6 months of microgravity on the ISS and (2) in response to a 15-day reconditioning program on Earth. DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal series. PATIENT SAMPLE: Data were collected from five astronauts who undertook seven long-duration missions on the ISS. OUTCOME MEASURES: For the MF muscle, measures included cross-sectional area (CSA) and linear measures to assess voluntary isometric contractions at vertebral levels L2 to L5. For the abdominal muscles, the thickness of the transversus abdominis (TrA), obliquus internus abdominis (IO) and obliquus externus abdominis (EO) muscles at rest and on contraction were measured. METHOD(S): Ultrasound imaging of trunk muscles was conducted at four timepoints (preflight, postflight, mid-reconditioning, and post reconditioning). Data were analyzed using multilevel linear models to estimate the change in muscle parameters of interest across three time periods. RESULT(S): Beta-coefficients (estimates of the expected change in the measure across the specified time period, adjusted for the baseline measurement) indicated that the CSA of the MF muscles decreased significantly at all lumbar vertebral levels (except L2) in response to exposure to microgravity (L3=12.6%; L4=6.1%, L5=10.3%; p<.001), and CSAs at L3-L5 vertebral levels increased in the reconditioning period (p<.001). The thickness of the TrA decreased by 34.1% (p<.017), IO decreased by 15.4% (p=.04), and the combination of anterolateral abdominal muscles decreased by 16.2% (p<.001) between pre- and postflight assessment and increased (TrA<0.008; combined p=.035) during the postreconditioning period. Results showed decreased contraction of the MF muscles at the L2 (from 12.8% to 3.4%; p=.007) and L3 (from 12.2% to 5%; p=.032) vertebral levels following exposure to microgravity which increased (L2, p=.046) after the postreconditioning period. Comparison with preflight measures indicated that there were no residual changes in muscle size and function after the postreconditioning period, apart from CSA of MF at L2, which remained 15.3% larger than preflight values (p<.001). CONCLUSION(S): In-flight exercise countermeasures mitigated, but did not completely prevent, changes in the size and function of the lumbar MF and anterolateral abdominal muscles. Many of the observed changes in size and control of the MF and abdominal muscles that occurred in response to prolonged exposure to microgravity paralleled those seen in people with LBP or exposed to prolonged bed rest on Earth. Daily individualized postflight reconditioning, which included both motor control training and weight-bearing exercises with an emphasis on retraining strength and endurance to re-establish normal postural alignment with respect to gravity, restored the decreased size and control of the MF (at the L3-L5 vertebral levels) and anterolateral abdominal muscles. Drawing parallels between changes which occur to the neuromuscular system in microgravity and which exercises best recover muscle size and function could help health professionals tailor improved interventions for terrestrial populations. Results suggested that the principles underpinning the exercises developed for astronauts following prolonged exposure to microg avity (emphasizing strength and endurance training to re-establish normal postural alignment and distribution of load with respect to gravity) can also be applied for people with chronic LBP, as the MF and anterolateral abdominal muscles were affected in similar ways in both populations. The results may also inform the development of new astronaut countermeasures targeting the MF and abdominal muscles.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1010,"Atypical radiation toxicity in patients with classical Kaposi's sarcoma. The classical (non-AIDS-related) form of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) typically affects older patients of Eastern European or Mediterranean ethnic background. Although radiotherapy is a standard part of the treatment armamentarium for KS patients, a high incidence of radiotoxicity has been reported in epidemic AIDS-related cases. In order to determine whether this radiotoxicity is observed only in patients with the epidemic form of the disease, we have conducted a retrospective chart review of 30 patients with classical KS treated with radiation for whom follow-up information was available. Seven out of 30 (23%) were found to have unexpectedly high levels of radiotoxicity after tumor doses of 22-42 Gy. This toxicity consisted either of significantly increased edema or chronic skin breakdown and severe radiodermatitis, in some cases requiring multiple surgical corrective procedures. We suggest that the abnormal lymphaticovenous development and chronic lymphokine stimulation associated with KS of both epidemic and classical forms may be responsible in part for the observed radiotoxicity.",Excluded

OBJECTIVES: To assess the feasibility of low-dose time-resolved imaging of contrast kinetics (TRICKS) magnetic resonance (MR) angiography of the pedal vasculature at 3.0 Tesla (T) using a head coil., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven healthy volunteers were imaged using TRICKS MR angiography at 3.0 T with both feet positioned in a head coil. A dose of 7 mL was used for each of 3 acquisitions: images were obtained of each foot in the sagittal plane, and then both feet were imaged simultaneously in the transverse plane. The following parameters were used for acquisition: (TR/TE 4.7 milliseconds/ 1.3 milliseconds, field of view = 28 cm, Flip angle = 30 degrees, 384 x 256 matrix, section thickness = 1.6 mm, Bandwidth = 19.23). The dorsalis pedis, plantar arch, distal posterior tibial, lateral tarsal, and medial plantar arteries were graded for visualization, artifact, and overall image quality on a 4-point scale (1 = worst; 4 = best)., RESULTS: Superior visualization trended towards separate sagittal acquisitions when compared with that of bilateral transverse acquisitions for most of the individual vessels of the foot. Overall, separate sagittal acquisitions (average score = 2.9) were superior to bilateral transverse acquisitions (average score = 2.6). The average image quality score reflecting the amount of artifact was 2.6 for studies obtained using bilateral transverse acquisitions and 3.1 for studies obtained using separate sagittal acquisitions., CONCLUSION: Low-dose gadolinium multi-injection TRICKS and bolus-chase MR angiography at 3.0 T provides an effective and easily reproducible technique for imaging of the pedal vasculature in volunteers and has great potential for clinical application.",Excluded

After a long experience with the Dynesys in treatment of degenerative instability of lumbar spine authors report their experience and preliminary results of a new hybrid system of dynamic stabilization and fusion which has two solutions with a single online system, the Dynesys system to Optima (DTO Zimmer Spine). Material(s) and Method(s): At the Department of Orthopedic A.S.U.S. Giovanni Battista Molinette of Turin since 3-2008 to 12-2009 17 patients with lumbosacral degenerative pathology were surgically treated, 7 males, 10 females, mean age 51 (35-69). All complained of low back pain (VAS 8) with radicular pain in 9 (VAS 7) and claudicazio in 8, ODI 53 %, in 9 patients imaging showed instability in adjacent segments of lumbar stenosis, in 6 junctional dynamic stenosis results of instrumented L4-L5 fusion, one case with 2degree grade L5-S1 isthmic spondylolisthesis had degenerative changes at higher levels, one case of pseudoarthrosis in fusion of L5-S1 isthmic spondylolisthesis had junctional instability. Dynamic synthesis has always included a single proximal segment of the instrumented fusion area which extended distally in S1 in 15 cases, in L5 in 2 cases (L5 sacralised). In 11 cases direct decompression was performed within the stenosis area (3 revisions of previous decompression), in 6 cases with functional stenosis indirect decompression was performed by disc-ligament tension with Dynesys. All patients have worn a lumbar corset for 2 months. One case needed revision surgery for a misplaced screw after 7 days. Result(s): For an average f. up 32 months (43-12), back pain almost improved in all patients a VAS 3 (2-6), 12 % ODI. The neurological impairment resolved in all patients (VAS 1). Patients with spondylolisthesis concerned of pain in the iliac crest donor side and higher back pain for insufficient proximal extension of the dynamic synthesis. Good fusion was observed on the X-ray in all cases of the instrumented area, we have not seen any hardware failure nor pedicular screws mobilisation or periprosthetic osteolysis and junctional disorders. Conclusion(s): The experience is short and requires a longer f. up but good clinical results encourage the application of the system in selected cases, often in young adults. This hybrid synthesis does not lengthen the operative time for ease assembly and provides the benefits of limiting the extent of fusion which is coupled to a dynamic system of proven efficacy on adjacent levels reducing the probability of occurrence of future junctional diseases.",Excluded

2286,"Location of Disease on Imaging may Predict Radiation Exposure During Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is performed for various diseases. The aim of this study is to evaluate the difference of dose-area product (DAP) during the ERCP procedures according to location of the lesion. We performed a retrospective study of consecutive 217 therapeutic ERCP examinations performed between November 2014 and April 2015 at a tertiary care center. ERCP procedures divided into two groups according to location of the lesion identified on imaging: lesions in the common hepatic duct (CHD) or the common bile duct (CBD) and lesions in the hepatic hilum or the intrahepatic duct (IHD). The mean DAP of the hilum-IHD group (48.7 Gy cm2) was significantly higher than that of the CBD-CHD group (34.9 Gy cm2) (P = 0.003). Radiation exposure during ERCP was significantly different according to location of bile duct lesion. Copyright © The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

898,"BCL11b gene is targeted by structural and numerical chromosomal aberrations in mature T-cell lymphoma. Background: BCL11b is a transcriptional repressor required for the differentiation and survival of alpha/beta T lymphocytes and the development of the corticospinal motor neurons in the central nervous system. It is likely involved in cancergenesis either as a tumorsuppressor gene via inactivating mutations or deletions in murine irradiation induced lymphomas or as a transcriptional deregulator via recurrent chromosomal translocation in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In this study we present data on BCL11b gene configuration and protein expression in series of mature T-cell lymphoma. Design(s): 265 mature T-cell lymphoma, namely 119 peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PTCL, NOS), 54 angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, 44 anaplastic large cell lymphoma, 13 extranodal T/NK lymphoma, 2 hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma, 6 T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia and 27 mycosis fungoides samples were selected from the files of the Institute of Pathology, Wuerzburg, Germany. All samples were classified according to the WHO classification criteria and studied for presence of genetic aberrations affecting BCL11b gene by newly designed interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay in tissue microarray formate. BCL11b protein expression was tested by immunohistochemistry using rat monoclonal antibody 25B6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc). Result(s): Chromosomal breakpoint in the BCL11b genomic region was detected in 3(1%) out of 265 mature T-cell lymphoma samples. All cases were classified as PTCL, NOS and presented with lymphadenopathy and cutaneous infiltration in 2 male and 1 female adult patients, respectively. One of the samples carried concurrent breakpoint in TCR alpha/sigma, suggesting a presence of an inv(14)(q11;q32), affecting the TCR alpha/sigma and BCL11b loci. Genomic gain in BCL11b/14q32 was recognized in 84 (32%) samples, most frequently affecting PTCL, NOS. Varying level of BCL11b protein expression was observed in 67% of the samples, showing no correlation to the presence or absence of an underlying genetic aberration. Conclusion(s): Our study identified BCL11b gene as a novel recurrent, though infrequent translocation partner in PTCL, NOS, affected also by numerical genetic aberrations. BCL11b protein is commonly expressed in mature T-cell lymphoma however it's biological and clinical significance remains unclear and merit further studies.",Excluded

209,"Abdominal aortic calcification on a plain X-ray and the relation with significant coronary artery disease in asymptomatic chronic dialysis patients. Background: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is common in asymptomatic chronic dialysis patients and plays an important role in their poor survival. Early identification of these high-risk patients could improve treatment and reduce mortality. Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) has previously been associated with CAD in autopsy studies. Since the AAC can be quantified easily using a lateral lumbar X-ray we hypothesized that the extent of AAC as assessed on a lateral lumbar X-ray might be predictive of the presence of significant CAD in dialysis patients. Method(s): All patients currently enrolled in the ICD2 trial without a history of CABG or a PCI with stent implantation were included in this study. All patients underwent CT-angiography (CTA) and a lateral X-ray of the abdomen. AAC on X-ray was quantified using a previously validated scoring system whereupon the association between AAC and the presence of significant CAD was assessed. Result(s): A total of 90 patients were included in this study (71% male, 67 +/- 7 years old). Forty-six patients were found to have significant CAD. AAC-score was significantly higher in patients with CAD (10.1 +/- 4.9 vs 6.3 +/- 4.6 (p < 0.05). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that AAC score is an independent predictor for the presence of CAD with a 1,2 fold higher risk per point increase (p < 0.01). The AAC score has a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 57% for the presence of significant CAD. Conclusion(s): This study shows that abdominal aortic calcification as assessed on a lateral lumbar X-ray is predictive for the presence of significant coronary artery disease in asymptomatic dialysis patients. This simple, non-invasive and cheap screening method could contribute to early identification of patients eligible for further screening of CAD.Copyright © 2017 The Author(s).",Excluded

Background: Upfront tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) has proved effective for selective advanced lung cancer patients in Taiwan. We hypothesized that early integration of radiotherapy during TKI treatment would decrease the chance of drug resistance and prolong progression-free survival (PFS). Method(s): This study included 25 patients with stage IIIb or IV non-squamous cell, non-small cell lung cancer (NSqCLC) who responded to upfront TKI treatment. Multi-target radiotherapy was administered during the TKI treatment course. Tomotherapy comprising a hypofractionated schedule with a dose of 40-50. Gy in 16-20 fractions was used for individual metastatic lesions. Result(s): The patients' median follow-up duration was 30 months (range, 9-62 months). Of the 23 patients who had stage IV disease, 9 had oligometastases (<=5 gross target volumes) and 14 were in the more advanced stages of the disease. Twelve patients received more than 1 cycle of radiotherapy (median, 3; range, 2-6) with TKI being the only systemic treatment before they were salvaged with chemotherapy. The overall response rate after radiotherapy was 84.0%, and the median PFS was 16 months. The 3-year overall survival rate was 62.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 39.1-85.8%). Toxicities were generally tolerated but it is necessary to prevent radiation-induced pneumonitis. Conclusion(s): We showed that combined first-line TKI therapy and early multi-target radiotherapy are very effective in selected patients that respond to TKI, when the status of mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are not known before the treatment. Our data may aid expansion of the effectiveness of TKI treatment through radiotherapy in Asian patients with stage IV NSqCLC. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Excluded
2127,"Treatment approach and survival from glioblastoma: Results from a population-based retrospective cohort study from Western Norway. Objectives To evaluate treatment and survival from glioblastoma in a real-world setting. Design and settings A population-based retrospective cohort study from Western Norway. Participants 363 patients aged 18 years or older diagnosed with glioblastoma between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2014. Primary and secondary outcome measures Overall survival and survival rates determined by Kaplan-Meier method, groups compared by log-rank test. Associations between clinical characteristics and treatment approach assessed by logistic regression. Associations between treatment approach and outcome analysed by Cox regression. Results Median overall survival was 10.2 months (95% CI 9.1 to 11.3). Resection was performed in 221 patients (60.9%), and was inversely associated with age over 70 years, higher comorbidity burden, deep-seated tumour localisation and multifocality. Median survival was 13.7 months (95% CI 12.1 to 15.4) in patients undergoing tumour resection, 8.3 months (95% CI 6.6 to 9.9) in patients undergoing biopsy and 4.5 months (95% CI 4.0 to 5.1) in patients where no surgical intervention was performed. Chemoradiotherapy according to the Stupp protocol was given to 157 patients (43%). Age over 70 years, higher comorbidity burden and cognitive impairment were associated with less intensive chemoradiotherapy. Median survival was 16.3 months (95% CI 14.1 to 18.5), 7.9 months (95% CI 6.7 to 9.0) and 2.0 months (95% CI 0.9 to 3.2) in patients treated according to the Stupp protocol, with less intensive chemoradiotherapy and with best supportive care, respectively. Surgical resection (HR 0.61 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.79)) and chemoradiotherapy according to the Stupp protocol (HR 0.09 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.15)) were strongly associated with favourable overall survival, when adjusted for clinical variables. Conclusions In a real-world setting, less than half of the patients received full-course chemoradiotherapy, with a median survival comparable to results from clinical trials. Survival was considerably worse in patients receiving less intensive treatment. Our results point out a substantial risk of undertreating glioblastoma, especially in elderly patients.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

2948,"Oxygen consumption during walking and running under fractional weight bearing conditions. INTRODUCTION: Knowledge of changes in oxygen consumption during reduced body weight loading at different speed levels is important, in particular in astronauts who may lose aerobic fitness as well as in clinical patients (e.g., in obese individuals at walking speeds or in injured athletes at running speeds). Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze oxygen consumption during unloaded walking and running., METHODS: Oxygen consumption (Vo2), heart rate (HR), and Borg rating of perceived exertion (Borg RPE) were quantified in 10 healthy young female and male volunteers at 3 body weight (BW) conditions (100%, 66%, and 33% BW) and 4 treadmill speeds (slow walking at 0.4 m x s(-1), comfortable walking at 1.3 m x s(-1), slow running at 2.2 m x s(-1), and moderately fast running at 3.1 m x s(-1)). Unloading was achieved in a waist-high chamber with increased pressure called Lower Body Positive Pressure (LBPP)., RESULTS: All parameters (Vo2, HR, and Borg RPE) decreased during unloaded walking and running. Interestingly, our findings confirm a specific linear relationship between each parameter and treadmill speed for each BW condition with smaller slope angles at higher levels of unloading (e.g., for Vo2, the slope angle decreased from 11.9 at 100% BW to 4.4 at 33% BW)., DISCUSSION: Oxygen consumption, heart rate, and Borg rating of perceived exertion are reduced during unloaded exercise with a relatively greater decline at higher treadmill speeds. That is, the higher the treadmill's speed in unloaded conditions, the relatively easier"" it is to exercise.""",Excluded

The clinical usefulness of L-methyl-11C-methionine positron emission tomography (11C-MET PET) and thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography (201T1 SPECT) for distinguishing glioma recurrence from radiation-induced changes was evaluated. Ten patients with lesions highly suggestive of recurrent glioma on magnetic resonance imaging underwent 11C-MET PET and 201T1 SPECT studies. Two patients were examined twice, so a total of 12 studies were performed. The clinical diagnoses were five recurrent gliomas and seven radiation necrosis. The five recurrent gliomas appeared as increased uptakes on both 11C-MET PET and 201T1 SPECT scans. Four of the seven radiation necrosis lesions also appeared as increased uptakes on the 201T1 SPECT scans. In contrast, only one radiation necrosis appeared as increased uptake on the 11C-MET PET scans. There was no significant difference in 201T1 SPECT indices between radiation necrosis and tumor recurrence, but the ratio of the differential absorption ratio of tumor tissue to that of the homologous contralateral gray matter in PET of recurrent glioma was significantly higher than that of radiation necrosis. 11C-MET PET is superior to 201T1 SPECT for the differentiation of tumor recurrence from radiation necrosis and delineation of the extent of the tumor.",Excluded
1065,"Difference in subacute blood pressure between office and ambulatory values predicts functional outcome after ischemic stroke. Objective: Acute hypertensive response after ischemic stroke is a self-limiting phenomenon and is associated with functional outcome. Excessive BP fluctuations may reflect increased sympathetic nervous system activity, which can impair the brain repair after stroke. Whether individual BP variation, based on difference between single office and full ambulatory 24-hour BP measurements, have a distinct long-term significance for stroke outcome remains unknown. We tested the hypothesis that subacute BP difference (BPD) [(office BP - mean daytime BP)/ mean daytime BP] is independently associated with stroke outcome. Design and method: In a prospective study, we included 132 patients (age 62.9 +/- 12.9, NIH Stroke Scale score (NIHSS) 7.0+/- 6.2) with acute ischemic stroke. Office (Omron) and Ambulatory BP monitoring (SpaceLabs) was performed on day 7 after stroke onset. The daytime period was defined as the interval from 6 AM to 10 PM. The relationship between these measures (adjusted for age, sex, admission neurological deficit as assessed by NIHSS score, baseline glucose level, and HR) and the 90-day poor outcome (death or dependency, modified Rankin Scale > 2) was studied using a multivariate logistic regression. Result(s): At 3 months, 28 (21.2%) patients had moderate to severe functional impairment after stroke. BPD given as a percentage was significantly higher in patients with poor outcome (14.2 +/-20.5 vs 2.0 +/-13.5; p < 0.001). In univariate analysis, high BPD (OR = 1.56; 95% CI, 1.19-2.05; p = 0.001) was significantly associated with poor stroke outcome. Age, sex, baseline neurological deficit and glucose level, thrombolytic treatment and subacute systolic BP and heart rate measured at day 7 also predicted stroke functional outcome. In multivariate analysis, the predictive value of BPD remained significant (OR = 2.01; 95% CI, 1.15-3.53; p = 0.01) after adjustment for covariates. Office BP also slightly predicted stroke outcome (OR = 1.02; 95% CI, 1.00-1.04; p = 0.04). By contrast, ambulatory BP levels had no significant predictive value after adjustment. Conclusion(s): Difference in BP between subacute office and ambulatory values is an independent predictor of functional outcome in patients after ischemic stroke. Both office and ambulatory BP reading are needed to evaluate stroke prognosis accurately. (Table Presented).",Excluded
1601,"18F-ICMT-11, a caspase-3-specific PET tracer for apoptosis: biodistribution and radiation dosimetry. UNLABELLED: Effective anticancer therapy induces tumor cell death through apoptosis. Noninvasive monitoring of apoptosis during therapy may provide predictive outcome information and help tailor treatment.

We report the safety, biodistribution, and internal radiation dosimetry profiles of (18)F-ICMT-11 in 8 healthy human volunteers., METHODS: (18)F-ICMT-11 was intravenously administered as a bolus injection (mean +/- SD, 159 +/- 2.75 MBq; range, 154-161 MBq) to 8 healthy volunteers (4 men, 4 women). Whole-body (vertex to mid thigh) PET/CT scans were acquired at 6 time points, up to 4 h after tracer injection. Serial whole blood, plasma, and urine samples were collected for radioactivity measurement and radiotracer stability. In vivo (18)F activities were determined from quantitative analysis of the images, and time-activity curves were generated. The total numbers of disintegrations in each organ normalized to injected activity (residence times) were calculated as the area under the curve of the time-activity curve, normalized to injected activities and standard values of organ volumes. Dosimetry calculations were then performed using OLINDA/EXM 1.1., RESULTS: Injection of (18)F-ICMT-11 was well tolerated in all subjects, with no serious tracer-related adverse events reported. The mean effective dose averaged over both men and women was estimated to be 0.025 +/- 0.004 mSv/MBq (men, 0.022 +/- 0.004 mSv/MBq; women, 0.027 +/- 0.004 mSv/MBq). The 5 organs receiving the highest absorbed dose (mGy/MBq), averaged over both men and women, were the gallbladder wall (0.59 +/- 0.44), small intestine (0.12 +/- 0.05), upper large intestinal wall (0.08 +/- 0.07), urinary bladder wall (0.08 +/- 0.02), and liver (0.07 +/- 0.01). Elimination was both renal and via the hepatobiliary system., CONCLUSION: (18)F-ICMT-11 is a safe PET tracer with a dosimetry profile comparable to other common (18)F PET tracers. These data support the further development of (18)F-ICMT-11 for clinical imaging of apoptosis.",Excluded
1571,"Dependency of the interaural phase difference sensitivities of inferior collicular neurons on a preceding tone and its implications in neural population coding. This study examined the sensitivities of the neuronal responses in the inferior colliculus (IC) to the interaural phase difference (IPD) of a preceding tone, and explored its implications in the neural-population representation of the IPD. Single-unit responses were recorded from the IC of anesthetized gerbils. The stimulus was a dichotic tone sequence with a common frequency (typically the unit's best frequency) and level (10-20 dB relative to the threshold), consisting of a conditioner (200 ms) followed by a probe (50 ms) with a silent gap (5-100 ms) between them. The IPDs of the 2 tones were varied independently. The presence of a conditioner generally suppressed the probe-driven responses; the effect size increased as the conditioner IPD approached the unit's most responsive IPD. The units' preferred IPDs were relatively invariant with the conditioner IPD. Two types of models were used to evaluate the effects of a conditioner on the IPD representation at the level of IC neural population. One was a version of the population-vector model. The other was the hemispheric-channel model, which assumed that the stimulus IPD is represented by the activities of 2 broadly tuned hemispheric channels. Both models predicted that, in the presence of a conditioner, the IPD representation would shift in a direction away from the conditioner IPD. This appears to emphasize the difference between the conditioner and the probe IPDs. The results indicate that in the IC, neural processes for IPD adapt to the stimulus history to enhance the representational contrast between successive sounds.",Excluded
30,"Self-taught axillary vein access without venography for pacemaker implantation: prospective randomized comparison with the cephalic vein access. Aim: Axillary vein access for pacemaker implantation is uncommon in many centres because of the lack of training in this technique. We assessed whether the introduction of the axillary vein technique was safe and efficient as compared with cephalic vein access, in a centre where no operators had any previous experience in axillary vein puncture., Methods and results: Patients undergoing pacemaker implantation were randomized to axillary or cephalic vein access. All three operators had no experience nor training in axillary vein puncture, and self-learned the technique by reading a published review. Axillary vein puncture was fluoroscopy-guided without contrast venography. Cephalic access was performed by dissection of delto-pectoral groove. Venous access success, venous access duration (from skin incision to guidewire or lead in superior vena cava), procedure duration, X-ray exposure, and peri-procedural (1 month) complications were recorded. results We randomized 74 consecutive patients to axillary (n = 37) or cephalic vein access (n = 37). Axillary vein was successfully accessed in 30/37 (81.1%) patients vs. 28/37 (75.7%) of cephalic veins (P = 0.57). Venous access time was shorter in axillary group than in cephalic group [5.7 (4.4-8.3) vs. 12.2 (10.5-14.8) min, P < 0.001], as well as procedure duration [34.8 (30.6-38.4) vs. 42.0 (39.1-46.6) min, P = 0.043]. X-ray exposure and peri-procedural overall complications were comparable in both groups. Axillary puncture was safe and faster than cephalic access even for the five first procedures performed by each operator., Conclusion: Self-taught axillary vein puncture for pacemaker implantation seems immediately safe and faster than cephalic vein access, when performed by electrophysiologists trained to pacemaker implantation but not to axillary vein puncture.

2792,"Long-term in vitro and in vivo effects of gamma-irradiated BCG on innate and adaptive immunity. BCG vaccination is associated with a reduced mortality from nonmycobacterial infections. This is likely to be mediated by a combination of innate-immune memory (trained immunity"") and heterologous effects on adaptive immunity. As such, BCG could be used to boost host immunity but not in immunocompromised hosts, as it is a live, attenuated vaccine. Therefore, we assessed whether killed gammaBCG has similar potentiating effects. In an in vitro model of trained immunity, human monocytes were incubated with gammaBCG for 24 h and restimulated after 6 d. Cytokine production and the role of pattern recognition receptors and histone methylation markers were assessed. The in vivo effects of gammaBCG vaccination were studied in a proof-of-principle trial in 15 healthy volunteers. gammaBCG induced trained immunity in vitro via the NOD2 receptor pathway and up-regulation of H3K4me3 histone methylation. However, these effects were less strong than those induced by live BCG. gammaBCG vaccination in volunteers had only minimal effects on innate immunity, whereas a significant increase in heterologous Th1/Th17 immunity was observed. Our results indicate that gammaBCG induces long-term training of innate immunity in vitro. In vivo, gammaBCG induces mainly heterologous effects on the adaptive-immune system, whereas effects on innate cytokine production are limited. Copyright © Society for Leukocyte Biology.""",Excluded

Purpose: The diagnoses of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and depression are often found to coexist. The impact of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) on treatment-related toxicity and outcome in patients with GBM is unclear. Methods and Materials: We retrospectively reviewed 160 patients with GBM who received treatment at our institution between 1999 and 2008. Those taking an SSRI during treatment for GBM were identified and toxicities were assessed. Result(s): Median survival for the entire cohort was 1.05 years. A total of 35 patients (21.8%) took an SSRI during initial treatment for GBM. There was no statistical difference in the rate of >=grade 3 toxicity in patients taking an SSRI when compared with those who were not (11.4% vs. 13.6%, respectively; P = 1.00). Two-year survival in the cohort of patients taking an SSRI was 32% versus 17% in those who were not (P = 0.18). After making adjustment for age, recursive partitioning analysis class, and extent of surgery, absence of an SSRI during treatment was associated with a hazard risk of 1.5 (95% confidence interval = 1.00-2.42; P = 0.05).

Here we show that the frequency of de novo copy number variants (CNVs) and insertion/deletion events (indels) is significantly elevated in offspring of exposed fathers. We also show that the spectrum of induced de novo single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) is strikingly different; with clustered mutations being significantly over-represented in the offspring of irradiated males.

Background: Extrapleural pneumonectomy for malignant pleural mesothelioma is considered an aggressive procedure, but symptomatic and quality of life changes are unknown. Method(s): Between 1997 and 2004, 16 consecutive patients underwent extrapleural pneumonectomy for mesothelioma followed by chemoradiotherapy. Tumor-related symptoms and quality of life (Short-Form-36 and St. George's questionnaires) were assessed pre, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. Result(s): Thirty-day postoperative major morbidity was 31% with no mortality. At 3 months postoperatively, dyspnea improved in 10 patients (62%), pain in 12 (75%), cough in 10 (62%), fever in 11 (68%), Karnofsky-index in 10 (62%), Short-Form-36 physical-component-summary in 8, mental-component- summary in 5 and total St. George score in 8 (50%). At 1 year 10 (62%) patients were alive and majority of improved parameters were still stable. Thereafter they usually started to decline. Survival was influenced by nonepithelial histology (P < 0.01) and N2-disease (P < 0.01), which showed to be the only prognosticator at Cox regression (P < 0.0001, Odd ratio 5.4). Among symptomatic variables, a 3-month postoperative Short-Form-36 physical-component-summary above the median value correlated significantly with a better prognosis (P < 0.02).

The Mc Nemar test showed no difference between the detection rates of MR and CT, MR and DSA, MR and US, and Lipiodol-CT and DSA; however, the differences between the detection rates of MR and Lipiodol-CT and CT and Lipiodol-CT were statistically significant (p less than or equal to 0.05). The difference in sensitivity between the detection rates of Lipiodol-CT and US was just above the level considered significant (P less than or equal to 0.065). On T1- and T2-weighted spin echo images 83% of small HCC were hyperintense relative to the surrounding liver parenchyma. Pseudocapsule was observed in 58% of lesions on T1-weighted images in particular. We believe that US is still the best diagnostic technique for the screening of HCC. We prefer MR to CT as a second level examination to support US in noninvasive diagnosis of small HCC, since MR gives the same or slightly better results than CT without the need of ionizing radiation and large amounts of iodized contrast medium. In our opinion, more invasive examinations, such as DSA and Lipiodol-CT, cannot be avoided in cases where an exact knowledge of the number of lesions is essential for the choice of therapy.",Excluded
874,Calcium metabolism evaluated by 47Ca kinetics. Methodologic aspects with optimization of a whole-body counter. Optimization of a four-crystal stretcher geometry whole-body (WB) counter was performed. The measured geometric characteristic did not differ significantly from the theoretically calculated characteristic (p greater than 0.05). The linearity of the WB counter was high in the range 3.7 kBq to 3.7 MBq. Longtime variability of local background was CV = 3.7 per cent. In vivo sensitivity was calculated to 18 cpm/kBq and the detection limit to about 5 kBq. The reproducibility was estimated to 0.7 per cent. The WB counter was used in 47Ca turnover and calcium balance studies of 15 normal individuals. The data were analysed according to a modification of the expanding calcium pool model using an improved Bauer-Carlsson-Lindquist formulation. Variability and method errors of main parameters for calcium metabolism were evaluated.,Excluded
3423,"Efficacy of topical PUVA soaks for palmoplantar dermatoses: an audit. BACKGROUND: With a lack of evidence base for individual topical PUVA protocols, treatment is presently based on the consensus of current practice. This audit was designed to investigate the effectiveness of topical PUVA for palmoplantar dermatoses., METHODS: Phototherapy notes were reviewed on all patients who received hand and/or foot PUVA 2002-2007 in the Northern Health and Social Care Trust (NHSCT), Northern Ireland., RESULTS: Thirty patients met the inclusion criteria for the study. The mean number of treatments, maximum single UVA dose, and cumulative dose, were 18.4, 4.2 J/cm2, and 48.3 J/cm2, respectively. A positive response to treatment occurred in 51.3% of patients, which fell short of the 70% standard set. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, number of treatments (P=0.04) and maximum single UVA dose (P=0.03) were the only variables associated with positive treatment outcome. The response was not influenced significantly by skin type, concurrent topical treatments, or cumulative UVA dose. Limitations to the study: Small patient numbers may have prevented the statistical significance of individual variables., CONCLUSIONS: UV dose increments should be clearly defined to avoid excess caution at the expense of an adequate patient response, and a minimum of 20 treatments administered to all patients, if tolerated.",Excluded

1646,"The usefulness of radiation therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma. BACKGROUND/AIMS: The usefulness of radiation therapy (RT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still controversial. To clarify whether RT has its role in the management of HCC as a single modality or in combination with other modalities, we analyzed the clinical features of the patients treated with RT retrospectively. METHODOLOGY: Twenty-two patients who underwent RT for intrahepatic lesions with total dose ranging from 58 to 68 Gy were studied. Regression rate for 21 of the irradiated lesions was calculated using the computed tomographic scans. RESULTS. After the size of the irradiated intrahepatic tumor initially decreased, it remained unchanged for a long period. Tumor size at the latest follow-up never exceeded pre-RT tumor size except in one patient who was treated by RT only. In 3 of 20 cancer deaths, the irradiated tumors were the direct cause of death. CONCLUSION(S): Local RT for HCC at potentially curative dose can be performed safely in patients with preserved liver function even if they have already been treated with other therapies. Radiation therapy has a role in strengthening the therapeutic efficacy when combined with other therapy.",Excluded
441,"Incident air kerma to absorbed organ dose conversion factors for breast and lung in PA thorax radiography: The effect of patient thickness and radiation quality. Purpose Converting the measurable quantities to patient organ doses in projection radiography is usually based on a standard-sized patient model and a specific radiation quality, which are likely to differ from the real situation. Large inaccuracies can therefore be obtained in organ doses, because organ doses are dependent on the exposure parameters, exposure geometry and patient anatomy. In this study, the effect of radiation quality and patient thickness on the organ dose conversion factors were determined. Methods In this study, the posterior-anterior projection radiograph of the thorax was selected in order to determine the effect of radiation quality (tube voltages of 70-130 kV and total filtrations of 3 mmAl to 4 mmAl + 0.2 mmCu) and patient thickness (anterior-posterior thicknesses of 19.4-30.8 cm) on the breast and lung dose conversion factors. For this purpose, Monte Carlo simulation programs ImpactMC and PCXMC were used with computed tomography examination data of adult male and female patients and mathematical hermaphrodite phantoms, respectively. Results Compared to the reference beam quality and patient thickness, the relative variation range in organ dose conversion factors was up to 74% for different radiation qualities and 122% for different patient thicknesses. Conclusions Conversion factors should only be used with comprehensive understanding of the exposure conditions, considering the exposure parameters, exposure geometry and patient anatomy they are valid for. This study demonstrates that patient thickness-specific and radiation quality-specific conversion factors are needed in projection radiography.Copyright © 2016 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica",Excluded
259,"320-Row Multidetector CT Angiography in the Detection of Critical Cerebrovascular Anomalies. Background: The acquisition of a new 320-row multidetector computed tomography angiography (CTA) scanner at the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital has provided higher quality imaging with less radiation exposure and shorter time of acquisition. However, its reliability has not been fully proven in critical vascular lesions when it comes to replacing a more invasive examination such as cerebral angiography. We wished to validate the accuracy of this equipment to investigate four common indications for patients to undergo conventional digital subtraction angiography: subarachnoid hemorrhage, vasospasm, unusual intracerebral hemorrhage, and unruptured aneurysm. Method(s): Radiological reports and relevant imaging from 82 consecutive subjects who underwent a 320-row multidetector CTA followed by cerebral angiography from February 2010 to February 2014 were retrospectively analysed. A total of 102 cerebrovascular anomalies were found. Reports from both imaging modalities were compared to determine the diagnostic accuracy of CTA. Result(s): The overall sensitivity and specificity of 320-row multidetector CTA for detecting cerebrovascular abnormalities were, respectively, 97.60% and 63.20%. Similar results were obtained for all four categories of clinical indications. Conclusion(s): Results obtained from CTA were consistent with those obtained on digital subtraction angiography regardless of the vascular pathology. To our knowledge, this study is the first validating the accuracy of 320-row CTA in diagnosing critical cerebrovascular lesions.Copyright © The Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences Inc. 2016.",Excluded
2949,"Radiofrequency ablation is beneficial in simultaneous treatment of synchronous liver metastases and primary colorectal cancer. Background: In patients with resectable synchronous colorectal liver metastases (CRLM), either twostaged or simultaneous resections of the primary tumor and liver metastases are performed. Data on radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for the treatment of CRLM during a simultaneous procedure is lacking. The primary aim was to analyze short-term and long-term outcome of RFA in simultaneous treatment. A secondary aim was to compare simultaneous resection with the colorectal-first approach. Method(s): Retrospective analysis of 241 patients with colorectal cancer and synchronous CRLM between 2000-2016. Median follow-up was 36.1 months (IQR 18.2-58.8 months). A multivariable analysis was performed to analyze the postoperative morbidity, using the comprehensive complication index. A propensity matched analysis was performed to compare survival rates. Result(s): In multivariable analysis, the best predictor of lower complication severity was treatment with RFA (p = 0.040). Higher complication rates were encountered in patients who underwent an abdominoperineal resection (p = 0.027) or age > 60 years (p = 0.022). The matched analysis showed comparable overall survival in RFA treated patients versus patients undergoing a liver resection with a five year overall survival of 39.4% and 37.5%, respectively (p = 0.782). In a second matched analysis, 5-year overall survival rates in simultaneously treated patients (43.8%) was comparable to patients undergoing the colorectal first approach (43.0%, p = 0.223). Conclusion(s): RFA treatment of CRLM in simultaneous procedures is associated with a lower complication severity and non-inferior oncological outcome as compared to partial liver resection. RFA should be considered a useful alternative to liver resection.Copyright © 2018 Hof et al.

3581,"Diagnostic capability and radiation dose of cone beam CT dacryocystography in different scanning fields of view in healthy volunteers. OBJECTIVES: Cone beam CT dacryocystography (CBCT-DCG) is a new imaging technique for assessing the lacrimal drainage system (LDS). The purpose of this pilot study is to compare the diagnostic capability and radiation dose of CBCT-DCG in different scanning fields of view (FOV) to evaluate the possibilities of the reduction of radiation dose. METHOD(S): Fifteen healthy volunteers underwent CBCT-DCG in an upright position. The first five subjects were scanned using the scanning FOV of 11x10 cm (Group A), then 8x8 cm (Group B), and the last five subjects 5x5.5 cm (Group C). The image quality and diagnostic validity of different groups were evaluated by two experienced otolaryngologists. The effective dose of each group was calculated and compared. RESULT(S): All images showed good delineation of the LDS and its surrounding structures. With regard to the image quality and diagnostic validity, no differences were found among different groups. Compared with Group A, the effective radiation dose for Group B (38.40 muSv) was 38.54% lower and that for Group C (17.12 muSv) was 72.60% lower. CONCLUSION(S): A substantial reduction of the effective dose for CBCT-DCG in healthy volunteer by decreasing FOV is possible without compromising the diagnostic capability. CBCT-DCG is a potential valid first-line imaging test for the evaluation of LDS, and it permits functional assessment of lacrimal drainage.",Excluded

Objective: To review the authors' experience with Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKR) for small recurrent high-grade gliomas (HGGs) following prior radical resection, external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT), and chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ). Method(s): The authors retrospectively analyzed 26 consecutive adults (9 women and 17 men; median age 60.4 years; Karnofsky Performance Status [KPS] >=70) who underwent GKR for recurrent HGGs from 2004-2009. Median lesion volume was 1.22 cc, and median treatment dose was 15 Gy. Pathology included glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; n = 16), anaplastic astrocytoma (AA; n = 5), and anaplastic mixed oligoastrocytoma (AMOA; n = 5). Two patients lost to follow-up were excluded from radiographic outcome analyses. Result(s): Median overall survival (OS) for the entire cohort from the time of GKR was 13.5 months. Values for 12-month actuarial survival from time of GKR for GBM, AMOA, and AA were 37%, 20% and 80%. Local failure occurred in 9 patients (37.5%) at a median time of 5.8 months, and 18 patients (75%) experienced distant progression at a median of 4.8 months. Complications included radiation necrosis in two patients and transient worsening of hemiparesis in one patient. Multivariate hazard ratio (HR) analysis showed KPS 90 or greater, smaller tumor volumes, and increased time to recurrence after resection to be associated with longer OS following GKR. Conclusion(s): GKR provided good local tumor control in this group of clinically stable and predominantly high-functioning patients with small recurrent HGGs after radical resection. Meaningful survival times after GKR were seen. GKR can be considered for selected patients with recurrent HGGs. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2691,"Resistance exercise as a countermeasure to disuse-induced bone loss. During spaceflight, skeletal unloading results in loss of bone mineral density (BMD). This occurs primarily in the spine and lower body regions. This loss of skeletal mass could prove hazardous to astronauts on flights of long duration. In this study, intense resistance exercise was used to test whether a training regimen would prevent the loss of BMD that accompanies disuse. Nine subjects (5 men, 4 women) participated in a supine maximal resistance exercise training program during 17 wk of horizontal bed rest. These subjects were compared with 18 control subjects (13 men, 5 women) who followed the same bed rest protocol without exercise. Determination of treatment effect was based on measures of BMD, bone metabolism markers, and calcium balance obtained before, during, and after bed rest. Exercisers and controls had significantly (P < 0.05) different means, represented by the respective following percent changes: lumbar spine BMD, +3% vs. -1%; total hip BMD, +1% vs. -3%; calcaneus BMD, +1% vs. -9%; pelvis BMD, -0.5% vs. -3%; total body BMD, 0% vs. -1%; bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, +64% vs. 0%; alkaline phosphatase, +31% vs. +5%; osteocalcin, +43% vs. +10%; 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D, +12% vs. -15%; parathyroid hormone intact molecule, +18% vs. -25%; and serum and ionized calcium, -1% vs. +1%. The difference in net calcium balance was also significant (+21 mg/day vs. -199 mg/day, exercise vs. control). The gastrocnemius and soleus muscle volumes decreased significantly in the exercise group, but the loss was significantly less than observed in the control group. The results indicate that resistance exercise had a positive treatment effect and thus might be useful as a countermeasure to prevent the deleterious skeletal changes associated with long-duration spaceflight.",Excluded
2150,"Iterative image reconstruction techniques: Applications for cardiac CT. Traditional limitations of cardiac CT are related to image noise, blooming artifacts from calcifications and stents, and radiation exposure. We evaluated whether these limitations can be ameliorated by the use of iterative reconstruction in image space (IRIS) instead of traditional filtered back projection (FBP) image reconstruction techniques. We compared image reconstruction with the use of IRIS with traditional FBP for their effect on image quality, noise, volume of heavy coronary artery calcifications, and stents as a measure of ""blooming"" artifacts, and radiation dose at cardiac CT. The radiation dose comparison was performed as a matched pair analysis, whereas all other comparisons were performed within the same group of patients. The subjective image quality of IRIS reconstructions was rated higher than FBP reconstructions. Image noise was lower with IRIS than with FBP. The volume of stents and heavy coronary artery calcifications measured lower in IRIS reconstructed series compared with FBP. Similar levels of image noise were achieved with 80/100 kVp of tube voltage with IRIS compared with 120 kVp and FBP, resulting in a 62% reduction in effective dose. Our preliminary experiences suggest that IRIS incrementally improves the CT evaluation of coronary arteries, especially in challenging scenarios. Substantial radiation reduction seems feasible without associated increases in image noise. Copyright © 2011 Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In surgical treatment, favourable short-term outcome (headache, gait and micturition disorders, improved consciousness, psychomotor activity, social behaviour) was found in 88% of the patients; long-term favourable outcome was present in 60% of the patients and implied only the psychic and social indicators. In medical treatment the favourable short-term outcome was nonsignificant and the long-term outcome was favourable in only 32% of the patients. In the remaining cases evaluated as unfavourable, the cognitive disorders increased progressively. The predictors for favourable therapeutic outcome were: early diagnosis, early surgical intervention, the clinical form of hydrocephalus, the sequelae and short-term effects of surgical treatment.",Excluded
2600,"Protection from free radical formation on the scalp. Hair is a protective barrier for the body against external aggressors such as solar radiation. People with bald scalps or thinning hair do not benefit from this protective barrier. It is known that solar exposure can induce oxidative stress to the skin; however not many studies have examined the potential for oxidative damage to the scalp. Free radicals produced by these stressors can lead to the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, MMP's and the breakdown of collagen and elastin. They can also inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in hair follicles. In order to determine whether scalp skin is a potential target of oxidative stress, we developed a non-invasive method to assess the generation of free radicals from measuring the chemiluminescence signal in skin. Significant free-radical production was detected from the scalp after exposure to dose of visible light (400-700nm). Traditional sunscreens block only the UV (290-400um) wavelengths of solar light, leaving the longer wavelengths to stimulate and produce free radicals in the skin. A photostable UVA/UVB sunscreen combined with a triple combination of natural antioxidants including a Parthenolide- free Feverfew Extract, a natural extract known to be a potent antioxidant, was developed to reduce the production of free radicals from the scalp. Topical application of the triple antioxidant sunscreen significantly reduced the amount of generated free radicals on the scalp. These results demonstrate that the scalps of men and women with thinning to bald scalps are a potential target of oxidative damage. Excessive damage to the hair follicle could lead to decreased proliferation and be a contributing factor to hair loss. This study suggests the need for a sunscreen with potent antioxidants to protect the scalp from the free radical induced damage from solar exposure.",Excluded

2550,"A review of the effects of uranium and depleted uranium exposure on reproduction and fetal development. Depleted uranium (DU) is used in armor-penetrating munitions, military vehicle armor, and aircraft, ship and missile counterweighting/ballasting, as well as in a number of other military and commercial applications. Recent combat applications of DU alloy [i.e., Persian Gulf War (PGW) and Kosovo peacekeeping objective] resulted in human acute exposure to DU dust, vapor or aerosol, as well as chronic exposure from tissue embedding of DU shrapnel fragments. DU alloy is 99.8% 238Uranium, and emits approximately 60% of the alpha, beta, and gamma radiation found in natural uranium (4.05 x 10(-7) Ci/g DU alloy). DU is a heavy metal that is 160% more dense than lead and can remain within the body for many years and slowly solubilize. High levels of urinary uranium have been measured in PGW veterans 10 years after exposure to DU fragments and vapors. In rats, there is strong evidence of DU accumulation in tissues including testes, bone, kidneys, and brain. In vitro tests indicate that DU alloy may be both genotoxic and mutagenic, whereas a recent in vivo study suggests that tissue-embedded DU alloy may be carcinogenic in rats. There is limited available data for reproductive and teratological deficits from exposure to uranium per se, typically from oral, respiratory, or dermal exposure routes. Alternatively, there is no data available on the reproductive effects of DU embedded. This paper reviews published studies of reproductive toxicity in humans and animals from uranium or DU exposure, and discusses ongoing animal research to evaluate reproductive effects in male and female rats embedded with DU fragments, and possible consequences in F1 and F2 generations.",Excluded

388,"Effect of selective inhibitors of inflammation on oral mucositis: preclinical studies. OBJECTIVE: Oral mucositis is a severe, dose-limiting side effect of radio(chemo)therapy for head and neck tumors. The epithelial radiation response (ulceration) is accompanied by inflammatory changes. Their interaction with the epithelial processes remains unclear. The present study was initiated to determine the effect of inhibition of TNF-alpha or COX-2 on the epithelial radiation response in the mouse tongue model., METHODS: Daily fractionated irradiation was given with 5 x 3 Gy/week over one (days 0-4) or two weeks (days 0-4, 7-11). Each protocol was terminated by graded test doses (5 dose groups, 10 animals each) to a defined area of the lower tongue surface to generate full dose-effect curves for mucosal ulceration. A TNF-alpha inhibiting antibody (Infliximab) or a COX-2 inhibitor (Celecoxib) was administered., RESULTS: No effect of Infliximab or Celecoxib was found in any of the protocols. Isoeffective doses for ulcer induction were unchanged. Also, the time course of the response was largely unaffected., CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of TNF-alpha or COX-2, two dominating inflammatory pathways, did not result in modulation of the response of oral epithelium during fractionated irradiation. This suggests that the inflammatory changes mediated through TNF-alpha or COX-2 are not relevant for the epithelial radiation response of oral mucosa.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: HIV status may affect outcomes after definitive chemoradiotherapy for anal cancer. OBJECTIVE(S): Here, we report a large series in the highly active antiretroviral therapy era comparing outcomes between HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients with anal cancer. DESIGN: This was a retrospective chart review. SETTINGS: The study was conducted at an outpatient oncology clinic at large academic center. PATIENTS: A total of 107 patients were reviewed, 39 HIV positive and 68 HIV negative. All of the patients underwent definitive chemoradiation for anal cancer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Data on patient characteristics, treatment, toxicity, and outcomes were collected. Overall survival, colostomy-free survival, local recurrence-free survival, and distant metastasis-free survival were analyzed. RESULT(S): Median follow-up was 15 months. HIV-positive patients were younger (median, 52 vs 64 years; p < 0.001) and predominantly men (82% men vs 49% men; p = 0.001). There were no significant differences in T, N, or stage groups. HIV-positive patients had a significantly longer duration from biopsy to start of chemoradiation (mean number of days, 82 vs 54; p = 0.042). There were no differences in rates of acute toxicities including diarrhea, fatigue, or dermatitis. HIV-positive patients had significantly higher rates of hospitalization (33% vs 15%; p = 0.024). The 3-year overall survival rate was 42% in HIV-positive and 76% in HIV-negative patients (p = 0.037; HR, 2.335 (95% CI, 1.032-5.283)).

482,"Time-related changes in computed tomographic appearance and pathologic findings after radiofrequency ablation of the rabbit lung: Preliminary experimental study. PURPOSE: To evaluate correlations between computed tomographic (CT) appearance and pathologic findings after radiofrequency (RF) ablation of lungs and to determine whether CT appearance could predict the extent of the effective therapeutic area. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The lungs of 14 rabbits were subjected to RF ablation and CT scans were obtained immediately and at various intervals thereafter. Four rabbits were killed immediately after the initial CT imaging (n = 4). The remaining 10 rabbits were killed after additional CT scans at intervals of 3 days (n = 2), 1 week (n = 4), 2 weeks (n = 2), and 3 weeks (n = 2) after RF ablation. Pathologic findings were correlated with CT appearance. RESULT(S): Immediately after RF ablation, a restricted area of central dense opacity enclosed by an extensive area of ground-glass opacity was noted in the ablated region on CT images. Pathologically, the former corresponded to destructive tissue and the latter corresponded to tissue with some degree of injury. After 1 week, the entire ablated region appeared as a well-demarcated homogeneous dense opacity on CT that corresponded to necrotic tissue and its surrounding rim of granulation tissue on histopathologic examination, indicating that the enclosing extensive area of ground-glass opacity on the initial CT scan represented an ongoing necrosis. Within 2-3 weeks, the ablated region gradually contracted on the CT images, representing a tissue repairing process in which the granulation tissue was encroaching on the inner necrotic tissue. CONCLUSION(S): Ground-glass opacity of the ablated region on CT immediately after RF ablation represents an ongoing necrosis. © SIR, 2005.",Excluded
313,"Myocardial perfusion imaging with a cadmium zinc telluride-based gamma camera versus invasive fractional flow reserve. Purpose: Recently introduced ultrafast cardiac SPECT cameras with cadmium zinc telluride-based (CZT) detectors may provide superior image quality allowing faster acquisition with reduced radiation doses. Although the level of concordance between conventional SPECT and invasive fractional flow reserve (FFR) measurement has been studied, that between FFR and CZT-based SPECT is not yet known. Therefore, we aimed to assess the level of concordance between CZT SPECT and FFR in a large patient group with stable coronary artery disease. Method(s): Both invasive FFR and myocardial perfusion imaging with a CZT-based SPECT camera, using Tc-tetrofosmin as tracer, were performed in 100 patients with stable angina and intermediate grade stenosis on invasive coronary angiography. A cut-off value of <0.75 was used to define abnormal FFR. Result(s): The mean age of the patients was 64+/-11 years, and 64 % were men. SPECT demonstrated ischaemia in 31 % of the patients, and 20 % had FFR <0.75. The concordance between CZT SPECT and FFR was 73 % on a per-patient basis and 79 % on a per-vessel basis. Discordant findings were more often seen in older patients and were mainly (19 %) the result of ischaemic SPECT findings in patients with FFR >=0.75, whereas only 8 % had an abnormal FFR without ischaemia as demonstrated by CZT SPECT. Conclusion(s): Only 20 - 30 % of patients with intermediate coronary stenoses had significant ischaemia as assessed by CZT SPECT or invasive FFR. CZT SPECT showed a modest degree of concordance with FFR, which is comparable with previous results with conventional SPECT. Further investigations are particularly necessary in patients with normal SPECT and abnormal FFR, especially to determine whether these patients should undergo revascularization. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded

Over the diagnostic and therapeutic course there were no significant differences regarding the median volume of contrast (CCTA 80.3 ml[65.0-165.0] vs ICA 90.0 ml[55.0-100.0], p = 0.099), while a non-significant trend towards higher radiation dose in the CCTA group was observed (9.9 mSv[7.0-22.1] vs 9.4 mSv[5.2-14.0], p = 0.05). There were no acute cardiovascular events. Conclusion(s): CCTA may hypothetically act as an effective 'gatekeeper' to the catheterization laboratory in the diagnosis of stable patients with current indications for ICA. This strategy may result in non-invasive, outpatient-based triage of two thirds of individuals without actionable CAD, obviating unnecessary invasive examinations. However, the longer follow-up is indispensable. ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT02591992 The aim of our trial was to evaluate the clinical value of coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) as the first-line anatomical test in the diagnosis of stable patients with indications for invasive coronary angiography (ICA) due to suspected significant coronary artery disease (CAD). This is the first study triaging this group of patients with CT and the results of this randomized trial are promising in terms of safety and efficacy.Copyright © 2018 Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography",Excluded
1221,"Do non-thermal electromagnetic fields cause nitrosative stress in male and female rats?. Nitrosative stress occurs when the generations of highly Reactive Nitrogen Species (RNS) such as nitric oxide (NO) exceed the ability of the human body to neutralize and eliminate them. It may lead to nitrosylation reactions that can alter protein structure by inhibiting normal body functions. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether RF Fields at non - thermal level can affect total NO (NOx) and antioxidant levels in plasma thus cause nitrosative stress. Twenty-four male and female Wistar rats were divided into four groups: Group I and Group II: male (n=6) and female (n=6) control groups, Group III and Group IV: male (n=6) and female (n=6) RF radiation exposed groups. The exposed groups of rats were exposed to non - thermal RF radiation 20 min/day for a month. NOx (nitrite/nitrate) levels were measured by Griess assay using Elisa reader. The total sulfhydryl (RSH) levels were determined spectrophotometrically by Kurtel method. The exposure to RF Radiation for a month caused significant increase in NOx plasma levels in male and female rats (p < 0.05). Conversely RSH levels were significantly lower in exposed rats compared to control rats (p < 0.05). No statistically significant difference was observed in the rectal temperature between control and RF - irradiated rats (p > 0.05). In the present study, we showed that plasma NOx level may be increased in both male and female rats due to RF radiation exposure. The results of our study are evident that RF Fields at non - thermal level can induce nitrosative stress by increasing NOx and decreasing antioxidant levels.",Excluded
1813,"Phase I study of pemetrexed and cisplatin with concurrent high-dose thoracic radiation after induction chemotherapy in patients with unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Purpose: This is a phase I, escalating-dose trial targeting exclusively patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), investigating pemetrexed and fixed-dose cisplatin concurrently administered with high-dose radiotherapy (RT) after induction chemotherapy (CT). Primary objective was to determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of pemetrexed. Patients and Materials: Patients with unresected stage III NSCLC, planned V20<=35%, and FEV>=1.3L, were treated every 21 days for 2 cycles (pemetrexed 500mg/m2; cisplatin 75mg/m2), followed by 2 cycles of concurrent CT-RT: pemetrexed starting dose was 400mg/m2, escalated up to 800mg/m2 per 100mg/m2 dose level (DL), cisplatin at 75mg/m2 and RT at fixed dose of 66Gy/33 fractions. Result(s): Nine of 10 enrolled patients (age range 46-68 years; 6 men; ECOG PS 0 [6 patients], PS 1 [4]; stage IIIA [1], IIIB [9]; 6 adenocarcinomas, 3 squamous cell carcinomas, 1 large cell carcinoma) were entered on 3 DLs. Dose escalation of pemetrexed was conducted up to 600mg/m2 based on the independent safety monitoring board recommendation. One dose-limiting toxicity occurred at DL3: Grade 4 septic shock. Grade 3 related toxicities: 2 neutropenia at DL3, 2 lymphopenia per DL (3 recurrent), 2 leukopenia (1 recurrent) at DL3, 1 gastric pain (DL3), 1 nausea and 1 recurrent vomiting (DL2). No Grade 3/4 radiation-related toxicities were observed. No toxic death was observed. Disease control rate was 77.7% (1 CR, 4 PR, 2 SD). One-year survival rate was 90%. Conclusion(s): This phase I report of pemetrexed is dedicated to NSCLC with induction therapy and fixed high-dose RT. Pemetrexed at 500mg/m2, concurrently given with cisplatin and RT was well tolerated and appears to be the only third-generation agent that can likely be recommended safely at full dose in future trials with concurrent RT. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Excluded
953,"The value of 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT over conventional SPECT in the evaluation of parathyroid adenomas or hyperplasia. As SPECT/CT technology evolves, its applications and indications need to be evaluated clinically for more efficient and cost-effective use. This retrospective study evaluated the clinical value of simultaneously acquired (99m)Tc-sestamibi SPECT/CT versus conventional SPECT in diagnosing and locating parathyroid adenomas or hyperplasia in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. METHOD(S): Immediately and 60 minutes after intravenous administration of 740-925 MBq of (99m)Tc-sestamibi, static planar images of the neck and chest were obtained. SPECT/CT images were acquired 30 minutes after injection. Two experienced masked readers independently evaluated whether conventional SPECT images provided information beyond what was available from the planar images either by changing the diagnosis or by better locating the glands and whether the SPECT/CT images provided information beyond what was available from the planar plus conventional SPECT images. Forty-eight consecutive patients with a clinical diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism were included in the study. The 32 whose scans showed positive results underwent surgical resection and were examined histopathologically. RESULT(S): Planar and SPECT imaging, with or without CT fusion, identified 89% of the surgically confirmed diseased parathyroid glands. Use of SPECT/CT changed the diagnosis in only 1 patient (2%) from positive to negative and better located the glands in only 4 patients (8%). SPECT/CT was particularly helpful in locating the 2 ectopic parathyroid adenomas diagnosed in this cohort. Tracer retention in diseased glands did not correlate with histologic characteristics. Also, biochemical markers did not correlate with the scan findings. CONCLUSION(S): SPECT/CT has no significant clinical value additional to that of conventional SPECT for parathyroid imaging except in locating ectopic parathyroid glands. Eliminating the CT acquisition will spare patients the additional time, radiation exposure, and expense.",Excluded

The accumulating effects of exposure to electromagnetic radiation emitted by a conventional mobile phone (MP) on male sexual behaviour have not yet been analyzed. Therefore, we studied these effects in 18 male rabbits that were randomly divided into phone and control groups. Six female teasers were taken successively to the male's cage and the copulatory behavior was recorded. Serum total testosterone, dopamine and cortisol were evaluated. The animals of the phone group were exposed to MPs (800 MHz) in a standby position for 8 h daily for 12 weeks. At the end of the study, the copulatory behavior and hormonal assays were re-evaluated. Mounts without ejaculation were the main mounts in the phone group and its duration and frequency increased significantly compared with the controls, whereas the reverse was observed in its mounts with ejaculation. Ejaculation frequency dropped significantly, biting/grasping against teasers increased notably and mounting latency in accumulated means from the first to the fourth teasers were noted in the phone group. The hormonal assays did not show any significant differences between the study groups. Therefore, the pulsed radiofrequency emitted by a conventional MP, which was kept on a standby position, could affect the sexual behavior in the rabbit.",Excluded
2239,"Polyethyleneimine grafted with pluronic P85 enhances Ku86 antisense delivery and the ionizing radiation treatment efficacy in vivo. In an effort to improve the efficacy of antisense delivery, we evaluated polyethyleneimine (PEI, 2 kDa) alone or grafted with nonionic amphiphilic block copolymer Pluronic (P85) as a carrier for Ku86 antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) delivery. Ku86 is an abundant nuclear protein that plays an important role in nonhomologous DNA end joining and has implications in tumorigenesis and acquired drug resistance. Transfection of adherent and suspension cell lines with Ku86 ASOs complexed with P85-g-PEI (2 kDa) conjugates was associated with a specific decrease in Ku86 mRNA levels (EC50<75 nM and EC50<250 nM, respectively, n=3). More importantly, no requirement for reduced serum conditions was necessary during transfection. In contrast, whereas Ku86 ASOs complexed with PEI (2 kDa) alone were effective in decreasing Ku86 mRNA levels in adherent cell lines (EC50<75 nM, n=3), the formulation did not produce any detectable decrease in Ku86 mRNA levels in suspension cell lines. Transfection of adherent cell lines with 500 nM Ku86 ASOs formulated with P85-g-PEI (2 kDa) was associated with a specific decrease (<10% remaining of control) in Ku86 protein expression and a two-fold increased cell death after treatment with ionizing radiation (IR). In athymic nude mice bearing subcutaneous human HT29 colon adenocarcinoma xenografts, Ku86 ASO-P85-g-PEI (2 kDa) administration (15 mg/kg, subcutaneously) with a Q1D x 7 treatment schedule, when combined with a single dose of IR (6 Gy), caused a significant inhibition of HT29 tumor growth compared with mismatch- and naked antisense-pretreated control groups (time from 200 to 1000 mm3, 126.9 versus 84.18 and 87.76 days, P<0.005). A potentiation of the antitumor activity was observed in all mice treated with Ku86 ASO-P85-g-PEI (2 kDa) formulation; however, tumor growth inhibition was reversible upon treatment cessation. No morbidity/mortality or changes in histopathology were observed under this treatment regiment. Our results indicate that P85-g-PEI (2 kDa) conjugates may increase the efficacy of Ku86 ASO delivery in management of resistant malignancies, thus providing a rationale for their evaluation in cancer patients in combination with conventional anticancer therapies.",Excluded
725,"Gamma knife radiosurgery in the treatment of tumor-related facial pain. Background: Intracranial neoplasms can cause pain similar to trigeminal neuralgia. Literature regarding radiosurgery for this is limited. We present a retrospective review of patients with tumor-related facial pain from benign lesions treated with gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) at Wake Forest University. Objective(s): The primary objectives were to determine long-term pain relief and predictive factors for pain alleviation. Method(s): We reviewed 515 patients treated with GKRS for benign meningioma, vestibular schwannoma or trigeminal schwannoma between August 1999 and August 2010. Twenty-one eligible patients had tumor-related facial pain prior to GKRS. The median marginal tumor dose was 12 Gy. Long-term pain relief data were obtained by chart review and telephone interview. Result(s): The median follow-up for symptom evaluation was 3.8 years. Seventeen of 21 patients (81%) experienced a Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) score of I-III at 6 months following GKRS. Kaplan-Meier estimates of freedom from BNI IV-V relapse were 66% at 1 year and 53% at 2 years. No pain relapses occurred after 2 years. Conclusion(s): GKRS of benign lesions is a noninvasive option for patients with tumor-related facial pain. Pain relief is modest, with the majority of pain relapses occurring within 2 years and approximately one half of patients maintaining relief beyond 2 years. Copyright © 2012 S.

337,"Radiation dose in a Triple rule-out"" coronary CT angiography protocol of emergency department patients using 64-MDCT: The impact of ECG-based tube current modulation on age, sex, and body mass index"". OBJECTIVE. Triple rule-out"" coronary CT angiography (CTA) using 64-MDCT technology is a new approach for evaluating emergency department patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Our objective was to evaluate the reduction in effective radiation dose through the use of tube current modulation in patients who underwent a triple rule-out coronary CTA evaluation and to document how effective radiation dose was impacted by patient age, sex, and body mass index (BMI). MATERIALS AND METHODS. A retrospective analysis of triple rule-out coronary CTA examinations performed on a 64-MDCT scanner was ordered on a prospective cohort of 267 consecutive low-to moderate-risk emergency department patients with suspected ACS from a single university hospital between October 2006 and March 2008. Tube current modulation was generally used in patients with heart rates below 65 beats per minute during the second half of the study period as a way to reduce radiation exposure. We calculated effective radiation exposure using actual patient coronary CTA scanning parameters by age, sex, and BMI RESULTS. Among the 172 patients evaluated without tube current modulation, effective dose averaged (+/- SD) 18.0 +/- 5.6 mSv (range, 9.9-31.3 mSv). Of the 95 patients who underwent CTA examination with tube current modulation, effective dose was significantly lower at 8.75 +/- 2.64 mSv (range, 5.4-16.6 mSv; p < 0.0001) and image quality was better (p < 0.0001) as compared with examinations without tube current modulation. There were no significant radiation differences by patient age, but tube current modulation decreased radiation exposure by at least half. Among the studies in which tube current modulation was not used, women received less radiation than men (17.0 vs 19.5 mSv, respectively; p < 0.001). For the studies with tube current modulation, there were no radiation differences by sex. Obese patients received significantly more radiation than overweight and normal-weight patients in the non-tube current modulation groups (20.9 mSv vs 15.0 and 14.9 mSv, respectively; p < 0.0001) and in the tube current modulation groups (10.3 mSv vs 7.6 and 7.1 mSv, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION. The overall effective radiation dose for triple rule-out coronary CTA was reduced by more than 50% with ECG-based tube current modulation without loss of image quality. Tube current modulation should be used for triple rule-out coronary CTA examinations whenever possible. © American Roentgen Ray Society.""",Excluded
3631,"The effect of chemotherapy on the latency interval of radiation induced sarcomas. Aim: Radiation induced sarcoma typically manifests 10-20 years after initial radiation exposure. Contemporary cancer treatment often includes a combination of radiation therapy with chemotherapy. This may influence the pattern of second cancer in long term survivors. We performed an audit of radiation induced sarcoma seen in the Bone and Soft Tissue Sarcoma Clinic at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. Method(s): Patients were identified through the Bone and Soft Tissue Sarcoma Clinic at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. Patients with a sarcoma diagnosis between June 2005 and June 2010 were identified. Fourteen patients were identified to have radiation induced sarcoma. Result(s): Seven of the patients were female and seven were male. The median age was 54. Of the initial diagnoses, four were sarcoma, five adenocarcinoma. two squamous cell carcinoma, one ependymoma, one melanoma and one lymphoma. The median radiation dose was 50Gy. Five patients received chemotherapy at the time of the initial radiotherapy. The median latency interval for patients who received chemotherapy was 5.1 years, and mean latency interval 5 years. Patients who did not receive chemotherapy had a longer median latency interval of 13.6 years and significantly longer mean latency interval of 13.5 years (p = 0.02). Conclusion(s): We hypothesise that chemotherapy shortens the latency interval of radiation induced sarcomas. This could possibly be through the synergistic effect of chemoradiation on genomic instability in normal cells. To confirm these findings, a large scale multicenter study is required.",Excluded
1865,"The role of endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene polymorphisms in patients with lung cancer. Objectives: Lung cancer is a disease characterized by uncontrolled cell growth in the lung tissues. The most common causes of lung cancer include smoking, exposure to radon gas, asbestos, environmental pollutants as well as genetic factors. Nitric oxide (NO) has potential mutagenic and carcinogenic activity and may play an important role in lung cancer. Endothelial NO, synthesized from L-arginine by endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), inhibits apoptosis and promotes angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation. The aim of the present study was to examine the possible relationship between eNOS gene intron 4 variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) and exon 7-G894T (Glu298Asp) polymorphisms and lung cancer risk. Method(s): DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes of 107 lung cancer patients and 100 control subjects. Designated polymorphisms were identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Result(s): Our study showed that the frequencies of the b/b genotype and b allele of eNOS gene intron 4 VNTR polymorphism were significantly higher in lung cancer patients than in controls (P < 0.05). However, there was no significant association between eNOS gene G894T polymorphism and lung cancer risk (P > 0.05). Conclusion(s): These results suggest that the presence of the intron 4 VNTR* b allele and b/b genotype may be a genetic risk factor for development of lung cancer. Further larger-scale studies are needed to confirm these findings.Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Excluded

1653,"Irradiated male tsetse from a 40-year-old colony are still competitive in a Riparian forest in Burkina Faso. BACKGROUND: Tsetse flies are the cyclical vectors of African trypanosomosis that constitute a major constraint to development in Africa. Their control is an important component of the integrated management of these diseases, and among the techniques available, the sterile insect technique (SIT) is the sole that is efficient at low densities. The government of Burkina Faso has embarked on a tsetse eradication programme in the framework of the PATTEC, where SIT is an important component. The project plans to use flies from a Glossina palpalis gambiensis colony that has been maintained for about 40 years at the Centre International de Recherche-Developpement sur l'Elevage en zone Subhumide (CIRDES). It was thus necessary to test the competitiveness of the sterile males originating from this colony., METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: During the period January-February 2010, 16,000 sterile male G. p. gambiensis were released along a tributary of the Mouhoun river. The study revealed that with a mean sterile to wild male ratio of 1.16 (s.d. 0.38), the abortion rate of the wild female flies was significantly higher than before (p = 0.026) and after (p = 0.019) the release period. The estimated competitiveness of the sterile males (Fried index) was 0.07 (s.d. 0.02), indicating that a sterile to wild male ratio of 14.4 would be necessary to obtain nearly complete induced sterility in the female population. The aggregation patterns of sterile and wild male flies were similar. The survival rate of the released sterile male flies was similar to that observed in 1983-1985 for the same colony., CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We conclude that gamma sterilised male G. p. gambiensis derived from the CIRDES colony have a competitiveness that is comparable to their competitiveness obtained 35 years ago and can still be used for an area-wide integrated pest management campaign with a sterile insect component in Burkina Faso.",Excluded
431,"Estimation of left ventricular ejection fraction with low-dose gated tomographic radionuclide angiography using cadmium-zinc-telluride gamma camera in patients receiving cardio-toxic chemotherapy: A dramatic radiation reduction. Background: Tomographic radionuclide angiography (TRA) is a simple non-invasive procedure which can monitor left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) with automatic processing software, resulting in excellent reproducibility. New gamma cameras using cadmium-zinc-telluride (CZT) detectors enables reduction of the patient radiation dose. We compared LVEF and left ventricular (LV) volumes between low dose and standarddose TRA using a CZT camera. Method(s): Between September and December 2015, patients receiving potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy and undergoing TRA were consecutively included. CZT acquisition was performed in <> after injection of 550MBq 99mTclabelled human serum albumin and lasted 7 minutes (recommended activity: 550-1110MBq, Society of Nuclear Medicine Guidelines). Each acquisition was analyzed full dose and equivalent half dose by the same physician, using the same software (Quantitative Blood Pool SPECT, Cedars Sinai) to generate LVEF and LV volumes. Result(s): 80 patients were analyzed (40% male, mean age 60 years and BMI 28 kg/m2). There was no significant difference in LVEF and LV systolic and diastolic volumes between full dose and equivalent half dose acquisition (p< 0.005). The contrasttonoise ratio wasn't visually decreased. Effective dose were 3.3 millisieverts (mSv) and 1.65mSv respectively for fulldose and equivalent halfdose acquisitions using our parameters. Conclusion(s): LVEF and LV volumes can accurately be determined using fast low-dose CZT acquisition (7 minutes, < 2mSv, below natural radiation) in patients receiving cardio-toxic chemotherapy. This dose reduction up to 50% from the lowest recommended administered activity allows repeated scans in those patients, with reduced dosimetry. Further dose reductions may be achievable.",Excluded

Two radiologists independently reviewed each observation in 80 kVp CT and 80/Sn150 kVp CT. Modified line-density profile of the tumor and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were measured. Diagnostic confidence, lesion conspicuity, and subjective image quality were calculated and compared between image sets. The effective dose and size-specific dose estimate (SSDE) were calculated in the image sets., RESULTS: Modified line-density profile analysis revealed higher attenuation differences between the tumor and normal tissue in 80 kVp CT than in 80/Sn150 kVp CT (127 vs. 107, P = 0.05). The 80 kVp CT showed increased CNR in the liver (8.0 vs. 7.6) and the aorta (18.9 vs. 16.3) than the 80/Sn150 kVp CT. The 80 kVp CT yielded higher enhancement of organs (4.9 +/- 0.2 vs. 4.7 +/- 0.4, P<0.001) and lesion conspicuity (4.9 +/- 0.3 vs. 4.8 +/- 0.5, P = 0.035) than the 80/Sn150 kVp CT; overall image quality and confidence index were comparable.

The SSDE was 7.4 +/- 3.8 mGy on 80/Sn150 kVp CT and 4.1 +/- 2.2 mGy on 80 kVp CT., CONCLUSIONS: The 80 kVp CT reduced the radiation dose by 45.2% in oncology patients while showing comparable or superior image quality to that of 80/Sn150 kVp CT for abdominal tumor evaluation.",Excluded
20,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for essential tremor: Retrospective analysis of a 19-year experience. Background: Essential Tremor (ET) is a common movement disorder that can be disabling. Initial treatment is in the form of medical therapies. Patients with medically refractory ET seek surgical intervention which include radiofrequency thalamotomy, deep brain stimulation, and radiosurgical thalamotomy. Radiosurgical thalamotomy is a minimally invasive surgical option which is especially valuable for elderly and high surgical risk patients. Objective(s): The purpose of this study was to retrospectively analyze the outcomes of stereotactic radiosurgery for patients suffering from medically refractory essential tremor. Method(s): During a 19-year period (1996-2015), 73 patients underwent gamma knife thalamotomy for intractable essential tremor. A median central dose of 140 Gy (range, 130-150) was delivered to the nucleus ventralis intermedius through a single 4-mm isocenter. We used the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin clinical tremor rating scale to score tremor, handwriting, drawing, and ability to drink fluids. The median time to last follow-up was 28 months (range, 6-152). Result(s): After gamma knife thalamotomy, 93.2% improved in tremor. Forty-four patients (60.3%) experienced tremor arrest or barely perceptible tremor. Eighteen patients (24.7%) noted tremor arrest and complete restoration of motor function. Tremor improvement was sustained at last follow-up in 96% of patients who experience tremor relief. Mean tremor score improved from 3.19 before to 1.27 after gamma knife thalamotomy (P < 0.0001). Mean handwriting score improved from 2.97 to 1.25 (P < 0.0001). Mean drawing score improved from 3.16 to 1.26 (P < 0.0001). Mean drinking score improved from 3.14 to 1.56 (P < 0.0001). Imaging follow-up showed three types of lesions: enhancing lesion, streaking along internal capsule on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, and significant reactive changes. Three patients (4%) experienced temporary adverse radiation effects. Conclusion(s): Radiosurgery is a safe and valuable treatment option for medically refractory essential tremor, especially for the elderly or those with high surgical risk for DBS or radiofrequency thalamotomy. © 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",Excluded
238,"Overall and chemotherapy-free survival following stereotactic body radiation therapy for abdominopelvic oligometastases. Introduction: Limited data establish the efficacy and safety of SBRT in the abdominopelvic (AP) space, where SBRT delivery is challenging due to the proximity of radiosensitive luminal gastrointestinal (GI) organs. The aim of this study was to assess clinical outcomes in patients with AP OM treated with SBRT. Method(s): Eligible patients were those with OM (defined as metastases in <=3 total sites) in the AP space (excluding liver) treated with SBRT. Descriptive statistics and Kaplan-Meier estimates of (LC), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and chemotherapy-free survival (CFS) were performed. Result(s): Fifty-one patients with 58 AP OM received SBRT between 2011 and 2015. Median follow-up was 21.9 months. All SBRT treatments were delivered in 5 fractions with a median dose of 35 Gy (25-40 Gy). Progression post-SBRT occurred in 38/51 patients (75%), with a median PFS of 4.9 months (95% CI: 2.5-7.5), and 2-year PFS of 29%. Rates of 2-and 4-year LC were 74% and 69%, respectively. Median OS was 42.6 months (95% CI: 31-55). Oligometastatic progression occurred in 21/38 patients, and of those, 48% (10/21) received further SBRT. Resulting 2- and 4-year CFS were 47% and 37%, respectively (median 15.1 months). Nineteen patients (37%) experienced a grade 1 or 2 acute toxicity. One grade 3 (acute) toxicity was observed. No grade 4 or 5 toxicities were detected. Conclusion(s): SBRT to AP OM was associated with sustained LC, excellent OS and minimal toxicity. The use of SBRT allowed for prolonged CFS and the salvage of limited-burden distant failures.Copyright © 2020 Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists",Excluded

Objectives: This prospective investigation was carried out in order to evaluate the accuracy of vertebral fracture assessment by DXA using GE iDXA device (GE Medical Systems Lunar, Madison, WI, USA) compared to conventional radiography. Materials/Methods: We enrolled 273 subjects (207 females and 68 males, age range 28-85 years) consecutively studied at our Mineral Metabolism Centre, which were undergoing a spine vertebral X-ray evaluation. Lateral images of the spine, from T4 to L4, by both conventional X-ray and iDXA device, were acquired in each subject on the same day, after informed consent was obtained. The radiographs were evaluated by an experienced skeletal radiologist (D.D.), using the semiquantitative (SQ) method. The iDXA images were evaluated by a trained operator using a specific software (enCORE). Result(s): By means of SQ radiological technique, we evaluated 3,515 (99%) of the 3,549 available vertebrae, and identified 151 vertebral deformities (101mild and 50moderate or severe). By means of iDXA we visualized 3,405 (96%) vertebrae and identified 150 vertebral deformities (100 mild and 50 moderate or severe). Ninety-two subjects (33.7% of the total sample) were identified as having vertebral fractures by SQ Rx technique and eighty-seven subjects (31.9%) fractured were recognized by iDXA (chi2 = n.s.). A single fracture was detected in 66 patients (24.2%) by conventional radiographs and in 59 subjects (21.6%) by iDXA; 26 subjects (9.5%) had multiple vertebral fractures detected by SQ Rx technique and 28 subjects (10.2%) by iDXA . Considering radiological SQ assessment as the gold standard, iDXA sensitivity was 87% and the specificity was 96% (Positive Predictive Value 88%; Negative Predictive Value 97%). Agreement between radio-graphs and iDXA was 96% with a kappa statistic of 0.91 (confidence interval 0.82-0.96). Conclusion(s): According to the results obtained, iDXA and SQ radiological technique demonstrated good agreement in classifying vertebrae as normal or deformed. Therefore, since iDXA performs spine images with good resolution and lower dose, it proves to be useful in the clinical evaluation of patients at risk of osteoporosis or for the selection of patients for osteoporosis-related clinical trials.",Excluded
588,"A role for radiotherapy in the management of advanced medullary thyroid carcinoma: The Mayo Clinic experience. Outcomes of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) in advanced medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) are largely unknown. Retrospective review of data from patients with MTC, diagnosed from June 1, 1970, through December 31, 2007. Overall survival and locoregional tumor control rates were calculated. Seventeen patients had adjuvant or palliative EBRT delivered to 41 sites. Six patients initially had adjuvant EBRT (median, 60.80 Gy); none had relapse in the treated area. Five patients with locoregional recurrence after surgery were treated (median, 59.40 Gy), and durable disease control was achieved in 3. Twelve patients received palliative EBRT to 29 sites of metastatic disease (median, 30.00 Gy), which provided sustained symptom relief at 45% of sites. Five- and tenyear overall survival rates were 44% and 19%, respectively. Adjuvant EBRT may be most effective for prevention of locoregional recurrence. EBRT may provide sustained control of advanced, metastatic disease in select patients. © J.A. Call et al., 2013 Licensee PAGEPress, Italy.",Excluded
399,"Evaluation of a transparent perfluorodecalin-infused patch as an adjunct to laser-assisted tattoo removal: A pivotal trial. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Laser-assisted treatment of tattoos is well recognized to produce opaque epidermal whitening that prevents multiple sequential passes during a single treatment session. The amount of epidermal whitening produced in association with the procedure can be minimized by topical application of perfluorodecalin (PFD), which is an optical clearing agent. This pivotal trial assessed the ability of a transparent PFD-infused patch used in conjunction with a Q-switched nanosecond laser in the treatment of tattoos to permit multiple laser passes during a single 5 minute treatment session in comparison to the number of passes that could be completed using conventional treatment of the tattoo with the laser alone., STUDY DESIGN: Thirty subjects (mean age 37 years; 14 males) with predominantly dark blue or black tattoos were enrolled in a split-tattoo trial. One half of each tattoo was treated conventionally, whereas the other half was treated through the PFD patch. Treatments were performed using a nanosecond Q-switched 755-nm Alexandrite laser. The number of treatments performed in a 5-minute time period was quantified for each side of the tattoo (primary effectiveness outcome). Patient-reported pain scores and adverse events (AEs) were also evaluated., RESULTS: Significantly more laser passes could be made on average using the PFD patch compared with treatment using the laser alone (3.7 passes vs. 1.4 passes; P < 0.001). AEs were limited to those expected during laser removal of tattoos. The proportions of subjects with transient edema and erythema were lower in the PFD patch treatment group (36.7% vs. 63.3% and 33.3% vs. 70.0%, respectively); all AEs were transient and resolved quickly. No patient in either group exhibited dyschromia (hypo- or hyperpigmentation) in the treatment area at the 1-month post treatment visit. Additionally, when surveyed at the 1-month follow-up visit, all subjects (30/30) preferred to continue laser-assisted tattoo removal with the PFD patch., CONCLUSION: An average of 3.7 laser passes were made in a defined 5-minute treatment session when using the transparent PFD-infused patch, which is significantly more than was possible with the laser alone (average of 1.4 passes). Use of the PFD patch was associated with improved tolerability compared with conventional treatment, with subjects experiencing fewer and less severe AEs related to epidermal injury. Lasers Surg.

1252,"Splinting the degenerative basal joint: Custom-made or prefabricated neoprene?. The purpose of this study was to compare the objective, subjective, and radiographic responses of patients with carpometacarpal joint osteoarthritis (CMCJ-OA) wearing a prefabricated neoprene splint (PFN), which crosses the CMCJ and metacarpophalangeal joint, with those of patients wearing a custom-made thermoplastic short opponens splint (CMT), which crosses only the CMCJ. Patients (N = 25) with first CMCJ stage I and II osteoarthritis were assigned randomly to wear either the PFN splint or the CMT splint for one week. After one week, the subjects rated their function in the splint and their satisfaction and pain levels on visual analogue scales. Pinch measurements were performed and x-rays were taken to assess carpometacarpal subluxation. The second splint was then applied for one week and all measures were repeated. The subjects rated the PFN splint significantly higher, and most reported that they would choose the PFN splint over the CMT splint for daily and long-term use. Both pain and function were improved with splinting, but the effect was amplified with the PFN splint compared with the CMT splint. Both splints reduced subluxation at the first carpometacarpal joint, but the CMT effect was greater. This study further supports current evidence that subjects with stage I and II first CMCJ-OA will have pain relief with thumb splinting. In addition, the PFN splint will provide greater relief when compared with the CMT splint. Furthermore, this study reveals that patients prefer the PFN splint to the CMT splint.",Excluded

2151,"DW-MRI-guided dose escalation improves local control of locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated with chemoradiotherapy. Background: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is one of the most highly radiosensitive malignancies; however, some locally advanced NPC patients experienced local recurrence even though they received aggressive treatment regimens. Defining the tumor volume precisely is important to escalate the total dose required for the primary tumor. In this study, we aimed to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of dose escalation guided by DW-MRI in patients with locally advanced NPC. Patients and Methods: A total of 230 patients with locally advanced NPC treated with intensive modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) at Sichuan Cancer Hospital between January 2010 and January 2015 were enrolled in this retrospective study. All the patients were treated with all-course of simultaneous integrated boost-IMRT. DW-MRI-guided dose escalation with 2.2-2.5 Gy/F, qd for 1-3daysor1.2-1.5 Gy/F, bid for 1-3 days were prescribed to 123 patients. Survival and complication of the patients were evaluated, and multivariate analysis was performed. Result(s): The median follow-up of patients in the DW-MRI-guided dose-escalation group and the conventional group was 48 months (range 8-88 months) and 52 months (range 6-90 months), respectively. The 5-year overall survival rate, distant metastasis-free survival rate, progression-free survival, and local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) of patients in the dose-escalation group and the conventional group were 88% vs 82.5% (p = 0.244), 86.1% vs 83.3% (p = 0.741), 82.2% vs 76.6% (p = 0.286), and 89.1% vs 80.1% (p = 0.029), respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that dose escalation was independent prognostic factor for LRFS (HR 0.386, 95% CI 0.163-0.909, p = 0.03). Conclusion(s): DW-MRI-guided dose escalation is a feasible strategy to improve local control of patients with locally advanced NPC.

3049,"Salivary gland-sparing other than parotid-sparing in definitive head-and-neck intensity-modulated radiotherapy does not seem to jeopardize local control. Background: The objective was to analyze locoregional (LR) failure patterns in patients with head-and-neck cancer (HNC) treated using intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with whole salivary gland-sparing: parotid (PG), submandibular (SMG), and accessory salivary glands represented by the oral cavity (OC). Method(s): Seventy consecutive patients with Stage I-II (23%) or III/IV (77%) HNC treated by definitive IMRT were included. For all LR failure patients, the FDG-PET and CT scans documenting recurrence were rigidly registered to the initial treatment planning CT. Failure volumes (Vf) were delineated based on clinical, radiological, and histological data. The percentage of Vf covered by 95% of the prescription isodose (Vf-V95) was analyzed. Failures were classified as "" in-field"" if Vf-V95 >= 95%, "" marginal"" if 20% < Vf-V95 < 95%, and "" out-of-field"" if Vf-V95 <=20%. Correlation between Vf-V95 and mean doses (Dmean) in the PG, SMG, and OC was assessed using Spearman's rank-order correlation test. The salivary gland dose impact on the LR recurrence risk was assessed by Cox analysis. Result(s): The median follow-up was 20 months (6-35). Contralateral and ipsilateral PGs were spared in 98% and 54% of patients, respectively, and contralateral and ipsilateral SMG in 26% and 7%, respectively. The OC was spared to a dose <=40 Gy in 26 patients (37%). The 2-year LR control rate was 76.5%. One recurrence was "" marginal"" , and 12 were "" in-field"" No recurrence was observed in vicinity of spared structures. Vf-V95 was not significantly correlated with Dmean in PG, SMG, and OC. The LR recurrence risk was not increased by lower Dmean in the salivary glands, but by T (p = 0.04) and N stages (p = 0.03). Conclusion(s): Over 92% of LR failures occurred "" in-field"" within the high dose region when using IMRT with a whole salivary gland-sparing strategy. Sparing SMG and OC in addition to PG thus appears a safe strategy. © 2013 Chajon et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
757,"A reappraisal of the use of 5-methoxypsoralen in the therapy of psoriasis. 5-methoxypsoralen (5-MOP) is considered an alternative to 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) for photochemotherapy of psoriasis. We have compared the clinical efficacy and tolerability of 5-MOP (1.2 mg/kg)-UVA versus 8-MOP (0.6 mg/kg)-UVA therapy in 25 patients of skin type III and IV, affected by relapsing plaque-type psoriasis of similar body involvement; indeed, the same patients were given 8-MOP during 1 year and 5-MOP during the subsequent year after relapsing. Both treatments cleared psoriatic lesions with a comparable number of exposures, but 5-MOP required significantly higher cumulative UVA doses. The difference was due to the lower phototoxicity of 5-MOP, as assessed by the determination of the minimal phototoxic dose, and to its higher tanning activity, as assessed by the weekly grading of pigmentation. Nevertheless, therapy by 5-MOP-UVA seemed particularly interesting in that it showed a higher tolerability since only 1 patient experienced nausea, whereas during therapy with 8-MOP-UVA nausea and/or vomiting occurred in 7 patients, sunburn in 6 and itching in 3. Since we have treated the same patients with the two drugs, our results were not influenced by interindividual variations of phototoxic responses, tanning ability and susceptibility to develop psoralen-induced short-term side-effects. It was concluded that, although long-term side-effects of the 5-MOP-UVA treatment have still to be determined, such treatment of psoriasis should be reappraised due to its higher tolerability in comparison to 8-MOP-UVA treatment.",Excluded

We retrospectively investigated the therapeutic outcomes of our series of 7 Ta and 62 T1 bladder cancers with grade 3 (G3) malignancy in 61 men and 8 women having a mean age of 66.2 years. Following transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), 35 and 6 patients received intravesical instillations of bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and anthracycline-derivants, respectively, whereas 15 received no adjuvant therapy. Five and 2 patients received systemic and local chemotherapy with irradiation, respectively, and six underwent radical cystectomy for invasive potential. The 5-year non-recurrence, progression-free, and overall (cancer-specific) survival rates were 66, 82%, and 76 (88) %, respectively, after a median follow-up of 52 months. The 5-year non-recurrence rates were 24% in non-adjuvant, 85% in BCG, 0% in anthracycline-derivants, 65% in systemic and local chemoradiation therapy, and 68% in cystectomy. The 5-year progression-free and overall (cancer-specific) survival rates of the patients treated with BCG instillation were 91% and 94(100)%. There were no significant differences in the 5-year non-recurrence and progression-free rates between 12 patients with carcinoma in situ (CIS) and 23 patients without CIS. Complete TUR of all visible tumors and a reliable histopathological diagnosis of appropriate specimens bearing the muscle layer are mandatory for assessment of recurrence. G3 Ta-1 bladder cancers and CIS showed a high risk of recurrence, and required aggressive treatment. Since BCG therapy following TURBT significantly reduced the risk of recurrence and progression, adjuvant BCG therapy is considered to be the most promising initial conservative treatment for G3 Ta-1 bladder cancers.",Excluded
1578,"Development of radiation exposure in patients undergoing pulmonary vein isolation in Germany between 2007 and 2014: great potential to minimize radiation dosage. AIM: The aim of this study was to analyze the radiation usage in patients undergoing pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) in Germany and to evaluate the possibility to reduce radiation dose., METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 6617 patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) from the German ablation registry and the FREEZEplus registry (control group), who underwent first PVI between 2007 and 2014, were analyzed. In the second step, the effect of optimized conventional fluoroscopy and optimized 3D mapping use was evaluated in 526 consecutive patients with AF who underwent first PVI at the Klinikum Ludwigshafen (optimized group) between 2007 and 2014. In the control group, the median dose area product (DAP) for PVI was 34 Gy cm(2), and the median DAP rate was 1.3 Gy cm(2)/min. The DAP decreased from 37 to 28 Gy cm(2), whereas the DAP rate increased from 1.3 to 1.6 Gy cm(2)/min between 2007 and 2014. In the optimized group, optimized radiation application and use of 3D mapping resulted in a continuous decrease in the DAP from 67 to 2 Gy cm(2) and DAP rate from 1.0 to 0.2 Gy cm(2)/min., CONCLUSION: Currently, the median radiation exposure during PVI in Germany is 28 Gy cm(2). Optimized fluoroscopy by simple means can safely reduce the radiation dose to about 2 Gy cm(2) or even lower when using 3D mapping. Before introducing novel expensive technologies for radiation reduction optimizing of the conventional fluoroscopy is mandatory.",Excluded
1866,"Expandable self-locking nail in the management of closed diaphyseal fractures of femur and tibia. BACKGROUND: Intramedullary fixation is the treatment of choice for closed diaphyseal fractures of femur and tibia. The axial and rotational stability of conventional interlocking nails depends primarily on locking screws. This method uses increased operating time and increased radiation exposure. An intramedullary implant that can minimize these disadvantages is obviously better. Expandable intramedullary nail does not rely on interlocking screws and achieves axial and rotational stability on hydraulic expansion of the nail. We analyzed 32 simple fractures of shaft of femur and tibia treated by self-locking expandable nail., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Intramedullary fixation was done by using self-locking, expandable nail in 32 patients of closed diaphyseal fractures of tibia (n = 10) and femur (n = 22). The various modes of injury were road traffic accidents (n = 21), fall from height (n = 8), simple fall (n = 2), and pathological fracture (n = 1). Among femoral diaphyseal fractures 16 were males and six females, average age being 33 yrs (range, 18- 62 yrs). Seventeen patients had AO type A (A1 (n = 3), A2 (n = 4), A3 (n = 10)) and 5 patients had AO type B (B1 (n = 2), B2 (n = 2), B3 (n = 1)) fractures. Eight patients having tibial diaphyseal fractures were males and two were females; average age was 29.2 (range, 18- 55 yrs). Seven were AO type A (A1 (n = 2), A2 (n = 3), A3 (n = 2)) and three were AO type B (B1 (n = 1), B2 (n = 1), and B3 (n = 1)). We performed closed (n = 27) or open reduction (n = 5) and internal fixation with expandable nail to stabilize these fractures. The total radiation exposure during surgery was less as no locking screws were required. Early mobilisation and weight-bearing was started depending on fracture personality and evidences of healing. Absence of localised tenderness and pain on walking was considered clinical criteria for union, radiographic criteria of union being continuity in at least in three cortices in both AP and lateral views. Patients were followed for at least one year., RESULTS: The average operative time was 90 min (range, 55-125 min) for femoral fractures and 53 min (range, 25-115 min) for tibial fractures. Radiation exposure was minimum, average being 84 seconds (range, 54-132) for femoral fractures and 54 seconds (range, 36-78) for tibial fractures. All fractures healed, but few had complications, such as infection (one case with tibial fracture) bent femoral nail with malunion (n = 1), and delayed union (n = 3; 2 cases in femur and 1 case in tibia). Mean time of union was 5.1 months (range, 4-10(1/2) months) for femoral fractures and 4.8 months (range, 3-9 months) for tibial fractures., CONCLUSION: We found the nail very easy to use with effective fixation in AO type A and B fractures in our setting. Less surgical time is required with minimum complications. The main advantage of the expandable nail is that if affords. satisfactory axial, rotatory, and bending stability with decreased radiation exposure to operating staff and the patient.",Excluded
3360,"Radiation therapy for oncological emergencies. AIMS AND BACKGROUND: Radiation therapy holds a fundamental role in oncological emergencies such as superior vena cava syndrome, spinal cord compression and endocranial hypertension. The purpose of our study was, by comparing schedules of treatment, to confirm the efficacy of hypofractionated radiation therapy., METHODS: From January 1994 to December 1998, 43 patients with superior vena cava syndrome, 37 patients with metastatic spinal cord compression and 108 patients with endocranial hypertension secondary to metastasis were treated at our institution. In the group of patients with superior vena cava syndrome, radiotherapy schedules were: 4 Gy x 5 to a total dose of 20 Gy (23 patients) and 3 Gy x 10 to a total dose of 30 Gy (20 patients). In the group of patients with spinal cord compression, radiation schedules were: 3 Gy x 10 to a total dose of 30 Gy (15 patients); 4 Gy x 5 to a total dose of 20 Gy (12 patients); a single fraction of 8 Gy in 10 cases, repeated after 1 week in 7 responder cases to a total dose of 16 Gy. 5 out of 37 patients were underwent to laminectomy plus stabilization of the spine and post-operative radiotherapy. In the group of patients with endocranial hypertension, radiotherapy schedules were: 6 Gy x 2 to a total dose of 12 Gy (53 patients), repeated after 4 weeks in 34 responder patients and 3 Gy x 10 to a total dose of 30 Gy (55 patients)., RESULTS: The patients with superior vena cava syndrome, revaluated after 4 weeks at the end of treatment, obtained a partial remission of symptomatology in 73.9% with 20 Gy and in 75% with 30 Gy. The patients with spinal cord compression obtained symptomatic relief in 73.3% with 30 Gy, in 66.6% with 20 Gy and in 70% of cases treated with 8 Gy. The patients with endocranial hypertension obtained symptomatic relief in 64.1% with 12 Gy and in 63.3% with 30 Gy., CONCLUSION: Histology, pretreatment and performance status were important prognostic factors for the response to therapy. Our results demonstrated no significant difference among different schedules of radiotherapy and confirmed the importance of radiotherapy for oncological emergencies: it improves the quality of life and, in responding patients, is associated with a longer survival time.",Excluded
710,"Variants in the ATM-CHEK2-BRCA1 axis determine genetic predisposition and clinical presentation of papillary thyroid carcinoma. The risk of developing papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), the most frequent form of thyroid malignancy, is elevated up to 8.6-fold in first-degree relatives of PTC patients. The familial risk could be explained by high-penetrance mutations in yet unidentified genes, or polygenic action of low-penetrance alleles. Since the DNA-damaging exposure to ionizing radiation is a known risk factor for thyroid cancer, polymorphisms in DNA repair genes are likely to affect this risk. In a search for low-penetrance susceptibility alleles we employed Sequenom technology to genotype deleterious polymorphisms in ATM, CHEK2, and BRCA1 in 1,781 PTC patients and 2,081 healthy controls. As a result of the study, we identified CHEK2 rs17879961 (OR=2.2, P=2.37e-10) and BRCA1 rs16941 (odds ratio [OR]=1.16, P=0.005) as risk alleles for PTC. The ATM rs1801516 variant modifies the risk associated with the BRCA1 variant by 0.78 (P=0.02). Both the ATM and BRCA1 variants modify the impact of male gender on clinical variables: T status (P=0.007), N status (P=0.05), and stage (P=0.035). Our findings implicate an important role of variants in the ATM- CHEK2- BRCA1 axis in modification of the genetic predisposition to PTC and its clinical manifestations. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
1876,"Characteristics of induced mutations in offspring derived from irradiated mouse spermatogonia and mature oocytes. The exposure of germ cells to radiation introduces mutations in the genomes of offspring, and a previous whole-genome sequencing study indicated that the irradiation of mouse sperm induces insertions/deletions (indels) and multisite mutations (clustered single nucleotide variants and indels). However, the current knowledge on the mutation spectra is limited, and the effects of radiation exposure on germ cells at stages other than the sperm stage remain unknown. Here, we performed whole-genome sequencing experiments to investigate the exposure of spermatogonia and mature oocytes. We compared de novo mutations in a total of 24 F1 mice conceived before and after the irradiation of their parents. The results indicated that radiation exposure, 4 Gy of gamma rays, induced 9.6 indels and 2.5 multisite mutations in spermatogonia and 4.7 indels and 3.1 multisite mutations in mature oocytes in the autosomal regions of each F1 individual. Notably, we found two types of deletions, namely, small deletions (mainly 1~12 nucleotides) in non-repeat sequences, many of which showed microhomology at the breakpoint junction, and single-nucleotide deletions in mononucleotide repeat sequences. The results suggest that these deletions and multisite mutations could be a typical signature of mutations induced by parental irradiation in mammals.",Excluded
1367,"Comparison of definite chemoradiation therapy with carboplatin/paclitaxel or cisplatin/5-fluoruracil in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. Background: While neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (nCRT) with subsequent surgery is the treatment of choice for patients with locally advanced or node-positive squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus (SCC) suitable for surgery, patients who are unsuitable for surgery or who refuse surgery should be treated with definite chemoradiation therapy (dCRT). Purpose of this study was to compare toxicity and oncologic outcome of dCRT with either cisplatin and 5-fluoruracil (CDDP/5FU) or carboplatin and paclitaxel (Carb/TAX) in patients with SCC. Method(s): Twenty-two patients who received dCRT with carboplatin (AUC2, weekly) and paclitaxel (50 mg per square meter of body-surface area, weekly) were retrospectively compared to 25 patients who were scheduled for dCRT with cisplatin (20 mg/m2/d) and 5-fluoruracil (500 mg/m2/d) on day 1-5 and day 29-33. For the per-protocol (PP) analysis, PP treatment was defined as complete radiation therapy with at least 54Gy and at least three complete cycles of Carb/TAX or complete radiation therapy with at least 54Gy and at least one complete cycle of CDDP/5FU. While patients who were scheduled for dCRT with Carb/TAX received a significantly higher total radiation dose (median dose 59.4Gy vs. 54Gy, p < 0.001) than patients who were scheduled for dCRT with CDDP/5FU, no significant differences were seen for other parameters (age, sex, TNM-stage, grading and tumor extension). Result(s): Forty-seven patients (25 patients treated with CDDP/5FU and 22 patients treated with Carb/TAX) were evaluated for the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis and 41 of 47 patients (23 patients treated with CDDP/5FU and 18 patients treated with Carb/TAX) were evaluated for the PP analysis. Severe myelotoxicity (>= IIIdegree) was seen in 52% (CDDP/5FU) and 55% of patients (Carb/TAX), respectively (p = 1.000). In the univariate binary logistic regression analysis, patients age was the only factor associated with an increased risk of >= IIIdegree myelotoxicity (hazard ratio 1.145, 95% CI 1.035; 1.266; p = 0.009). Regarding treatment efficiency, no significant differences were seen for overall survival (OS) and freedom from relapse (FFR) between both treatment groups. Conclusion(s): Myelotoxicity and oncologic outcome under dCRT were not different for patients with SCC of the esophagus treated with either CDDP/5FU or Carb/TAX. The putative equivalence of dCRT with Carb/TAX in this setting should be further investigated in prospective trials. However, our data reveal that the risk of significant myelotoxicity increases with patient age and therefore other chemotherapy regimens might be evaluated in elderly patients.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).",Excluded

Here we report a retrospective study of the treatment and other factors associated with its outcomes. Material(s) and Method(s): The medical records of 100 patients diagnosed with ATC at Ito Hospital between 1993 and 2009 were reviewed and pertinent information was extracted and analyzed. Result(s): There were 80 women and 20 men, and their median age at diagnosis was 68 years (range, 41-90 years). Thirteen patients had a history of well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Six patients had a small ATC focus within a differentiated carcinoma. All cases were retrospectively staged according to the Union for International Cancer Control classification system, and the results were stage IVA in 11 cases, stage IVB in 31 cases, and stage IVC in 58 cases. Seventy patients underwent surgical treatment, and complete resection was performed in 24 of them. Seventy-eight patients received radiotherapy, and 58 of them received a total dose of >=40 Gy. Twenty-seven patients received chemotherapy. Only 15 patients received multimodal therapy (surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy). The 1-year survival rates according to stage were as follows: stage IVA, 72.7%; stage IVB, 24.8%; and stage IVC, 8.2%. Multivariate analysis identified age >=70 years, white blood cell >=10,000 mm3, extrathyroidal invasion, and distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis as prognostic factors. Survival after complete resection was significantly better than after incomplete resection or no resection. The results also suggested that radiation doses of >=40 Gy were associated with significantly longer survival. Conclusion(s): Although the prognosis of most patients with ATC continues to be poor, surgery, radiotherapy, and a combination of both improved the survival of patients with ATC. © 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Excluded

In addition, for each patient sex, age, weight, height, focus-to-film distance, focus-to-skin distance, patient thickness, kV, mAs, field size and the nominal film speed were registered. Different X-ray machines were used in the participating centres--Thoravision, flat panel detector and film screen combinations in two centres (analogue system). The tube voltages employed varied between 60 and 150 kV and the nominal film speed between 200 and 400/800. All mean dose values (ESAK and AKAP) for the different centres showed a different value for female and male populations. The differences were up to 100 % and always higher for the mean AKAP. For a thorax posteroanterior examination, the mean ESAK varied between 0.06 and 0.46 mGy and the mean AKAP varied between 60 and 690 mGy cm(2).

OBJECTIVES: To determine the feasibility of automated co-registration of angiography and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) to facilitate integration of these two imaging modalities in a synchronous manner., BACKGROUND: IVUS provides cross-sectional imaging of coronary arteries but lacks overview of the vascular territory provided by angiography. Co-registration of angiography and IVUS would increase utility of IVUS in the clinical setting., METHODS: Forty-nine consecutive patients undergoing surveillance for cardiac allograft vasculopathy with angiography and IVUS of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) were enrolled. A pre-IVUS angiogram of the LAD was performed followed by an ECG-triggered fluoroscopy (ECGTF) during IVUS pullback at 0.5 mm/s using an automatic pullback device. ECGTF was used to track the IVUS catheter during pullback and establish a spatial relationship to the pre-IVUS angiogram. Angio-IVUS co-registration was performed with a research prototype (Siemens Healthcare, Germany) and accuracy was evaluated by distance mismatch between angiography and IVUS images at vessel bifurcations., RESULTS: Median age was 54 (44.5, 67) years. The population was 82.6% male with minimal risk factors. The median (IQR) co-registration distance mismatch measured at 108 bifurcations in 42 (85%) patients was 0.35 (0.00-1.16) mm. Seven patients were excluded due to inappropriate data acquisition (n = 3) and failure of tracking (n = 4), e.g., due to overlapping sternal wires. Estimated effective radiation dose for ECGTF was 0.09 mSv., CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the feasibility of angio-IVUS co-registration which may be used as a clinical tool for localizing IVUS cross-sections along an angiographic roadmap. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

2146,"Complications after stereotactic radiosurgery for brain metastases: Incidences, correlating factors, treatments and outcomes. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Complications after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for brain metastases (BMs) were analyzed in detail using our database including nearly 3000 BM patients., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was an institutional review board-approved, retrospective cohort study using our prospectively accumulated database including 3271 consecutive patients who underwent gamma knife SRS for BMs during the 1998-2016 period. Excluding four patients lost to follow-up, 112 with three-staged treatment and 189 with post-operative irradiation, 2966 who underwent a single-session of SRS only as radical irradiation were studied., RESULTS: The overall median survival time after SRS was 7.8 (95% CI; 7.4-8.1) months. Post-SRS complications occurred in 86 patients (2.9%) 1.9-211.4 (median; 24.0, IQR; 12.0-64.6) months after treatment. RTOG neurotoxicity grades were 2, 3 and 4 in 58, 25 and 3 patients, respectively. Cumulative incidences determined with a competing risk analysis were 1.4%, 2.2%, 2.4%, 2.6% and 2.9% at the 12th, 24th, 36th, 48th and 60th post-SRS month, respectively. Among various pre-SRS clinical factors and radiosurgical parameters, multivariable analyses demonstrated solitary tumor (Adjusted HR; 0.584, 95% CI; 0.381-0.894, p=0.0133), controlled primary cancer (Adjusted HR; 2.595, 95% CI; 1.646-4.091, p<0.0001), no extra-cerebral metastases (Adjusted HR; 1.608, 95% CI; 1.028-2.514, p=0.0374), KPS >=80% (Adjusted HR; 2.715, 95% CI; 1.245-5.924, p=0.0121) and largest tumor volume >=3.3cc (Adjusted HR; 0.516, 95% CI; 0.318-0.836, p=0.0072) to be independently significant predictors of a higher incidence of complications., CONCLUSION: The post-SRS complication incidence is acceptably low (2.9%). Meticulous long-term follow-up after SRS is crucial for all patients. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded
390,"Exposure to electromagnetic fields and risk of central nervous system disease in utility workers. Occupational exposure to electromagnetic fields has been associated with neurological diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, senile dementia, Parkinson disease, and Alzheimer disease. I studied the incidence of central nervous system diseases in 30,631 persons employed in Danish utility companies between 1900 and 1993. I linked the cohort to the nationwide, population-based Danish National Register of Patients and compared the numbers of cases of these diseases observed between 1978 and 1993 with the corresponding rates in the general population. In addition I fit to the data on utility workers a multiplicative Poisson regression model in relation to estimated levels of exposure to 50-Hz electromagnetic fields. Overall, there was an increase in risk for senile dementia and motor neuron diseases combined. The incidences of Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, and other diseases of the central nervous system were essentially unrelated to exposure to electromagnetic fields. A decreased risk of epilepsy compared with the general population probably reflects a healthy worker effect; I observed an increased risk of epilepsy based on internal comparisons. The increased risk for senile dementia and motorneuron diseases may be associated with above-average levels of exposure to electromagnetic fields.",Excluded
161,"[Large mantle fields--indication, technic, tolerance and side effects]. In our Department, the technique of large mantle fields has proved to be a good therapeutic means for supradiaphragmatic and infradiaphragmatic irradiation of several lymph node groups in one irradiation field. With this technique the lymph node groups needing a treatment can be irradiated without overlappings or gaps, and thus the therapy reliability is considerably improved. The side effects are limited with respect to the large volume dose, in the individual case they can easily be eliminated by reducing the single dose. Gastrointestinal side effects can be controlled by chemotherapy in a satisfactory manner. Only in very few cases the modifications of the white blood count necessitated a short interruption of the therapy cycle. Furthermore, the simplified and easily reproducible focussing of the individual fields is especially appreciated by the technical staff.",Excluded
2811,"Nomogram for predicting symptom severity during radiation therapy for head and neck cancer. OBJECTIVES: Radiation therapy (RT), with or without chemotherapy, can cause significant acute toxicity among patients treated for head and neck cancer (HNC), but predicting, before treatment, who will experience a particular toxicity or symptom is difficult. We created and evaluated 2 multivariate models and generated a nomogram to predict symptom severity during RT based on a patient-reported outcome (PRO) instrument, the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Head and Neck Module (MDASI-HN)., STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective, longitudinal, questionnaire-based study., SETTING: Tertiary cancer care center., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Subjects were 264 patients with HNC (mostly oropharyngeal) who had completed the MDASI-HN before and during therapy. Pretreatment variables were correlated with MDASI-HN symptom scores during therapy with multivariate modeling and then were correlated with the composite MDASI-HN score during week 5 of therapy., RESULTS: A multivariate model incorporating pretreatment PROs better predicted MDASI-HN symptom scores during treatment than did a model based on clinical variables and physician-rated patient performance status alone (Akaike information criterion = 1442.5 vs 1459.9). In the most parsimonious model, pretreatment MDASI-HN symptom severity (P < .001), concurrent chemotherapy (P = .006), primary tumor site (P = .016), and receipt of definitive (rather than adjuvant) RT (P = .044) correlated with MDASI-HN symptom scores during week 5. That model was used to construct a nomogram., CONCLUSION: Our model demonstrates the value of incorporating baseline PROs, in addition to disease and treatment characteristics, to predict patient symptom burden during therapy. Although additional investigation and validation are required, PRO-inclusive prediction tools can be useful for improving symptom interventions and expectations for patients being treated for HNC.

234,"Changes in X-ray sensitivity of mouse eggs from fertilization to the early pronuclear stage, and their repair capacity. To study the changes in radiosensitivity of male and female genomes from fertilization to the pronuclear stage, the frequency of induced chromosome aberrations was examined at the first-cleavage metaphase in eggs fertilized with X-irradiated sperm, in eggs X-irradiated at the mature oocyte stage immediately before fertilization, and in fertilized eggs exposed to X-rays at various stages before DNA synthesis (1-5 h after insemination). Gametic treatment, fertilization and embryo culture were carried out in vitro. Most of the induced chromosome aberrations were chromosome-type aberrations, the frequency of chromosome fragments being the highest, followed by chromosome exchanges in both sperm and oocytes. The induction of chromosome-type aberrations was much higher in oocytes than in sperm. Chromosome-type aberrations were the main type also in fertilized eggs irradiated at the pre-DNA-synthetic stage. The radiosensitivity increased gradually with pronuclear formation (1-4h after insemination), but little difference in radiosensitivity was observed between eggs irradiated at 4 h and 5 h, corresponding to the stage when pronuclear formation was complete. The drastic change with pronuclear formation was found not only in radiosensitivity but also in the frequency of chromosome aberrations. The frequency of chromosome-type exchanges decreased drastically 2 h after insemination, and exchanges were barely observed at 5 h. The difference in radiosensitivity between male and female genomes also markedly changed with pronuclear formation, the chromosome aberration induction in the female genome being much higher than that in the male genome before accomplishment of pronuclear formation. The analysis of potentiation effects of 3-aminobenzamide and caffeine on the yield of X-ray-induced chromosome aberrations demonstrated that the increase of radiosensitivity and the decrease of chromosome-type exchange induction with pronuclear formation, may be closely correlated with alterations in chromatin configuration in the pronuclei and in repair capacity of fertilized eggs at the pre-DNA-synthetic stage. No evidence based on repair efficiency was found for the marked difference in radiosensitivity between male and female genomes during pronuclear formation.",Excluded
217,"Occurrence of Phosphenes in Patients Undergoing Proton Beam Therapy for Ocular Tumor. Purpose: Phosphenes are frequently reported by patients irradiated in the head and neck area. The aim of the present study was to characterize and investigate potential mechanisms of proton beam therapy (PBT)-induced phosphenes in a large population of patients undergoing PBT for ocular tumors. Design(s): Prospective cohort study. Method(s): Consecutive patients who underwent PBT in a single center were included. Immediately after the first session, all patients completed a questionnaire collecting information about the presence of phosphenes as well as their color, shape, and duration. Patient, tumor and treatment characteristics (dose volume histograms) were also collected. Result(s): Among the 474 patients included, 62.8% reported phosphenes during the first session of PBT. Reported colors were mainly blue-violet (70.5%) and white (14.1%). The prevalence of phosphenes was higher in younger patients (P =.003); other patient or ocular characteristics were not associated with the occurrence of phosphenes. Irradiation of the macula (P <.001) and/or optic disc (P <.001) were significantly associated with the presence of phosphenes, whereas blue-violet color was only associated with young age and irradiation of macular area (P =.04). Pupillary constriction was reported for 57.1% of patients with phosphenes vs 18.5% of patients without (P <.001). Blue-violet phosphenes (P <.001) and irradiation of macula (P =.001) were statistically associated with pupillary constriction. Conclusion(s): The present study reported a high rate of phosphenes in patients irradiated by PBT for ocular tumor. Their blue-violet color and their association with a pupillary constriction probably indicates the stimulation of S-cones and retinal ganglion cells that reflects the activation of the afferent visual pathway.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1717,"Retreatment of vestibular schwannomas with Gamma Knife surgery. OBJECT: The response rate of vestibular schwannomas (VSs) to radiosurgery has reached the 97% level in several published series. When failure rarely occurs, some controversy has existed as to whether the tumor has to be resected or can be safely retreated with radiosurgery. The authors retrospectively studied the outcome of retreating 11 patients with Gamma Knife surgery (GKS)., METHODS: The authors studied 11 patients at the New England Gamma Knife Center who had undergone GKS as a second radiosurgical treatment for VS from 1994 to 2007. One patient underwent proton-beam radiotherapy as the first treatment, and the other 10 patients had undergone GKS initially. Tumor control (size before and after the first and the second treatment) was evaluated using MR imaging to demonstrate the course after the 2 treatments. Facial nerve function (House-Brackmann grading system), trigeminal nerve function, hearing (Gardner-Robertson classification), and any adverse radiation effects were evaluated. The prescription dose was 12 Gy (11-13.2 Gy) for both treatments., RESULTS: Of the 11 patients, 2 showed increase, 1 had no change, and, in 8, the VS decreased in size after the retreatment. One tumor remained unchanged over the first 6 months, but demonstrated signs of internal necrosis. All patients demonstrated stable facial nerve function. Regarding facial numbness, 2 patients experienced increases, 8 no change, and 1 decreased numbness. There was no functional hearing prior to the second treatment in 10 patients, and hearing was impaired in 1 patient. Adverse radiation effects (slight peduncular edema) were seen in 2 patients after the second treatment, and 1 patient had edema after the first treatment as well., CONCLUSIONS: Vestibular schwannomas can be retreated with GKS with good tumor control response and low risk of toxicity.",Excluded
1707,"Biopsy of pleural thickenings with pocket size ultrasound device. Introduction:Pleural pathology diagnosis is based on the collection of cytological and histological samples. The use of image techniques is becoming more popular to increase accuracy and safety. TAC-guided thoracic biopsy is the most commonly used method but thoracic ultrasound offers some advantages like: absence of ionizing radiations and bedside exploration. Our aim was to analyze effectiveness and safety of the ultrasound-guided pleural biopsies using a pocket size ultrasound device (PSUD). Method(s): A prospective, one-year study from January 2016 to January 2017 was carried out. We included all patients with pleural thickening greater than 3 mm. Pleural biopsy was performed with a 14G gauge automatic needle (Acecut. TSK). Biopsy was completely echo-guided. Result(s):The samples were tagged as adequate sample (AS) or non-adequate sample (NAS) depending on the presence of mesothelium evidenced by the pathologist. Adequate samples (AS) were also tagged as diagnostic samples (DAS) or non-diagnostic samples (NDAS). We enrolled 32 patients. 68.8% were males, mean age of 53 (ED: 31). Biopsy was performed without need of hospitalization in 50 % of the cases. We obtained 26 AS (84.4%). 96.4% of them were diagnostic (DAS). Only one case showed further evidence of pleural involvement in a negative biopsy (mediastinal pleura). The only complication in all the biopsies performed was a pneumothorax without clinical repercussion in a pleural nodule biopsy without pleural effusion. The patient was treated with a conservative approach. Conclusion(s):PSUD is a useful tool to increases effectiveness and safety of the histologic diagnosis of pleural thickening.",Excluded
2503,"Synaptic plasticity in the adult spinal dorsal horn: the appearance of new functional connections following peripheral nerve regeneration. Peripherally regenerated fibers were impaled in the dorsal columns. Each impaled fiber's adequate stimulus was determined and the fiber was activated by passing brief (200 ms) current pulses through the microelectrode. Cord dorsum potentials (CDPs) elicited by fiber stimulation were recorded at 8 sites, and then the fiber was injected with Neurobiotin (NB). In the same preparations, dorsal horn cells were impaled and their receptive fields (RFs) mapped; areas of skin from which the most vigorous responses were elicited were noted. Needle electrodes inserted into these cutaneous ""hot spots"" were used to electrically activate minimal numbers of peripherally regenerated fibers while simultaneously recording the resulting CDPs and any intracellular EPSPs. This allowed determination of connectivity between regenerated fibers and dorsal horn cells with overlapping RFs. In agreement with findings in intact animals, NB revealed long-ranging collaterals which were not seen using intraaxonally injected horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Although there was no qualitative difference in their morphology compared to those seen in controls, the correlation between spatial distribution of boutons and amplitudes of the monosynaptic CDPs of peripherally regenerated fibers revealed significant shifts in the functional efficacy of many central connections. Transcutaneous electrical stimulation revealed a significantly higher incidence of connectivity between regenerated fibers and cells with overlapping RFs at 9-12 months (86%) than at 5-6 months (34%). Although there was no obvious anatomical reorganization of afferent projections in the dorsal horn, the observed functional changes with time following transection show the formation of new functional central connections.",Excluded
459,"Does prior microsurgery improve or worsen the outcomes of stereotactic radiosurgery for cavernous sinus meningiomas?. Background: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is an important option for patients with cavernous sinus meningiomas. Objective(s): To evaluate cranial nerve outcomes in patients who underwent SRS for cavernous sinus meningiomas with or without prior microsurgery. Method(s): During a 23-year interval, 272 patients underwent Gamma Knife SRS for cavernous sinus meningiomas (70 men, 202 women; median age, 54 years). In this series, 99 patients underwent prior microsurgical resection. The median tumor volume was 7.9 cm and median marginal dose was 13 Gy. The median follow-up period was 62 months (range, 6-209 months). Result(s): The progression-free survival after SRS was 96% at 3 years, 94% at 5 years, and 86% at 10 years. After SRS, 13 of 91 patients (14%) who underwent prior microsurgery had improvement of preexisting cranial nerve symptoms or signs. In comparison, 54 of 145 patients (37%) without prior microsurgery had improvement of preexisting cranial nerve symptoms or signs. The improvement rate of cranial nerve deficits after SRS in patients without prior microsurgery was 20% at 1 year, 34% at 2 years, 36% at 3 years, and 39% at 5 years. Patients who had not undergone prior microsurgery had significantly higher improvement rates of preexisting cranial nerve symptoms and signs (P = .001). After SRS, 29 patients (11%) developed new or worsened cranial nerve function. Conclusion(s): SRS provided long-term effective tumor control and a low risk of new cranial nerve deficits. Improvement in preexisting cranial neuropathies was detected in significantly more patients who had not undergone prior microsurgical procedures. © 2013 by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.",Excluded
141,"Dramatic and prolonged decrease of whole salivary secretion in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients treated with radiotherapy. Objectives. This study evaluates: (1) the change in whole salivary secretion rates of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients before, during, and after radiotherapy, especially during the first week of irradiation; (2) the recovery capability of salivary glands up to 2 years postirradiation; and (3) the possible prognostic factors affecting salivary gland functions. Study design. Fifty patients who completed conventional radiotherapy using either once-per-day or hyperfractionated technique were included. Both unstimulated and stimulated whole salivary flow rates and ratios (flow rate compared with baseline) were measured before, during, 1, 3, and 6 months, and 1 and 2 years after radiotherapy. Multivariate analysis of potential prognostic factors affecting the salivary secretion ratio was made. Results. Salivary glands were very radiosensitive and responded to radiation very early. After 720 cGy at the fourth day of the 8-week treatment, the unstimulated and stimulated salivary flow rates had decreased by 40%-50%. The nadir was reached in many patients after 3600 cGy (4 weeks). A second phase of decrease in salivary secretion was noted after completion of radiotherapy. Conclusions. Different mechanisms may be responsible for salivary response after low and high dose of radiation. This study shows no recovery of salivary secretion during the follow-up period, and the best strategy for managing radiation-induced salivary gland damage may be reduction of radiation dose to the glands. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

1435,"Geometrical changes of parotid, submandibular, and thyroid glands during intensity modulated radiation therapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Purpose/Objective(s): Both the tumor and organs at risk (OARs) occurred considerable changes during the intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) course for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). This study aims to analyze quantitatively the geometrical variations of the parotid, submandibular gland (SMG) and thyroid as three independent OARs throughout IMRT course. Materials/Methods: Twenty NPC patients received the definitive chemo-IMRT in 33 fractions within 6.5 week-long course. Each patient had a planning CT (pCT) and six weekly repeat CT (rCT) without enhanced contrast. Each rCT was rigidly registered to its pCT. The parotid, SMG and thyroid were manually delineated in the axial pCT and rCT imaging by a single radiation oncologist. When compared a contour in pCT with rCT, it was calculated the volume of each contour (V-pCT, V-rCT), the common volume (V-com) and the shortest perpendicular distance (SPD) between two contours. Each surface voxel of a contour in rCT has a SPD and the standard deviation (SD) of all the SPDs was calculated. Both the SPD and Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) calculated as 2*V-com / (V-pCT + V-rCT) were used as the surrogate of the shape variations. The displacement of center of mass as the positional shift was calculated and the mean displacement, system and random error were statistically calculated. The difference of geometrical changes among six week, the left- and right- sided OAR was compared using one-way analysis of variance or Mann-Whitney U test. Result(s): The mean radiation dose of the parotid, SMG, thyroid gland were 32.12 >= 11.2 Gy, 25.46 >= 8.62 Gy, 18.89 >= 10.24 Gy, (mean >= standard deviation) respectively. And their mean and maximal volume reduction were 28.6% >= 14.6%, 26.6% >= 17.1%, 12.3% >= 11.3% and 40.6% >= 12.4%, 38.9%>=14.9%, 16.3%>=14.3%, respectively. For the parotid and SMG, the volume loss per treatment day decreased from 1.7%, 1.6% in the first week to 0.5%, 0.6% in the last week, and that of thyroid was of 0.4% - 0.5% after the 2nd week. The center of mass displacement of parotid gland shifted medially 2.0 mm - 2.6 mm, SMG and thyroid did medially 0.1 mm - 0.5 mm. In addition, the displacement in anterior-posterior and cranial-caudal direction were < 0.6 mm. The 3-demensional vector displacements of the parotid and SMG were 2.2mme 2.9mmand that of thyroid were 4.0mm- 4.3 mm. The DSCs of parotid, SMGand thyroid showed the decreased time-trend. For the parotid, SMG, thyroid, the SD of SPDs increased from 1.5 mm e 1.8 mm in the first week to 2.1mme2.5 mm. The variations among the different weeks were statistically different (P < 0.05) and there was no difference between the left- and right-sided OARs (P> 0.05). Conclusion(s): For NPC, the volume, position and shape of parotid, SMG, thyroid occurred in quantifiable variations and these geometrical changes have their time-trend, which suggests the necessity of re-planning for the further sparing of OAR further during IMRT.",Excluded
1262,"Femoral artery dopplerfluxometry of adult healthy dogs (canis lupus familiaris). Background: In Veterinary Medicine, there are several methods for early and accurate assessment of blood flow dynamics. The Dopplerfluxometry can access the peak systolic velocity, mean velocity and end diastolic velocity, including Resistive Index and Pulsatility Index. Normal values of Dopplerfluxometry in healthy dogs allow the identification of vascular abnormalities and authors' knowledge there are no reference regarding the values of Dopplerfluxometry of the femoral artery in healthy dogs. The aim of the study was to assess the femoral Dopplerfluxometry of adult healthy dogs by Resistive Index, Pulsatility Index, systolic and diastolic velocities, and femoral artery diameter. Materials, Methods & Results: Eighteen healthy intact beagle dogs, male and female, aging from 2 to 4 years old (mean +/- SD: mean 3 +/- 0.8 years), weighing from 10.1-17.9 kg [22.3-39.5 lb] [mean +/- SD: 14.3 +/- 2.7 kg (31.5 +/- 5.96 lb)] were used. The dogs underwent to physical examination, complete blood cell count, serum biochemistry examination urinalysis, and radiographs examination, muscular and cardiac evaluation. Females had to be in anestrous. All dogs were submitted to right femoral artery Dopplerfluxometry. The dogs were positioned in dorsal recumbency by one person without any chemical restraint. A high definition ultrasound device equipped with a 3 - 13 MHz multi-frequency linear transducer was used. The right femoral artery was identified with the transducer positioned transversely on the right triangle femoral area. Peak systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity was measured. The Resistivity Index and Pulsatility Index were calculated automatically by the ultrasound machine software. Three measurements were obtained with the Doppler spectrum. The values of peak systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity, Resistivity Index, Pulsatility Index and femoral artery diameter were expressed as Mean +/- Standard Deviation (SD). Discussion(s): No studies regarding to femoral artery Dopplerfluxometry in healthy dogs were found in the literature. These results can be used as normal reference values of Dopplerfluxometric parameters for adult dogs. The literature cited only Dopplerfluxometric values of renal arteries, abdominal aorta and of the internal thoracic artery. The normal values of arterial Dopplerfluxometry is necessary to identify the spectral quantitative characteristics of the blood flow for diagnosis and prognosis of vascular diseases. Authors referred to changes in blood perfusion by Dopplerfluxometry examination, but no changes in B-mode ultrasonography. The femoral Resistivity Index values can be used to correlate the postoperative evolution in dogs submitted to femoral bone, hip and knee surgeries, since Dopplerfluxometry allows blood flow assessment in the femoral region muscles. Changes in the heart rate, blood pressure, stress, exercise, and diseases as hypotension, renal lesion, hepatic diseases, diabetes, hyperadrenocorticism can change the Dopplerfluxometric parameters. All dogs which used in this study were clinically healthy, and were used beagle dogs due to lowest variations within breed. Sedation was avoid due to possible changes in Dopplerfluxometric parameters since the use of sedation or tranquilization in animals is strongly discussed due to possible hemodynamic changes that may occur during the examination. In conclusion, the mean values of the right femoral artery Dopplerfluxometry in male and female adult healthy dogs is Resistivity Index (0.887); Pulsatility Index (1.599); peak systolic velocity (124.41 cm/s), end-diastolic velocity (14.12 cm/s), femoral artery diameter (3.9 mm).Copyright © 2018 Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul.

993,"The impact of body mass index on the efficacy and safety of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation. Background: Obesity is a well established risk factor for atrial fibrillation (AF) development. Our purpose was to determine the impact of body mass index (BMI) on the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency catheter ablation of AF. Method(s): Two hundred and twenty-six consecutive patients with symptomatic, drug-refractory paroxysmal (59.3%) and persistent (40.7%) AF underwent wide circumferential electrical pulmonary vein isolation. Patients were classified according to BMI as normal (< 25 kg/m2); overweight (25 to 29.9 kg/m2); and obese (>= 30 kg/m2). Result(s): Patients with high BMI were younger and displayed a higher rate of hypertension, increased left atrial diameter, increased left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters, and increased levels of several conventional markers of inflammation and oxidative stress including white blood cell count, fibrinogen, uric acid, alanine aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyltransferase (p < 0.05). After a mean follow-up period of 432.32 +/- 306.09 days from the index procedure, AF recurrence rate was 34.9% for normal weight, 46.2% for overweight, and 46.2% for obese patients (p: 0.258). Subjects classified above the 50th percentile for BMI displayed a trend toward a higher AF recurrence rate (p: 0.08). In univariate Cox regression survival analysis, BMI was not predictive of AF recurrence. Radiation exposure was significantly higher in overweight and obese patients in relation to normal weight patients (p: 0.003). No significant differences regarding major complications were observed among BMI groups. Conclusion(s): In this study population, BMI was not an independent predictor of AF recurrence following left atrial catheter ablation. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Excluded
1248,"An ecological study of cancer incidence and radon levels in South West England. To investigate the relationship of domestic radon levels and cancer, the incidence of 14 major cancers in Devon and Cornwall were examined in relation to the local radon levels. Cancer registrations for 1989-1992 were provided by the South-Western Regional Cancer Registry. The average radon levels for postcode sectors were sorted into ten categories from low (< 40 Bq/m3) to extremely high (> or = 230 Bq/m3) and age-standardised incidence rates were calculated for each radon category. The incidence rates for lung cancer, where radon has been claimed to be a risk factor, were very similar across all domestic radon categories. Only non-melanoma skin cancers, showed a significant increase in incidence in the high-radon postcode sectors (> or = 100 Bq/m3) compared with the low-radon sectors (< 60 Bq/m3) and this effect was observed for both sexes. The remaining 12 cancer sites showed no significant trend in incidence rates with increasing radon concentration. There was no significant difference in corrected survival rates for any cancer site between the low- and high-radon areas.

3571,"The value of the initial post-EVAR computed tomography angiography scan in predicting future secondary procedures using the Powerlink stent graft. Objective: Current long-term surveillance after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) is based on high-resolution contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans at scheduled, lifelong intervals. The cancer and nephrotoxicity risks of interval CT scanning and prolonged radiation exposure are concerning. We sought to determine if surveillance CT angiography (CTA) can be safely reduced. Method(s): From July 2000 to November 2007, 345 patients were enrolled in U.S. Food and Drug Administration trials of the Powerlink System (Endologix, Irvine, Calif). An independent core laboratory analyzed 1519 post-EVAR CT scans (N = 1519) to 5 years to evaluate aneurysm size, migration, presence of endoleak, and evidence of graft obstruction. Analyses were conducted to determine the value of the initial CTA scan in predicting future secondary procedures in enrolled patients. Result(s): At any time during follow-up, CTA identified endoleak in 123 patients (36%), with 95% of endoleaks being type II. In addition, 49 patients underwent 72 secondary procedures at a mean of 22 +/- 21 months (range, 2-2007 days) after initial EVAR. These were based on clinical identification of limb ischemia in 13 interventions (18%) or core laboratory identification of abnormal CT finding in 58 interventions (81%). Of the 58 core laboratory identified findings, the inciting abnormality was present on the initial postoperative scan in 49 (84%). Of the remaining nine CT-driven procedures, three (5.2%) were due to late sac expansion attributed to type II endoleak (n= 2) or endotension (n= 1); two (3.4%) were for prophylactic reasons in the absence of endoleak; and four (6.8%) were in patients with type II endoleak not observed by the core laboratory and without sac expansion. The negative predictive value of the initial postoperative CTA for the need for a secondary procedure is therefore 96.4%, which can be improved to 97.6% with duplex ultrasound surveillance to detect sac expansion. Thus, a negative initial postoperative CTA is highly predictive of long-term freedom from secondary intervention. Conclusion(s): Among enrolled patients with suitable anatomy for EVAR, most abnormalities that result in a secondary procedure are detected on the initial postoperative CTA or present with clinical symptoms. Long-term surveillance CTA may therefore be replaced by duplex ultrasound imaging if the initial postoperative CTA shows no abnormalities.

Result(s): Between January 1996 and April 1998, 871 Dutch and 94 other patients were randomised. Our feasibility analysis shows that cooperation between and within the participating disciplines goes well. With regard to the surgical part, this can be confirmed by the large number of operations attended by consultant surgeons (58%). The number of abdominoperineal resections appeared to be low (30%), as did the percentage of lateral margins involved (13%). The rate of adverse effects of radiotherapy was acceptable. Apart from a larger operative blood loss and a higher infective complication rate in the irradiated group, no significant differences were found with regard to morbidity and mortality between the randomised groups. Conclusion(s): The accrual of our trial is going well and it is feasible; short term preoperative radiotherapy is safe even in combination with TME.",Excluded
2112,"Emergency readmission following elective endoscopy: Audit of 29 868 day-case procedures performed at four teaching hospitals in northwest england. Introduction Despite emergency readmission being a NHS quality indicator and unplanned admission after elective endoscopy a GRS auditable outcome; there is a lack of audit standards and difficulties in attaining these data due to limitations in hospital IT systems. Commercial analytical reporting tools that use NHS administrative data can generate local reports from HES and may serve as a starting point for clinical audit. Aim To determine the prevalence, demographics, aetiology and outcomes of emergency readmissions following elective endoscopy. Methods From 1.4.08 to 31.3.09 emergency admissions within 6 days of a day-case upper or lower GI endoscopy (ERCP excluded) were identified from analyses of NHS administrative data at RLUH, AUH, SRH, and SMUH. Using a standard proforma, each readmission was audited using case notes, endoscopy database, and the hospital informatics systems. Two senior doctors determined the validity of the admission subdividing them into; unrelated, possible and definite with the latter two categories defining an endoscopy readmission. Results Of the 29 868 daycases, 235 admissions were identified, of which 147 were endoscopy readmissions. The following data all relates to endoscopy readmissions. Demographics Male: Female ratio=1:1; Mean age (SD): 65.1 years (17).Readmission rate overall was 0.49%(0.56% for upper and 0.42% for lower GI procedures) with highest rates for therapeutic uppers (1.75%) > therapeutic lowers (0.56%) > diagnostic upper (0.47%) > diagnostic lower (0.38%). Aetiology The most common reasons for admission were vascular events (26.5%) > Symptoms such as pain (17%), GI haemorrhage (17%), suspected/confirmed perforation (17% (confirmed 6.1%))> respiratory (10.2%) causes >bowel obstruction (4.8%): Investigations 71% required simple blood tests and/or x-rays and 26%, cross-sectional imaging. Treatment 84.4% required only observation, 4.8%; surgery, 2.7%; repeat endoscopy, and 7.5% IV antibiotics. Outcomes 24.5% were short-stays discharges from either AED, or medical/Surgical assessment units. Mean LOS was 8.2 (13) days and 30-day mortality was 6.8%. Conclusion Commercial analytical reporting tools combined with local interpretation and multicentre collaboration was essential for determining useful information regarding endoscopy readmissions. Readmission rates predictably varied with the procedure type (0.38-1.75%) with therapeutic procedures having the highest. While most patients required simple observation/supportive care, LOS was considerable and mortality rate among readmitted cases was significant.",Excluded
2634,"[123 I]Iodometomidate for molecular imaging of adrenocortical cytochrome P450 family 11B enzymes. BACKGROUND: Due to advances in conventional imaging, adrenal tumors are detected with increasing frequency. However, conventional imaging provides only limited information on the origin of these lesions, which represent a wide range of different pathological entities. New specific imaging methods would therefore be of great clinical value. We, therefore, studied the potential of iodometomidate (IMTO) as tracer for molecular imaging of cytochrome P450 family 11B (Cyp11B) enzymes., METHODS: Inhibition of Cyp11B1 and Cyp11B2 by IMTO, etomidate, metomidate, and fluoroetomidate was investigated in NCI-h295 cells and in Y1 cells stably expressing hsCyp11B1 or hsCyp11B2. Pharmacokinetics and biodistribution after iv injection of [(123/125)I]IMTO were analyzed in mice in biodistribution experiments and by small-animal single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Furthermore, four patients with known adrenal tumors (two metastatic adrenal adenocarcinomas, one bilateral adrenocortical adenoma, and one melanoma metastasis) were investigated with [(123)I]iodometomidate-SPECT., RESULTS: In cell culture experiments, all compounds potently inhibited both Cyp11B1 and Cyp11B2. Adrenals showed high and specific uptake of [(123/125)I]IMTO and were excellently visualized in mice. In patients, adrenocortical tissue showed high and specific tracer uptake in both primary tumor and metastases with short investigation time and low radiation exposure, whereas the non-adrenocortical tumor did not exhibit any tracer uptake., CONCLUSION: We have successfully completed the development of an in vivo detection system of adrenal Cyp11B enzymes by [(123)I]IMTO scintigraphy in both experimental animals and humans. Our findings suggest that [(123)I]IMTO is a highly specific radiotracer for imaging of adrenocortical tissue. Due to the general availability of SPECT technology, we anticipate that [(123)I]IMTO scintigraphy may become a widely used tool to characterize adrenal lesions.",Excluded
3518,"Effect of cobalt-60 gamma radiation on reproductive disturbance in freshwater prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii (De Man, 1879). The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of acute level of 60Co gamma radiation on fecundity of freshwater prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii. Prawns were exposed to four different dose levels (3, 30, 300 and 3000 mGy) and their reproductive disturbances i.e Gonadosomatic Index (GSI), Egg Clutch somatic Index (ESI), Egg Counts and Egg hatching rates were calculated. The experimental group showed significant reduction in GSI (0.47 +/- 0.01) & ESI (1.22 +/- 0.08) after exposure to 60Co gamma radiation. Egg Count (3713 +/- 21) and Egg hatching rates (3798 +/- 11) were significantly reduced in all irradiated groups. The number of dead larva increased with the increasing level of doses. With the increase in dosage level, the gonad and egg clutch weight were decreased which likely lead to reduced number of eggs. Our results proved that even low level of ionizing radiation (60Co) affects the fecundities of freshwater crustacean M. rosenbergii.Copyright © 2019 The Authors",Excluded
1678,"Absence of radiographic progression of hip arthritis during infliximab treatment for ankylosing spondylitis. This study aims to examine the impact of long-term treatment with the anti-TNF antibody infliximab on radiographic progression of hip arthritis in ankylosing spondylitis. Anteroposterior X-rays of the pelvis obtained at baseline from consecutive patients with ankylosing spondylitis and bilateral hip arthritis were compared with X-rays obtained after 6 +/- 2.5 years (mean +/- SD) of continuous infliximab treatment. Analysis was performed by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Radiology Hip Index (BASRI-h) scoring system (min 0, max 4). Hip joint space width was also assessed by the average of measurements at three distinct sites between the acetabulum and femoral head. In 23 patients with active disease (21 men, mean age and disease duration of 45 and 16 years, respectively), the BASRI-h score at baseline was 1 in 7, 2 in 16, 3 in 16, and 4 in 7 hips (including two arthroplasties). Individual BASRI-h scores at baseline (2.50 +/- 0.86, mean +/- SD) remained unchanged in all patients at end of follow-up. At baseline, the average width of the whole joint space (3.56 +/- 0.70 mm, n = 44) was not associated with disease activity measurements but negatively correlated with BAS functional index (Spearman r = -0.5, P = 0.007). After 2-10 years of infliximab treatment, the average width of the whole joint space in these patients (3.59 +/- 0.79 mm) was not reduced. These results suggest that radiographic progression of hip arthritis in ankylosing spondylitis may be arrested during infliximab treatment.",Excluded
1425,"Optimized demineralization of human cancellous bone by application of a vacuum. Human demineralized bone matrix derived from cortical bone is used by surgeons due to its ability to promote bone formation. There is also a need for shaped demineralized bone matrices made from cancellous bone, where the properties of the material allow its insertion into defects, therefore acting as a void filler and scaffold onto which new bone can form. In this study, we report that demineralized bone sponges were prepared by dissecting and cutting knee bone into cancellous bone cubes of 1 cm3. These cubes were then taken through a series of warm water washes, some with sonication, centrifugation, and two decontamination chemical washes. The cubes were optimally demineralized into sponges with 0.5N hydrochloric acid under vacuum with constant pH measurement. Demineralization was confirmed by quantitative measurement of calcium and qualitatively by compression. The sponges were freeze dried before terminal sterilisation with a target dose of 25 kGy gamma radiation whilst frozen. Samples of the sponges were histologically examined for calcium and collagen and also tested for osteoinductivity. Data showed well defined collagen staining in the sponges, with little residual calcium. Sponges from two out of three donors demonstrated osteoinductivity when implanted into the muscle of an athymic mouse.Copyright © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) during pregnancy or the early postpartum period is rare, but can be devastating for both the mother and the fetus. There have been major advances in the diagnosis and treatment of acute coronary syndromes in the general population, but there is little consensus on the approach to diagnosis and treatment of pregnant women. This article reviews the literature relating to the pathophysiology of AMI in pregnant patients and the challenges in diagnosis and treatment of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in this unique population. From a cardiologist, maternal-fetal medicine specialist, and anesthesiologist's perspective, we provide recommendations for the diagnosis and management of STEMI occurring during pregnancy.

977,"Comparison of ultrasound-assisted and pure fluoroscopy-guided extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy for renal stones. Background: In this study, we aimed to compare the efficacy and clinical outcomes of shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) for patients with renal stones using pure fluoroscopy (FS) or ultrasound-assisted (USa) localization with two lithotripters. Method(s): We retrospectively identified 425 patients with renal calculi who underwent SWL with either a LiteMed LM-9200 ELMA lithotripter (209 cases), which combined ultrasound and fluoroscopic stone targeting or a Medispec EM-1000 lithotripter machine (216 cases), which used fluoroscopy for stone localization and tracking. The patient demographic data, stone-free rates, stone disintegration rates, retreatment rates and complication rates were analyzed. Result(s): The USa group had a significantly higher overall stone-free rate (43.6 vs. 28.2%, p < 0.001) and stone disintegration rate (85.6 vs. 64.3%, p < 0.001), as well as a significantly lower retreatment rate (14.8 vs. 35.6%, p < 0.001) and complication rate (1.9 vs. 5.5%, p = 0.031) compared with the FS group. This superiority remained significant in the stone size < 1 cm stratified group. In the stone size > 1 cm group, the stone-free rate (32.4 vs. 17.8%, p = 0.028), disintegration rate (89.2 vs. 54.8%, p = 0.031) and retreatment rate (21.6 vs. 53.4%, p < 0.001) were still significantly better in the USa group, however there was no significant difference in the complication rate. The most common complication was post-SWL-related flank pain. Conclusion(s): SWL is a safe and non-invasive way of treating renal stones. This study compared two electromagnetic shock wave machines with different stone tracking systems. LiteMed LM-9200 ELMA lithotripter, which combined ultrasound and fluoroscopic stone targeting outperformed Medispec EM-1000 lithotripter, which used fluoroscopy for stone localization and tracking, with better stone-free rates and disintegration rates, as well as lower retreatment rates and complications with possible reduced radiation exposure.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded
2589,"Short chain fatty acids are effective in short-term treatment of chronic radiation proctitis: randomized, double-blind, controlled trial. PURPOSE: Short chain fatty acids are the main energy source of colonocytes and their use may be impaired in chronic radiation proctitis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the therapeutic effect of short chain fatty acid enemas in patients with chronic radiation proctitis., METHODS: A prospective, randomized, double-blind trial comparing short chain fatty acid enemas with placebo was conducted in 19 patients with chronic radiation proctitis. Short chain fatty acid enemas contained 60 mM sodium acetate, 30 mM sodium propionate, and 40 mM sodium butyrate. The treatment period lasted five weeks and patients were followed up for six months., RESULTS: On admission, both groups were similar regarding all parameters evaluated. After five weeks short chain fatty acid-treated patients showed a significant decrease in the number of days with rectal bleeding from the previous week (4.4+/-1.8 to 1.4+/-2.2; P = 0.001) and an improvement of endoscopic score (4.8+/-1.4 to 2.2+/-1.2; P = 0.001). Hemoglobin values were also significantly higher in short chain fatty acid-treated patients (13.1+/-0.9 g/dl vs. 10.7+/-2.1 g/dl; P = 0.02). Mucosal DNA and protein concentrations decreased in both groups but significantly so only in placebo-treated patients (P = 0.05). Changes in histologic parameters were not significant in either group. Although short chain fatty acid-treated patients did not get worse in the next six months, placebo-treated ones gradually improved, and at the end of six months, differences between the two groups were no longer observed., CONCLUSIONS: Short chain fatty acid enemas can accelerate the process of healing in chronic radiation proctitis, but treatment has to be continuous if a complete and sustained clinical, endoscopic, and histologic response is to be obtained.",Excluded
938,"Failure patterns relative to radiation treatment fields for stage II-IV thymoma. INTRODUCTION: The optimal radiation therapy (RT) field design for thymomas remains unclear. Here we report the failure patterns in stage II-IV thymoma after RT at two tertiary referral centers, classified according to the new International Thymic Malignancy Interest Group definitions. METHOD(S): We reviewed 156 stage II-IV patients with thymoma treated with definitive (n=24) or adjuvant (n=132) RT. All RT was delivered without elective nodal irradiation (median dose 5040 cGy). Intrathoracic failures were classified as (1) in-field failures (within 100% isodose line [IDL]), (2) marginal recurrences (<100% and >=50% IDL), and (3) out-of-field failures (outside the 50% IDL). RESULT(S): The median follow-up was 61 months. Surgical margins were positive in 39%. The median tumor size was 9 cm. The 5-year cumulative incidence of all intrathoracic failures was 24% (n=34). Failures occurred within the RT field (n=5), marginally (n=1), out-of-field (n=22), and synchronously in- and out-of-field (n=6). The 5-year cumulative incidence of in-field failures was 7%. These were associated with Masaoka stage and tumor size. Macroscopically positive margins were associated with more local failures. Intrathoracic failures occurred most commonly in the pleural space (n=29) and lymph nodes (n=9). Patients with more advanced stage, and those treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy had more intrathoracic failures. RT dose and chemotherapy did not impact failure patterns. CONCLUSION(S): Although there were few in-field failures in patients who received RT for stage II-IV thymomas, a high rate of out-of-field intrathoracic failures still occurred. Further study is necessary to identify treatment approaches that prevent pleural recurrences. Copyright © 2014 by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.",Excluded
2766,"Definitive high-dose photon/proton radiotherapy for unresected mobile spine and sacral chordomas. Study Design.: A retrospective review. Objective.: The purpose of this study is to report the results of high-dose proton based definitive radiotherapy for unresected spinal chordomas. Summary of Background Data.: Spine chordoma is treated primarily by surgical resection. However, local recurrence rate is high. Adjuvant radiotherapy improves local control. In certain locations, such as high sacrum, resection may result in significant neurological dysfunction. Methods.: We retrospectively reviewed 24 patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated spinal chordomas (core biopsy only; no prior incision or resection) treated with high-dose definitive radiotherapy alone using protons and photons at our center from 1988 to 2009. Results.: Reasons for radiotherapy alone included medical inoperability (3) and concern for neurological dysfunction based on spine level (21). Median age was 69.5 years. Tumor locations included cervical (2), thoracic (1), lumbar (2), S1-S2 (17), and S3 or below (2). Median maximal tumor diameter was 6.6 cm (1.4-25.5), and median tumor volume was 198.3 cm (4.65-2061). Median total dose was 77.4 GyRBE (proton dose unit, gray relative biological effectiveness). Analysis at median follow-up of 56 months showed overall survival of 91.7% and 78.1%, chordoma specific survival of 95.7% and 81.5%, local progression free survival of 90.4% and 79.8% and metastases free survival of 86.5% and 76.3%, at 3 and 5 years respectively. Tumor volume more than 500 cm was correlated with worse overall survival. Long-term side effects included 8 sacral insufficiency fractures (none required surgical stabilization), 1 secondary malignancy, 1 foot drop, 1 erectile dysfunction, 1 perineal numbness, 2 worsening urinary/fecal incontinence, and 4 grade-2 rectal bleeding. None required new colostomy. All surviving patients remained ambulatory. Conclusion.: These results support the use of high-dose definitive radiotherapy for patients with medically inoperable or otherwise unresected, mobile spine or sacrococcygeal chordomas.

3615,"Is it possible to avoid hypopituitarism after the irradiation of pituitary adenomas by the Leksell gamma-knife?. Radiation therapy is used in the treatment of pituitary adenomas, especially in failures of neurosurgery and pharmacotherapy to reduce the size of adenomas and normalize their hypersecretion. Conventional fractionated radiotherapy has achieved good results, but only after a long latency, with considerable postradiation morbidity and with very frequent appearance of hypopituitarism. The focal stereotactic targeting allowed by Leksell gamma-knife (LGK) was supposed to decrease the incidence of hypopituitarism, however our first patients treated by LGK developed hypopituitarism in 38.2%. Consequently, we have analyzed factors leading to this unfavorable outcome and suggested that the mean dose of irradiation on pituitary tissue is the most important cause of hypopituitarism. Result(s): Seventy-five patients (47 women and 28 men) with pituitary adenomas (39 with acromegaly, 17 prolactinomas, 8 with Cushing's disease, 1 with Nelson's syndrome and 9 functionless adenomas), where the mean dose of irradiation on pituitary tissue was measured, were followed 60-180 (mean 91.1) months. In 41 patients, the mean dose of irradiation on pituitary was more than 15 Gy. The hypopituitarism at least in one axis developed in 29 (70.7%) patients during 10-126 months after the irradiation. In 34 patients, the mean dose on pituitary was less than 15 Gy. Only one patient (1.2%) developed hypopituitarism 12 months after the irradiation. This patient had undergone two previous pituitary surgeries and had already central hypothyreosis when irradiated. Conclusion(s): To avoid hypopituitarism the radiation dose of 15 Gy is the maximum safe limit of the mean dose of radiation to the pituitary tissue surrounding the adenoma. This cut off should become a rule when irradiating pituitary adenomas - just like the dose rules of 7 Gy on the optical tract or 14 Gy on the brainstem.",Excluded

Introduction: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with CDDP plus 5-FU is considered the standard treatment for stage IB/II/III esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in Japan. However, patient survival remains unsatisfactory. Objective(s): We conducted a feasibility study of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NeoCRT) with CDDP plus 5-FU and elective nodal irradiation in patients with stage IB/II/III ESCC. Aim of follow up study is to clarify the long term outcome and site of recurrence. Material(s) and Method(s): Eligibility criteria included clinical stage IB/II/III ESCC, a PS of 0-1, and age of 20-75 years. Chemotherapy consisted of 2 courses of 5-FU (1000mg/m2, days 1-4) and CDDP (75mg/m2, day 1), with a 4week interval. Radiotherapy was concurrently administered to a total dose of 41.4Gy in 23 fractions. After completion of CRT, transthoracic esophagectomy with extensive lymphadenectomy (>D2) was performed. Result(s): Thirty-three patients (pts) were enrolled in this study between July 2010 and June 2011, and 2 were determined to be ineligible. Characteristics of the 31 eligible patients included a median age of 63 years (range, 40-73 years), male/female ratio of 28/3, PS 0/1 distribution of 19/12, and cStage IIA/IIB/III distribution of 2/10/19. In total, 31 patients (100%) underwent NeoCRT, and 25 (81%) underwent surgery; 1patient (3%) did not undergo surgery due to disease progression. Among the patients who underwent surgery, there was 1 treatment-related death. After 54.3 month of follow up time, 9 patients had recurred in regional only (2pts) and with any distant lesion (7pts). The 3- year recurrence free and overall survival rates were 60.9% and 70.8%, respectively. No >=grade3 late toxicities were seen.

Number and modality of imaging studies were collected. Effective radiation exposure (ERE) doses were calculated from the dose length product values reported with each computed tomography (CT) scan., RESULTS: There were 72 males and 32 females with a mean age of 49 years (range 21-78). Patients underwent an average 1.8 (range 0-5) and 0.7 (range 0-2) plain radiographs, 0.82 (range 0-4) and 0.15 (range 0-2) CTs, 0.09 (range 0-1) and 0.03 (range 0-1) intravenous urograms, and 0.3 (range 0-1) and 0.6 (range 0-2) ultrasounds (US) during the first and second years, respectively (all P<.05). The average calculated ERE dose per CT scan was 23.16 mSv (range 4.94-72.77). The calculated mean ERE dose per patient significantly decreased from 29.29 mSv (range 1.7-77.27) in the first year to 8.04 mSv (range 1.4-24.72) in the second year (P<.01). This was because of significantly fewer CT scans and significantly more US imaging during the second year (P<.05). Although 18 (17.3%) patients exceeded 50 mSv during the first year, none exceeded this threshold during the second year. The mean ERE dose did not correlate with stone location, patient age, and sex., CONCLUSION: The calculated mean ERE dose significantly decreased during the second year of follow-up in patients with urolithiasis because of significantly higher use of US.

1787,"V30 as a predictor for radiation-induced hypothyroidism: A dosimetric analysis in patients who received radiotherapy to the neck. Introduction: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the possible predictors of thyroid disorders after neck radiotherapy, with a focus on radiation dose-volume factors. Method(s): Thyroid function was measured in 100 patients who had received radiotherapy to the neck, including the thyroid. All radiation-induced thyroid dysfunctions were determined with an endpoint of abnormal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (fT3) and thyroxine (fT4) and thyroid peroxidase antibodies and (TPA). The total volume of the thyroid, mean radiation dose to the thyroid (Dmean) and thyroid volume percentage that received radiation doses of 10-50 Gy (V10-V50) were calculated in all patients. The evaluated risk factors for thyroid dysfunction included dose-volume parameters, sex, age, previous surgery, chemotherapy and comorbidity. Result(s): There were 52 patients with hypothyroidism and V30 (p = 0.03), thyroid volume (p = 0.01) and Dmean (p = 0.03) appeared to be correlated with hypothyroidism in univariate analysis. However, there was not association found in multivariate analysis for these factors. Conclusion(s): Thyroid disorders after radiation therapy to the neck still represent a clinically underestimated problem. V30 may be a useful tool for evaluating the risk of hypothyroidism when determining an individual patient's treatment. © 2014 Akgun et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
1421,"DPYD, TYMS, TYMP, TK1, and TK2 genetic expressions as response markers in locally advanced rectal cancer patients treated with fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiotherapy. This study is to investigate multiple chemotherapeutic agent- and radiation-related genetic biomarkers in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) patients following fluoropyrimidine-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) for response prediction. We initially selected 6 fluoropyrimidine metabolism-related genes (DPYD, ORPT, TYMS, TYMP, TK1, and TK2) and 3 radiotherapy response-related genes (GLUT1, HIF-1 alpha, and HIF-2 alpha) as targets for gene expression identification in 60 LARC cancer specimens. Subsequently, a high-sensitivity weighted enzymatic chip array was designed and constructed to predict responses following CCRT. After CCRT, 39 of 60 (65%) LARC patients were classified as responders (pathological tumor regression grade 2 ~ 4). Using a panel of multiple genetic biomarkers (chip), including DPYD, TYMS, TYMP, TK1, and TK2, at a cutoff value for 3 positive genes, a sensitivity of 89.7% and a specificity of 81% were obtained (AUC: 0.915; 95% CI: 0.840-0.991). Negative chip results were significantly correlated to poor CCRT responses (TRG 0-1) (P = 0.014, hazard ratio: 22.704, 95% CI: 3.055-235.448 in multivariate analysis). Disease-free survival analysis showed significantly better survival rate in patients with positive chip results (P = 0.0001). We suggest that a chip including DPYD, TYMS, TYMP, TK1, and TK2 genes is a potential tool to predict response in LARC following fluoropyrimidine-based CCRT. © 2013 Ming-Yii Huang et al.",Excluded
1269,"GUCY2C signaling opposes the acute radiation-induced GI syndrome. High doses of ionizing radiation induce acute damage to epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, mediating toxicities restricting the therapeutic efficacy of radiation in cancer and morbidity and mortality in nuclear disasters. No approved prophylaxis or therapy exists for these toxicities, in part reflecting an incomplete understanding of mechanisms contributing to the acute radiation-induced GI syndrome (RIGS). Guanylate cyclase C (GUCY2C) and its hormones guanylin and uroguanylin have recently emerged as one paracrine axis defending intestinal mucosal integrity against mutational, chemical, and inflammatory injury. Here, we reveal a role for the GUCY2C paracrine axis in compensatory mechanisms opposing RIGS. Eliminating GUCY2C signaling exacerbated RIGS, amplifying radiation-induced mortality, weight loss, mucosal bleeding, debilitation, and intestinal dysfunction. Durable expression of GUCY2C, guanylin, and uroguanylin mRNA and protein by intestinal epithelial cells was preserved following lethal irradiation inducing RIGS. Oral delivery of the heat-stable enterotoxin (ST), an exogenous GUCY2C ligand, opposed RIGS, a process requiring p53 activation mediated by dissociation from MDM2. In turn, p53 activation prevented cell death by selectively limiting mitotic catastrophe, but not apoptosis. These studies reveal a role for the GUCY2C paracrine hormone axis as a novel compensatory mechanism opposing RIGS, and they highlight the potential of oral GUCY2C agonists (Linzess; Trulance) to prevent and treat RIGS in cancer therapy and nuclear disasters.Copyright ©2017 AACR.",Excluded
2622,"Onsite versus offsite radiation treatment of malignant spinal cord compression: Lessons from a safety net health system. Objective: Metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC) is an oncologic emergency that often warrants emergent treatment; but, it is unclear whether radiation treatment (RT) can be optimally managed from an offsite radiotherapy facility. Method(s): Patient charts from consecutive patients with MSCC who were treated with radiotherapy alone at either an onsite hospital radiation department (from 2008 to 2012) or an offsite radiotherapy centre (2012-2015) were reviewed. Patient clinical parameters were compared across groups with either the chi2 test or Fisher's exact test, while survival curves were compared with the log-rank test. The primary end points were ambulatory rate over time, overall survival and cancer-specific survival. Result(s): A total of 45 patients were identified, with 19 patients treated onsite in the hospital department and 26 patients treated at the offsite radiotherapy centre with median follow-up of 42 days vs 48.5 days, respectively. The ambulatory rate over time, overall survival and cancer-specific survival were not significantly different between the two eras. Patients treated in-hospital were more likely to start treatment the same day as the consult (""sim and treat"") (79% vs 27%, p = 0.006) and were more likely to not complete treatment (26% vs 4%, p = 0.029) as compared with those treated in the offsite centre. Conclusion(s): Patients with MSCC can be feasibly treated at an offsite radiotherapy centre with outcomes similar to those treated in-hospital. Advances in knowledge: This is the first study in literature to compare outcomes between onsite and offsite RT of MSCC.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

1976,"Effects of sex and gender on adaptation to space: neurosensory systems. Sex and gender differences have long been a research topic of interest, yet few studies have explored the specific differences in neurological responses between men and women during and after spaceflight. Knowledge in this field is limited due to the significant disproportion of sexes enrolled in the astronaut corps. Research indicates that general neurological and sensory differences exist between the sexes, such as those in laterality of amygdala activity, sensitivity and discrimination in vision processing, and neuronal cell death (apoptosis) pathways. In spaceflight, sex differences may include a higher incidence of entry and space motion sickness and of post-flight vestibular instability in female as opposed to male astronauts who flew on both short- and long-duration missions. Hearing and auditory function in crewmembers shows the expected hearing threshold differences between men and women, in which female astronauts exhibit better hearing thresholds. Longitudinal observations of hearing thresholds for crewmembers yield normal age-related decrements; however, no evidence of sex-related differences from spaceflight has been observed. The impact of sex and gender differences should be studied by making spaceflight accessible and flying more women into space. Only in this way will we know if increasingly longer-duration missions cause significantly different neurophysiological responses in men and women.",Excluded
3108,"Radioembolization of symptomatic, unresectable neuroendocrine hepatic metastases using yttrium-90 microspheres. PURPOSE: To evaluate safety, efficacy, and symptom-control of radioembolization in patients with unresectable liver metastases from neuroendocrine tumors (NETLMs)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two patients (mean age of 62 years) with treatment-refractory NETLMs underwent radioembolization using yttrium-90 ((90)Y) resin microspheres. Posttreatment tumor response was assessed by cross-sectional imaging using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and tumor-marker levels. Laboratory and clinical toxicities and clinical symptoms were monitored., RESULTS: The median activity delivered was 1.63 GBq (range 0.63-2.36). Imaging follow-up using RECIST at 3-month follow-up demonstrated partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease in 22.5, 75.0, and 2.5% of patients, respectively. In 97.5% of patients, the liver lesions appeared hypovascular or partially necrotic. The mean follow-up was 16.2 months with 40 patients (95.2%) remaining alive. The median decrease in tumor-marker levels at 3 months was 54.8% (chromogranin A) and 37.3% (serotonin), respectively. There were no acute or delayed toxicities greater than grade 2 according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE (v3.0)]. No radiation-induced liver disease was noted. Improvement of clinical symptoms 3 months after treatment was observed in 36 of 38 symptomatic patients., CONCLUSION: Radioembolization with (90)Y-microspheres is a safe and effective treatment option in patients with otherwise treatment-refractory NETLMs. Antitumoral effect is supported by good local tumor control, decreased tumor-marker levels, and improved clinical symptoms. Further investigation is warranted to define the role of radioembolization in the treatment paradigm for NETLMs.",Excluded
2073,"Lung tumour induction in mice after uniform and non-uniform external thoracic X-irradiation. The aim of this study was to investigate the validity of the ICRP procedure of using average tissue/organ dose in estimating carcinogenic risk. It has been suggested that highly non-uniform exposure ('hot spots') is much more carcinogenic than an equivalent dose delivered uniformly. In a series of experiments, mice were irradiated with X-rays either uniformly to the thorax or non-uniformly with 72 1-mm microbeams which irradiated approximately 20 per cent of the total lung volume. Two experiments involving uniform irradiation showed a peaked tumour incidence curve with a maximum at 5 Gy. The first 'microbeam' study also produced a pronounced peak in the dose response with a maximum tumour incidence at 1 Gy average lung dose or 5 Gy to the irradiated lung tissue. This implied the use of average tissue dose might underestimate the carcinogenic hazard of non-uniform exposure. Later, more extensive, microbeam experiments failed to replicate this finding. The results were nearly similar to those for uniform irradiation, with a slight increase in tumour incidence from 2.5-5.0 Gy average lung dose. These results imply that for these irradiation conditions the ICRP dose averaging procedure remains valid.",Excluded
2371,"A preliminary study of the use of ultrasound in defining nasal fractures: Criteria for a confident diagnosis. Nasal fractures are usually diagnosed by clinical examination, with or without the support of imaging studies. While plain-film radiography lacks sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing nasal fractures, and computed tomography (CT) is not always practical or cost-effective, ultrasonography (US) may be useful in this regard. The criteria by which adult nasal fractures are reliably identified on US must be clear. We conducted a preliminary prospective, controlled, observational study to define the appearance of nasal fractures on US. We used US to image 12 patients with a clinical or radiologic (CT or x-ray) diagnosis of nasal fracture. All patients presented within 2 weeks of their injury. For comparison purposes, we also obtained US images from 12 control subjects who had no history of nasal trauma or surgery. We found that we could confidently diagnose nasal fractures on lateral-view US on the basis of a disruption of bone continuity and/or displacement of fracture segments. However, our findings were not as consistent with dorsal-view US, and we do not believe it is adequate for diagnosis. We conclude that lateral US can be used to detect nasal fractures in adults, but further studies are needed to assess its sensitivity, specificity, cost-effectiveness, and practicality.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term efficacy of irradiated homologous rib grafts (IHRGs) for both augmentation and support function in rhinoplasty in general and for specific recipient sites within the nose. DESIGN: A retrospective study was conducted at an academic medical center to evaluate the loss of volume and support function of IHRGs in 9 specific recipient sites in the nose. RESULT(S): We studied 66 patients, with a total of 177 IHRGs, dating back 9 years, with an average follow-up of 51 months. The rate of resorption increased with duration of follow-up. Complete resorption was found in 1 IHRG, and moderate resorption was observed in 55 IHRGs (31%). Resorption was characterized by a loss of support function rather than a loss of volume. Moderate resorption had a negative clinical outcome for shield grafts only. CONCLUSION(S): Irradiated homologous rib grafts were safe to use in rhinoplasty. In cases requiring a shield graft, IHRGs should be avoided.",Excluded
3084,"Assessment of Corneal Backward Light Scattering in Diabetic Patients. OBJECTIVES: To analyze corneal backward light scattering differences in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus., METHODS: We enrolled 43 eyes from 43 diabetic patients and 40 eyes from 40 healthy controls. Corneal backward light scattering was evaluated using densitometry measurements from different corneal layers and zones obtained using Scheimpflug tomography (PentacamHR)., RESULTS: When densitometry values were divided by depth, anterior layer of diabetic corneas displayed significantly higher corneal backward light scattering values than controls (32.05, 95% confidence intervals [CI], 31.02-33.08 vs. 29.18, 95% CI, 27.60-30.76, P=0.024). Corneal densitometry measurements were also significantly higher in diabetic eyes compared with control eyes, when considered by concentric zones of total cornea in the 0 to 2 mm (21.65, 95% CI, 20.28-23.01 vs. 18.87 95% CI, 18.49-19.25, P=0.020), and anterior layer in the 0 to 2 mm (27.3, 95% CI, 25.04-29.56 vs. 22.31, 95% CI, 20.57-24.05, P<0.001), 2 to 6 mm (26.2, 95% CI, 24.99-27.41 vs. 22.4, 95% CI, 20.18-24.62, P<0.001) and 6 to 10 mm (32.19, 95% CI, 29.98-34.40 vs. 27.2, 95% CI, 25.39-29.01, P=0.022). There was excellent positive correlation between anterior total corneal densitometry measurements and duration of diabetes (r=0.802, P<0.001), although no significant correlation was observed with anterior total corneal densitometry measurements and hemoglobin A1c levels (r=0.080, P=0.621) in diabetic eyes., CONCLUSIONS: Backward light scattering values from the anterior layer of the cornea is greater in diabetic eyes than in controls.

1368,"Multivariate analysis of low-dose radiation-associated changes in cytokine gene expression profiles using microarray technology. OBJECTIVE: The availability of microarray technology, which permits evaluation of the entire cellular transcriptome in a single experiment, has provided new insights on the function of the genome under normal and pathological conditions, as well as in response to genotoxic stimuli, including ionizing radiation. The aims of this study were to: 1) determine whether specific cytokine gene expression profiles can be delineated in individuals exposed to chronic, low-dose radiation; and 2) compare analyses from three multivariate analytic methodologies, hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), principal component analysis (PCA), and projection pursuit (PP), in evaluating transcriptional responses in human mononuclear cells to low doses of ionizing radiation (IR), as determined by cDNA microarrays., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Total RNA isolated from mononuclear cells of 19 apparently healthy adult individuals exposed to low doses of IR ranging from 0.18 mSv to 49 mSv over a period of 11 to 13 years, as a result of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant catastrophe, was reverse transcribed in the presence of radioactive dATP to generate radiolabeled complementary cDNA. Target cDNA was hybridized to human cytokine and receptor arrays and mRNA transcriptional patterns were evaluated using HCA, PCA, and PP., RESULTS: Statistical analyses of the data generated from 19 microarrays revealed distinct gene expression patterns in mononuclear cells of individuals exposed to radiation doses of greater than 10 mSv or less than 10 mSv. Genes encompassed within clusters discerned by HCA, PCA, and PP varied depending on the methodology used to analyze the microarray data. The most frequently expressed genes across all radiation doses were serine/threonine protein kinase receptor (11/19), transforming growth factor (TGF) receptor (11/19), EB13 (10/19), and CD40 ligand., CONCLUSIONS: Although our findings suggest that it may be possible to assign gene expression profiles to low-dose-irradiated individuals, we show that gene expression profiles vary, depending on the statistical method used to analyze the data. Since there is, as of yet, no consensus regarding the best method to analyze a multivariate dataset, and since discarding the raw data and repeating the experiment at a later date constitutes an unwarranted expenditure, it is important to submit microarray data to public databases where these data can be reevaluated and interpreted by investigators holding expertise in various fields within the scientific community, including radiation biology, statistics, and bioinformatics.",Excluded

Objectives: To our knowledge this is the largest report analyzing outcomes for reirradiation (reRT) for locoregionally recurrent lung cancer, and the first to assess thoracic reRT outcomes in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Method(s): Forty-eight patients (11 SCLC, 37 non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC]) receiving reRT to the thorax were identified; 44 (92%) received reRT by intensity-modulated radiotherapy. Palliative responses, survival outcomes, and prognostic factors were analyzed. Result(s): NSCLC patients received a median of 30 Gy in a median of 10 fractions, whereas SCLC patients received a median of 37.5 Gy in a median of 15 fractions. Median survival for the entire cohort from reRT was 4.2 months. Median survival for NSCLC patients was 5.1 months, versus 3.1 months for the SCLC patients (P=0.15). In NSCLC patients, multivariate analysis demonstrated that Karnofsky performance status>=80 and higher radiation dose were associated with improved survival following reRT, and 75% of patients with symptoms experienced palliative benefit. In SCLC, 4 patients treated with the intent of life prolongation for radiographic recurrence had a median survival of 11.7 months. However, acute toxicities and new disease symptoms limited the duration of palliative benefit in the 7 symptomatic SCLC patients to 0.5 months. Conclusion(s): ReRT to the thorax for locoregionally recurrent NSCLC can provide palliative benefit, and a small subset of patients may experience long-term survival. Select SCLC patients may experience meaningful survival prolongation after reRT, but reRT for patients with symptomatic recurrence and/or extrathoracic disease did not offer meaningful survival or durable symptom benefit.

498,"Standardisation of the neck-shaft angle and measurement of age-, gender- and BMI-related changes in the femoral neck using DXA. Introduction The morphology of the proximal femur has often been investigated in the literature, but the normal population ranges and standard deviations have still not been determined for this area. This study aimed to determine the age-, gender- and body mass index (BMI)-related changes in the femoral neck, especially on the neck-shaft angle, by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurements. Method s Retrospective analyses of DXA images of the proximal femur from 18,943 individuals aged 20-108 years were performed. The age, gender, weight and height of each individual were obtained at the time of bone measurement. Data on theta angle were obtained from DXA measurements. Simple linear regression analysis and Pearson's correlation coefficients were used to investigate the relationships between theta and age, gender and BMI. Results There was a significant correlation between theta and age (p < 0.001). We also found a significant difference between the various age groups using analysis of variance (p < 0.001), but there was no meaningful correlation between theta and BMI (p = 0.377) and the BMI groups (p = 0.180). There were small but statistically significant differences in the neck-shaft angle between males and females (p < 0.05). Conclusion In this study, DXA-based measurements were used and many parameters of proximal femur geometry were calculated with limited radiation exposure. We have demonstrated that the mean neck-shaft angle is greater in males than in females, and that theta increases with age. We also found a significant difference between different age groups, but no meaningful correlation between theta and BMI.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the simultaneous use of automatic tube current modulation (ATCM) and automatic tube voltage selection (ATVS) for abdominal and chest CT examinations regarding radiation dose reduction and image quality., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We enrolled 617 patients who all underwent contrast-enhanced chest or abdominal CT and divided them into two groups. In group A, 317 patients who underwent CT with only ATCM and a fixed body mass index-adjusted tube voltage (120 kV or 100 kV) were enrolled. In group B, both ATCM and ATVS were used. Image attenuation and noise were measured in different anatomic regions., RESULTS: The mean contrast-to-noise ratio and the signal-to-noise ratio of abdomen and chest CT was higher in group B compared with group A (p < 0.0001). In total, the effective radiation doses for abdomen and chest CT examinations were significantly reduced in group B by 18% compared with group A (p < 0.0001). When only examining those who benefited from the ATVS tool, a dose reduction of 35% for chest CT and 42% for abdomen CT could be achieved (p < 0.0001 for each)., CONCLUSION: The simultaneous use of ATVS and ATCM enables significant radiation dose reduction in abdominal and thoracic contrast-enhanced CT examinations compared with the use of ATCM alone.",Excluded

1589,"Automatic, three-segment, MR-based attenuation correction for whole-body PET/MR data. PURPOSE: The combination of positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance (MR) tomography in a single device is anticipated to be the next step following PET/CT for future molecular imaging application. Compared to CT, the main advantages of MR are versatile soft tissue contrast and its capability to acquire functional information without ionizing radiation. However, MR is not capable of measuring a physical quantity that would allow a direct derivation of the attenuation values for high-energy photons., METHODS: To overcome this problem, we propose a fully automated approach that uses a dedicated T1-weighted MR sequence in combination with a customized image processing technique to derive attenuation maps for whole-body PET. The algorithm automatically identifies the outer contour of the body and the lungs using region-growing techniques in combination with an intensity analysis for automatic threshold estimation. No user interaction is required to generate the attenuation map., RESULTS: The accuracy of the proposed MR-based attenuation correction (AC) approach was evaluated in a clinical study using whole-body PET/CT and MR images of the same patients (n = 15). The segmentation of the body and lung contour (L-R directions) was evaluated via a four-point scale in comparison to the original MR image (mean values >3.8). PET images were reconstructed using elastically registered MR-based and CT-based (segmented and non-segmented) attenuation maps. The MR-based AC showed similar behaviour as CT-based AC and similar accuracy as offered by segmented CT-based AC. Standardized uptake value (SUV) comparisons with reference to CT-based AC using predefined attenuation coefficients showed the largest difference for bone lesions (mean value +/- standard variation of SUV(max): -3.0% +/- 3.9% for MR; -6.5% +/- 4.1% for segmented CT). A blind comparison of PET images corrected with segmented MR-based, CT-based and segmented CT-based AC afforded identical lesion detectability, but slight differences in image quality were found., CONCLUSION: Our MR-based attenuation correction method offers similar correction accuracy as offered by segmented CT. According to the specialists involved in the blind study, these differences do not affect the diagnostic value of the PET images.",Excluded

Wave front measurements were performed with a Hartmann-Shack aberrometer. To investigate lenticular spherical aberration, HOAs were examined in 28 eyes before and after phacoemulsification, followed by insertion of an aberration-free intraocular lens. The relationship between lens opacity grade and ocular and lenticular spherical aberrations were investigated., RESULTS: Mean spherical aberrations in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 were 0.25 +/- 0.10, 0.16 +/- 0.13, 0.12 +/- 0.15, and 0.10 +/- 0.20 mum, respectively, and showed a significant difference with nuclear opacity grading (p = 0.001). The spherical aberration showed negative associations with nuclear opacity grading (r = -0.408, p < 0.001). The predominant change in HOAs after phacoemulsification was an increase in spherical aberration, and 86 % of lenticular spherical aberrations were presumed to have negative values.

3175,"Failures (cause and time) of radiotherapy in oral cancer. The results of retrospective clinical evaluation concerning 434 cases of oral carcinomas treated with radiotherapy from January 1959 to December 1967 are presented. The analysis of the results obtained shows that radiotherapy alone may offer a reasonable possiblity of success in limited lesions (68.3% 5-year survival of Stage I patients). In more advanced local cases, and especially those with regional adenopathies, radiotherapy alone cannot consistently control the disease for a long period of time; 5-year survival from the onset of treatment was respectively 36.5% and 24.5% for Stage II and III cases. Moreover, if controlateral of bilateral metastatic adenopathies or fixed lymph nodes are present, the prognosis becomes dramatic (2.6% 5-year survival of Stage IV patients). Among the irradiation techniques currently available, curietherapy (intersitial applications or surface molds) presumably offers the best possibility of success, since the observed failures, both overall and stage by stage, are inferior. Radiotherapy alone may generally be of proven efficacy if the local or locoregional extension is limited. In more advanced cases a combined surgery-chemotherapy treatment method is recommended. The criteria for a combined therapeutic approach for these tumors are also discussed.",Excluded

PURPOSE: Combined radiochemotherapy (RCT) for gastric cancer with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) results in ablative doses to the upper left kidney, while image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IG-IMRT) allows kidney sparing despite improved target coverage. Renal function in long-term gastric cancer survivors was evaluated with 3T functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and (23)Na imaging., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five healthy volunteers and 13 patients after radiotherapy were included: 11xIG-IMRT; 1x3D-CRT; 1x positive control"" with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) of a metastasis between the spleen/left kidney. Radiation doses were documented for the upper/middle/lower kidney subvolumes. Late toxicity was evaluated based on CTC criteria, questionnaire, and creatinine values. Morphological sequences, DWI images, and (23)Na images were acquired using a (1)H/(23)Na-tuned body-coil before/after intravenous water load (WL). Statistics for [(23)Na] (concentration) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were calculated for upper/middle/lower renal subvolumes. Corticomedullary [(23)Na] gradients and [(23)Na] differences after WL were determined., RESULTS: No major morphological alteration was detected in any patient. Minor scars were observed in the cranial subvolume of the left kidney of the 3D-CRT and the whole kidney of the control SBRT patient. All participants presented a corticomedullary [(23)Na] gradient. After WL, a significant physiological [(23)Na] gradient decrease (p < 0.001) was observed in all HV and IG-IMRT patients. In the cranial left kidney of the 3D-CRT patient and the positive control SBRT patient, the decrease was nonsignificant (p = 0.01, p = 0.02). ADC values were altered nonsignificantly in all renal subvolumes (all participants). Renal subvolumes with doses >= 35 Gy showed a reduced change of the [(23)Na] gradient after WL (p = 0.043). No participants showed clinical renal impairment., CONCLUSIONS: Functional parameters of renal (23)Na MRI after gastric IG-IMRT are identical to those of healthy volunteers, in contrast to renal subvolumes after ablative doses in the control and 3D-CRT patient. While kidney doses to the cortex below 20-25 Gy in fractional doses of ~ 1 Gy in IG-IMRT (combined with intensified chemotherapy) do not seem to cause significant MRI morphological or functional alterations, doses of > 35 Gy in 1.5-2 Gy fractions clearly result in impairment.""",Excluded

PURPOSE: To define the diagnostic precision of non-specialized readers in the detection of type 2 endoleaks (T2EL) in arterial versus venous phase acquisitions, and to evaluate an approach for radiation dose reduction., METHODS: The pre-discharge and final follow-up multi-slice CT angiographies of 167 patients were retrospectively analyzed. Image data were separated into an arterial and a venous phase reading set. Two radiology residents assessed the reading sets for the presence of a T2EL, feeding vessels, and aneurysm sac size. Findings were compared with a standard of reference established by two experts in interventional radiology. The effective dose was calculated., RESULTS: Overall, experts detected 131 T2ELs, and 331 feeding vessels in 334 examinations. Persistent T2ELs causing aneurysm sac growth > 5 mm were detected in 20 patients. Radiation in arterial and venous phases contributed to a mean of 58.6% and 39.0% of the total effective dose. Findings of reader 1 and 2 showed comparable sensitivities in arterial sets of 80.9 versus 85.5 (p = 0.09), and in venous sets of 73.3 versus 79.4 (p = 0.15), respectively. Reader 1 and 2 achieved a significant higher detection rate of feeding vessels with arterial compared to venous set (p = 0.04, p < 0.01). Both readers correctly identified T2ELs with growing aneurysm sac in all cases, independent of the acquisition phase., CONCLUSION: Arterial acquisitions enable non-specialized readers an accurate detection of T2ELs, and a significant better identification of feeding vessels.

3202,"[Technique and radiation dose of conventional X-rays and computed tomography of the sacroiliac joint]. Anterior-posterior (a.p.) or posterior-anterior X-rays of the sacroiliac joint, sometimes supplemented by a transverse view, have been the method of choice for diagnosis of patients suspected of having sacroiliitis. The sensitivity and specificity of conventional X-rays are relatively low, which can delay the diagnosis of sacroiliitis. Computed tomography (CT) is superior to conventional X-rays for diagnosis of sacroiliitis, but does emit a relatively higher dose of radiation. For this reason, particularly for females, CT should be optimized by employing semi-coronal planes which require a lower radiation dose than axial planes. CT in a semi-coronal plane causes minimal radiation to the ovaries, and the effective radiation dose for women might even be lower than with conventional AP X-rays. Therefore, for suspected sacroiliitis in young women, CT in the semi-coronal plane is the preferred imaging method with respect to diagnostics and radiation protection when magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not available. Male gonads can be protected from radiation doses in conventional X-rays, and CT as the primary imaging method can only be justified in these cases because of its better diagnostic capabilities. Due to the lack of inherent risk factors, MRI is superior to CT for diagnostics since it provides images of inflammatory signs in addition to joint destruction.

BACKGROUND: We evaluated the anatomic location of the external anal sphincter (EAS) to pelvic bony landmarks related to 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DRT) and studied the dosimetric coverage of the EAS in patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiation for rectal cancer., METHODS: Sixty-four consecutive rectal cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation were included. All patients were treated in a prone position on a bellyboard by 3DRT. The inferior border of the RT fields was at least 3-5 cm inferior to the gross tumorous volume (GTV) or at the inferior border of the obturator foramen (IBOF), whichever was more inferior. The EAS was contoured and dose distributions were determined using dose-volume histograms., RESULTS: In 53 out of 64 cases (82.8%), the EAS was completely inferior to the IBOF. In the remaining 11 cases, the EAS was either overlapping the IBOF (10 cases; 15.6%) or completely superior to the IBOF (1 case; 1.7%). The average mean dose delivered to the EAS was 2795 cGy. Lower mean doses were delivered to the EAS when the center of the EAS was located more distant from the GTV., CONCLUSIONS: Meticulous planning to define the inferior border of the RT field is recommended to avoid irradiating the EAS.",Excluded
982,"Determinants of vitamin D status in long-term renal transplant patients. In this study, we explored the determinants of vitamin D status in a large cohort of stable, Long-term renal transplant (RTx) patients. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations, and bone biochemistry parameters, were retrospectively analyzed from 266 RTx patients (>10 yr post-engraftment) presenting to clinic over the course of a year. Forty-five percent of the cohort were vitamin D deficient (<37.5 nM), 38% insufficient (37.5 75-nM), and 17% sufficient (>75 nM). Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were higher in patients presenting in summer (p<0.001) and in more active patients (p<0.05). RTx patients with non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) (n=45) had higher 25(OH)D concentrations than patients without NMSC (n=221; p<0.05) despite these patients being older, having worse eGFR, transplanted for longer, and less active physically (p<0.05). Lower 25(OH)D concentrations were associated with higher PTH concentrations (p<0.05) which, in the setting of widespread hypovitaminosis, suggests that secondary hyperparathyroidism was common in this cohort. In conclusion, season and activity status are important determinants of vitamin D status. We report, for the first time, that NMSC is associated with higher 25(OH)D, probably through increased UV radiation exposure. Long-term RTx patients may benefit from oral vitamin D supplementation, but this requires a randomized controlled trial to confirm. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.",Excluded
891,"Abdominal circumference but not the degree of lumbar flexion affects the accuracy of lumbar interspace identification by Tuffier's line palpation method: An observational study. Background: Lumbar puncture for spinal or epidural anesthesia is commonly performed by palpating bony landmarks, but identification of the desired intervertebral level is often inaccurate. It is unclear whether such inaccuracy is related to patient factors, such as body mass index and degree of lumbar flexion. We hypothesized that overweight patients and patients with less of an ability to hyperflex their lumbar spines are prone to inaccurate lumbar spinous intervertebral level identification. Method(s): 52 adult volunteers were included in this study. 7 anesthesiologists with different years of experience identified and marked subjects' levels of the iliac crests, then marked the presumed interspaces. Lumbar X-ray was then performed with metal markers, and actual radiographic findings were identified and compared to the initial markings. Result(s): Patients with larger abdominal circumferences (mean (SD), 94.0(12.1) cm), higher body mass indices (25.9(3.9) kg/m), and aged between 50 and 70 years old had lumbar interspaces that were higher than the presumed level; patients with smaller abdominal circumferences (82.8(13.5) cm) and lower body mass indices (21.6(4.1) kg/m) had intervertebral levels that were lower than the presumed level. Cobb's angle, indicating the degree of lumbar flexion, did not affect the accuracy obtained. Conclusion(s): Patients' abdominal circumference, body mass index, and age are factors that may impact the accuracy of lumbar level identification. Tuffier's line, as identified by palpation, does not seem to be a reliable landmark for proper lumbar interspace identification in all cases.Copyright © Lin et al.",Excluded
701,"Radiosurgical techniques and clinical outcomes of gamma knife radiosurgery for brainstem arteriovenous malformations. OBJECTIVE: Brainstem arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is rare and radiosurgical management is complicated by the sensitivity of the adjacent neurological structures. Complete obliteration of the nidus is not always possible. We describe over 20 years of radiosurgical procedures for brainstem AVMs, focusing on clinical outcomes and radiosurgical techniques., METHODS: Between 1992 and 2011, the authors performed gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) in 464 cerebral AVMs. Twenty-nine of the 464 patients (6.3%) reviewed had brainstem AVMs. This series included sixteen males and thirteen females with a mean age of 30.7 years (range : 5-71 years). The symptoms that led to diagnoses were as follows : an altered mentality (5 patients, 17.3%), motor weakness (10 patients, 34.5%), cranial nerve symptoms (3 patients, 10.3%), headache (6 patients, 20.7%), dizziness (3 patients, 10.3%), and seizures (2 patients, 6.9%). Two patients had undergone a previous nidus resection, and three patients had undergone a previous embolization. Twenty-four patients underwent only GKRS. With respect to the nidus type and blood flow, the ratio of compact type to diffuse type and high flow to low flow were 17 : 12 and 16 : 13, respectively. In this series, 24 patients (82.8%) had a prior hemorrhage. The mean target volume was 1.7 cm(3) (range 0.1-11.3 cm(3)). The mean maximal and marginal radiation doses were 38.5 Gy (range 28.6-43.6 Gy) and 23.4 Gy (range 18-27 Gy), and the mean isodose profile was 61.3% (range 50-70%)., RESULTS: Twenty-four patients had brainstem AVMs and were followed for more than 3 years. Obliteration of the AVMs was eventually documented in 17 patients (70.8%) over a mean follow-up period of 77.5 months (range 36-216 months). With respect to nidus type and blood flow, the obliteration rate of compact types (75%) was higher than that of diffuse types (66.7%), and the obliteration rate of low flow AVMs (76.9%) was higher than that of high flow AVMs (63.6%) (p<0.05). Two patients (6.9%) with three hemorrhagic events suffered a hemorrhage during the follow-up period. The annual bleeding rate of AVM after GKRS was 1.95% per year. No adverse radiation effects or delayed cystic formations were found., CONCLUSION: GKRS has an important clinical role in treatment of brainstem AVMs, which carry excessive surgical risks. Angiographic features and radiosurgical techniques using a lower maximal dose with higher isodose profiles are important for lesion obliteration and the avoidance of complications.",Excluded
1271,"Vitamin D receptor gene polymorphisms and Parkinson's disease in a population with high ultraviolet radiation exposure. INTRODUCTION: A high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency has been reported in Parkinson's disease (PD). Epidemiologic studies examining variability in genes involved in vitamin D metabolism have not taken into account level of exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR). We examined whether exposure to UVR (as a surrogate for vitamin D levels) and variations in the vitamin D receptor gene (VDR) are associated with PD., METHODS: Within a geographical information system (GIS) we linked participants' geocoded residential address data to ground level UV data to estimate historical exposure to UVR. Six SNPs in VDR were genotyped in non-Hispanic Caucasian subjects., RESULTS: Average lifetime UVR exposure levels were >5000 Wh/m(2), which was higher than levels for populations in previous studies, and UVR exposure did not differ between cases and controls. Homozygotes for the rs731236 TT (major allele) genotype had a 31% lower risk of PD risk (OR=0.69; 95% CI=0.49, 0.98; p=0.04 for TT vs. TC+CC). The rs7975232 GG (minor allele) genotype was also associated with decreased risk of PD (OR=0.63; 95% CI=0.42, 0.93; p=0.02 for GG vs. TG+TT). The association between PD risk and a third locus, rs1544410 (BsmI), was not statistically significant after adjustment for covariates, although there was a trend for lower risk with the GG genotype., CONCLUSIONS: This study provides initial evidence that VDR polymorphisms may modulate risk of PD in a population highly exposed to UVR throughout lifetime.

From our experience with 20 patients who required surgery for radiation enteritis and who were followed for up to 20 years, we were able to identify three clinical groups. Patients in the first group need only medical treatment for their symptoms, and observation, whereas patients in the second group may present with acute, debilitating, life-threatening symptoms that may require emergency surgery.

3056,"Axillary basal cell carcinoma. BACKGROUND: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) rarely occurs in the axilla. Only 18 cases have been reported in the world literature., OBJECTIVES: To report our institution's 11-year experience with axillary BCC., METHODS: A review of patient charts and biopsy specimens is given., RESULTS: We report 14 patients with 15 axillary BCCs. The average patient age was 65.6. The average lesion size was 10.8 mm. Nine patients had a personal history of skin cancer at sun-exposed sites. One patient had basal cell nevus syndrome. A history of ionizing radiation and severe sunburn involving the axilla was each seen in separate patients. No other predisposing factors for developing BCC were identified, such as immune suppression or a history of other malignancies. Histologic subtypes of all tumors were considered less aggressive, and only one tumor recurred., CONCLUSIONS: Axillary BCC is rare. Factors other than ultraviolet radiation likely contribute to the development of BCC, especially at sun-protected sites. Performing a periodic and complete cutaneous examination that includes sun-protected sites is important, especially in patients who have a history of skin cancer.",Excluded
1278,"Bone marrow-derived cells rescue salivary gland function in mice with head and neck irradiation. Treatment for most patients with head and neck cancers includes ionizing radiation. A consequence of this treatment is irreversible damage to salivary glands (SGs), which is accompanied by a loss of fluid-secreting acinar-cells and a considerable decrease of saliva output. While there are currently no adequate conventional treatments for this condition, cell-based therapies are receiving increasing attention to regenerate SGs. In this study, we investigated whether bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) can differentiate into salivary epithelial cells and restore SG function in head and neck irradiated mice. BMDCs from male mice were transplanted into the tail-vein of 18 Gy-irradiated female mice. Salivary output was increased in mice that received BMDCs transplantation at week 8 and 24 post-irradiation. At 24 weeks after irradiation (IR), harvested SGs (submandibular and parotid glands) of BMDC-treated mice had greater weights than those of non-treated mice. Histological analysis shows that SGs of treated mice demonstrated an increased level of tissue regenerative activity such as blood vessel formation and cell proliferation, while apoptotic activity was increased in non-transplanted mice. The expression of stem cell markers (Sca-1 or c-kit) was detected in BMDC-treated SGs. Finally, we detected an increased ratio of acinar-cell area and approximately 9% of Y-chromosome-positive (donor-derived) salivary epithelial cells in BMDC-treated mice. We propose here that cell therapy using BMDCs can rescue the functional damage of irradiated SGs by direct differentiation of donor BMDCs into salivary epithelial cells. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Purpose: The aim of this study was to analyze the implant stability quotient (ISQ) results of the resonance frequency (RF) during the first day of surgery and 3 months after dental implant placement in the maxilla. Material(s) and Method(s): This study was approved by 40 patients with total or partial edentulous maxillary jaws underwent with 85 dental implants. The ISQ values were measured from these 85 implants at baseline and 3 months after placement. Osttell Mentor device was invented to measure the RF value of the implant fixture through the transducer or pin. Measurements were taken 4 times in each direction of the inserted oral dental implant. OPG X-ray images were also obtained to evaluate the bone and neighbouring anatomical structures. Result(s): The ISQ at baseline had a mean value of 58 (SD 5.91) for all implants placed in anterior and posterior sectors of maxillary ridges. The mean ISQ value on the 3rd month (secondary stability) after placement for all implants was 65 (SD 5.55). An ISQ value >=65 was observed in 65 implants (78.82%) after 3 months of placement. Differences between primary and secondary mean ISQ values were statistically significant (p < 0.001). The one year cumulative success rate was 98.3% for tested and inserted oral implants. Conclusion(s): The results of presented study demonstrates and suggests that the influence and reliability of Osstell ISQ values, measured immediately and 3 months after placement it's predictable for the oral implant outcomes, especially analyzing the sensibility of secondary RFA values.Copyright © 2018, Peytchinski, Gospodin Iliev ET.

3434,"Clinical implementation of an emergency department coronary computed tomographic angiography protocol for triage of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome. Objectives: To evaluate the efficiency and safety of emergency department (ED) coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) during a 3-year clinical experience. Method(s): Single-center registry of coronary CTA in consecutive ED patients with suspicion of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The primary outcome was efficiency of coronary CTA defined as the length of hospitalization. Secondary endpoints of safety were defined as the rate of downstream testing, normalcy rates of invasive coronary angiography (ICA), absence of missed ACS, and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) during follow-up, and index radiation exposure. Result(s): One thousand twenty two consecutive patients were referred for clinical coronary CTA with suspicion of ACS. Overall, median time to discharge home was 10.5 (5.7-24.1) hours. Patient disposition was 42.7 % direct discharge from the ED, 43.2 % discharge from emergency unit, and 14.1 % hospital admission. ACS rate during index hospitalization was 9.1 %. One hundred ninety two patients underwent additional diagnostic imaging and 77 underwent ICA. The positive predictive value of CTA compared to ICA was 78.9 % (95 %-CI 68.1-87.5 %). Median CT radiation exposure was 4.0 (2.5-5.8) mSv. No ACS was missed; MACE at follow-up after negative CTA was 0.2 %. Conclusion(s): Coronary CTA in an experienced tertiary care setting allows for efficient and safe management of patients with suspicion for ACS. Key points: * ED Coronary CTA using advanced systems is associated with low radiation exposure. * Negative coronary CTA is associated with low rates of MACE. * CTA in ED patients enables short median time to discharge home. * CTA strategy is characterized by few downstream tests including unnecessary ICA.Copyright © 2016, European Society of Radiology.",Excluded
3317,"Evaluation and definitive management of medically inoperable early stage non-small-cell lung cancer. Part 2: newer treatment modalities. Lung cancer is estimated to be the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in both men and women in 2006, and the leading causes of cancer mortality. Non-small-cell lung cancer represents the majority of such cases. Most of these patients have locally advanced disease at presentation and are not eligible for curative resection. For the minority of patients who are technically resectable at presentation, lobectomy or pneumonectomy and pathologic mediastinal nodal staging offer the best overall survival. The high rate of comorbid medical illness and poor baseline pulmonary function in this population, however, make many such early-stage patients medically inoperable. For these patients, conventional single-modality radiotherapy has been the primary definitive treatment option, as discussed in part 1 of this article, which appeared in last month's issue. Numerous retrospective reports demonstrate long-term disease-free and overall survival data that are modestly superior to that expected after observation, but both local and distant failure continue to be significant risks. Investigation of radiotherapy dose escalation is ongoing, in an effort to improve local control while maintaining minimal toxicity. Additionally, emerging evidence suggests that new modalities, such as stereotactic radiosurgery and radiofrequency ablation, may also be potentially curative treatment alternatives.

RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess an optimized renal multiphase computed tomography angiography (MP-CTA) protocol regarding reduction of contrast volume., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients underwent MP-CTA (12 phases, every 3.5 seconds, 80 kV/120 mAs) using 30 mL of contrast medium. The quality of MP-CTA was assessed quantitatively measuring vessel attenuation, image noise, and contrast-to-noise ratio. MP-CTA was evaluated qualitatively regarding depiction of vessels, cortex differentiation, and motion artifacts (grades 1-4, 1 = best). Mean effective radiation dose was registered. Results were compared to standard renal computed tomography angiography (CTA) (80 mL). Student t test was applied, if variables followed normal distribution. For other variables, nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test was used., RESULTS: All acquisitions were successfully performed, and no patient had to be excluded from the study. MP-CTA enabled high attenuation (aorta: 503 +/- 91 HU, renal arteries: 450 +/- 73 HU/456 +/- 72 HU) at adequate image noise (13.7 +/- 1.5) and good contrast-to-noise ratio (34.2 +/- 10.2). Good attenuation of renal veins was observed (286 +/- 43 HU/282 +/- 42 HU). Arterial enhancement was significantly higher compared to renal CTA (aorta: 396 +/- 90 HU, renal arteries: 331 +/- 74 HU/333 +/- 80 HU; P < .001). MP-CTA protocol enabled good image quality of renal arteries (1.5 +/- 0.6) and veins (1.7 +/- 0.6). Cortex differentiation and motion artifacts were ranked 1.8 +/- 0.8 and 1.6 +/- 0.8. The mean effective radiation dose was 9 mSv (MP-CTA)., CONCLUSIONS: Compared to standard renal CTA, the renal MP-CTA enabled the significant reduction of contrast volume and simultaneously provided a significantly higher arterial attenuation.

Group (3): contained two sub-groups, one scanned at a time per projection of 20 s and the other scanned at 10 s per projection. The three groups were processed using 3D reconstruction algorithm(flash 3 D) (4 subsets, 13 iterations, FWHM=14 mm). Dose rate was recorded using a calibrated standard survey meter for all patients after dose administration. Besides, Dose calculations were also considered the time elapsed during staff exposure that included dose prepration, injection, patient imaging, and release times. Myocardial functional parameters such as Ejection Fraction (EF), End Diastole Volume (EDV), End Systole Volume (ESV) and Total Perfusion Defect (TPD) were compared for each group.

758,"A side-hole catheter for catheterization of a difficult internal mammary artery. Background The internal mammary artery (IMA) can be a source of hemoptysis in patients with chronic lung disease. Intervention via the IMA can be a challenge due to anatomic variations and lead to excessive contrast use and radiation exposure. Purpose To evaluate safety and efficiency of a new side-hole catheter for the catheterization of the IMA in patients with hemoptysis. Material and Methods From January 2011 to August 2014, a total of 96 transarterial embolization procedures required exact evaluation of the IMA due to chronic lung disease involving the anterior thorax. In 17 cases (18%) of these 96 procedures, the conventional selective IMA angiography failed and instead a novel side-hole catheter as a modification of a cobra-type curved catheter was used. The side hole allowed passage of a micro-wire and catheter. Results Failed catheterizations were due to severe vascular tortuosity, acutely angulated subclavian artery, or abnormal takeoff of the IMA. The Cobra shaped catheter with the microcatheter through the side-hole catheter yielded a technical success rate of 100%. Longer time was required to catheterize the IMA with the Cobra shaped catheter than with the side-hole catheter (17 vs. 2 min, P < 0.05). There were no procedure-related complications. Conclusion Side-hole catheter technique is useful in patients whose internal mammary artery is difficult to access.

997,"Long-term effects of microgravity on the swimming behaviour of young rats. The postnatal development of sensory systems has been shown in studies over the last four decades to be influenced by experience during critical periods of development. We report here that similar experience-dependent development can be observed in the swimming behaviour of young rats reared from postnatal day 14 (P14) to P30 in the reduced gravitational field of low earth orbit. Animals flown in space when placed in the water on the day of landing maintained their head and forelimbs in a balanced posture. However, until the animals began to swim, their hindquarters showed little lateral postural control resulting in rotation about the longitudinal axis (60 degrees+/-4 deg). Such results suggest an 'unlinking' of postural control of the forequarters from the hindquarters in the early hours after landing. Similar instability seen in animals age-matched to the day of launch (97+/-7 deg) and in ground control animals (9+/-3 deg) was corrected within one or two rotations, even in the absence of swimming. Animals flown in space began to swim sooner after being placed in the water, and the duration of swimming strokes was shorter than in control animals. Motion analysis revealed a difference in the swimming style on landing day. In flight animals, the knee joint was more flexed throughout the stroke, there was a narrower range of movement, and the linear velocity of the tip of the foot was faster throughout most of the stroke than in age-matched control animals. Thus, posture in the water as well as swimming speed and style were altered in the animals flown in space. Some of these characteristics persisted for as long as the animals were followed (30 days). These included the short pre-swimming interval and short stroke duration in flight animals. These findings clearly show that an altered gravitational field influences the postnatal development of motor function. The nature of the differences between animals reared in space for 16 days and those remaining on the ground reflects an adaptation of the flight animals to the microgravity environment. The data suggest that the most fundamental of these adaptations is a resetting of the basic motor rhythm to a higher frequency.",Excluded
2408,"Characterization of haustral activity in the human colon. Contraction patterns of the human colon are rarely discussed from the perspective of its haustra. Colonic motility was analyzed in 21 healthy subjects using 84-sensor manometry catheters with 1-cm sensor spacing. Capsule endoscopy and manometry showed evidence of narrow rhythmic circular muscle contractions. X-ray images of haustra and sensor locations allowed us to identify manometry motor activity as intrahaustral activity. Two common motor patterns were observed that we infer to be associated with individual haustra: rhythmic pressure activity confined to a single sensor, and activity confined to a section of the colon of 3-6 cm length. Intrahaustral activity was observed by 3-4 sensors. Approximately 50% of the haustra were intermittently active for -30% of the time; 2,402 periods of haustral activity were analyzed. Intrahaustral activity showed rhythmic pressure waves, propagating in mixed direction, 5-30 mmHg in amplitude at a frequency of -3 cpm (range 2-6) or -12 cpm (range 7-15), or exhibiting a checkerboard segmentation pattern. Boundaries of the haustra showed rhythmic pressure activity with or without elevated baseline pressure. Active haustra often showed no boundary activity probably allowing transit to neighboring haustra. Haustral boundaries were seen at the same sensor for the 6- to 8-h study duration, indicating that they did not propagate, thereby likely contributing to continence. The present study elucidates the motility characteristics of haustral boundaries and the nature of intrahaustral motor patterns and paves the way for investigating their possible role in pathophysiology of defecation disorders.Copyright © 2021 the American Physiological Society",Excluded
1570,"A functional evaluation of pincer femoroacetabular impingement in asymptomatic adults. Introduction: Pincer femoroacetabular impingement, defined as acetabular overcoverage of the femoral head, is a frequent anomaly of the hip in young adults, which has recently been incriminated in the development of early-onset hip osteoarthritis [1]. While most studies have only explored this phenomenon in a static position [2], it is still not known how the overcoverage of the femoral head by the acetabulum relates to gait. The aim was to examine whether acetabular parameters implicated in the development of femoroacetabular impingement correlate to self-selected and fast speed gait in asymptomatic adults. Research question: Is pincer femoroacetabular impingement related to self-selected and/or fast speed gait in asymptomatic adults? Methods: 28 asymptomatic adult subjects (age = 21.2 +/- 1.7, 19M & 9F) with no prior orthopaedic treatment underwent full body EOS biplanar X-rays with 3D reconstruction of the pelvis and lower limbs. The following acetabular parameters were subsequently generated: coverage of the femoral head by the acetabulum (CovFH in %), acetabular anterior coverage angle (ACov), acetabular anteversion (AAnt) and abduction (AAb). The gait of all subjects was assessed using 3D gait analysis during self-selected and fast speed gait in order to determine lower limb kinematic and spatio-temporal parameters of gait. In order to understand which acetabular parameters most relate to gait kinematics and spatio-temporel parameters, stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) was applied during both self-selected and fast gait. Result(s): Walking speed significantly differed (p < 0.001) between self-selected (1.2 +/- 0.2 m/s) and fast speed gait (2.1 +/- 0.3 m/s). SMLR revealed that walking speed was determined (Adj. R2 = 0.25; p < 0.001) by both CovFH (beta = -0.53) and height (beta = 0.29) during fast speed gait. Walking speed was independent of all skeletal parameters during self-selected speed gait. Step length was determined (Adj. R2 = 0.51; p < 0.001) by both height (beta = 0.76) and CovFH (beta = -0.22) during fast speed gait but only by height (b = 0.34) during self-selected speed gait. Moreover, maximal hip extension during stance was solely determined by Acov during both self-selected and fast speed gait (b = 0.45 and 0.51 respectively). Discussion(s): This is the first study to show that hip morphology affects spatio-temporal characteristics of gait during fast but not self-selected speed gait in asymptomatic adults. Walking speed and step length decreased with increased acetabular coverage of the femoral head during fast but not self-selected speed gait. Moreover, maximal hip extension during stance was diminished with decreasing anterior coverage. These findings suggest that relative acetabular overcoverage of the femoral head limits maximal hip extension during gait, probably through posterior femoroacetabular impingement, but that this only limits walking speed during fast and not self-selected speed gait.

Response in the target lesion was assessed with cross-sectional imaging by using World Health Organization (WHO) and European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) guidelines., RESULTS: The mean delivered radiation dose was 126 Gy. The mean increase in embolic load with this approach was 111%, corresponding to an increase from 3.6 to 7.3 million microspheres. Clinical toxicities included fatigue (28 patients, 56%), abdominal pain (19 patients, 38%), and nausea/vomiting (six patients, 12%). Grade 3-4 bilirubin toxicity was seen in one patient. Two gastroduodenal ulcers were observed. With cross-sectional imaging, response rates according to WHO and EASL guidelines were 51% and 69%, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the safety and efficacy of extended-shelf-life (90)Y glass microspheres. The increased embolic load and lowered activity per microsphere theoretically resulted in better tumor coverage and, hence, improved response rates. This standardizable treatment paradigm provides a minimally embolic therapy for liver tumors.",Excluded
1798,"Decreased asbestos-induced lung inflammation and fibrosis after radiation and bone marrow transplant. The effect of lung irradiation on subsequent inflammatory or fibrotic lung injuries remains poorly understood. We postulated that irradiation and bone marrow transplantation might impact the development and progression of lung remodeling resulting from asbestos inhalation. Our objective was to determine whether irradiation and bone marrow transplantation affected inflammation and fibrosis associated with inhaled asbestos exposure. Inflammation, cytokine production, and fibrosis were assessed in lungs of naive and sex-mismatched chimeric mice exposed to asbestos for 3, 9, or 40 days. Potential engraftment of donor-derived cells in recipient lungs was examined by fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Compared with asbestos-exposed naive (nonchimeric) mice, chimeric mice exposed to asbestos for 3, 9, or 40 days demonstrated significant abrogation of acute increases in asbestos-associated inflammatory mediators and fibrosis. Donor-derived cells trafficked to lung but did not significantly engraft as phenotypic lung cells. Irradiation and bone marrow transplantation alters inflammatory and fibrotic responses to asbestos, likely through modulation of soluble inflammatory mediators.",Excluded
384,"Prospective evaluation of early treatment outcome in patients with meningiomas treated with particle therapy based on target volume definition with MRI and 68Ga-DOTATOC-PET. Purpose. To evaluate early treatment results and toxicity in patients with meningiomas treated with particle therapy. Material and methods. Seventy patients with meningiomas were treated with protons (n = 38) or carbon ion radiotherapy (n = 26). Median age was 49 years. Median age at treatment was 55 years, 24 were male (34%), and 46 were female (66%). Histology was benign meningioma in 26 patients (37%), atypical in 23 patients (33%) and anaplastic in four patients (6%). In 17 patients (24%) with skull base meningiomas diagnosis was based on the typical appearance of a meningioma. For benign meningiomas, total doses of 52.2-57.6 GyE were applied with protons. For high-grade lesions, the boost volume was 18 GyE carbon ions, with a median dose of 50 GyE applied as highly conformal radiation therapy. Nineteen patients were treated as re-irradiation. Treatment planning with MRI and 68-Ga-DOTATOC-PET was evaluated. Results. Very low rates of side effects developed, including headaches, nausea and dizziness. No severe treatment-related toxicity was observed. Local control for benign meningiomas was 100%. Five of 27 patients (19%) developed tumor recurrence during follow-up. Of these, four patients had been treated as re-irradiation for recurrent high-risk meningiomas. Actuarial local control after re-irradiation of high-risk meningiomas was therefore 67% at six and 12 months. In patients treated with primary radiotherapy, only one of 13 patients (8%) developed tumor recurrence 17 months after radiation therapy (photon and carbon ion boost). Conclusion. Continuous prospective follow-up and development of novel study concepts are required to fully exploit the long-term clinical data after particle therapy for meningiomas. To date, it may be concluded that when proton therapy is available, meningioma patients can be offered a treatment at least comparable to high-end photon therapy.Copyright © 2013 Informa Healthcare.",Excluded
1780,"A prospective assessment of radiotherapy (RT)- Induced early functional renal changes by means of 23Na-Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Purpose: Radiation-induced renal damage is an important side effect for patients with long-term survival after abdominal RT. Time course of post-RT functional and morphological renal changes is unknown. MRI with 23Na imaging is a novel technique which provides functional kidney assessment. In a previous analysis, for long-term survivors of gastric cancer, late radiation induced changes in the kidney regions exposed to high doses but no alterations in regions exposed to intermediate/low doses were observed. Morphological and functional assessment in the acute post-RT phase in comparison to baseline values are missing. The purpose of this prospective study was to investigate kidney alterations and to correlate them to focal renal radiation doses before and early after abdominal RT. Patients/Methods: 3 pats without any known pre-RT kidney disease who were to undergo RT for abdominal sarcoma and B-NHL, respectively, were examined on a 3.0T scanner before and 2-6 weeks post-RT. In addition to T1- and T2w morphological sequences, 23Na images were obtained using a dedicated 23Na-tuned coil. The planning CT and the associated local radiation isodoses were deformably matched to the morphological MRI sequences with the software ""Velocity"" (Varian). Kidney regions exposed to radiation doses 5Gy, 20 Gy and 40Gy were identified and mean 23Na signal gradient along the cortico-medullary gradient and gradient slope were measured in these regions separately. Result(s): Mean relative 23Na signal of the cortico-medullary gradient and gradient slope matched with values of healthy volunteers in the pre-RT examination. All results are summarised in Table 1. In the first post-RT MRI, morphological sequences (T1 and T2w) did not show any changes. In kidney regions with doses below 20Gy, no changes in the 23Na-gradient slope were observed. For regions with doses of 40Gy and beyond, a functional result was observed that was different from the low dose regions: The slope of the 23Na cortico-medullary gradient in the high-dose regions was markedly reduced in the post-RT MRI when compared to the pre-RT MRI. (Table Presented) Average slope (in arbitrary units/pixel along the cortico-medullary axis) pre and post RT for different dose regions. A marked decrease in average slope is found for the 40Gy regions, whereas the slope of the cortico-medullary 23Na gradient remains high in areas receiving 20Gy or less. Conclusion(s): 2-6 weeks post RT, marked functional effects were observed in high-dose areas while no alteration in kidney function was observed in low dose areas (20Gy), indicating the value of functional MR imaging in the early assessment and characterisation of the chronological course of radiogenic nephrotoxicity.",Excluded
2087,"Surgeons' exposure to radiation in single- and multi- level minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion; a prospective study. Although minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (MIS-TLIF) has widely been developed in patients with lumbar diseases, surgeons risk exposure to fluoroscopic radiation. However, to date, there is no studies quantifying the effective dose during MIS-TLIF procedure, and the radiation dose distribution is still unclear. In this study, the surgeons' radiation doses at 5 places on the bodies were measured and the effective doses were assessed during 31 consecutive 1- to 3-level MIS-TLIF surgeries. The operating surgeon, assisting surgeon, and radiological technologist wore thermoluminescent dosimeter on the unshielded thyroid, chest, genitals, right middle finger, and on the chest beneath a lead apron. The doses at the lens and the effective doses were also calculated. Mean fluoroscopy times were 38.7, 53.1, and 58.5 seconds for 1, 2, or 3 fusion levels, respectively. The operating surgeon's mean exposures at the lens, thyroid, chest, genitals, finger, and the chest beneath the shield, respectively, were 0.07, 0.07, 0.09, 0.14, 0.32, and 0.05 mSv in 1-level MIS-TLIF; 0.07, 0.08, 0.09, 0.18, 0.34, and 0.05 mSv in 2-level; 0.08, 0.09, 0.14, 0.15, 0.36, and 0.06 mSv in 3-level; and 0.07, 0.08, 0.10, 0.15, 0.33, and 0.05 mSv in all cases. Mean dose at the operating surgeon's right finger was significantly higher than other measurements parts (P,0.001). The operating surgeon's effective doses (0.06, 0.06, and 0.07 mSv for 1, 2, and 3 fusion levels) were low, and didn't differ significantly from those of the assisting surgeon or radiological technologist. Revision MIS-TLIF was not associated with higher surgeons' radiation doses compared to primary MIS-TLIF. There were significantly higher surgeons' radiation doses in over-weight than in normal-weight patients. The surgeons' radiation exposure during MIS-TLIF was within the safe level by the International Commission on Radiological Protection's guidelines. The accumulated radiation exposure, especially to surgeon's hands, should be carefully monitored. © 2014 Funao et al.",Excluded
1965,"Diagnostic accuracy of 320-row computed tomography as compared with invasive coronary angiography in unselected, consecutive patients with suspected coronary artery disease. Noninvasive coronary angiography with multislice computed tomography (CT) scanners is feasible with high sensitivity and negative predictive value. The radiation exposure associated with this technique, however, is high and concerns in the widespread use of CT have arisen. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of coronary angiography using 320-row CT, which avoids exposure-intensive overscanning and overranging. We prospectively studied 118 unselected consecutive patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) referred for invasive coronary angiography (ICA). All patients had 320-row CT within 1 week of ICA, which, together with quantitative analysis, served as the reference standard. Of the 65 out of 118 patients who were diagnosed as having CAD by ICA, 64 (98 %) were correctly identified at 320-row CT. Noteworthy, 320-row CT correctly detected CAD in 3 patients with atrial fibrillation and ruled out the disease in the other 8 patients. From 151 significant coronary stenoses detected on ICA, 137 (91 %) were correctly identified with 320-row CT. In the per-patient analysis, sensitivity and specificity of 320-row CT were 98 and 91 %, respectively. In the per-vessel analysis, sensitivity and specificity of 320-row CT were 93 and 95 %, respectively. In the per segment analysis, sensitivity and specificity of 320-row CT were 91 and 99 %, respectively. Diameter stenosis determined with the use of CT showed good correlation with ICA (P < 0.001, R = 0.81) without significant underestimation or overestimation (-3.1 +/- 24.4 %; P = 0.08). Comparison of CT with ICA revealed a significantly smaller effective radiation dose (3.1 +/- 2.3 vs. 6.5 +/- 4.2 mSv; P < 0.05) and amount of contrast agent required (99 +/- 51 vs. 65 +/- 42 ml, P < 0.05) for 320 row CT. The present study in an unselected population including patients with atrial fibrillation demonstrates that 320-row CT may significantly reduce the radiation dose and amount of contrast agent required compared with ICA while maintaining a very high diagnostic accuracy.",Excluded
3567,"The impact of the effective dose to immune cells on lymphopenia and survival of esophageal cancer after chemoradiotherapy. Purpose: To test the hypothesis that effective dose to circulating immune cells (EDIC) impacts the severity of radiation-induced lymphopenia and clinical outcomes of esophageal cancer patients treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). Material(s) and Method(s): 488 esophageal cancer patients treated with CCRT with and without surgery were analyzed. The EDIC model considers the exposure of circulating immune cells as the proportion of blood flow to lung, heart, liver, and the volume of the exposed area of the body, with the basis of mean lung dose (MLD), mean heart dose (MHD), mean liver dose (MlD), and integral dose (ITD) of the body region scanned, calculated as: EDIC=0.12*MLD+0.08*MHD+0.15*0.85*MlD*[Formula presented]1/2+0.45+0.35*0.85*[Formula presented]1/2*[Formula presented] Where n is the fraction number. Correlations of EDIC with overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), distant metastasis free survival (DMFS), and locoregional control (LRC) rates were analyzed using both univariable and multivariable Cox models. Lymphopenia during CCRT was graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. Result(s): Grade 4 lymphopenia resulted in inferior clinical outcomes, including OS, PFS, and DMFS. The median EDIC was 3.6 Gy (range, 0.8-6.0 Gy). Higher EDIC was strongly associated with severe lymphopenia, particularly when EDIC was above 4 Gy. Patients with EDIC > 4.0 Gy had more G4 lymphopenia than those with EDIC <= 4.0 Gy (67.3% vs. 40.8%; P < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, increasing EDIC was independently and inversely associated with worse OS, PFS, and DMFS. Conclusion(s): EDIC can be recommended as a useful tool to predict lymphopenia and inferior clinical outcomes, and it should be minimized below 4 Gy.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
2291,"Flow cytometry-based assay for determination of teleost cytotoxic cell lysis of target cells. BACKGROUND: The nonradiometric assays previously developed to detect cellular cytotoxic activity have been hindered by many difficulties. Among the problems are the requirement for expensive commercial kits and the use of techniques that produce high background noise and decreased sensitivity. In addition, these assays did not account for bidirectional apoptosis (activation-induced cell death [AICD]). Most attempts to derive cytometry-based cytotoxicity assays have been unsuccessful because individual effectors and targets could not be identified (i.e., ""separated"") using gating techniques., METHODS: In the present study, teleost nonspecific cytotoxic (NCC) and mammalian target cells were each sufficiently different in size to identify them by flow cytometry (FCM). Using appropriate gating and discriminator techniques, these two cell populations were differentiated based on scatter properties and propidium iodide (PI) binding. Total capacity for PI binding was obtained by permeabilization of the targets with ice-cold acetone. Spontaneous PI binding was relatively low. This technique detected cytotoxicity at effector-to-target ratios (E:T) of 1:1 and after only 30 min cocultivation., RESULTS: Tilapia NCC from peripheral blood kill human transformed target cells by necrosis and apoptosis as identified by PI binding. Maximum killing of HL-60 targets (approximately 100%) occurred by 180 min cocultivation. For the same time, the killing of IM-9 did not exceed 60%. Almost 90% of IM-9 targets are lysed following 14 h of cocultivation. The maximum killing of both HL-60 and IM-9 targets was observed at a 25:1 E:T ratio after 14 h. Comparisons of the chromium(>51) release assay with flow detection of cytotoxicity revealed that FCM detected 55% lysis of the target cells compared with 2% cytotoxicity by chromium release, after a cocultivation time of 240 min., DISCUSSION: FCM detection of (teleost) NCC lysis of target cells using PI uptake is more sensitive than standard chromium release assays. This level of sensitivity was observed because NCC and targets were sufficiently different in size such that they could be resolved by scatter plots. Using FCM, cytotoxicity was detected earlier and at lower E:T ratios than previously reported for chromium release assays. Although tilapia were reported previously to be not capable of lysing IM-9 targets by chromium release detection, the more sensitive method of FCM detected cytotoxicity using PI uptake. HL-60 lysis by tilapia NCC exhibited saturable kinetics but occurred at different times post-cocultivation. Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Excluded

Purpose: The aim was to evaluate the effects of irradiation of Culex pipiens irradiated as pupae on the larval and pupal mortality percentages, the larval and pupal duration, adult emergence percentages and ovarian development in comparison with the un-irradiated group. Material(s) and Method(s): The mosquito, C. pipiens Linnaeus (L) was irradiated as pupae with three gamma doses 40, 60 and 80 Gy. Different biological aspects include the ovarian development of irradiated females tested. Result(s): Gamma doses used significantly increased the larval and pupal mortality percentages, the larval and pupal duration and significantly decreased the adult emergence percentages. Moreover, fecundity and egg hatchability percentages were severely decreased with increasing gamma doses. While the sterility% was positively correlated with the doses used. Gamma doses caused a dose-dependent decrease in the number of developed eggs, reduction in the number of developed oocytes, signs of degenerative processes in oocytes, yolk mass and egg size decrease. Conclusion(s): Results obtained indicated that gamma radiation of C. pipiens induced remarkable effects on the biological, developmental and reproductive activity.© 2018, Copyright © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group LLC.",Excluded
2638,"Role of routine chest radiography after percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy. BACKGROUND: The role of routine chest radiography (CXR) after percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) has been questioned., METHODS: We performed a prospective observational study, on a mixed medical/surgical critical care unit in a university teaching hospital. We studied all patients undergoing PDT as part of their critical care management from November 1, 2003 until July 31, 2007. All PDTs were performed under bronchoscopic guidance. After PDT, we reviewed the immediate post-procedural films to assess the utility of routine postoperative CXR. For the purposes of CXR review, we considered a procedure to be either uncomplicated or technically difficult. Clinically relevant CXR findings were new barotrauma (pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum) or a significant change in consolidation from the pre-procedure film., RESULTS: A total of 384 patients underwent PDT during the study period. Of these, 345 had immediate post-procedural CXRs available for review. There were 252 PDTs (73%) documented as uncomplicated. There were 93 (27%) technically difficult procedures, with 107 adverse events recorded. In 82 (24%) procedures, these difficulties were described as minor procedural complications [multiple attempts at needle insertion (> or = 3), minor bleeding or tracheal ring fracture]. Significant complications (mal-placement in the anterior mediastinum and major bleeding) were documented in 12 (3.5%) patients. New abnormalities were noted on 8 (2.3%) immediate post-procedural CXRs. In only one patient was there a new CXR change in an uncomplicated PDT., CONCLUSIONS: Immediate CXR after uncomplicated PDT performed under bronchoscopic guidance rarely reveals unexpected radiological abnormalities. The role of CXR after PDT appears to be restricted to those patients undergoing technically difficult and complicated procedures. A change in practice to this effect will lead to reductions in both medical costs and exposure of staff and patients to ionizing radiation.",Excluded
378,"Embo-EVAR: A Technique to Prevent Type II Endoleak? A Single-Center Experience. Background Intraprocedural aneurysm sac embolization (embo-EVAR) during endovascular abdominal aneurysm repair (EVAR) using coils and fibrin glue is a technique for preventing type II endoleak (EII). Our aim is to evaluate feasibility, safety and clinical outcome of this promising approach. Materials and Methods A retrospective clinical case analysis of 72 patients who underwent EVAR during the period 2011-2014. Two groups were compared at 6 and 12 months follow-up with contrast media computed tomography scan and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) imaging: consecutively, 36 patients (group A) treated with classic EVAR and 36 patients (group B) treated with embo-EVAR. Coils were released filling better as possible the aneurysm sac; the embolization was completed by injecting fibrin glue. Device and materials used, differential systemic and sac pressures, presence of any endoleak, and complication were registered. Results In our experience, we had 100% technical success without surgical conversion. Embo-EVAR was performed, after endograft deployment, in group B patients, all with ratio of DELTA-pressures (obtained from DELTA-sac pressure/DELTA-differential pressure) > 0.16. No early or late complications occurred and mortality was nil. Follow-up was performed with computed tomography-angiography and CEUS at 6 and 12 months. We observed 9 type II and 1 type Ia endoleak in group A and 2 type II and 1 type Ib endoleaks in group B. Mean radiation exposure time was 30.3 min in group A and 43.3 min in group B. EVAR procedure average cost was 9,000 . The average cost of sac embolization was 1,500. Conclusions Although a randomized study is necessary, embo-EVAR may be a valid approach to prevent type II endoleaks and further complications. Mild costs and exposure-dose increase could be accepted to avoid reinterventions, and in our experience, it could be routinely performed with excellent results.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1353,"Light panretinal photocoagulation (LPRP) versus classic panretinal photocoagulation (CPRP) in proliferative diabetic retinopathy. PURPOSE: We misled to verify whether a panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) performed using low levels of ARGON laser energy (light PRP) has the same efficacy as a PRP performed in a conventional fashion using argon green wavelengths (classic PRP) in eyes with high-risk proliferative diabetic retinopathy (HRPDR). Furthermore, we misled to compare the session number performed and the side effects produced by the two techniques., METHODS: Sixty-five eyes with HRPDR of 50 consecutive patients were enrolled in a prospective randomized controlled trial. In eyes selected for light PRP, a very light biomicroscopic effect on the retina was obtained for each spot. In eyes assigned to classic PRP, each spot produced a white-yellow biomicroscopic effect. Mean follow-up was 22.4 months +/- 9.7 in the light PRP and 21.6 months +/- 9.3 in the classic PRP group (p = 0.727)., RESULTS: The initial mean logMAR visual acuity (VA) in the light PRP group was 0.12 +/- 0.13 and in the classic PRP group 0.14 +/- 0.15 (p = 0.493). The final mean VA in the former was 0.18 +/- 0.25, and in the latter 0.27 +/- 0.30 (p = 0.231). Median power was 235mW (100-540mW) for light and 420mW (200-950mW) for classic PRP (p < 0.001). Regression of HRPDR at the end of the follow-up was obtained in 30/31 eyes (97%) treated with classic PRP and in 31/34 eyes (91%) treated with light PRP (p = 0.615). The total mean session number was 7.4 +/- 2.4 for light and 9.9 +/- 2.2 for the classic PRP group (p < 0.001). Complications were more frequent in the classic PRP group., CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of Light PRP is similar to that of classic Light PRP in eyes with HRPDR. Light PRP is associated with fewer complications and allows the reduction of the number of treatment sessions.",Excluded

We queried the National Cancer Data Base for stage I-II Hodgkin lymphoma patients and analyzed radiation dose in patients receiving combined modality therapy (CMT). We found a higher use of 20 Gy as a component of CMT after 2010, the year of publication of the GHSG HD10 trial results., Introduction: Treatment for early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) involves radiotherapy (RT), chemotherapy, or combined modality therapy (CMT). We analyzed reduction of RT dose in CMT, particularly in the context of German Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG) HD10 randomized trial results of 2010. Patients and Methods: The National Cancer Data Base was queried for patients with stage I-II HL receiving CMT. RT dose and associated characteristics were analyzed. Stage I and absence of B symptoms were used as a surrogate for early-stage favorable disease. Result(s): Of 31,301 patients with stage I-II HL, 11,457 received CMT between 2004 and 2015. Using the surrogate defined above, 1955 patients (17.1%) were classified as having favorable disease. The majority (61.6%) received 30-36 Gy, while 7.0% received 20 Gy. The provision of 20 Gy was more common in stage I patients (12.3% vs. 5.4% in stage II) and at academic facilities (10.8% vs. 6.3%-8.9% at other facilities). Use of 20 Gy (vs. 30-36 Gy) was less likely with thorax site (odds ratio [OR] 0.43 vs. head and neck), stage II disease (OR 0.41), and B symptoms (OR 0.33). Notably, the use of 20 Gy increased dramatically after 2010 (the year of publication of GHSG HD10 trial results), with rates of 12.3% in 2010-2015 versus 0.1% in 2004-2009 (OR 6.3, P <.001). This was even more pronounced in cases of favorable early-stage disease, with 25.5% after 2010 versus 2.8% before 2010 (OR 13.2, P <.001). The use of doses > 36 Gy decreased over a corresponding time period (OR 0.44, P <.001). Conclusion(s): Analysis of CMT for patients with early-stage HL demonstrates variability in RT dose, including increasing use of 20 Gy and decreasing use of high doses > 36 Gy.Copyright © 2020",Excluded

Background Previous studies on ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure before and after a diagnosis of cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) have been based primarily on questionnaires. Objective measures are needed. Objectives To assess changes in UVR exposure in patients with CMM using objective surrogate parameters in a descriptive study. Methods Ten patients recently diagnosed with CMM during the 5 months (autumn and winter) preceding study start in February 2009; 21 patients diagnosed from 12 months to 6 years before study start; and 15 controls, who matched the recently diagnosed patients on age, sex, residential area, constitutive skin type and occupation completed the investigations. UVR exposure before and after diagnosis of CMM was assessed using measures of serum 25-hydro vitamin D [25(OH)D], skin pigmentation and by interviews. Winter 25(OH)D was used as a surrogate parameter of UVR exposure the previous summer - the summer before CMM diagnosis in recently diagnosed patients. Results Winter 25(OH)D was significantly higher among recently diagnosed patients compared with controls (P = 0.02, R2 = 0.60) and patients diagnosed up to 6 years earlier (P = 0.01). The increase in 25(OH)D during the summer after diagnosis was significantly lower for recently diagnosed patients than for controls (P = 0.005, R2 = 0.51) and patients diagnosed up to 6 years earlier (P = 0.008). No difference was found in summer 25(OH)D between the groups. Conclusions Our findings suggest that patients with CMM had a higher UVR exposure the summer before diagnosis than did controls and patients diagnosed up to 6 years earlier, and that after diagnosis UVR exposure fell to the level of controls in patients with CMM. © 2011 The Authors.

AIM: To assess the value of a single-phase dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) urography protocol with synchronous nephrographic-excretory phase enhancement and to calculate the potential dose reduction by omitting the unenhanced scan., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-four patients referred for haematuria underwent CT urography using a protocol that included single-energy unenhanced and dual-energy contrast-enhanced with synchronous nephrographic-excretory phase scans. DECT-based images [virtual unenhanced (VUE), weighted average, and colour-coded iodine overlay] were reconstructed. Opacification degree by contrast media of the upper urinary tract, and image quality of virtual unenhanced images were independently evaluated using a four-point scale. The diagnostic accuracy in detecting urothelial tumours on DECT-based images was determined. The dose of a theoretical dual-phase single-energy protocol was obtained by multiplying the effective dose of the unenhanced single-energy acquisition by two. Radiation dose saving by omitting the unenhanced scan was calculated., RESULTS: The degree of opacification was scored as optimal or good in 86.9% of cases (k = 0.72); VUE image quality was excellent or good in 83.3% of cases (k = 0.82). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for urothelial tumours detection were 85.7, 98.6, 92.3, and 97.1%. Omission of the unenhanced scan led to a mean dose reduction of 42.7 +/- 5%., CONCLUSION: Single-phase DECT urography with synchronous nephrographic-excretory phase enhancement represents an accurate ""all-in-one'' approach with a radiation dose saving up to 45% compared with a standard dual-phase protocol.

Purpose: To retrospectively review outcomes and toxicities for patients with recurrent head and neck cancer (HNC) undergoing re-irradiation (re-RT). Method(s): Retrospective review of oncologic outcomes and toxicity data from patients who received head and neck (HN) re-RT with curative intent using intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) from 2011 to 2016. Common toxicities were scored using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) V4. Treatment outcomes included progression-free survival (PFS), locoregional control (LRC), and overall survival (OS). Result(s): Twenty-one patients with HNC were re-irradiated with curative intent. The median follow-up after re-RT was 27.8 months. The median retreatment dose was 66 Gy (range, 60-70), and the median retreatment volume was 194.1 cm3 (range, 52.4-1375.6). The median LRC, PFS, and OS were 10 months, 8.4 months, and 18.1 months, respectively. Patients treated with surgery as a component of primary HN cancer treatment had significantly worse PFS and OS when retreated compared with those initially treated with chemoradiation alone (p = 0.026 and p = 0.005, respectively). Those with stage IVA/B recurrent disease had worse LRC, PFS, and OS compared with stage II/III disease (p = 0.029, p = 0.049, and p = 0.020 respectively). Acute grade >= 3 toxicity and late grade >= 3 toxicity were 38% and 38%, respectively, with dysphagia being most common (24% acute and 14% late). Conclusion(s): Re-irradiation with IMRT for locally advanced HN recurrences either definitively or after salvage surgery is feasible, but treatment-related toxicity remains significant. Patients who received surgery as a component of their initial treatment and those with more advanced stage disease may be more difficult to salvage with re-irradiation.Copyright © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
319,"Disaster preparedness education and a Midwest Regional Poison Center. OBJECTIVE: To assess knowledge and comfort related to disaster preparedness and response gained and retained from a disaster medicine workshop given to Certified Specialists in Poison Information (CSPI). DESIGN: A pilot study with a pre-post intervention design. SETTING: A Midwest Regional Poison Center. PARTICIPANTS: All CSPIs employed at the participating Poison Center (N = 27) were recruited. Participation ranged from 44 percent (n = 12) for the 4-month postworkshop knowledge quiz to 78 percent (n = 21) for the preworkshop survey. INTERVENTION: A disaster medicine workshop was given to the CSPIs. Quizzes and surveys were done preworkshop and then repeated at 1 week, 4 months, and 14 months postworkshop. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: CSPI knowledge and comfort pertaining to disaster-related calls. RESULT(S): CSPIs' comfort levels with calls regarding major chemical or nuclear/radiation disasters significantly increased and stayed elevated during all follow-up periods [Kruskal-Wallis chi2 (3) = 13.1, p = 0.01]. The average preworkshop quiz score was 58.2 percent. A statistically significant increase in mean quiz score was demonstrated amongst preworkshop and postworkshop scores at all tested time intervals (F = 18.8, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION(S): CSPIs' knowledge regarding disaster management significantly increased after a disaster medicine workshop, and this knowledge was significantly retained for the 14-month duration of this study. Currently, there are no uniform guidelines for Poison Centers regarding disaster response training. Studies targeted at the development of educational competencies for CSPIs and disaster response would help to standardize this much needed education.",Excluded
1352,"The role of CT and MRI fusion reconstruction-guided 3D printing navigation template for puncture during sacral neuromodulation: a clinical randomized controlled trial. Objective: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the accurate puncture during sacral neuromodulation (SNM) guided with 3D printing navigation template based on reconstruction techniques using fusing sacral CT and MRI images. Method(s): Totally 42 patients operated with SNM were selected in Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University from July 2016 to August 2017. The patients were randomly divided into control group (n=22) and experimental group (n=20) using random number table. The conventional cross-positioning technique under X-ray was used for puncture during SNM in the control group. While in the experimental group, the sacral CT and MRI images were fused for reconstruction and design of the navigation template, printed by 3D technique for the puncture in SNM. The times of punctures, the average time for puncture operation, the time of intraoperative testing of the stimulator device, the minimum onset voltage of the stimulator, the X-ray radiation dose, postoperative curative effect (rate of secondary transformation) and the incidence rate of complications were compared between the two methods using independent-simple t test or chi2 test. Result(s): Compared to control group, fewer times of punctures, shorter time needed for puncture operation, shorter time of intraoperative testing of the stimulator, smaller radiation dose and minimum effective voltage were found in the experimental group (P<0.05). There were 15 and 16 patients who completed the secondary transformation in the control group and experimental group, and there was no significant difference between the two groups (chi2=0.757, P=0.384). There were 3 cases of complications in the control group, including 2 cases of infection and 1 case of bleeding, while no complications in the experimental group. Conclusion(s): CT and MRI images fusion reconstruction-guided 3D printing navigation template can help perform accurate and safe punctures in SNM. Compared to conventional puncture positioned under X-ray, it can effectively improve the puncture efficiency, and reduce the radiation dose in the operation.Copyright © 2021 Chinese Medical Association",Excluded
1489,"Abdominal applications of 3.0-T MR imaging: comparative review versus a 1.5-T system. With the development of dedicated receiver coils and increased gradient performance, 3.0-T magnetic resonance (MR) systems are gaining wider acceptance in clinical practice. The expected twofold increase in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared with that of 1.5-T MR systems may help improve spatial resolution or increase temporal resolution when used with parallel acquisition techniques. Several issues must be considered when applying 3.0-T MR in the abdomen, including the alteration of the radiofrequency field and relaxation time, increase in energy deposition and susceptibility effects, and problems associated with motion artifacts. For the evaluation of liver lesions, higher SNR and greater resolution achieved with the 3.0-T system could translate into better detection of malignant lesions on T2-weighted images obtained with adjusted imaging parameters. For the evaluation of pancreatic and biliary diseases, high-resolution T2-weighted imaging using single-shot turbo spin-echo sequences is useful; improvement in SNR was noticeable on two-dimensional MR cholangiopancreatographic images. For the preoperative imaging of rectal cancer, a single-shot sequence is useful for dramatically decreasing imaging time while maintaining image quality. Substantial modification of examination protocols, with optimized imaging parameters and sequence designs along with ongoing development of hardware, could contribute to an increased role of the 3.0-T system for abdominal MR examinations.",Excluded
2981,"Outcomes of surgical management of peptic ulcer perforation using the falciform ligament: A cross-sectional study at a single centre in Vietnam. Introduction: Peptic ulcer perforation (PUP) is one of the most common critical surgical emergencies. The omentum flap is commonly used to cover a PUP. However, the omentum cannot be used in cases of severe peritonitis or previous surgical removal. This is the first study conducted in Vietnam that was designed to analyse the outcomes of patients with PUPs who were treated using the falciform ligament. Method(s): In this study, we retrospectively identified 40 consecutive patients who were treated for PUP at a single high-volume centre in Vietnam from February 2018 to February 2021. Peptic ulcer perforation was measured during diagnostic evaluation based on preoperative imaging, such as X-ray, and CT scan. Patients who had malignancy, laparoscopic surgery, omentopexy and nonoperative treatment were excluded from this research. Result(s): Forty patients were included; the mean age of the patients was 66.3 years (range 33-99 years), and some patients had comorbid disease (57.5%), hypertension (30%), diabetes (10%), cirrhosis (7.5%), and chronic renal failure (7.5%). The PUPs were located in the duodenum (80%), or the pyloric (15%) and prepyloric (5%) regions. The procedures used to treat the patients included duodenostomy (32.5%), gastrojejunostomy (37.5%), and antrum resection (2.5%). The average operative time was 88.6 min (45-180 min), hospital stay was 9.6 days (2-35 days), and oral intake was started at 4.1 days (3-8 days); additionally, the 30-day mortality (17.5%) and incidences of pneumonia (25%), multiorgan failure (15%), acute liver failure (5%), wound infection (7.5%), and ulcer peptic fistula (0%) were assessed. Univariate tests showed that an ASA >= III and comorbidities, such as pulmonary complications, liver failure and multiorgan failure, were associated with mortality. The multivariate test showed that multiorgan failure was the only factor related to mortality. Conclusion(s): The falciform ligament can be efficiently used for the closure of a PUP. Although there were no instances of complication with a reperforated peptic ulcer, the mortality rate was slightly highly related to severe comorbidities and postoperative multiorgan failure.Copyright © 2021",Excluded
1691,"Low-dose coronary computed tomography angiography using prospective ECG-triggering compared to invasive coronary angiography. To assess the diagnostic accuracy of prospective ECG-triggering 64-slice multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) coronary angiography for evaluation of coronary artery disease (CAD). Forty-two patients (31 males, 11 females, mean age 64 years) underwent cardiac CT and invasive coronary angiography (ICA). Patients with a heart rate of <65 beats/min with stable heart rhythm were included in the study sample. We used a prospective ECG-triggering protocol. Luminal narrowing over 50% was considered to be significant according to a modified 17-segment AHA model, using invasive coronary angiography (ICA) as the standard of reference. The mean radiation dose was 3.5 mSv +/- 0.3 (range, 3.3-4.2 mSv), and 542 of 549 segments (98.7%) in the 42 patients were diagnostic. In contrast, 119 of 542 segments (22%) were diagnosed as significant by ICA. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV and NPV were 95.0, 96.2, 96, 85.8 and 98.8%, respectively. False positive results were affected by densely calcified plaques, whereas false negatives were caused by motion artifact with poor vessel attenuation at the distal segments or near the bifurcation area of the coronary arteries. Prospective ECG-triggering MDCT is a useful method for evaluating CAD in patients with a lower heart rate with low radiation dose. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.",Excluded
2645,"Relationships between ionizing radiation, bone marrow transplantation and leukemogenesis. Studies of the relationships between ionizing radiation, bone marrow transplantation and leukemogenesis were carried out in 343 LACA mice. The recipients (female) were given whole-body irradiation with 7 or 8 Gy of Co-60 gamma-rays, while the donors (male) were given whole-body irradiation with 3, 1.5, 0.5, 0.1, 0.05 and 0 Gy of Co-60 gamma-rays. Each recipient was intravenously infused with 1-3 X 10(7) of the mixed marrow cells of donors. In the result, the average incidence of surviving over 1 month was 86% in the recipients. Myelocytic leukemia developed in all the transplanted groups, the average incidence being 88.5%. Leukemia was observed in 1.5-2.5 months after transplantation in the recipients receiving marrow cells from donors exposed to 3 Gy, but in 5-8 months in other groups. It was demonstrated by the analysis of Y-chromosome that the leukemic cells were derived from the donor's marrow cells. The results suggest that marrow transplantation for the mice irradiated by Co-60 gamma-rays of lethal dose can protect them from death, but promote the development of leukemia. Radiation can induce production of factors which lead to leukemic transformation of engrafted normal marrow cells in the irradiated mice; the direct damage of DNA caused by radiation is not the unique factor that gives rise to leukemia.",Excluded
516,"Long-term hearing outcomes following stereotactic radiosurgery for vestibular schwannoma: Patterns of hearing loss and variables influencing audiometric decline. Object. The goals of this retrospective cohort study were as follows: 1) to describe the long-term prevalence and timing of hearing deterioration following low-dose (12- to 13-Gy marginal dose) stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for vestibular schwannoma (VS); and 2) to identify clinical variables associated with long-term preservation of useful hearing following treatment. Methods. Patients with serviceable hearing who underwent SRS for VS between 1997 and 2002 were studied. Data including radiosurgery treatment plans, tumor characteristics, pre- and posttreatment pure tone average, speech discrimination scores, and American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery hearing class were collected. Time to nonserviceable hearing was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate associations with time to nonserviceable hearing were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results. Forty-four patients met the study criteria and were included. The median duration of audiometric follow- up was 9.3 years. Thirty-six patients developed nonserviceable hearing at a mean of 4.2 years following SRS. The Kaplan-Meier estimated rates of serviceable hearing at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 years following SRS were 80%, 55%, 48%, 38%, and 23%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that pretreatment ipsilateral pure tone average (p < 0.001) and tumor size (p = 0.009) were statistically significantly associated with time to nonserviceable hearing. Conclusions. Durable hearing preservation a decade after low-dose SRS for VS occurs in less than one-fourth of patients. Variables including preoperative hearing capacity and tumor size may be used to predict hearing outcomes following treatment. These findings may assist in pretreatment risk disclosure. Furthermore, these data demonstrate the importance of long-term follow-up when reporting audiometric outcomes following SRS for VS. © AANS, 2013.",Excluded
1362,"Keratocyte reflectivity and corneal haze. Corneal transparency is a remarkable characteristic that is essential for vision. Biophysical models of corneal transparency have entirely focused on the stromal extracellular matrix and disruption of the regular array of collagen fibres as the main reason for corneal haziness. Therefore, disorder of corneal transparency has traditionally been explained by a combination of three main factors: (1) abnormal water content (i.e. swelling or edema); (2) abnormal collagen fibre diameter, spacing, and orientation (i.e. scar tissue or fibrosis); and (3) abnormal accumulation of macromolecules (proteins, glycosaminoglycans, lipids, etc.) as in many corneal dystrophies. Here, clinical and experimental data are provided to support the concept that corneal keratocytes, which are normally invisible and transmit light, may show intense light scattering in injured corneas. Thus, the existence of a fourth group of corneal transparency disorders is proposed that predominantly are associated with abnormal cellular-based reflections from multiple layers of stromal keratocytes. In this group of patients, the light scattering structures (keratocyte nuclei, cell-body, and cell-processes) cannot be discriminated using standard slit-lamp biomicroscopy but requires a confocal microscopic examination. Despite their importance, almost nothing is known about the physical basis for the invisibility and haziness of the keratocytes. A more comprehensive model to understand corneal transparency is needed and should include the interaction of visible light with the physical structure of the keratocyte and its subcellular constituents.",Excluded

Background and purpose: This phase II study evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of weekly cisplatin along with concomitant boost accelerated radiation regimen in patients with locally advanced unresectable head and neck carcinoma. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 94 patients (median age, 58 years) with UICC stage III (n=19) and IV (n=75) cancer of the oropharynx, larynx, hypopharynx and oral cavity were included. Patients received radiotherapy with a concomitant boost scheme (1.8 Gy on days 1-40 and 1.5 Gy boost on days 25-40 with a total dose of 72 Gy) and concurrent cisplatin, 40 mg/m2 weekly, for the first 4 weeks. Result(s): Most patients (95%) received both radiation and chemotherapy according to protocol. Toxicity was manageable with grade III mucositis and pharyngeal-oesophageal toxicity in 85 and 50% of patients, respectively. Haematological toxicity was mild. Four patients (4%) died due to complications. With a median follow of 41 months, median overall survival and time to progression were 27 and 25 months, respectively. The estimated overall survival at 4 years was 41%. Conclusion(s): Concomitant boost accelerated radiation plus concurrent weekly cisplatin is a feasible schedule in patients with locally advanced unresectable head and neck carcinoma, with acceptable toxicity and survival data. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In this study, we investigated the prognosis of AA with radiologic necrosis which is the representative radiologic finding of glioblastoma. From 1995 to 2010, we operated on 26 patients who were confirmed to have AA. The male:female ratio was 13:13, and the median age was 47.23 years. The mean follow-up period was 3 years. We analyzed the prognostic significance of radiologic necrosis with age, sex, KPS, tumour location, radiologic findings, extent of removal and radiation therapy oncology group recursive partitioning analysis (RTOG-RPA) classification. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 0.5 (+/-0.17) years and the median overall survival (OS) was 1.6 (+/-0.40) years. In univariate analysis, the clinical variables of younger age (p = 0.030) and RTOG-RPA class III (p = 0.043) correlated with longer PFS, and KPS (p = 0.038), radiologic necrosis (p = 0.013) and the extent of removal (p = 0.041) correlated with OS. The median OS was 1.0 (+/-0.21) year in AA with radiologic necrosis compared to AA without radiologic necrosis, which showed 2.1 (+/-0.29) years median OS. On multivariate analysis, there was no statistically significant prognostic factor. However, Cox's regression model revealed that gross total removal was associated with a longer OS (hazard ratio =0.136; 95% CI, 0.018 to 1.046; p = 0.055) compared to partial removal or biopsy. Gross total resection was associated with good prognosis, and AA with radiologic necrosis had poor prognosis like glioblastoma. © 2013 The Neurosurgical Foundation.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: Radiation therapy's (RT's) effects on cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) such as implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) and pacemakers (PMs) are not well established, leading to device removal or relocation in preparation for RT., OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of scattered RT on CIED performance., METHODS: We analyzed 69 patients--50 (72%) with PMs and 19 (28%) with ICDs--receiving RT at the University of Michigan. Collected data included device model, anatomic location, and treatment beam energies, treatment type, and estimated dose to the device. Patients were treated with either high-energy (16-MV) and/or low-energy (6 MV) photon beams with or without electron beams (6-16 MeV). The devices were interrogated with pre- and post-RT and/or weekly with either in-treatment or home interrogation, depending on the patient's dependence on the device and the estimated or measured delivered dose. Outcomes analyzed were inappropriate ICD therapies, device malfunctions, or device-related clinical events., RESULTS: The PMs were exposed to 84.4 +/- 99.7 cGy of radiation, and the ICDs were exposed to 92.1 +/- 72.6 cGy of radiation. Two patients with ICDs experienced a partial reset of the ICD with the loss of historic diagnostic data after receiving 123 and 4 cGy, respectively. No device malfunction or premature battery depletion was observed at 6-month follow-up from RT completion., CONCLUSIONS: CIED malfunction due to indirect RT exposure is uncommon. Regular in-treatment or home interrogation should be done to detect and treat these events and to ensure that diagnostic data are preserved. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Nine patients required hospitalization, and 1 patient died., METHODS: To investigate the outbreak, pneumonia case patients were matched to control participants on the basis of age, sex, and community of residence. Participants in the investigation and their household contacts were interviewed, and serum samples and respiratory tract specimens were collected. Risk factors were evaluated by means of conditional logistic regression., RESULTS: Among 32 pneumonia case patients, 21 (65%) had confirmed or probable HAdV-14 infection. None of 32 matched control participants had evidence of HAdV-14 infection (P<.001 for the difference). Factors independently associated with pneumonia included contact with a known HAdV-14-infected case patient (odds ratio [OR], 18.3 [95% confidence interval {CI}, >or=2.0]), current smoking (OR, 6.7 [95% CI, >or=0.9]), and having neither traveled off the island nor attended a large public gathering (OR, 14.7 [95% CI, >or=2.0]). Fourteen (67%) of 21 HAdV-14-positive case patients belonged to a single network of people who socialized and often smoked together and infrequently traveled off the island. HAdV-14 infection occurred in 43% of case-patient household contacts, compared with 5% of control-participant household contacts (P = .005)., CONCLUSIONS: During a community outbreak in Alaska, HAdV-14 appeared to have spread mostly among close contacts and not widely in the community. Demographic characteristics and illness patterns among the case patients were similar to those observed in other recent outbreaks of HAdV-14 infection in the United States.",Excluded

Objective: To compare the proportion of emergency department (ED) patients who undergo subsequent chest CT or MR within 1 year of an initially negative scan for pulmonary embolism (PE). Method(s): This single-center, retrospective, observational study examined the use of chest CT or MR for ED patients with MR angiography (MRA) negative for PE during April 2008 to March 2013. We compared the 1-year scan utilization for these cases to an age- and sex-matched cohort of patients who underwent CT angiography (CTA). We also calculated time to first follow-up scan and mean radiation dose in each arm. Trained data abstractors used a standardized protocol and electronic case report form to gather all outcomes of interest. Results are reported as means or proportions with their associated confidence intervals (CIs). Result(s): In all, 717 ED patients (430 MRAs and 287 CTAs) were included. At 1 year, the proportion undergoing subsequent imaging (MRA 16.7%, CTA 15.3%; difference = 1.4%, 95% CI 4.05%-6.86%) and time to first follow-up scan (difference = 13 days, 95% CI -22.69-48.7) did not differ between arms. Mean radiation dose per patient at 1 year was significantly higher in the CTA arm (9.82 mSv; 95% CI 9.12-10.53) compared with 2.92 mSv (95% CI 1.86-3.98) with MRA. Those with an index MRA were more likely to undergo subsequent MRAs (odds ratio 3.68; 95% CI 1.22-11.12) than those with an index CTA.

Nine patients with 11 primary or secondary liver non-neuroendocrine malignancies with mean and maximum diameters of 4.0 and 7.7 cm became long-term survivors after precision irradiation in a stereotactic body frame. Doses varied from 20 to 45 Gy split at 2-4 occasions a few days apart, with higher doses in the target centers. Occasional chemotherapy was stopped well before irradiation. No hospitalizations were needed because side effects, regional pain and nausea, were mild. All patients have now survived 5-14 years without recurrences. Two verified and one suspected secondary cancers occurred in organs close to the irradiated targets, and two of them could be resected for cure. Precision irradiation can thus cure selected liver malignancies. It is the first non-invasive method to achieve this, and the present patients are its first long-term survivors. A prolonged follow-up period is, however, necessary, because we have in other patients seen local tumor regrowth as late as four years after irradiation. The approach may cure some tumors, which are technically unsuited for other treatment modalities, and can be used for patients at high surgical risk. The success rate for local control seems good, but has to be defined by formal studies after optimization of radiation doses. © 2008 Humana Press Inc.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To compare the demarcation line depth after 2 different protocols of simultaneous laser in situ keratomileusis and collagen crosslinking (LASIK Xtra)., METHODS: Twenty-three patients receiving bilateral LASIK Xtra were included in this comparative interventional study. The corneal stroma was soaked with 0.22% riboflavin for 90 seconds before flap repositioning. One eye was then randomized to receive either 18 mW/cm of ultraviolet A irradiation for 120 seconds or for 180 seconds, whereas the fellow eye received the other irradiation duration. The demarcation line on anterior-segment optical coherence tomography and grading of corneal haze on slit lamp were compared at postoperative month 1., RESULTS: The average age was 29.0 +/- 8.2 years. There was no statistical difference in preoperative spherical equivalent refraction (P > 0.05). At postoperative 1 month, a well-defined demarcation line was visible in 74% and 70% in the 2- and 3-minute groups, respectively. The demarcation line depth was 282 +/- 51 mum and 284 +/- 43 mum, respectively (P = 1), and the ratio of the demarcation line depth to the postoperative central corneal thickness was 0.69 +/- 0.13 and 0.72 +/- 0.10 (P = 0.61). There was no difference in the percentage of eyes with grade 1 or 2 corneal haze (P = 0.76)., CONCLUSIONS: The depth of the demarcation line was the same after receiving 18-mW/cm irradiation for either 2 or 3 minutes. The amount of early postoperative corneal haze was also similar. We postulate that there was lack of oxygen in the corneal tissue to fuel the photochemical reaction despite given additional time.",Excluded

Aim: Investigation of the biodistribution and calculation of dosimetry of Ga-68-DOTATOC- for patients imaged in the routine clinical setting for diagnosis or exclusion of neuroendocrine tumours. Patients, methods: Dynamic PET/CT-imaging (Biograph 16) was performed over 20 min in 14 patients (8 men, 6 women) after injection of (112 +/- 22) MBq 68Ga-DOTATOC followed by whole body 3D-acquisition (8 bed positions, 3 or 4 min each) 30 min p.i. and 120 min p.i.. Urinary tracer elimination was measured and blood activity was derived non-invasively from the blood pool of the heart. The relevant organs for dosimetry were spleen, kidneys, liver, adrenals, urinary bladder and pituitary gland. Dosimetry was performed using OLINDA/EXM 1.0 software and specific organ uptake was expressed as standardized uptake values (SUVs). Result(s): Rapid physiological uptake of the radiotracer could be demonstrated in liver, spleen and kidneys, adrenals and pituitary gland (mean SUVs were 6, 20, 16, 10, and 4, respectively). Radiotracer elimination was exclusively via urine (16% of injected dose within 2h); no redistribution could be observed. The spleen and the kidneys received the highest radiation exposure (0.24 mSv/MBq, 0.22 mSv/MBq resp.), mean effective dose yielded 0.023 mSv/MBq. Conclusion(s): 68Ga-DOTATOC is used extensively for diagnosis of somatostatin receptor positive tumours because it has several advantages over the 111In-labelled ligand. The derived dosimetric values are lower than first approximations from the biological data of OctreoScan. The use of CT for transmission correction of the PET data delivers radiation exposure up to 1 mSv (low dose). © Schattauer 2009.",Excluded

Following SRS, 12 lesions had late ARE at a median of 33.2 months and 7 lesions had late LF occurring a median of 23.6 months. As patients with cancer live longer and as SRS is increasingly utilized for treatment of brain metastases, the incidence of these previously rare imaging changes is likely to increase. Clinicians should be aware of these late events, with ARE occurring up to 5.3 years and local failure up to 3.8 years following SRS in our cohort.Copyright © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Excluded
3696,"Quantification of coronary artery calcium on the basis of dual-energy coronary CT angiography. PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility of using virtual noncontrast material-enhanced (VNC) computed tomographic (CT) series derived from dual-energy CT imaging studies for coronary artery calcium quantification., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This HIPAA-compliant study was institutional review board approved; all patients provided written informed consent. Thirty-six patients prospectively underwent noncontrast-enhanced CT calcium scoring followed by coronary CT angiography performed in dual-energy mode. By using different reconstruction algorithms, three VNC series were generated and evaluated for noise and efficiency of virtual iodine removal. Two readers independently quantified calcium on VNC images and true noncontrast-enhanced conventional calcium scoring series. A leave-one-out cross validation was used to assess the accuracy of calcium score prediction from VNC series by means of linear regression., RESULTS: CT value histograms of the VNC series closely resembled the profile in the true noncontrast-enhanced series. There was excellent correlation between calcium volumes on the VNC series and true noncontrast-enhanced series on a per-patient (r = 0.94, P < .001, n = 36) and per-vessel (r = 0.94, 0.91, and 0.92 for the three coronary arteries, all P < .001, n = 36 each) level. The ability of a linear regression model to predict actual calcium scores from calcium volumes on VNC series was excellent (r = 0.82). Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis rankings that were derived from the predicted calcium scores also showed excellent agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.909)., CONCLUSION: Coronary artery calcium identification and quantification based on dual-energy coronary CT angiographic studies may obviate the need for dedicated CT calcium scoring studies.

1008,"Tissue microarray constructs to predict a response to chemoradiation in rectal cancer. PURPOSE: To identify, using tissue microarray (TMA), an immunohistochemical panel predictive of response to ionizing radiation (IR) in rectal cancer., METHODS: TMA constructs were prepared from archived stage II/III rectal tumors and matching adjacent mucosa (n=38) from patients treated with pre-operative chemoradiation. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed for MIB, Cyclin E, p21, p27, p53, survivin, Bcl-2, and BAX. Immunoreactivity along with clinical variables was subjected to univariate and forward stepwise logistic regression analyses., RESULTS: Pathological complete response (pCR) was 23.9%. The number of positive lymph nodes obtained in the resected specimen was associated with pCR. Immunoreactivity for MIB (Sn 15%, Sp 65%, OR 0.33), p53 (Sn 3%, Sp 84%, OR 0.16), Bcl-2 (Sn 11%, Sp 74%, OR 0.35), and BAX (Sn 92%, Sp 80%, OR 46) was associated with pathological response (all p's<0.001). Forward stepwise logistic regression analysis demonstrated that MIB was an independent predictor of a response to chemoradiation (p=0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: A combined panel of mediators of apoptosis alone or combined with clinical factors is a feasible approach that can be applied to rectal tumor biopsies to predict a response to chemoradiation. The most sensitive factor was BAX; while MIB independently predicted a response to chemoradiation. Copyright Published by Elsevier Ltd.",Excluded
1740,"Impact of Endovascular Technique on Fluoroscopy Usage: Stent-Assisted Coiling versus Flow Diversion for Paraclinoid Internal Carotid Artery Aneurysms. Flow diversion is increasingly being utilized for the treatment of internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of endovascular technique--flow diversion versus stent-assisted coiling (SAC) on fluoroscopy time in patients treated for wide-neck paraclinoid ICA aneurysms. A retrospective review identified the 20 most recent consecutive patients treated for wide-neck paraclinoid ICA aneurysms by flow diversion and SAC respectively. Fluoroscopy time, cumulative dose area-product (DAP), contrast usage, intra-procedural complications, and total procedure time were collected and compared between the two treatment techniques. Treatment groups were comparable in terms of demographics, contrast usage, and clinical and angiographic outcomes. Flow diversion was associated with a significant reduction in fluoroscopy time (52.0 minutes versus 77.4 minutes), and demonstrated a strong trend towards shorter total procedure time (172 minutes versus 202 minutes). Average patient radiation exposure as measured by DAP was lower in the flow diversion group, 13225 mGy(x)cm(2) versus 15124 mGy(x)cm(2), although this finding was not statistically significant. There was no significant difference in contrast usage between the two groups, 152 ml and 159 (flow diversion and SAC respectively). The rate of complete aneurysm occlusion was higher in the flow diversion group (80% versus 60%). Endovascular treatment of paraclinoid ICA aneurysms with flow diversion is associated with shorter fluoroscopy times compared to stent-assisted coiling. There is also a likely reduction in overall procedure time. These results should be considered when recommending a treatment course for patients with such lesions.",Excluded
2624,"Utility of new bioabsorptive screws in cervical anterior fusion. Background: The aim of this study is to report our use of new bioabsorbable screws in cervical anterior fusion. These screws need not be removed because they are completely absorbed by resolution in vivo. We describe our method and the new bioabsorbable screws. Method(s): We used PLLA screws until September 2004 and uncalcined uHA-PLLA screws thereafter. They are completely absorbed by resolution to water and carbon dioxide upon in vivo hydrolysis. The uHA-PLLA screws are x-ray impenetrable, and their uHA content renders them osteoconductive. In cervical anterior fusion, the graft is inserted in the area of deletion resulting from decompression. The screws are inserted in the 4 corners of the vertebral body and graft. In long fusion, they are introduced in the 2 lateral wings of the bone graft on each vertebral body and in the 4 corners. Our method eliminates the need for plates or mesh. Result(s): We have used this method in 62 patients and encountered no complications. There were no screw or graft extrusions and no surgery-related infections. The patients were able to walk a few hours after the operation and wore a simple neck collar for a few days. Conclusion(s): This safe and easy method shortens the hospital stay and reduces the risk of graft extrusion and complications associated with the use of nonabsorbable devices. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

2480,"Adaptive and innovative Radiation Treatment FOR improving Cancer treatment outcomE (ARTFORCE); a randomized controlled phase II trial for individualized treatment of head and neck cancer. BACKGROUND: Failure of locoregional control is the main cause of recurrence in advanced head and neck cancer. This multi-center trial aims to improve outcome in two ways. Firstly, by redistribution of the radiation dose to the metabolically most FDG-PET avid part of the tumour. Hereby, a biologically more effective dose distribution might be achieved while simultaneously sparing normal tissues. Secondly, by improving patient selection. Both cisplatin and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) antibodies like Cetuximab in combination with Radiotherapy (RT) are effective in enhancing tumour response. However, it is unknown which patients will benefit from either agent in combination with irradiation. We will analyze the predictive value of biological markers and (89)Zr-Cetuximab uptake for treatment outcome of chemoradiation with Cetuximab or cisplatin to improve patient selection., METHODS: ARTFORCE is a randomized phase II trial for 268 patients with a factorial 2 by 2 design: cisplatin versus Cetuximab and standard RT versus redistributed RT. Cisplatin is dosed weekly 40 mg/m(2) for 6 weeks. Cetuximab is dosed 250 mg/m(2) weekly (loading dose 400 mg/m(2)) for 6 weeks. The standard RT regimen consists of elective RT up to 54.25 Gy with a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) to 70 Gy in 35 fractions in 6 weeks. Redistributed adaptive RT consists of elective RT up to 54.25 Gy with a SIB between 64-80 Gy in 35 fractions in 6 weeks with redistributed dose to the gross tumour volume (GTV) and clinical target volume (CTV), and adaptation of treatment for anatomical changes in the third week of treatment.Patients with locally advanced, biopsy confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx, oral cavity or hypopharynx are eligible.Primary endpoints are: locoregional recurrence free survival at 2 years, correlation of the median (89)Zr-cetuximab uptake and biological markers with treatment specific outcome, and toxicity. Secondary endpoints are quality of life, swallowing function preservation, progression free and overall survival., DISCUSSION: The objective of the ARTFORCE Head and Neck trial is to determine the predictive value of biological markers and (89)Zr-Cetuximab uptake, as it is unknown how to select patients for the appropriate concurrent agent. Also we will determine if adaptive RT and dose redistribution improve locoregional control without increasing toxicity.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01504815.",Excluded

Objectives: To find out the demography, clinical behaviour and outcome of ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN) in North-west Pakistan. Study Design: Case series. Place and Duration of Study: Department of Ophthalmology, Khyber Teaching Hospital, Peshawar, Pakistan, from March 2011 to December 2017. Methodology: All patients with OSSN consulting this department were registered. A special proforma was designed to document demography, clinical features, management, and follow-up of all cases. At the end of study, the data was analysed using SPSS version 25 and the result compiled. Result(s): Sixty-five eyes with OSSN were included in the study, in which 40 (61.5%) were males and 25 (38.5%) were females. Mean age of the patients was 61.68 +/-12.76 years. Twenty-six (40%) patients were farmers and exposed to ultraviolet light for prolong period. Fifty-nine (90.8%) presented with a painless, reddish mass on ocular surface. Average size of neoplasm at presentation was 18.60 +/- 11.30 mm in large dimension. Histopathologically, 23 (35.4%) were carcinoma in situ and 41(63%) invasive squamous cell carcinoma. During the period of follow-up 41 (63.1%) cured, 21 (32.2%) developed recurrence, and 3 (4.6%) patients passed away. Conclusion(s): OSSN is common in North-west Pakistan.

3527,"Hemi body irradiation: An economical way of palliation of pain in bone metastasis in advanced cancer. Background: The primary aim of this prospective non-randomized study was to evaluate the effect of hemi-body irradiation (HBI) on pain and quality of life in cancer patients with extensive bone metastases. The secondary aim was to evaluate side-effects and cost-effectiveness of the treatment. Material(s) and Method(s): Between March 2008 and December 2010, a total of 23 (male = 14, female = 9, median age = 60 years) diagnosed cases of metastatic cancer patients (prostate = 11, breast = 6, and lung = 6) received HBI, which was delivered as lower (n = 7) (dose = 8 Gy), upper (n = 8) (dose = 6 Gy), or sequential HBI (n = 8) with a Telecobalt unit (Theratron 780C). Among them, one lung cancer patient died at 2 months and one prostate cancer patient defaulted after the second follow-up. Thus, 21 patients (male = 13, female = 8, median age = 65 years) (prostatic cancer = 10, breast cancer = 6, and lung cancer = 5) were followed up for a minimum of 6 months. Evaluations were performed before and at 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 weeks after treatment. Pain evaluation was done by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Verbal Rating Scale (VRS), Percentage of Pain Relief (PRR), and Global Pain Score (GPS). Toxicity was assessed by CTC v-3 toxicity scores in the medical record. Assessment of oral morphine consumption was done before and after radiation using paired t-test, and correlation analysis was also done with decrease of morphine consumption and reduction of pain score using statistical analysis. Result(s): Response (control of pain) was partial (PR) in 67% and complete (CR) in 22% of patients. For most patients, the pain control lasted throughout the follow-up period (6 months). From 66.66% patients requiring 13 or more Morphine (10 mg) tablets per day prior to HBI, none of the patients required to consume 13 or more Morphine (10 mg) tablets per day following HBI, which was correlated with significant reduction in various pain scores (P < 0.05). One way ANOVA with Dunnett's Multiple Comparison Test (P < 0.05) was significant in VAS score changes, VRS score changes, PPR score changes, and GPS score changes. Along with the decrease in morphine tablets, the Linear Correlation of various scales for pain reduction like VAS, VRS, PPR, and GPS were significant. As such, the quality of life was better due to decreased pain and also, a decrease in the dose of analgesics. Grade 1 and 2 hematological toxicity and grade 1 diarrhea were observed as common side-effects. The average total cost of treatment including hospital stay, medicines, and radiation charges was around INR 400.00. Conclusion(s): This study shows that hemibody irradiation is not only an effective modality for palliation of severe bone pain in advanced cancer cases but also economical, involves short hospital stay, with acceptable side-effects, utilizes the simple Telecobalt machine, and is less cumbersome in comparison to other currently available pain palliation methods like oral morphine and radiopharmaceuticals. © 2014.

1059,"Clinicopathologic features as stronger prognostic factors than histology or grade in risk stratification of primary parotid malignancies. BACKGROUND: The aim of this study, using a retrospective chart review as the primary study design, was to determine the relative contribution of clinicopathologic risk factors versus low- and high-risk grade histologic groups to assist management of primary parotid cancers.
METHODS: In all, 168 primary parotid malignancies were treated surgically at a tertiary care center from 1982 to 2005. Of these, 115 patients with complete follow-up information were further analyzed. Pathologic updating and reclassification in 28% of cases enabled comparison of tumor histology or grade with current consensus criteria. Clinical outcomes of high- and low-risk histology and grade were compared with the influence of traditional clinicopathologic risk factors.
RESULTS: Of 115 cases, the male:female ratio was equal and the median age was 63 years (range, 15 to 89 years). Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (n = 28) was the most common histology. The median follow-up was 44 months (range, 0–278 months). Of low-risk histology patients who underwent neck dissection 40% had pN+ disease. The median time to recurrence was not reached for low-risk tumors, compared with 29 months for high-risk tumors (p = .0001). Interestingly, extracapsular spread (ECS) and margin status were independent prognostic factors and conferred significantly greater prognostic value than histologic grade risk group. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) at 5 years for the entire cohort were 51% and 57%, respectively. Risk group was a strong independent predictor of OS but not DFS.
CONCLUSIONS: Risk group defined by histology and grade was associated with DFS. ECS and margin status were independent predictors of DFS. Inclusion of ECS and margin status substantially improved the prediction of disease recurrence, supporting elective neck dissection and postoperative radiotherapy for high-grade tumors or low-risk histologies with positive margins or ECS.",Excluded

Introduction: To advise laryngeal carcinoma patients on the most appropriate form of treatment, a tool to predict survival and local control is needed. Material(s) and Method(s): We performed a population-based cohort study on 994 laryngeal carcinoma patients, treated with RT from 1977 until 2008. Two nomograms were developed and validated. Performance of the models is expressed as the Area Under the Curve (AUC). Result(s): Unfavorable prognostic factors for overall survival were low hemoglobin level, male sex, high T-status, nodal involvement, older age, lower EQD2T (total radiation dose corrected for fraction dose and overall treatment time), and non-glottic tumor. All factors except tumor location were prognostic for local control. The AUCs were 0.73 for overall survival and 0.67 for local control. External validation of the survival model yielded AUCs of 0.68, 0.74, 0.76 and 0.71 for the Leuven (n = 109), the VU Amsterdam (n = 178), the Manchester (n = 403) and the NKI cohort (n = 205), respectively, while the validation procedure for the local control model resulted in AUCs of 0.70, 0.71, 0.72 and 0.62. The resulting nomograms were made available on the website www.predictcancer.org. Conclusion(s): For patients with a laryngeal carcinoma treated with RT alone, we have developed visual, easy-to-use nomograms for the prediction of overall survival and primary local control.

1423,"Automated Planning to Improve Linac-Based Stereotactic Radiosurgery Plan Quality in Patients with 4 up to 10 Brain Metastases. Purpose/Objective(s): Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a promising treatment option for patients with multiple brain metastases (BM). We studied whether automated planning can improve LINAC-based SRS plan quality for multiple BM. Additionally, the use of one isocenter instead of separate isocentres for each metastasis was studied. Materials/Methods: For 12 patients with 4 up to 10 brain metastases, five non-coplanar LINAC-based SRS plans were created for 6MV photons: a manually planed dynamic conformal arc (DCA) plan with a separate isocenter for each metastasis, a dynamic IMRT plan with one isocenter, a VMAT plan with one isocenter, two DCA plans with one isocenter for 3 and 5 couch rotations. The last three plans were automatically generated. The maximum allowed gross tumor volume to planning target volume (PTV) margin was 1 mm. The prescription dose was 21 Gy or 18 Gy in a single fraction or 8.5 Gy in 3 fractions depending on the PTV volume. All plans were calculated with Monte Carlo, except the VMAT which was calculated with Collapsed Cone algorithm. The PTV coverage should be at least 98%. To assess SRS plan quality, the Paddick conformity index (CI), the Paddick gradient index (GI), the total V12Gy and V5Gy were studied and reported as MEAN+/-1SD. The number of monitor units (MU) and irradiation time were also compared. Result(s): The mean total CI was the highest for dynamic IMRT (see table). The lowest GI was for DCA plans with the separate-isocenter approach (3.7+/-0.6) and automatically generated DCA plans with one isocenter, whereas the highest GI was for VMAT plans (7.0+/-3.0). Moreover, the GI was 4.4+/-0.6 and 4.2+/-0.6 for automatically generated DCA plans with 3 couch and 5 couch rotations, respectively. The total V12Gy of automatically generated DCA plans with one isocenter (4.7+/-5.6% and 4.1+/-4.3% for 3 and 5 couch rotations, respectively) and dynamic IMRT plans (4.4+/-4.5%) were comparable with the manual DCA plans (3.6+/-3.7%). For the total V5Gy, quite the same behaviour as for the GI was found. The number of MU was the smallest for VMAT plans, followed by automatically generated DCA and IMRT plans and much lower than the manual DCA plans. The irradiation time was the smallest for automatically planned DCA plans followed by VMAT and IMRT plans. Conclusion(s): Automatically generated LINAC-based SRS plans for multiple BM in one isocenter can make the number of MU and irradiation time smaller with a comparable plan quality to manual DCA plans with the separate-isocenter approach. Based on all compared parameters, dynamic IMRT and DCA plans with one isocenter were the best and comparable with manual DCA plans with separate isocentres for each metastasis. Moreover, we can conclude that automated DCA plans with 5 couch and 3 couch rotations were comparable. [Figure presented]Copyright © 2019",Excluded

Purpose: To identify subgroups in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) with different susceptibilities to radio-chemotherapy by p53 protein and Ki-67 expression. Patients and Methods: Thirty-one patients with primary GBM underwent a combined radio-chemotherapy with topotecan. Percentage of cells expressing p53 protein and Ki-67 antigen was determined immunohistochemically. Additionally, the cell density within the tumour tissue was measured. Result(s): Median percentages of p53 and Ki-67 expressing cells were 4.3% (range = 0-28%) and 12.0% (range = 0-28%), respectively. Dividing the cases into two groups by high or low p53 protein 1-year disease-free survival rates were 13.3% and 23.6%. High or low Ki-67 expression showed one-year disease-free survival rates of 18.8% and 17.1%. Neither p53 nor Ki-67 expression showed a significant correlation with disease-free survival or overall survival. Median cell density was 252 cell/field (range = 42-595). 1-year disease-free survival rates were 14.5% and 21.7% in high and low cell density group, respectively.

595,"Low-dose MDCT and CT enterography of patients with crohn disease: Feasibility of adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the image quality and diagnostic performance of low-dose MDCT and CT enterography with adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) in the evaluation of Crohn disease. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Forty-eight patients (20 men, 28 women; mean age, 33.3 years; range, 17-83 years) with known or suspected Crohn disease who underwent low-dose MDCT and CT enterography with ASIR between December 2008 and December 2009 were included in the study. Twenty-seven patients had previously undergone standard-dose 64-MDCT and CT enterography with filtered back projection (FBP), and those images were used for comparison. The weight-based IV contrast protocol and scan parameters (120 kVp, 5-mm section thickness, 0.5-second rotation, pitch of 1.375, 64 x 0.625 mm detector configuration) were constant for the two techniques except for a higher noise index (x1.3) in the ASIR group. Two blinded readers reviewed 75 randomized MDCT-CT enterographic scans of 48 patients to assess image quality and diagnostic performance in the evaluation of Crohn disease, and the radiation dose for the studies was estimated. RESULTS. All 75 MDCT and CT enterographic scans had acceptable quality for diagnostic interpretation. Findings of Crohn disease were seen on 63 of 75 scans (84%). Low-dose scans in the ASIR group had optimal image quality and were rated comparable to or better than standard-dose FBP images (mean score, 4.2 vs 3.87; p = 0.007). The subjective image noise score (mean, 1.43 vs 1.58; p = 0.2) and objective image noise measurements were lower for ASIR images (p < 0.001). Low-dose studies with ASIR allowed average dose reduction of 34.5% compared with standard-dose scans with FBP (volume CT dose index for ASIR, 7.7 +/- 2.1 mGy; for FBP, 12 +/- 5.5 mGy; p < 0.01). CONCLUSION. Low-dose MDCT and CT enterographic studies reconstructed with ASIR were of appropriate quality for confident evaluation of the manifestations of Crohn disease while allowing approximately 34% dose reduction in comparison with FBP technique. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded
2744,"Imaging in Patients with Crohn's Disease: Trends in Abdominal CT/MRI Utilization and Radiation Exposure Considerations over a 10-Year Period. Purpose: To study the trends in utilization of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with Crohn's disease and to evaluate changes in CT radiation exposure over a 10-year period. Method(s): In this institutional review board-approved single-institution retrospective study, we included patients who underwent CT and MRIs for evaluation of Crohn's disease between 2006 and 2015. A total of 3196 CTs and 1924 MR scans were performed in 2156 patients (mean age: 34.8 +/- 17.71 yr; range: 3-91 yr) for initial diagnosis or follow-up of Crohn's disease between 2006 and 2015. Trends in CT/MR utilization was assessed by comparing the volume of CT/MRI studies performed each year. The changes in CT radiation exposure over the study period were estimated and compared. Result(s): The annual combined CT/MR utilization demonstrated a 1.9-fold rise over the last decade (2006: n = 358, 2015: n = 681, P < 0.001, r = 0.96). It was predominantly because of a substantial growth (9.2-fold increase) in the MR scan volume (2006: n = 37, 2015: n = 341, P < 0.001, r = 0.93), whereas CT volume did not show significant change (2006: n = 321, 2015: n = 340, P = 0.6). Over this same period, there was a 59.4% reduction in mean radiation exposure (2006: CT dose index vol 16.9 +/- 7.1 mGy, 2015: CT dose index vol 6.87 +/- 4.62 mGy, P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): A 9-fold growth in annual MR scan volume contributed to a nearly 2-fold rise in yearly cross-sectional imaging utilization in Crohn's patients between 2006 and 2015. Rising trend in imaging utilization paralleled a 60% reduction of CT radiation exposure.Copyright © 2017 Crohn's & Colitis Foundation.",Excluded
2465,"How effective are lead-rubber aprons in protecting radiosensitive organs from secondary ionizing radiation?. Introduction: The purpose of this experiment was to explore the direction of scattered secondary ionizing radiation to a patient. A left lateral radiographic examination of the elbow was deemed appropriate due to its close proximity to radiosensitive organs and record dose limiting opportunities upon wearing a lead-rubber apron. Method(s): An anthropomorphic phantom and lead-rubber apron (Pb 0.35 mm) was used with a 15 cc ionization chamber (model 10,100 AT TRIAD) to measure scattered radiation to radiosensitive organs. Dose readings were recorded before and after in order to quantify dose reduction. Pearson's correlation, linear regression, t-test and one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistics were used to affirm how likely dose limitation was attributed to chance (p < 0.05). Result(s): The lead-rubber apron offered dose reduction to most radiosensitive organs. Notably, ionizing radiation was significantly reduced to the left breast 0.0083 muGy (98%), right breast 0.0000 muGy (99.9%) and spleen 0.0262 muGy (99.9%). No empirical benefit was recorded for testes and ovaries. Interestingly, the thyroid recorded an increase in dose (0.1733 muGy; p = 0.01). This was later mitigated using a thyroid collar but identifies increased stochastic risks if lead-aprons are worn alone. Scattered radiation was also reduced to both eyes, which were not directly covered. Conclusion(s): Lead-rubber aprons are generally utilized to limit ionizing radiation, yet this article offers insight whereby increases to ionizing radiation to the thyroid are plausible when wearing a lead-rubber apron alone. Whilst these findings cannot be generalized to other radiographic examinations it provides insight into a potential increase risk of scatter to a radiosensitive organ. Implications for practice: This paper has implications because it identifies that lead-rubber has an impact on scattered ionizing radiation to radiosensitive organs for a lateral elbow examination. Further, it identifies the potential for ionizing radiation to be increased to the thyroid upon wearing a lead-rubber apron alone. Copyright © 2020 The College of Radiographers",Excluded
356,"Effects of linear-polarized near-infrared light irradiation on chronic pain. In order to study the efficacy of linear-polarized near-infrared light irradiation (LPNIR) on relieving chronic pain in conjunction with nerve block (NB) or local block (LB), a 3-week prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled study was conducted to evaluate the pre- and post-therapy pain intensity. Visual analogue scales (VASs) were measured in all patients before and 6 months after therapy visiting the pain clinic during the period of August 2007 to January 2008. A total of 52 patients with either shoulder periarthritis or myofascial pain syndrome or lateral epicondylitis were randomly assigned into two groups by drawing lots. Patients in Group I were treated with NB or LB plus LPNIR; Group II patients, for their part, were treated with the same procedures as in Group I, but not using LPNIR. In both groups, the pain intensity (VAS score) decreased significantly immediately after therapy as compared to therapy. There was a significant difference between the test and control groups immediately after therapy (P<0.05), while no effect 6 months later. No side effects were observed. It is concluded that LPNIR is an effective and safe modality to treat various chronic pains, which has synergic effects with NB or LB. Copyright 2012 Dong Huang et al.",Excluded
3037,"Cyberknife treatment for advanced or terminal stage hepatocellular carcinoma. AIM: To investigate the safety and efficacy of the Cyberknife treatment for patients with advanced or terminal stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)., METHODS: Patients with HCC with extrahepatic metastasis or vascular or bile duct invasion were enrolled between May 2011 and June 2015. The Cyberknife was used to treat each lesion. Treatment response scores were based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1. The trends of tumor markers, including alpha fetoprotein (AFP) and proteins induced by vitamin K absence II (PIVKA II) were assessed. Prognostic factors for tumor response and tumor markers were evaluated with Fisher's exact test and a logistic regression model. Survival was evaluated with the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model., RESULTS: Sixty-five patients with 95 lesions were enrolled. Based on the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer classification, all patients were either in the advanced or terminal stage of the disease. The target lesions were as follows: 52 were bone metastasis; 9, lung metastasis; 7, brain metastasis; 9, portal vein invasion; 4, hepatic vein invasion; 4, bile duct invasion; and 10 other lesion types. The response rate and disease control rate were 34% and 53%, respectively. None of the clinical factors correlated significantly with tumor response. Fiducial marker implantation was associated with better control of both AFP (HR = 0.152; 95%CI: 0.026-0.887; P = 0.036) and PIVKA II (HR = 0.035; 95%CI: 0.003-0.342; P = 0.004). The median survival time was 9 mo (95%CI: 5-15 mo). Terminal stage disease (HR = 9.809; 95%CI: 2.589-37.17, P < 0.001) and an AFP of more than 400 ng/mL (HR = 2.548; 95%CI: 1.070-6.068, P = 0.035) were associated with worse survival. A radiation dose higher than 30 Gy (HR = 0.274; 95%CI: 0.093-0.7541, P = 0.012) was associated with better survival. In the 52 cases of bone metastasis, 36 patients (69%) achieved pain relief. One patient had cerebral bleeding and another patient had an esophageal ulcer after treatment., CONCLUSION: The Cyberknife can be safely administered to patients with advanced or terminal stage HCC. High AFP levels were associated with worse survival, but a higher radiation dose improved the survival.",Excluded
3203,"The interdependence between clinical features of rheumatoid arthritis, thyroid gland function, and the anti-hormonal antibodies. Background: According to the common notions, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an immunopathological condition with complex autoimmune response, directed presumably to synovial tissue. Besides that, there are some organ involvements in RA, that can strongly affect the extent of the autoimmune reactions. One of this organs is thyroid gland, because changes of its function, either increase or decrease, modulate activity of immune cells and inflammation level on the whole. Production of antibodies, directed to T3 and T4, is a candidate mechanism of the thyroid involvement. Objective(s): The objectives of our study are detection of different thyroid conditions in RA including determination of lesion type and function assessment, as well as searching for interdependence between the clinical features of RA, type of thyroid involvement, and the level of the anti-hormonal antibodies. Method(s): The research was carried out in agreement with the principles of the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki (1997). Approval for the investigation was got from the Regional Medical Ethics Committee. We enrolled adult patients with RA, verified using ACR/EULAR criteria (2010). RA activity was determined by means of DAS28 index. Thyroid involvement was detected by clinical, ultrasound, and laboratory assessment, including TSH, free T3, free T4, and anti-TPO. Anti-T3 and anti-T4 antibodies were measured using ELISA and calculated in terms of optical density units (ODU). The positive cutoff values, 0.098 ODU for anti-T3 and 0.093 ODU for anti-T4, have been found using healthy controls (n=39). Results were expressed as means+/-standard errors, the differences were considered significant at p<0.05. Result(s): 75 patients with RA have been enrolled, including 61 (81.4%) women and 14 (18.6%) men, their age was from 25 to 78 years. Mean RA activity was 3.2+/-1.4 DAS28 points. Different visceral involvements were detected in 20 (26.7%) cases, and 5 (6.7%) of them had an overt clinical picture of thyroid lesions. The signs and symptoms for 4 of them were similar to Hashimoto's thyroiditis with hyperfunction, the remaining one was complied to the mixed toxic goiter. All these 5 patients had low TSH and quite high DAS28 score (4.8+/-1.9). However, the prevalence of subclinical thyroid disorders in RA was considerably higher. Virtually all the patients (n=73) have been revealed anti-T3 (0.128+/-0.047 ODU) and/or anti-T4 antibodies (0.152+/-0.050 ODU). There was no relationship between these antibodies and organ involvement, other than thyroid gland; RF titers also had no significant influence. We found some rather unexpected dependencies of these markers with X-ray RA stages, as well as with RA activity. There was a clear trend of elevation of mean anti-T4 concentration together with higher Steinbrocker stage (p=0.034, ANOVA), the inverse tendency have been observed for anti-T3 (p=0.047, ANOVA). Correlations of DAS28 score with anti-T4 (r=0.525, p=0.031) and anti-T3 (r=-0.391, p=0.040) were also opposite. There was another significant inverse correlation of DAS28 score and TSH concentration (r=-0.330, p=0.046). Conclusion(s): Our data suggest that though anti-T4 concentration is tended to be elevated, high RA activity can promote hyperthyroidism. This is probably due to either influence of these antibodies to T4 and T3 production, or immune disturbances caused by thyroid hyperfunction itself.",Excluded
406,"Low-dose ultraviolet exposure early in development can lead to widespread melanoma in the opossum model. Suckling young of opossums (Monodelphis domestica) were exposed to ultraviolet radiation (UVR, predominantly UVB: 290-320 nm) in part to determine an optimal protocol for induction and progression of melanoma in this species. In all, 620 litters were introduced to one of seven protocols. The lowest dose (175 J/m2) administered three times a week for almost three weeks led to the highest incidence of melanotic lesions with melanoma potential (8.1%) among young (5-month-old) adults. Among 101 much older animals (> 17 months at necropsy), 43% showed metastatic melanoma to the lymph nodes and almost one-third of these had progressed to widespread dissemination. Three of the latter animals, from a total of 13 obtained so far, were selected for detailed histological examination of disseminated disease. At necropsy, all three showed widespread metastases beyond the lymph nodes to the spleen, lungs, and other distant sites. Histological changes typical of malignant melanoma included junctional activity, mitotic figures, and nerve and vessel invasion. This novel finding leads us to conclude that UVR can act as a complete carcinogen for progression to widely disseminated disease and that exposure of sucklings can lead, in old age, to widespread metastatic melanoma in this model. The results are thus not inconsistent with the view that, in humans, early exposure to sunlight might act as an initiating factor in a later progression to malignant melanoma.",Excluded

Background: To investigate the capability of radiomic analysis using T2-weighted (T2W) and spectral attenuated inversion-recovery T2-weighted (SPAIR T2W) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for predicting the therapeutic response of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) to chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Method(s): Pretreatment T2W- and SPAIR T2W-MRI of 68 ESCC patients (37 responders, 31 nonresponders) were analyzed. A number of 138 radiomic features were extracted from each image sequence respectively. Kruskal-Wallis test were performed to evaluate the capability of each feature on treatment response classification. Sensitivity and specificity for each of the studied features were derived using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) models were constructed based on the training set (23 responders, 20 nonresponders) for the prediction of treatment response, and then the testing set (14 responders, 11 nonresponders) validated the reliability of the models. Comparison between the performances of the models was performed by using McNemar's test. Result(s): Radiomic analysis showed significance in the prediction of treatment response. The analyses showed that complete responses (CRs) versus stable diseases (SDs), partial responses (PRs) versus SDs, and responders (CRs and PRs) versus nonresponders (SDs) could be differentiated by 26, 17, and 33 features (T2W: 11/11/15, SPAIR T2W: 15/6/18), respectively. The prediction models (ANN and SVM) based on features extracted from SPAIR T2W sequence (SVM: 0.929, ANN: 0.883) showed higher accuracy than those derived from T2W (SVM: 0.893, ANN: 0.861). No statistical difference was observed in the performance of the two classifiers (P=0.999). Conclusion(s): Radiomic analysis based on pretreatment T2W- and SPAIR T2W-MRI can be served as imaging biomarkers to predict treatment response to CRT in ESCC patients.Copyright © Journal of Thoracic Disease.",Excluded
2807,"WORK PROCEDURES AND RADIATION EXPOSURE AMONG RADIOLOGIC TECHNOLOGISTS IN SOUTH KOREA. This study explored their work characteristics and safety compliance to identify primary factors influencing high occupational radiation exposure among radiologic technologists. A total of 12 387 radiologic technologists were surveyed from 2012 to 2013 in South Korea. Survey data for demographics and work-related characteristics were linked with the National Dose Registry. Multiple regression analysis was used and '% Excess Risk Explained' was calculated to illustrate the degree to which given risk factors explained the relationship of work procedures and radiation exposure. Characteristics of radiologic technologists exposed to higher radiation doses were male, aged <30, working at a general hospital or hospital, and frequently performing routine diagnostic X-ray, CT, portable X-ray and C-arm. Not being completely separated from patients and wearing lead apron was positively associated with higher radiation exposure. Type of facility and safety compliance were the main risk factors for high radiation exposure in performing diagnostic radiologic procedures.",Excluded
3025,"Characterization of sulfated polysaccharide from Laurencia obtusa and its apoptotic, gastroprotective and antioxidant activities. This study was designed to characterize the physico-chemical properties of the sulfated polysaccharide (SP) isolated from the red alga Laurencia obtusa and to evaluate its apoptotic, gastroprotective and antioxidant activities. The different macromolecular characteristics of SP were determined by size exclusion chromatography combined with multi-angle laser light-scattering detection (SEC-MALLS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR and 13C NMR). The native molecular weight of the extracted polysaccharide is high (>=336,900g.mol-1). It showed high amounts of sulfated groups (28.2%) and low levels of proteins. It was found to be a potent inducer of apoptosis on acute monocytic leukaemia THP-1cell lines with EC50 value of 53mug.mL-1. Furthermore, a significant gastroprotective effect (p<0.01) was also observed with a gastric ulcer inhibition of 63.44%, 78.42% and 82.15% at the doses 25, 50 and 100mg.kg-1, respectively. In addition, SP significantly increased glutathione levels (GSH) and decreased the concentration of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) in EtOH/HCl-damaged gastric mucosa in rats; it also exhibited an important antioxidant activity in vitro. Therefore, SP, derived from the red alga Laurencia obtusa, may have a potential therapeutic effect against acute myeloid leukaemia and a beneficial potential as gastroprotective and antioxidant natural product.

Background: We retrospectively examined outcomes of salvage high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy (HDR-ISBT) for locally recurrent rectal cancer (LRRC). Method(s): Nine patients with LRRC were treated with salvage HDR-ISBT. Their median age was 63 years. The median maximum diameter of LRRC was 40 mm (range 20-80 mm). Adenocarcinomas were histologically confirmed in all cases. The prescribed dose was 30 Gy/5 fractions/3 days to 50 Gy/10 fractions/6 days in the combined external-beam radiotherapy group (four patients) and 54 Gy/9 fractions/5 days to 60 Gy/10 fractions/6 days in the monotherapeutic group (five patients). Median follow-up time was 90 months (range 6-221 months). Result(s): Local control at final follow-up was achieved in five of nine patients. Of these five patients, one experienced a locally re-recurrent tumor in the vaginal wall 33 months after treatment and received re-HDR-ISBT as re-salvage treatment. The 8-year overall survival, local control, and progression-free survival rates were 56, 44, and 33 %, respectively. Based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ver. 4.03, the following Grade 3 adverse events were observed in three patients (>=3 months): Grade 3 skin ulceration in one patient who showed tumor invasion of the skin and whose V100 was 400 cc; Grade 3 vaginal perforation in one patient whose tumor had invaded the vaginal wall; and Grade 3 vagina-to-bladder fistula in one patient whose tumor received re-irradiation. Late adverse events above Grade 3 were not observed. Conclusion(s): Long-term follow-up results revealed that salvage HDR-ISBT is a promising treatment for LRRC with tolerable toxicity. © 2013 Japan Society of Clinical Oncology.",Excluded
2202,"Use of unstable chromosome aberrations for biological dosimetry after the first postirradiation mitosis. The loss of unstable chromosome aberrations after the first postirradiation mitosis makes their use difficult in radiation dosimetry. We describe here a method which, in a cell population observed at this stage, allows retrospective estimation of the frequencies of the unstable aberrations induced at the time of irradiation, and their use as a dosimeter. The laws controlling the behavior of unstable aberrations during mitosis were defined from a large-scale experiment on irradiated human lymphocytes. For cells undergoing the first, second, or third mitosis after irradiation, relationships were determined between the frequency, at irradiation time, of acentric fragments not arising from formation of dicentrics or rings, and the ratio of dicentrics and centric rings appearing without acentric fragments to the total number of dicentrics plus rings. On the basis of this ratio, the method described here provides an assessment of the postirradiation mitotic activity in a cell population. This assessment permitted estimation of the cell distribution and frequency of dicentrics plus centric rings, and of the frequency of acentric fragments at the time of irradiation. The use of this method for retrospective dosimetry after whole-body irradiation under various conditions of exposure is illustrated.",Excluded

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of free-tissue transfers for the reconstruction of radiation-induced complex injuries. The case files for patients who underwent reconstruction for radiation-induced injuries between May 1988 and November 1995 at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center were retrospectively reviewed. Thirty patients in whom 33 free flaps were done were included. Radiation-induced defects were located in the head and neck (n = 23), extremities (n = 4), chest wall (n = 2), and inguinal area (n = 1). The mean period between irradiation and injury was 78 months (range: 4 months to 38 years). Free-tissue transfer was successful in 97 percent (32/33 of patients). The overall complication rate was 40 percent (12/30). Flap donor sites included the fibula (n = 12), latissimus dorsi (n = 6), rectus abdominis (n = 6), iliac crest (n = 4), scapula (n = 3), and radial forearm (n = 2). Large-caliber vessels in the cervical, axillary, or inguinal regions were most commonly used to revascularize flaps. Vein grafts were used in five cases for the artery (2/5) or vein (3/5). Pedicle thrombosis occurred in three cases in recipient vessels located within the irradiated field. Two flaps were salvaged; one was lost, and the patient required a second free-flap reconstruction. The mean follow-up was 40 months (range: 2.5 to 83 months). The disease-free survival rate was 67 percent (20/30), local failures occurred in 10 percent (3/30) of patients, and 23.3 percent (7/30) of patients either died or were lost to follow-up. Healing of radiation-induced wounds may be achieved using free-tissue transfers, but complications are frequent.

1350,"Effect of constraint loading on the lower limb muscle forces in weightless treadmill exercise. Long exposure to the microgravity will lead to muscle atrophy and bone loss. Treadmill exercise could mitigate the musculoskeletal decline. But muscle atrophy remains inevitable. The constraint loading applied on astronauts could affect the muscle force and its atrophy severity. However, the quantitative correlation between constraint loading mode and muscle forces remains unclear. This study aimed to characterize the influence of constraint loading mode on the lower limb muscle forces in weightless treadmill exercise. The muscle forces in the full gait cycle were calculated with the inverse dynamic model of human musculoskeletal system. The calculated muscle forces at gravity were validated with the EMG data. Muscle forces increased at weightlessness compared with those at the earth's gravity. The increasing percentage from high to low is as follows: biceps femoris, gastrocnemius, soleus, vastus, and rectus femoris, which was in agreement with the muscle atrophy observed in astronauts. The constraint loading mode had an impact on the muscle forces in treadmill exercise and thus could be manipulated to enhance the effect of the muscle training in spaceflight. The findings could provide biomechanical basis for the optimization of treadmill constraint system and training program and improve the countermeasure efficiency in spaceflight.Copyright © 2018 Ning Guo et al.",Excluded

UNLABELLED: We compared the radiation-absorbed dose obtained from a two dimensional (2D) protocol, based on planar whole-body (WB) scans and fixed reference organ masses with dose estimates, using a 3D single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging protocol and patient-specific organ masses., METHODS: Six (6) patients with follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan, 5 2D planar WB, and 5 SPECT scans between days 0 and 6 after the injection of (111)In-ibritumomab tiuxetan. The activity values in the liver, spleen, and kidneys were calculated from the 2D WB scans, and also from the 3D SPECT images reconstructed, using quantitative image processing. Absorbed doses after the administration of (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan were calculated from the (111)In WB activity values combined with reference organ masses and also from the SPECT activity values and organ masses as estimated from the patient CT scan. To assess the quantitative accuracy of the WB and SPECT scans, an abdominal phantom was also studied., RESULTS: The differences between organ masses estimated from the patient CT and from the reference MIRD models were between -10% and +98%. Using the phantom, errors in organ and tumor activity estimates were between -86% and 10% for the WB protocol and between -43% and -6% for the SPECT protocol. Patient liver, spleen, and kidney activity values determined from SPECT were systematically less than those from the WB scans. Radiation-absorbed doses calculated with the 3D protocol were systematically lower than those calculated from the WB protocol (29%+/-26%, 73%+/-26%, and 33%+/-53% differences in the liver, spleen, and kidney, respectively), except in the kidneys of 2 patients and in the liver of 1 patient., CONCLUSIONS: Accounting for patient-specific organ mass and using SPECT activity quantification have both a great impact on estimated absorbed doses.",Excluded

Background: The objective was to evaluate the efficacy of a strong increase of the dose-intensity of concomitant radio-chemotherapy (RT-CT) in patients with far advanced non metastatic HNSCC. Method(s): Eligible patients had N3 disease (UICC 1997) and the primary tumor and/or the node(s) had to be strictly unresectable. Patients with palpable N2B-C were also eligible if massive nodal involvement was present. 109 patients were included, with 53 randomized to RT-CT and 56 to accelerated RT. In the RT-CT arm, the RT regimen consisted of 64 Gy in 5 weeks and the CT regimen consisted of synchronous CDDP 100 mg/m2 on days 2, 16, and 30 and 5FU 1000 mg/m2 on days1-5 and 29-33 of the RT course. After RT-CT, two adjuvant cycles of CDDP-5FU were delivered in good responders. A control arm was using a very accelerated RT, delivering 64 Gy in 3 weeks. Result(s): The most common tumor sites were oropharynx and hypopharynx. Most of the patients had T4 disease (70%) and 100% had a massive nodal involvement (mainly N3 with a mean nodal size >7 cm in both arms). A significant difference was observed in favor of the RT-CT arm (p = 0.005) in terms of cumulative incidence of local regional failure or distant metastases. However, the overall survival and event free survival rates were not significantly different between the two arms (p = 0.70 and 0.16, respectively). The lack of survival benefit in favor of the RT-CT was partly due to an excess of initial early treatment related death in the RT-CT arm. Conclusion(s): The very intense RT-CT schedule was more efficient on disease control, but was also more toxic than accelerated RT alone, pointing out that there was no clear improvement of the therapeutic index.

Objectives: To evaluate the image quality, coronary interpretability and radiation exposure of coronary CT angiography (CCTA) performed with a newest generation of cardiac-CT scanner in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Background(s): Despite the relevant improvement in the CT temporal resolution that characterizes the last scanner generation, the evaluation of coronary arteries by CCTA in patients with AF remains the more challenging application of cardiac- CT, particularly in patients with heart rate (HR) >75 bpm. Moreover, the radiation exposure associated with CT is still very high in this clinical subset. Material(s) and Method(s): 49 patients (30 males, mean age 71,5+/-7,3 years old) with chronic AF undergoing CCTA for suspected CAD by using a novel whole organ volumetric high definition CT scanner (16cm z-axis coverage with 256 detector rows and 512 slices, gantry rotation time 0.28 sec), were enrolled in the study. Prospective ECG-triggering was used in all patients, of whom 20 with double-shot technique and the remaining 29 with single-shot technique. In all patients, image quality score (by a 4-point Likert scale on a per-segment level) and coronary interpretability were evaluated and the effective dose (ED) was recorded. Result(s): The mean HR during the scan was 87.7+/-22 bpm. The overall image quality was very high (Likert=3.4+/-1.2, excellent image quality=451 segments, good=206 segments, adequate=90 segments, poor/non diagnostic=19 segments). The overall coronary interpretability was 97.5% (747/766 segments); in patients performed with double-shot technique, the interpretability was 96.4%, whereas we found an interpretability of 98.4% with single-shot technique. The overall mean ED was 4.6+/-2.1 mSv, while a significantly lower dose (3.6+/-1.5 mSv) was measured for single-shot technique vs. double-shot approach (5.9+/-2.1 mSv, p<0.01). Conclusion(s): The novel whole organ high definition CT scanner allows to evaluate coronary arteries with high image quality and coronary interpretability and low radiation exposure in patients with atrial fibrillation and high HR during the scan.",Excluded

Objective: We aimed to evaluate the time efficiency and diagnostic accuracy of automated myocardial computed tomography perfusion (CTP) image analysis software. Material(s) and Method(s): 320-row CTP was performed in 30 patients, and analyses were conducted independently by three different blinded readers by the use of two recent software releases (version 4.6 and novel version 4.71GR001, Toshiba, Tokyo, Japan). Analysis times were compared, and automated epi- and endocardial contour detection was subjectively rated in five categories (excellent, good, fair, poor and very poor). As semi-quantitative perfusion parameters, myocardial attenuation and transmural perfusion ratio (TPR) were calculated for each myocardial segment and agreement was tested by using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Conventional coronary angiography served as reference standard. Result(s): The analysis time was significantly reduced with the novel automated software version as compared with the former release (Reader 1: 43:08 +/- 11:39 min vs. 09:47 +/- 04:51 min, Reader 2: 42:07 +/- 06:44 min vs. 09:42 +/- 02:50 min and Reader 3: 21:38 +/- 3:44 min vs. 07:34 +/- 02:12 min; p < 0.001 for all).

3453,"Estimation of long-term salivary gland damage induced by radiotherapy. A classification is proposed for estimating salivary gland damage induced by radiotherapy to the head and neck. The volume of salivary glands irradiated was evaluated, and their relative proportions of whole saliva output were calculated. Stimulated salivary flow rate was measured in 61 patients treated with radiotherapy for head and neck malignancies. A highly significant negative correlation was found between the classification of salivary gland damage and stimulated salivary flow rate. The volume of the major salivary glands irradiated seems to be the most important factor affecting the postirradiation salivary flow after a curative dose of radiotherapy. If possible, partial sparing of the salivary glands may help to keep the patient's salivary secretion at an acceptable level and promote protection against dental caries. Most patients irradiated to the head and neck, however, need an effective prophylactic programme for the rest of their lives in order to preserve their teeth.",Excluded
2831,"Changes in the Selected Antioxidant Defense Parameters in the Blood of Patients after High Resolution Computed Tomography. Ionizing radiation generated during high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scanning may have an indirect effect on the mechanisms regulating the oxidative-antioxidant balance in the human body, which is one of the necessary factors ensuring the maintenance of its homeostasis. The aim of the study was to analyze the response of antioxidant systems through the determination of the antioxidant markers in the blood of patients exposed to oxidative stress resulting from the routine HRCT examination of the chest. Blood of 35 people aged 60.77 +/- 10.81 taken before and at four time points after the examination constituted the test material. The determination of the total antioxidant capacity expressed as ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) and ferric reducing antioxidant activity and ascorbic acid concentration (FRASC) were performed together with an examination of catalase activity and the concentration of the reduced glutathione. The organism's response to ionizing radiation was associated with a significant decrease in the antioxidant markers' levels at all time-points and showed a significant negative correlation depending on the radiation dose. Visible down-regulation of these markers is a response to increased oxidative stress. In light of the obtained results, the measurement of the selected markers of antioxidant defense may be a useful parameter of oxidative stress caused by ionizing radiation.",Excluded
3310,"Survival of mycoplasmas and ureaplasmas in water and at elevated temperatures. The survival of Mycoplasma hominis, Mycoplasma salivarium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Ureaplasma urealyticum in water and at elevated temperatures is a cause for concern. These microorganisms are pathogens. Some are implicated in serious genitourinary tract infections in men and women resulting in significant perinatal mortality and morbidity; others can cause respiratory tract infections. M. hominis has been implicated in wound infections, osteomyelitis, and infections of the heart valve. Because these microorganisms are pathogens, their survival in a closed water system has relevance to the well-being of crew members in an enclosed space. Consideration must be given to the elimination of these bacteria during recycling of water. Copyright 1990 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",Excluded
2229,"Re-evaluation of Ipsilateral Radiation for T1-T2N0-N2b Tonsil Carcinoma at the Princess Margaret Hospital in the Human Papillomavirus Era, 25 Years Later. PURPOSE: To report the outcome of ipsilateral radiation therapy (RT) in human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive (HPV+) patients and HPV-negative (HPV-) patients with T1-T2N0-N2b tonsillar cancer treated 25 years after our initial historical cohort., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with T1-T2N0-N2b tonsillar cancer who received ipsilateral RT or bilateral RT between 1999 and 2014 were reviewed. Overall survival (OS), local control (LC), regional control (RC), and grade 3 to 4 late toxicity (LT) were compared between ipsilateral RT and bilateral RT within HPV+ and HPV- patients, separately., RESULTS: HPV status was ascertained in 379/427 (88%) consecutive patients (ipsilateral RT: 62 HPV+, 34 HPV-; bilateral RT: 240 HPV+ 240, 41 HPV-). The proportion of ipsilateral RT by N category for HPV+ and HPV- patients were as follows: N0: 24/37 (65%) versus 28/48 (74%); N1: 21/49 (43%) versus 4/9 (44%); N2a: 10/39 (26%) versus 1/4 (25%); and N2b: 7/177 (4%) versus 1/24 (4%), respectively. Of the patients receiving ipsilateral RT, 94/96 (98%) were treated with RT alone. The median follow-up time was 5.03 years. The respective 5-year rates of OS, LC, RC, and LT were similar between ipsilateral RT and bilateral RT for the HPV+ patients (OS: 89% vs 87%, P=.55; LC: 97% vs 98%, P=.65; RC: 98% vs 97%, P=.27; LT: 17% vs 12%, P=.83) and HPV- patients (OS: 63% vs 48%, P=.27; LC: 90% vs 80%, P=.19; RC: 94% vs 83%, P=.14; LT: 15% vs 22%, P=.36). Of the 96 patients receiving ipsilateral RT, contralateral neck failure (CNF) occurred in 1/52 HPV+ patients and 1/34 HPV- patients. The 5-year CNF rates were 2% (95% CI: 1-9) (HPV+: 2% [0-14]; HPV-: 3% [0-21], P=.66). Five local failures (2 HPV+; 3 HPV-) and no distant failures were seen. The 5-year rates of LC, RC, and LT were 97% versus 90% (P=.24), 98% versus 94% (P=.25), and 18% versus 15% (P=.75) for the HPV+ and HPV- cohorts, respectively. Osteoradionecrosis occurred in 9 patients: 6/47 (13%) treated with conventional RT and 3/49 (6%) with intensity modulated RT (P=.32)., CONCLUSION: Ipsilateral radiation to selected patients with T1-T2N0-N2b tonsillar cancer results in equally excellent outcomes regardless of tumor HPV status.

1754,"Long-half-life 89Zr-labeled radiotracers can guide percutaneous biopsy within the PET/CT suite without reinjection of radiotracer. The rationale for this study was to evaluate the feasibility of withinsuite 89Zr-labeled radiotracer PET/CT-guided biopsy performed without reinjection. Method(s): From 2013 to 2016, 12 patients (7 men, 5 women; mean age, 61 y; range, 40-75 y) with metastatic prostate or breast carcinoma suspected either on imaging or because of biochemical progression underwent 14 percutaneous biopsies after diagnostic PET/CT using 89Zr-labeled radiotracers (mean dose, 180 MBq; range, 126-189 MBq) targeting prostatespecific membrane antigen (n 5 7) or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (n 5 5). Biopsy was performed within a PET/CT suite without radiotracer reinjection. Result(s): There were no complications in any biopsies, which were performed a mean of 6.2 d (range, 0-13 d) after injection of the radiotracer. The biopsy sites were bone (n 5 7), pleura (n 5 3), lymph nodes (n 5 2), and liver (n 5 2). On pathologic examination of the biopsy samples, all were positive for malignancy. The initial diagnostic imaging findings were concordant with the biopsy results. The additional radiation (mean dose-length product) due to the CT procedures was 1,581 mGy/cm (range, 379-2,686 mGy/cm).

OBJECTIVE: To compare the assessment of wrist synovitis severity, synovial volume and synovial perfusion parameters on a dedicated low-field (0.25-T) to that of a high-field (3-T) whole-body MR system in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA)., METHODS: Twenty-one patients (mean age 50.0 +/- 9.8 years) with active RA were recruited prospectively. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI examination of the most severely affected wrist was performed at both 0.25 T and 3 T. Three MRI-derived parameters, synovitis severity (RAMRIS grade), synovial volume (ml(3)) and synovial perfusion indices (maximum enhancement and enhancement slope), were compared., RESULTS: Comparing 0.25- and 3-T MRI, there was excellent agreement for semiquantitative assessment (r: 0.80, p < 0.00001) of synovitis (RAMRIS) as well as quantitative assessment (r: 0.94, p < 0.00001) of synovial volume. Good agreement for synovial Emax (r: 0.6, p = 0.002) and fair agreement (r: 0.5, p = 0.02) for synovial Eslope was found., CONCLUSIONS: Imaging of the RA wrist at 0.25 T yields excellent correlation with 3 T with regard to the synovitis activity score (RAMRIS) and synovial volume measurement. Fair to good correlation between low- (0.25-T) and high-field (3-T) MR systems was found for perfusion parameters, being better for Emax than for Eslope.",Excluded
2154,"Needle placement for piriformis injection using 3-D imaging. Piriformis syndrome is a pain syndrome originating in the buttock and is attributed to 6% - 8% of patients referred for the treatment of back and leg pain. The treatment for piriformis syndrome using fluoroscopy, computed tomography (CT), electromyography (EMG), and ultrasound (US) has become standard practice. The treatment of Piriformis Syndrome has evolved to include fluoroscopy and EMG with CT guidance. We present a case study of 5 successful piriformis injections using 3-D computer-assisted electromagnet needle tracking coupled with ultrasound. A 6-degree of freedom electromagnetic position tracker was attached to the ultrasound probe that allowed the system to detect the position and orientation of the probe in the magnetic field. The tracked ultrasound probe was used to find the posterior superior iliac spine. Subsequently, 3 points were captured to register the ultrasound image with the CT or magnetic resonance image scan. Moreover, after the registration was obtained, the navigation system visualized the tracked needle relative to the CT scan in real-time using 2 orthogonal multi-planar reconstructions centered at the tracked needle tip. Conversely, a recent study revealed that fluoroscopically guided injections had 30% accuracy compared to ultrasound guided injections, which tripled the accuracy percentage. This novel technique exhibited an accurate needle guidance injection precision of 98% while advancing to the piriformis muscle and avoiding the sciatic nerve. The mean (+/- SD) procedure time was 19.08 (+/- 4.9) minutes. This technique allows for electromagnetic instrument tip tracking with realtime 3-D guidance to the selected target. As with any new technique, a learning curve is expected; however, this technique could offer an alternative, minimizing radiation exposure.",Excluded
2520,"Multiple cervical lymph node involvement and extra-capsular extension predict for contralateral nodal recurrence after ipsilateral radiotherapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the tonsil. Background: Ipsilateral radiotherapy is an established technique for treating well-lateralised tonsillar tumours. Concerns exist regarding the risk of contralateral nodal failure, particularly in patients with ipsilateral nodal involvement at presentation. In this study, we retrospectively reviewed the clinical outcomes of patients treated with ipsilateral radiotherapy aiming to identify factors that predispose to a higher risk of contralateral nodal recurrence. Method(s): Retrospective case note review of all patients with tonsillar cancer who were treated using ipsilateral radiotherapy between September 1995 and September 2011 was performed. Demographics, T and N stage, involvement of soft palate and/or tongue base, presence of extra-capsular spread (ECS) and treatment details were recorded. Kaplan-Meier curves for treatment outcomes were generated. Result(s): A total of 136 patients were identified. Median follow-up was 4.2 years. Twelve (9%) patients had loco-regional recurrence. Eight patients (6%) had contralateral recurrence. N2b disease, ECS and number of pack-years of smoking were associated with contralateral nodal recurrence. Five-year overall survival was 89%, loco-regional disease-free survival 90%, disease-free survival 86% and distal recurrence-free survival 96%. Conclusion(s): N2b disease, ECS and a greater than 10 pack-year smoking history are risk factors for contralateral nodal recurrence in well-lateralised tonsillar cancers. Prophylactic irradiation of the contralateral neck should be recommended in this group of patients.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
766,"Outcomes of stereotactic radiosurgery for foramen magnum meningiomas: an international multicenter study. OBJECTIVE Meningiomas are the most common benign extramedullary lesions of the foramen magnum; however, their optimal management remains undefined. Given their location, foramen magnum meningiomas (FMMs) can cause significant morbidity, and complete microsurgical removal can be challenging. Anterior and anterolateral FMMs carry greater risks with surgery, but they comprise the majority of these lesions. As an alternative to resection, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has been used to treat FMMs in small case series. To more clearly define the outcomes of SRS and to delineate a rational management paradigm for these lesions, the authors analyzed the safety and efficacy of SRS for FMM in an international multicenter trial. METHODS Seven medical centers participating in the International Gamma Knife Research Foundation (IGKRF) provided data for this retrospective cohort study. Patients who were treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery and whose clinical and radiological follow-up was longer than 6 months were eligible for study inclusion. Data from pre- and post-SRS radiological and clinical evaluations were analyzed. Stereotactic radiosurgery treatment variables were recorded. RESULTS Fifty-seven patients (39 females and 18 males, with a median age of 64 years) met the study inclusion criteria. Thirty-two percent had undergone prior microsurgical resection. Patients most frequently presented with cranial neuropathy (39%), headache (35%), numbness (32%), and ataxia (30%). Median pre-SRS tumor volume was 2.9 cm3. Median SRS margin dose was 12.5 Gy (range 10-16 Gy). At the last follow-up after SRS, 49% of tumors were stable, 44% had regressed, and 7% had progressed. Progression-free survival rates at 5 and 10 years were each 92%. A greater margin dose was associated with a significantly increased likelihood of tumor regression, with 53% of tumors treated with > 12 Gy regressing. Fifty-two percent of symptomatic patients noted some clinical improvement. Adverse radiation effects were limited to hearing loss and numbness in 1 patient (2%). CONCLUSIONS Stereotactic radiosurgery for FMM frequently results in tumor control or tumor regression, as well as symptom improvement. Margin doses > 12 Gy were associated with increased rates of tumor regression. Stereotactic radiosurgery was generally safe and well tolerated. Given its risk-benefit profile, SRS may be particularly useful in the management of small- to moderate-volume anterior and anterolateral FMMs.",Excluded
3414,"Computer-assisted surgery for dynamic hip screw, using Surgix, a novel intraoperative guiding system. BACKGROUND: We present Surgix, a new computer-assisted surgery system (CASS). This system uses image analysis technology in order to measure three-dimensional (3D) distances, visualize implant templates and view the guided trajectory on standard fluoroscopy. Our purpose was to compare surgery results and technique with and without the Surgix CASS., METHODS: The study included 61 dynamic hip screw (DHS) procedures. The Surgix system was used in 41 procedures. We compared the number of guide wire insertion trials and the time needed for each trial, the number of X-ray pulses, tip-apex index, nine-quadrant position and shaft-neck angle., RESULTS: The procedures were carried out by experienced users (> or = five operations, using the system) and had a first-trial guide wire insertion success rate of 77.8%, compared to a rate of 10% for the control group (p = 0.001) and fewer insertion trials (1.33 vs. 3.05, respectively; p = 0.001). The mean number of fluoroscopy pulses was 41.5% lower for the experienced group than for the control (17.6 vs. 30.1; p = 0.009).

2564,"Microgeographic prediction of polygyny in the lark bunting. Field experiments on breeding populations of lark buntings (Calamospiza melanocorys) in South Dakota support the hypothesis that polygyny is promoted by a high variance in quality among male territories. Among these birds protection of the nest site from solar radiation is the major indicator of quality: nestling survival was significantly correlated with nest-site cover, and experimental increase of shading resulted in higher reproductive success. Males with superior territories attracted two mates, whereas those with poor territories failed to attract any. Secondary females had fledging success at least equal to that of contemporaneous monogamous pairs. On the sole basis of a shading score for each territory, the mating status of males (polygynous, monogamous, or bachelor) was predicted accurately in new areas of Colorado and North Dakota before females arrived.",Excluded

The efficacy of multimodality image fusion road-mapping technique for endovascular therapy has been reported recently. Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of endovascular therapy (EVT) with three-dimensional (3D) road mapping by fusing computed tomography (CT) and angiographical volumetric data for aorto-iliac chronic total occlusion (CTO). We retrospectively analyzed 36 patients with aorto-iliac CTO from June 2017 to November 2019 and classified them into two groups: EVT using a CT fused 3D roadmap (CTf3D-RM; 3D group, n = 14) and standard EVT (standard group, n = 22). Primary endpoint was wiring time and secondary endpoints were procedural success rate, number of guidewires, procedure time, radiation dose, contrast medium dose, and complications. Wiring time was significantly shorter in the 3D group than the standard group (3D, 15.6 +/- 10.23 min vs. standard, 44.6 +/- 35.3 min; p = 0.0052). Both groups had high procedural success rates (3D, 100% vs. standard, 100%) and low complication rates (3D, 0.0% vs. standard, 9.1%; p = 0.51). There were significantly fewer guidewires in the 3D group than the standard group (3D, 2.78 +/- 1.31 vs. standard, 4.36 +/- 2.01; p = 0.0138). The 3D group trended towards shorter procedural time (3D, 78.8 +/- 32.5 min vs. standard, 107.5 +/- 52.5 min; p = 0.076), lower radiation dose (3D, 28.6 +/- 18.9 Gycm2 vs. standard, 48.9 +/- 49.2 Gycm2; p = 0.15), and lower contrast medium dose (3D, 102.2 +/- 30.6 vs. standard, 127.5 +/- 51.3; p = 0.11) than the standard group. Therefore, we concluded that EVT with CTf3D-RM is effective for aorto-iliac CTO.

This work deals with the assessment of personal exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields and the study of temporal and spatial daily variations in a group of 24 adults from the West Bank, Palestine. Exposure was measured using a personal exposure meter EME SPY 140. Mean values of exposure levels from different radiofrequency sources were calculated using both naive and robust regression on order statistics approaches. The total daily exposure from all radiofrequency electromagnetic field sources varied widely among participants depending on their location, the mobile network they use, their activities, and their mode of transportation, ranging from about 0.2 V m to 0.9 V m. The average total daily exposure of all participants was about 0.48 V m.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Previous studies have demonstrated that sun-induced alteration of epidermal permeability barrier function varies with gender and age. In the present study, we assess the stratum corneum (SC) hydration in sun-exposed males and females., METHODS: A total of 168 subjects (84 males and 84 females) aged 19-75 years were enrolled. A multifunctional skin physiology monitor was used to measure SC hydration., RESULTS: In comparison with non-sun exposure, sun exposure does not cause a significant change in SC hydration in either young males or young females, whereas in aged females, a significant reduction of SC hydration is seen on the forehead and the dorsal hand of sun-exposed subjects. SC hydration on the canthus of both aged males and aged females is significantly lower than that of young subjects. Additionally, SC hydration on the dorsal hand of aged females is also significantly lower as compared with young females. Sun-induced reduction of SC hydration is more evident on the dorsal hand of aged females than that of males (P<0.001). Moreover, the SC rehydration capacity is significantly lower in sun-exposed aged females than in age-matched males., CONCLUSION: These results demonstrated that sun-induced changes of the SC hydration property vary with age and gender.

2544,"Collagen organisation in the interspinous ligament and its relationship to tissue function. X-ray diffraction and determination of optical anisotropy show that collagen fibres in pig and human lumbar interspinous ligaments tend to be orientated parallel to the spinous processes. There is a distribution of fibre orientations about this preferred direction. Flexion of the spine does not change the direction of preferred orientation but the angular spread of fibres increases. This pattern of collagen fibre orientations is consistent with the interspinous ligaments being able to transmit tension from the thoracolumbar fascia to the vertebrae. Since the collagen fibres tend to be aligned antero-posteriorly, they provide a high efficiency of reinforcement in this direction. The lack of fibres orientated perpendicular to the spinous processes will lead to low strength in the cranio-caudal direction so that the ligament can provide little resistance to flexion of the spine.",Excluded

3135,"Short-term Automated Quantification of Radiologic Changes in the Characterization of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Versus Nonspecific Interstitial Pneumonia and Prediction of Long-term Survival. Purpose: Fibrotic interstitial lung diseases presenting with nonspecific and overlapping radiologic findings may be difficult to diagnose without surgical biopsy. We hypothesized that baseline quantifiable radiologic features and their short-term interval change may be predictive of underlying histologic diagnosis as well as long-term survival in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) presenting without honeycombing versus nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP). Material(s) and Method(s): Forty biopsy-confirmed IPF and 20 biopsy-confirmed NSIP patients with available high-resolution chest computed tomography 4 to 24 months apart were studied. CALIPER software was used for the automated characterization and quantification of radiologic findings. Result(s): IPF subjects were older (66 vs. 48; P<0.0001) with lower diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide and higher volumes of baseline reticulation (193 vs. 83 mL; P<0.0001). Over the interval period, compared with NSIP, IPF patients experienced greater functional decline (forced vital capacity, -6.3% vs. -1.7%; P=0.02) and radiologic progression, as noted by greater increase in reticulation volume (24 vs. 1.74 mL; P=0.048), and decrease in normal (-220 vs. -37.7 mL; P=0.045) and total lung volumes (-198 vs. 58.1 mL; P=0.03). Older age, male gender, higher reticulation volumes at baseline, and greater interval decrease in normal lung volumes were predictive of IPF. Both baseline and short-term changes in quantitative radiologic findings were predictive of mortality. Conclusion(s): Baseline quantitative radiologic findings and assessment of short-term disease progression may help characterize underlying IPF versus NSIP in those with difficult to differentiate clinicoradiologic presentations. Our study supports the possible utility of assessing serial quantifiable high-resolution chest computed tomographic findings for disease differentiation in these 2 entities.Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

2625,"Alternating radiotherapy and chemotherapy for inoperable stage III non- small-cell lung cancer: Long-term results of two phase II GOTHA trials. Purpose/Objective: To report on two consecutive Phase II cooperative trials in which we evaluated the combination of alternating hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy and cisplatin-based chemotherapy in inoperable Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients and Methods: Between February 1986 and September 1989, 65 patients were entered in the first trial (GOTHA I), and between December 1989 and October 1992 67 were enrolled in the second trial (GOTHA II). In both protocols, radiotherapy (RT) was administered twice daily, at 6 h intervals, 5 days a week, to a total dose of 63 Gy in 42 fractions of 1.5 Gy. RT was given during weeks 2, 3, 6, and 7, over an elapsed time of 6 weeks. In GOTHA I, three cycles of cisplatin, 60 mg/m2 day 1, mitomycin, 8 mg/m2 day 1, and vindesin 3 mg/m2 day 1 and the first day of the following week, were given during weeks 1, 5, and 9; in GOTHA II, cisplatin 70 mg/m2 day 1 and vinblastin 5 mg/m2 day 1 and the first day of the following week were given during weeks 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, and 21. Result(s): With a minimum follow-up of 3 years, the 1-, 2-, 5-, and 8-year overall survival probability was 56% (95% CI 47-64%), 27% (20-35%), 12% (7- 18%) and 9% (3-16%), respectively, with a median survival of 13.6 months (11.4-16.8). Median follow-up for survivors was 6 years (3.3-9.9). There were no survival differences between Stages IIIA and IIIB (p = 0.84), performance status 0, 1, 2 (p = 0.87), sex (p = 0.45) or between the two treatment protocols. At this time, 14 patients are alive, and 118 have died: 102 from NSCLC, 4 from acute toxicity, 2 from secondary surgery, 4 from other medical causes, and 6 from unknown causes. Correlation between response and long- term survival was poor, since of the 24 patients who survived 3 years or more, only 6 (25%) were classified as having a complete response; the remainder having either a partial response (11, 46%), no change (6, 25%), or 'progressive disease' (1,4%). First site of relapse was local in 31% of these cases, distant in 43%, local and distant in 15%, and unknown in 11%. Main grade 3-4 acute toxicities were nausea-vomiting (17%), mucositis (15%), leukopenia (41%), and thrombocytopenia (11%). Eight patients presented with grade 3-4 symptomatic lung radiation pneumopathy. Conclusion(s): Based on this experience with 132 patients, this combination of alternated RT and chemotherapy (CT) for inoperable Stage III NSCLC is feasible with acceptable toxicity, and long-term results suggest a gain in survival when compared to those obtained with conventional RT alone. However, the still high local and distant failure rates indicate that both local and systemic therapies need to be improved.",Excluded

The smaller volume divided by the larger volume was below 50% in three of 17 patients for the sigmoid, in six of 17 patients for the 4 distal cm of the sigmoid, in two of 17 patients for the rectum, in two of 17 patients for the anal sphincter and in seven of 17 patients for the urinary bladder. For the urinary bladder the largest deviation was found cranially, 4.0 cm (SD 2.0 cm), the caudal part being relatively fixed. For the rectum the largest deviation was found in the anterior wall, 1.8 cm (SD 0.7 cm), with maximum documented variation in cranial direction of 3.2 cm (SD 1.8 cm)., CONCLUSIONS: The sigmoid varies considerably in documented position with the largest deviation anteriorly, the urinary bladder change in volume with the extension mainly located cranially and for the rectum the anterior wall is the most mobile with the distension becoming more pronounced cranially. In modeling dose-volume effects one may consider our results.",Excluded
3362,"In vivo UHMWPE biodegradation of retrieved prosthesis. Sixty-two ultra high molecular weight polyethylene prosthetic components (PEs) (31 tibial plateaux and 31 cups), sterilised by gamma rays or ethylene oxide (EtO), were retrieved after 1-12 years depending on different medical reasons and were studied by FTIR spectroscopy with derivatisation of oxidised species. Esters, acids and hydroperoxides were found under the surface of the EtO sterilised PEs up to 2 mm depth. The behaviour of gamma ray sterilised PEs is more complex due to the oxidation following the sterilisation process. Ester and acid formation might arise from the diffusion of components of synovial liquid or from the oxidation process, whereas hydroperoxide formation is thought to be due to the oxidation. Abrasion and delamination process is discussed considering the topological distribution of degradation products.",Excluded
1222,"Diagnostic medical imaging radiation exposure and risk of development of solid and hematologic malignancy. Limiting patients' exposure to ionizing radiation during diagnostic imaging is of concern to patients and clinicians. Large single-dose exposures and cumulative exposures to ionizing radiation have been associated with solid tumors and hematologic malignancy. Although these associations have been a driving force in minimizing patients' exposure, significant risks are found when diagnoses are missed and subsequent treatment is withheld. Therefore, based on epidemiologic data obtained after nuclear and occupational exposures, dose exposure limits have been estimated. A recent collaborative effort between the US Food and Drug Administration and the American College of Radiology has provided information and tools that patients and imaging professionals can use to avoid unnecessary ionizing radiation scans and ensure use of the lowest feasible radiation dose necessary for studies. Further collaboration, research, and development should focus on producing technological advances that minimize individual study exposures and duplicate studies. This article outlines the research used to govern safe radiation doses, defines recent initiatives in decreasing radiation exposure, and provides orthopedic surgeons with techniques that may help decrease radiation exposure in their daily practice.

2571,"Improving adjuvant therapy for rectal cancer by combining protracted-infusion fluorouracil with radiation therapy after curative surgery. BACKGROUND: The combination of radiation therapy and chemotherapy with fluorouracil plus semustine after surgery has been established as an effective approach to decreasing the risk of tumor relapse and improving survival in patients with rectal cancer who are at high risk for relapse or death. We sought to determine whether the efficacy of chemotherapy could be improved by administering fluorouracil by protracted infusion throughout the duration of radiation therapy and whether the omission of semustine would reduce the toxicity and delayed complications of chemotherapy without decreasing its antitumor efficacy., METHODS: Six hundred sixty patients with TNM stage II or III rectal cancer received intermittent bolus injections or protracted venous infusions of fluorouracil during postoperative radiation to the pelvis. They also received systemic chemotherapy with semustine plus fluorouracil or with fluorouracil alone in a higher dose, administered before and after the pelvic irradiation., RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 46 months among surviving patients, patients who received a protracted infusion of fluorouracil had a significantly increased time to relapse (P = 0.01) and improved survival (P = 0.005). There was no evidence of a beneficial effect in the patients who received semustine plus fluorouracil., CONCLUSIONS: A protracted infusion of fluorouracil during pelvic irradiation improved the effect of combined-treatment postoperative adjuvant therapy in patients with high-risk rectal cancer. Semustine plus fluorouracil was not more effective than a higher dose of systemic fluorouracil given alone.",Excluded
2454,"Image quality of iterative reconstruction in cranial CT imaging: comparison of model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) and adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASiR). Objectives: The purpose of this study was to compare cranial CT (CCT) image quality (IQ) of the MBIR algorithm with standard iterative reconstruction (ASiR)., Methods: In this institutional review board (IRB)-approved study, raw data sets of 100 unenhanced CCT examinations (120 kV, 50-260 mAs, 20 mm collimation, 0.984 pitch) were reconstructed with both ASiR and MBIR. Signal-to-noise (SNR) and contrast-to-noise (CNR) were calculated from attenuation values measured in caudate nucleus, frontal white matter, anterior ventricle horn, fourth ventricle, and pons. Two radiologists, who were blinded to the reconstruction algorithms, evaluated anonymized multiplanar reformations of 2.5 mm with respect to depiction of different parenchymal structures and impact of artefacts on IQ with a five-point scale (0: unacceptable, 1: less than average, 2: average, 3: above average, 4: excellent)., Results: MBIR decreased artefacts more effectively than ASiR (p < 0.01). The median depiction score for MBIR was 3, whereas the median value for ASiR was 2 (p < 0.01). SNR and CNR were significantly higher in MBIR than ASiR (p < 0.01)., Conclusions: MBIR showed significant improvement of IQ parameters compared to ASiR. As CCT is an examination that is frequently required, the use of MBIR may allow for substantial reduction of radiation exposure caused by medical diagnostics.Copyright © 2014, European Society of Radiology.",Excluded
2678,"The association between cumulative radiation dose and the incidence of severe oral mucositis in head and neck cancers during radiotherapy. Background: Quality of life can be influenced by oral mucositis (OM), and it is necessary to implement OM management strategies before the initiation of radiotherapy (RT) in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC). Aim(s): To examine the association between the cumulative radiation dose and the incidence of severe OM in HNC patients receiving RT. Methods and Results: A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted in a Showa University Fujigaoka Hospital, in Japan. We retrospectively analyzed 94 patients with HNC who developed OM during RT. We defined OM as a more than grade 2 OM. The cumulative incidence of OM curves of the two categories was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. We estimated the hazard ratio (HR) for OM after the adjustment of factors for covariates using Cox's regression analysis. Patients with smoking history had a significantly later development of OM than those with no smoking history (20 Gy-incidence OM 68.7% vs 39.7%, P =.003). In contrast, patients undergoing concurrent chemotherapy had an earlier development of OM than those undergoing RT alone (20 Gy-incidence OM 24.2% vs 55.7%, P <.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that no smoking history and concurrent chemotherapy were independent predictive factors, with a HR of 0.526 (P =.025) and 2.690 (P <.001), respectively. Conclusion(s): We demonstrated that no smoking history and concurrent chemotherapy may be predictive of OM in HNC patients.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

2910,"Outcomes and toxicities of definitive radiotherapy and reirradiation using 3-dimensional conformal or intensity-modulated (pencil beam) proton therapy for patients with nasal cavity and paranasal sinus malignancies. BACKGROUND: Proton therapy (PT) improves outcomes in patients with nasal cavity (NC) and paranasal sinus (PNS) cancers. Herein, the authors have reported to their knowledge the largest series to date using intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) in the treatment of these patients., METHODS: Between 2013 and 2018, a total of 86 consecutive patients (68 of whom were radiation-naive and 18 of whom were reirradiated) received PT to median doses of 70 grays and 67 grays relative biological effectiveness, respectively. Approximately 53% received IMPT., RESULTS: The median follow-up was 23.4 months (range, 1.7-69.3 months) for all patients and 28.1 months (range, 2.3-69.3 months) for surviving patients. The 2-year local control (LC), distant control, disease-free survival, and overall survival rates were 83%, 84%, 74%, and 81%, respectively, for radiation-naive patients and 77%, 80%, 54%, and 66%, respectively for reirradiated patients. Among radiation-naive patients, when compared with 3-dimensional conformal proton technique, IMPT significantly improved LC (91% vs 72%; P < .01) and independently predicted LC (hazard ratio, 0.14; P = .01). Sixteen radiation-naive patients (24%) experienced acute grade 3 toxicities; 4 (6%) experienced late grade 3 toxicities (osteoradionecrosis, vision loss, soft-tissue necrosis, and soft tissue fibrosis) (grading was performed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [version 5.0]). Slightly inferior LC was noted for patients undergoing reirradiation with higher complications: 11% experienced late grade 3 toxicities (facial pain and brain necrosis). Patients treated with reirradiation had more grade 1 to 2 radionecrosis than radiation-naive patients (brain: 33% vs 7% and osteoradionecrosis: 17% vs 3%)., CONCLUSIONS: PT achieved remarkable LC for patients with nasal cavity and paranasal sinus cancers with lower grade 3 toxicities relative to historical reports. IMPT has the potential to improve the therapeutic ratio in these malignancies and is worthy of further investigation. Copyright © 2020 American Cancer Society.",Excluded
2447,"[Value of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group guidelines based on MR imaging in diagnosing lymph node metastasis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma]. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) and other major cooperative groups endorse the consensus guidelines for the delineation of the node levels in stage N0 cases. But it is unclear if these guidelines can be extrapolated to N+ cases. This study was to explore the value of RTOG guidelines in delineating cervical target volumes for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients with lymph node metastasis., METHODS: Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the nasopharynx, including plain and contrast enhanced sequences, was performed on 254 naive NPC patients. The lymph nodes were divided into six cervical levels plus retropharyngeal nodes (RN) according to RTOG guidelines proposed in 2003., RESULTS: Anatomic boundaries of node levels were observed clearly on MRI. Of the 254 patients, 107 (42.1%) had obvious lymph node necrosis, 78 (30.7%) had extracapsular nodal spread, four (1.6%) had skipped metastasis. The levels of lymph node metastases in 51 (20.1%) patients were beyond RTOG guidelines, 42 of which were above cranial level IIb, six were behind the anterior edge of the trapezius muscle, and 23 were below the caudal of level IV; 20 patients had two regions of lymph node metastases beyond RTOG guidelines. No patient only with lymph node metastasis beyond RTOG guidelines was found., CONCLUSIONS: MRI is feasible to diagnose cervical node metastasis with RTOG guidelines. The boundaries of node levels should be enlarged rationally when delineating target volumes for the N+ NPC patients according to RTOG guidelines.",Excluded

1680,"Analysis of DNA repair gene polymorphisms in glioblastoma. BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults. Despite several factors such as ionizing radiation exposure or rare genetic syndromes have been associated with the development of glioblastoma, no underlying cause has been identified for the majority of cases. We thus aimed to investigate the role of DNA repair polymorphisms in modulating glioblastoma risk., METHODS: Genotypic and allelic frequencies of seven common polymorphisms in DNA repair genes involved in nucleotide excision repair (ERCC1 rs11615, ERCC2 rs13181, ERCC6 rs4253079), base excision repair (APEX1 rs1130409, XRCC1 rs25487), double-strand break repair (XRCC3 rs861539) and mismatch repair (MLH1 rs1800734) pathways were analyzed in 115 glioblastoma patients and 200 healthy controls. Haplotype analysis was also performed for ERCC1 rs11615 and ERCC2 rs13181 polymorphisms, located on the same chromosomal region (19q13.32)., RESULTS: Our results indicated that carriers of the ERCC2 Gln/Gln genotype were associated with a lower glioblastoma risk (OR=0.32, 95% CI 0.12-0.89; P=0.028), whereas carriers of the MLH1 AA genotype were associated with an increased risk of glioblastoma (OR=3.14, 95% CI 1.09-9.06; P=0.034). Furthermore, the haplotype containing the C allele of ERCC2 rs13181 polymorphism and the T allele of ERCC1 rs11615 polymorphism was significantly associated with a protective effect of developing glioblastoma (OR=0.34, 95% CI 0.16-0.71; P=0.004)., CONCLUSIONS: These results pointed out that MLH1 rs1800734 and ERCC2 rs13181 polymorphisms might constitute glioblastoma susceptibility factors, and also suggested that the chromosomal region 19q could be important in glioblastoma pathogenesis.

Objectives:To assess radiation exposure (RE) to the surgical team and fluoroscopy time (FT) during closed nailing of long bone fractures performed under fluoroscopic guidance with regard to surgeon's experience. Design(s):Prospective observational study. Setting(s):Level-1 trauma center. Participant(s):Surgical team, comprising a surgeon, a surgical assistant, and a scrub nurse, for closed nailing procedures performed in 202 consecutive closed tibial and femoral diaphyseal fractures. Intervention(s):Dosimeter provided to each member of surgical team. Surgeon experience level (trainee, senior registrar, and consultant).Main Outcome Measurements:RE (microsieverts) to the surgical team and FT (minutes) were recorded from the dosimeter and fluoroscopic unit, respectively, and correlated with surgeon's experience. Result(s):In tibial nailing, mean RE (in Sv) per procedure to surgeon, surgical assistant, and scrub nurse was 15.2, 9.2, and 2.0 for trainees, 14.5, 8.1, and 1.6 for senior registrars, and 13.6, 7.4, and 1.5 for consultants, respectively. In femoral nailing, mean RE per procedure to surgeon, surgical assistant, and scrub nurse was 181.6, 113.6, and 37.1 for trainees, 110.1, 66.7, and 20.4 for senior registrars, and 79.9, 30.9, and 12.5 for consultants, respectively. RE to the surgeon was highest followed by surgical assistant and scrub nurse irrespective of operating surgeon's experience in both tibial and femoral nailing (P < 0.001). In tibial nailing, there was a significant difference in FT only for the stage of guide wire passage (P = 0.041), whereas in femoral nailing, total FT (P < 0.001), nail entry verification (P = 0.02), guide wire passage (P = 0.013), nail introduction (P = 0.006), and distal locking (P < 0.001) showed a significant difference. Conclusion(s):RE was maximum for operating surgeon and least for scrub nurse irrespective of operating surgeon's experience in both femoral and tibial nailing. FT and RE to the surgical team decreased with increasing experience of the surgeon in femoral nailing. Level of Evidence:Prognostic Level II.

OBJECTIVE: We conducted the present phase I/IIa positron emission tomography (PET) imaging study with 89Zr conjugated with desferroxamine-IAB2M (89Zr-Df-IAB2M), an anti-prostate-specific membrane-antigen minibody, to assess its safety and feasibility in patients with urological cancer., METHODS: 89Zr-Df-IAB2M was synthetized by IBA Molecular (Somerset, NJ, USA) and transported by air to Tsukuba Molecular Imaging Center (Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan). 17 patients received 74 MBq (2 mCi) of 89Zr-Df-IAB2M at total mass doses of 10 mg. Whole-body and plasma clearance, normal-organ and lesion uptake, and radiation absorbed dose were estimated. We also preliminarily tested the performance of 89Zr-immuno-PET imaging for 13 patients with prostate cancer and 4 patients with other urological cancer., RESULTS: The administration of 89Zr-Df-IAB2M was well-tolerated, and no infusion-related reactions were observed in any patient. No adverse events were noted in the laboratory parameters, vital signs, or other parameters. The plasma clearance was biphasic, with an initial rapid phase (t 1/2 fast: 10.1 +/- 3.4 h) followed by a slow phase (t 1/2 slow: 49.0 +/- 22.7 h). The half-life of radioactivity in the whole body (WB t1/2) was 237 +/- 9 h. The highest absorbed radiation dose was 1.67 mGy/MBq, observed in the liver and kidney. The effective dose was 0.68 +/- 0.08 mSv/MBq. The radiation dose rate at 0.5 m distance from the patient was 8.67 microSv/h on day 1, and decreased to 2.26 microSv/h at 5 days after injection. Both bone and lymph node metastases were detected with 89Zr-Df-IAB2M by 24 or 48 h imaging., CONCLUSIONS: Administration of 89Zr-Df-IAB2M was well-tolerated and safe in terms of adverse events and radiation exposure and protection. 89Zr-Df-IAB2M is feasible for usage by long-distance transportation. Further studies are warranted for analysis of its use for tumor lesion detection (UMIN000015356).",Excluded

Design(s): Retrospective case series of 4 patients. Method(s): Four eyes of 4 patients treated for OSSN after corneal graft in an institutional setting were included. All 4 patients were treated with topical chemotherapy and additionally 1 patient each was treated with excisional biopsy and photodynamic therapy. The main outcome measure was the recurrence of OSSN and the clarity of corneal graft after treatment. Result(s): The mean time interval between corneal graft and diagnosis of OSSN was 36 months (range, 2 to 73 months). All 4 eyes were on chronic treatment with topical steroids for a minimum duration of 2 months and 2 eyes had previous herpes keratitis. Misdiagnosis of graft rejection was found in 2 cases. The mean tumor basal diameter was 18 mm (range, 14- to 25-mm) and the tumor involved a mean of 76% of the corneal surface (range, 15% to 90%). Management was successful in all cases using topical mitomycin C (n = 1), topical interferon alpha2b (n = 4), and photodynamic therapy (n = 1). At mean follow-up of 20 months, tumor control was achieved in all cases and all 4 eyes showed chronic graft opacification with vascularization but no intraocular tumor.

2221,"The effects of post-radiation education pamphlet on self-efficacy in cancer patients. Cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy often experience anxiety and a sense of loss of control immediately after completion of their active treatment. This study aims to evaluate, using a cross-sectional survey, the effects of a post-radiation education pamphlet on the self-efficacy of cancer patients in terms of seeking/understanding medical information, seeking support, and coping with radiation side effects. Forty-eight patients from various age groups with a variety of cancer diagnoses were recruited from the Radiation Medicine Program at Princess Margaret Hospital. Descriptive analysis of 35 survey responses suggests that the pamphlet improved patient self-efficacy in terms of seeking and understanding medical information, seeking support, and coping with radiation side effects. The benefits of the pamphlet were also found to be independent of patients' education level. Despite the small sample size, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of the education pamphlet in improving patient self-efficacy and gives support to the pamphlet's utility in improving the transition care of cancer patients finishing radiotherapy. In parallel, 40 Princess Margaret Hospital Radiation Medicine Program staff members were also asked, via online surveys, about their awareness of the pamphlet, and its usefulness in terms of content, format, and timing of the information provided.

3204,"Fasciculation-myokymic activity and prolonged nerve conduction block. A physiopathological relationship in radiation-induced brachial plexopathy. Fourteen radiation-induced brachial plexus neuropathies in 12 patients suffering from cancer were studied. Neurophysiological evaluation showed a diffuse neurogenic lesion with muscular denervation signs associated with motor and sensory nerve conduction impairment of axonal type in the distal segments of the arm. Somatosensory evoked potentials were frequently abnormal, with absence of N9 in 9 out of the 10 extremities explored. The most characteristic findings were, however, the presence of fasciculation potentials--single and grouped--and myokymic discharges in 78.5% of cases (11 out of 14 plexuses), and a motor nerve conduction block on proximal stimulation, at the supraclavicular as well as cervical spine levels, in all of the cases. Both phenomena showed a high correlation when analyzed in the same neuromuscular territory. The 5 muscles with no voluntary activity and complete--or nearly complete--motor nerve conduction block were the ones with the most intense ectopic activities. The conduction blocks were present after long periods of illness in all cases and, in 2 of the cases, they persisted in successive explorations at intervals of 9 months and 2 years respectively. These data would support a probable cause-effect relationship between a persistent and prolonged motor nerve conduction block and the presence of fasciculation-myokymic type activities.

We calculated the diagnostic accuracy of x-ray and computed tomography (CT) evaluations, respectively, in addition to system outcomes., RESULTS: Twenty-seven of the 78 patients included for analysis were ultimately positive for bone impaction. Initial x-ray interpretations demonstrated a sensitivity of 24.0% (95% CI, 9.4%-45.1%) and a specificity of 90.0% (95% CI, 78.2%-96.7%). However, initial CT interpretation (ie, a preliminary read from on-call residents) demonstrated a sensitivity of 75% (95% CI, 19.4%-99.4%) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI, 59.0%-100%).

1483,"Capecitabine in postoperative radiochemotherapy for gastric adenocarcinoma. Background: More than 50% of new gastric cancer patients are diagnosed with unresectable disease. In 50-80% of patients who underwent radical resection, locoregional recurrence is observed. It has been proved that postoperative radiochemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin significantly improves the treatment outcome. The treatment with oral fluoropyrimidines, such as capecitabine, appears to be more comfortable for patients, because there is no need for any invasive procedures. Method(s): In the period from October 2006 to December 2009, 95 patients (64 males, 31 females; aged 26-78 years, mean age 58.9 years) were treated for adenocarcinoma of non-cardial gastric cancer with postoperative chemoradiation with capecitabine. All patients had locally and/or regionally advanced disease, stages Ib-IIIc. Distal subtotal resection of the stomach was performed in 46.3%, total resection in 50.5% and multivisceral resection in 3.2% of patients. Radical (R0) resection was performed in 95.8% of patients and 4.2% of patients underwent non-radical (R1) surgery. In 44.2% patients, the tumor was staged as pT3 or pT4, and 77.9% patients had N+ disease. Chemotherapy included peroral capecitabine in the dose of 1250 mg/m2 bid on days 1-14 followed by a one week break. During irradiation patients took capecitabine in the dose of 825 mg/m2 bid. After radiotherapy was completed the patients received three more cycles of capecitabine in the dose of 1250 mg/m2 bid on days 1-14 with a one week break between each cycle. 3-D conformal radiotherapy at a daily dose of 1.8 Gy and total irradiation dose of 45 Gy was delivered on linear accelerator with 15MV photon beams for 5 days per week. The main endpoints of this study were loco-regional control, disease-free survival, disease-specific survival and overall survival. The rates of acute side-effects were also estimated. Result(s): Seventy-six percent of patients completed the treatment according to the protocol. In 4% of the patients the total irradiation dose was lower than intended and 24% of patients did not receive all cycles of chemotherapy. No death occurred due to the therapy. Acute toxicity, such as nausea and vomiting, stomatitis, diarrhea, hand-foot syndrome and infections of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 5.3%, 1.1%, 2.1%, 7.4% and 19% of patients, respectively. Despite intensive nutritional support during the treatment the weight loss was observed in 58.4% of patients. The median follow-up time for all 95 patients was 4 years (range: 0.4-6.3 years), whereas in survivors it was 4.8 years (range: 3.4-6.3 years). On the close-out date, 63% patients were still alive, all of them without any signs of the disease. Thirty percent of patients died from gastric carcinoma, 5% died from other causes and in 2% the cause of death could not be determined. After adjuvant radiochemotherapy, recurrence was observed in 31.6% of patients: local and/or regional recurrence in 4.2% of patients and systemic disease alone in 27.4% of patients. The 5 years LRC, DFS, DSS and OS were 93.1%, 67%, 68.6%, and 62.2%, respectively.

MCDE computations demonstrated higher doses with 6 MV than 18 MV in D(95%) for the PTV (64.62 vs 63.64, p=0.009), PTV(optim) (65.48 vs 64.83, p=0.014) and CTV (66.22 vs 65.64, p=0.027). Dose inhomogeneity was lower with 18 than with 6 MV photons for GTV (0.08 vs 0.09, p=0.007) and CTV (0.10 vs 0.11, p=0.045) in CS but not MCDE plans. 6 MV photons significantly (D(33%); p=0.045) spared the esophagus in MCDE plans. Observed dose differences between lower and higher energy IMRT plans were dependent on the individual patient., CONCLUSIONS: Selection of photon energy depends on priority ranking of endpoints and individual patients. In the absence of highly accurate dose computation algorithms such as CS and MCDE, 6 MV photons may be the prudent choice.",Excluded
1982,"Evaluation of a novel normal database with matched SPECT systems and optimal pre-filter parameters for 3D-SSP. PURPOSE: A normal perfusion database (NDB) is imperative for the statistical imaging of brain function. This study validates a novel NDB created under the same injection dose and acquisition conditions for three gamma camera systems and evaluates optimal pre-filter parameters for three-dimensional stereotactic surface projections (3D-SSPs)., METHOD: We compared a novel NDB that matched the databases in each of three vendor gamma camera systems with a conventionally constructed NDB (conventional NDB) and a NDB constructed in-house for 3D-SSP. We generated hypoperfused regions where pre-specified volumes were simulated for various areas in SPECT images. The properties of each NDB were evaluated based on the distribution of the standard deviation (SD). Abnormal accumulation regions were validated using Z, extent, and artifactual scores. Detection error was used to evaluate the optimal Butterworth pre-filter cutoff frequency with the perfusion defect rate (PDR) in 3D-SSP., RESULTS: The SD distribution was the same in the novel NDB and in the NDB constructed in-house, and the SD of the peak distribution was 0.08-0.07. The Z and extent scores of the novel DB and the NDB constructed in-house were similar, but increased along with the artifactual scores when using the conventional NDB. Many artifacts appeared in the Z score map when using the conventional NDB. The detection error deviated from the actual value by -1.3% at a cutoff frequency of 0.58 cycles/cm and a PDR of 30%, which was the lowest. The cutoff frequency became lower or higher, and the low-perfusion defect rate increased according to the increasing detection error. The optimal cutoff frequency was between 0.52 and 0.58 cycles/cm., CONCLUSIONS: We generated a novel NDB according to the individual devices and compared it with a conventional and a NDB constructed in-house. The Z and extent scores were essentially equal when using the novel DB and the NDB constructed in-house, but considerably differed when using the conventional NDB. The optimal cutoff frequency of the Butterworth filter evaluated from the detection error was in the range of 0.52-0.58 cycles/cm. The detection error increased the perfusion defect rate by <15% and this was undetectable in 3D-SSP. The next step will be to improve the accuracy of the extent of abnormal regions and the sensitivity of the Z score using a novel NDB constructed according to the individual devices.",Excluded
3274,"Scanning beyond anatomic limits of the thorax in chest CT: findings, radiation dose, and automatic tube current modulation. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine additional radiation dose associated with scanning beyond the anatomic limits of the thorax in chest CT protocol and to assess the effect of z-axis modulation on the additional radiation dose associated with the scanning protocol. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ""Extra"" images for routine chest CT were defined as those above lung apices (supraapical) and those caudal to the lowermost portion of lung parenchyma (infrapulmonary), including images obtained beyond the adrenal glands (infraadrenal). One hundred and forty-eight consecutive chest CT examinations (70 men, 78 women; age range, 15-90 years) performed September 13-25, 2003, were reviewed to determine the number of supraapical, infrapulmonary, and infraadrenal extra images. All examinations were performed using z-axis modulation (n = 70) or fixed tube current (n = 78). The CT dose index volume and dose-length product (DLP) values for the extra images were calculated. Two radiologists reviewed these extra images for pathologic findings. Student's t test was used to perform the statistical analysis. RESULT(S): One hundred forty-four (97%) examinations had supraapical extra images and 145 (98%) had infrapulmonary extra images. A total of 31 additional findings were observed in extra images. Most clinically important findings were identified in patients with a history of malignancy. With z-axis modulation, the mean DLP for supraapical and infrapulmonary extra images was 39.98 mGy x cm and 132.59 mGy x cm, respectively. With fixed tube current, the mean DLP for supraapical and infrapulmonary extra images was 30.31 mGy x cm and 95.91 mGy x cm, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): A substantial number of extra images are acquired during chest CT that do not add clinically important information in patients with nonmalignant indications. The use of z-axis modulation increased radiation dose for the extra images.",Excluded
1603,"Osteoporosis in hyperthyroidism estimated by photon absorptiometry. The degree of osteoporosis in hyperthyroidism before and during treatment with carbimazole was studied by photon absorption technique of the right forearm and calcaneus. In addition serum total calcium, serum ionized calcium, serum phosphorus and serum alkaline phosphatase were determined. A group of 96 patients suffering from untreated hyperthyroidism (85 women and 11 men) was studied (79 of these patients were also followed during treatment) and compared to a control group of 157 persons (107 women and 50 men). The women were divided into two groups: <= 45 years old and more than 45 years old. In all groups untreated hyperthyroid patients showed lower bone densities compared to the control group, but this was only significant in women. During treatment all groups showed a significant increase in density. After 3-6 months of treatment bone density in the calcaneus increased 12% and in the forearm 1.5%; after 6 months - 3 years 33% and 31%, respectively. At that time bone density was normalized. There was no correlation between bone density in hyperthyroid patients and duration and severity of the disease. The biochemical changes were characterised by increases in serum alkaline phosphatase (26%), serum total calcium (16%) and serum ionized calcium concentration (17%) in cases of untreated hyperthyroidism. Serum phosphorus concentration did not change. A correlation was found between elevation of the alkaline phosphatase and decreased bone density.",Excluded
2777,"Minimally Invasive Screw Fixation of Unstable Pelvic Fractures Using the ""blunt End"" Kirschner Wire Technique Assisted by 3D Printed External Template. Objective. This study aimed to determine the accuracy and safety of the ""blunt end"" Kirschner wire (KW) technique for the minimally invasive treatment of unstable pelvic fractures with the assistance of a 3D printed external template. Methods. Clinical data of 28 patients with unstable pelvic fractures between January 2016 and January 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. There were 6 cases of B1, 10 of B2, 8 of C1, and 4 of C2 fractures, all of which received surgical treatment. The ""blunt end"" KW technique with a 3D template was adopted for the minimally invasive placement of the iliosacral (IS) or superior ramus screws. The number of intraoperative fluoroscopies, surgical time, and complications were recorded. Postoperative reduction was assessed using the Matta criteria, and the Majeed score system was used to evaluate postoperative functional recovery. Results. The average number of fluoroscopies was 35 per patient, and the average surgical time was 85.2 min. A total of 19 S1 and 28 S2 IS screws were inserted. Eleven antegrade superior ramus screws and 4 retrograde screws were placed in 11 patients, and anterior subcutaneous internal fixation (INFIX) was used to fix the anterior pelvic ring in 17 patients. All patients were followed up for an average of 18 months. Postoperative reduction was evaluated by Matta's criteria: Excellent in 16 cases, good in 9 cases, and fair in 3 cases. The Majeed score was used in the last follow-up to evaluate functional recovery: Excellent in 13 cases, good in 10 cases, fair in 4 cases, and poor in 1 case. There were no cases of operative vascular injury. Conclusion. The ""blunt end"" KW technique with a 3D printed external template is a safe and effective method for the placement of IS and superior ramus screws in unstable pelvic fractures with minimized surgical duration and radiation exposure.Copyright © 2019 Kaifang Chen et al.",Excluded
1122,"Level of supervision and radiation exposure of senior orthopedic residents during surgical treatment of proximal femur fracture. The sustained use of intraoperative fluoroscopy has led to increased use of minimally invasive surgical techniques, enhanced surgeon proficiency, improved anatomic corrections, reduced patient morbidity, earlier functional recovery, and decreased length of hospital stay. As a result, orthopedic attending surgeons and residents are exposed to more radiation, increasing the risk of cancer and radiation-induced cataracts compared with the general population and those who work in other surgical specialties. The magnitude of radiation exposure depends on the susceptibility of the tissues affected, medical specialty, the position of the C-arm, distance from the radiation beam, level of difficulty of the surgical procedure, surgeon experience, level of resident training, and level of supervision by the attending surgeon. However, little information is available on the effect of supervision level on radiation exposure for orthopedic senior residents. The goal of this study was to investigate whether level of supervision by the attending surgeon affects the radiation exposure of orthopedic senior residents during surgical treatment of proximal femur fracture with cephalomedullary nail fixation. This retrospective cohort study was performed from January 2019 to March 2019. No significant relationship between supervision level and radiation exposure of senior residents was observed. Supervision level does not significantly affect radiation exposure for senior residents; therefore, the implementation of standardized training in radiation safety may be a more essential measure to decrease radiation exposure.Copyright © 2021 Slack Incorporated.

2923,"Salvage gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery followed by bevacizumab for recurrent glioblastoma multiforme: a case-control study. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery (GKSR) followed by bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy in 11 patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme who experienced tumor progression despite aggressive initial multi-modality treatment. Our experience included eight male and three female patients. The median patient age at GKSR was 62 years (range 46-72 years). At the time of GKSR, seven patients had a first recurrence and four had two or more recurrences. The median interval from the initial diagnosis until GKSR was 17 months (range 5-34.5 months). The median tumor volume was 13.6 cm(3) (range 1.2-45.1 cm(3)) and the median margin dose of GKSR was 16 Gy (range 13-18 Gy). Following GKSR, bevacizumab was administrated with irinotecan in nine patients and with temozolomide in one patient. One patient was treated with bevacizumab monotherapy. The treatment outcomes were compared to 44 case-matched controls who underwent GKSR without additional bevacizumab. At a median of 13.7 months (range 4.6-28.3 months) after radiosurgery, tumor progression was evident in seven patients. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 15 months (95% confidential interval (CI), 6.5-23.3 months). Six-month and 1-year PFS rates were 73 and 55%, respectively. The median overall survival (OS) from GKSR was 18 months (95% CI, 10.1-25.7 months) and 1-year OS rate was 73%. One patient (9%) experienced grade III toxicity and one patient (9%) had major adverse radiation effects. Compared with patients who did not receive bevacizumab, the patients who received bevacizumab had significantly prolonged PFS (15 months vs. 7 months, P = 0.035) and OS (18 months vs. 12 months, P = 0.005), and were less likely to develop an adverse radiation effect (9 vs. 46%, P = 0.037). The combination of salvage GKSR followed by bevacizumab added potential benefit and little additional risk in a small group of patients with progressive glioblastoma.

The decompression experienced due to the change in pressure from a space vehicle (1013hPa) to that in a suit for extravehicular activity (EVA) (386hPa) was simulated using a hypobaric chamber. Previous ground-based research has indicated around a 50% occurrence of both venous gas emboli (VGE) and symptoms of decompression illness (DCI) after similar decompressions. In contrast, no DCI symptoms have been reported from past or current space activities. Twenty subjects were studied using Doppler ultrasound to detect any VGE during decompression to 386hPa, where they remained for up to 6h. Subjects were supine to simulate weightlessness. A large number of VGE were found in one subject at rest, who had a recent arm fracture; a small number of VGE were found in another subject during provocation with calf contractions. No changes in exhaled nitric oxide were found that can be related to either simulated EVA or actual EVA (studied in a parallel study on four cosmonauts). We conclude that weightlessness appears to be protective against DCI and that exhaled NO is not likely to be useful to monitor VGE.",Excluded

AH can be a mild or a life-threatening sign of ANCA-associated vasculitis, but its prognostic impact and specific characteristics have not been determined. To do so, we retrospectively analyzed AH episodes that occurred, between 1991 and 2010, in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis entered in the FVSG database. Patients and Methods: We selected confirmed AH cases, as assessed by the presence of hemoptysis and ground-glass images on X-rays or CT scans and/or bloody bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Renal insufficiency was defined as creatininemia >150 mmol/l. Severity criteria were: hypoxia, Hb decline >1 g/dl over 48 h after AH occurred and requiring mechanical ventilation. Result(s): For the 65 cases (35 men and 30 women) analyzed, their mean age at the 1stAH episode was 53 years. ANCA-associated vasculitis diagnoses were: 55% Wegener's granulomatosis (WG), 34% microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and 9% Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS). Pre-AH hemoptysis occurred in 41 (63%) patients: 39% the week preceding, 29.3% 2-4 weeks before and 19.5% >1 month prior to AH diagnosis, which led to ANCA-associated vasculitis diagnosis for 45 (69.2%) patients. Among 10 (15.4%) patients (4 WG, 4 MPA, 2 CSS) requiring mechanical ventilation, 4 had hemoptysis previously. Twenty-three (35%) patients were hypoxic and 23 (35%) had major Hb decreases; 36 (55%) had concomitant renal insufficiency (pulmo-renal syndrome): 18 WG (51% of all WG) and 18 MPA (81% of all MPA). Paucimmune glomerulonephritis was seen in 31/33 kidney biopsies. Intriguingly, no CSS patient had renal impairment when AH occurred. Treatments included a combination of corticosteroids and intravenous cyclophosphamide (CYC) for 55 (85%) patients; oral CYC was used in 5, methotrexate in 4 and plasma exchange in 7. Rituximab and remicade were prescribed to 1 patient each. Mean time between AH and treatment onset was 5.87 (range 0-60) days. Mean follow-up was 8.3 years (range 1 month-19 years). Follow-up information was not available for 8 patients. A total of 38 (58%) patients relapsed: 7 with AH and other organ involvement, 21 with non-AH manifestation(s) and 10 with AH alone. Three patients underwent kidney transplantation. The 13 (20%) deaths (6 WG and 7 MPA) were attributed to: septic shock for 4, lung cancer for 2, and 1 each of the following: bladder cancer, AH, sudden death, hemorrhagic stroke, ARDS due to misplaced nasogastric tube and probably drug-related (methotrexate). Although 9/13 patients with pulmo-renal syndrome died, no death resulted directly from the initial AH. Conclusion(s): These findings highlight the importance of recognizing premonitory hemoptysis as an early sign of AH in ANCA-associated vasculitides, since 63% of the cohort patients had bloody sputum before AH was diagnosed. Also, patients with AH and renal insufficiency have poorer survival prognoses. As demonstrated by the five-factor score, AH alone is not predictive poor prognosis; conversely, kidney involvement dictates a poor outcome.",Excluded

Additional 3T sequences were acquired with a reduced number of averages and using the parallel acquisition technique for accelerating imaging speed. Artifact size (diameter, area), image quality (5-point scale) and delineation of anatomical structures were compared among the techniques, sequences and field strengths using the Wilcoxon sign-rank and paired t-test with Bonferroni correction., RESULTS: At both field strengths, WARP showed significant superiority over standard sequences regarding image quality, artifact size and delineation of anatomical structures. At 3T, artifacts were larger compared to 1.5T without affecting diagnostic quality, and scanning time could be reduced by up to 64 % without quality degradation., CONCLUSION: WARP proved useful in imaging metal-on-metal hip resurfacings at 1.5T as well as 3T with better image quality surrounding the implants.

BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease caused by the new coronavirus. Previous studies have shown that the chest CT examination plays an important role in the diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19. However, some patients with COVID-19 had low white blood cell counts and reduced lymphocyte ratios. Multiple CT examinations may cause radiation damages as well as increase the apoptosis of peripheral blood lymphocytes. A new low-dose CT method should be developed because the regular CT may aggravate the disease., METHOD: Sixty cases were randomly divided into the study group (n = 30) and control group (n = 30). The lung window was reconstructed by Karl 3D iterative technique in the study group. The image quality was subjectively evaluated by two senior chest group diagnostic physicians using a 5-point double-blind method. The value of CT measurement and its standard deviation (SD) was used as an objective evaluation criteria. The volume of CT dose index (CTDIvol), dose length product (DLP) and effective dose (ED) from the two groups were compared and analyzed statistically., RESULT: There was no significant difference in the occurrence rates of ground glass opacities, consolidation, crazy-paving pattern, fiber cable shadow and axial interstitial thickening between the study group and control group (p > 0.05). In addition, no significant difference was found for the subjective score of overall image quality and image noise level (SD) between the two groups (p > 0.05). However, significant differences was found in CTDIvol, DLP, and ED between the study group and the control group (p < 0.05). The effective dose of the study group was reduced by 76% compared to the control group., CONCLUSION: CareDose 4D low-dose scanning combined with Karl 3D iterative reconstruction technology can not only greatly reduce the radiation dose, but also provide images that meet the diagnostic criteria of COVID-19, which can be used as a routine method for the follow-up of COVID-19 patients.",Excluded

PURPOSE: This trial was undertaken to compare the rates of resectability between patients treated with neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiation vs. boosted radiotherapy alone., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with clinically unresectable rectal cancer were randomized to receive external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) to pelvis (45 Gy) with concurrent oral Capecitabine (CRT group; Arm 1) or EBRT to pelvis (45 Gy) alone followed by 20 Gy dose of localized radiotherapy boost to the primary tumor site (RT with boost group, Arm 2). All patients were assessed for resectability after 6 weeks by clinical examination and by CT scan and those deemed resectable underwent surgery., RESULTS: A total of 90 patients were randomized, 46 to Arm 1 and 44 to Arm 2. Eighty seven patients (44 in Arm 1 and 41 in Arm 2) completed the prescribed treatment protocol. Overall resectability rate was low in both the groups; R0 resection was achieved in 20 (43 %) patients in Arm 1 vs. 15 (34 %) in Arm 2. Adverse factors that significantly affected the resectability rate in both the groups were extension of tumor to pelvic bones and signet ring cell pathology. Complete pathological response was seen in 7 and 11 %, respectively. There was greater morbidity such as wound infection and delayed wound healing in Arm 2 (16 vs. 40 %; p = 0.03)., CONCLUSION: Escalated radiation dose without chemotherapy does not achieve higher complete (R0) tumor resectability in locally advanced inoperable rectal cancers, compared to concurrent chemoradiation.",Excluded

Demographic, clinical, and complications data were recorded and analyzed. Early postoperative complications occurred in 46.5% of the patients and post-radiation therapy complications in 16.1%. Wound dehiscence (27.9%) and inferior alveolar nerve injury (25.6%) were the common early postoperative complications. Dental injuries (9.7%) and plate exposure/infection (9.7%) were the common post-radiation therapy complications. Furthermore, inferior alveolar nerve injury and early abscess formation were significantly associated with the site of the mandibulotomy. The T-stage of a tumour but not the site of mandibulotomy was significantly associated with tumour margin clearance. Mandibulotomy does pose an added risk of complications for a patient undergoing tumour surgery. The benefits of mandibulotomy in terms of gaining margin clearance could not be proven in this study. The site of mandibulotomy appears to increase the risk of developing an inferior alveolar nerve injury.Copyright © 2019",Excluded

Aims Transseptal puncture (TP) for left atrial (LA) catheter ablation procedures is routinely performed under fluoroscopic guidance. To decrease radiation exposure and increase safety alternative techniques are desirable. The aim of this study was to assess whether right atrial (RA) electroanatomic 3D mapping can reliably identify the fossa ovalis (FO) in preparation of TP. Methods Between May 2019 and August 2019, electroanatomic RA mapping was performed before TP in 61 patients with and results paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation. Three electroanatomic methods for FO identification, mapping catheter-induced FO protrusion, electroanatomic-guided analysis, and voltage mapping, were evaluated and compared with transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE). Mapping catheter-induced FO protrusion was feasible in 60 patients (98%) with a mean displacement of 6.8 +/- 2.5 mm, confirmed by TOE, and proofed to be the most valuable and easiest marker for FO identification. Electroanatomic-guided analysis localized the FO midpoint consistently in the lower half (43 +/- 7%) and posterior (18.2 +/- 4.4 mm) to a line between coronary sinus and vena cava superior. Analysis of RA voltage maps during sinus rhythm (n = 40, low-voltage cut-off value 1.0 and 1.5 mV) allowed secure FO recognition in 33% and 18%, only. A step-by-step approach, combining FO protrusion (first step) with anatomy criteria in case of protrusion failure (second step) would have allowed for the correct localization of a TP site within the FO in all patients. Conclusion Right atrial electroanatomic 3D mapping prior to TP proofed to be a simple tool for FO identification and may potentially be of use in the safe and radiation-free performance of TP prior to LA ablation procedures.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.",Excluded
501,"Effect of oral administration of Hypericum perforatum extract (St. John's wort) on skin erythema and pigmentation induced by UVB, UVA, visible light and solar simulated radiation. Hypericin from St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum L.) is a photosensitizing agent that may cause a severe photodermatitis when higher amounts of St John's wort are ingested by animals. Although Hypericum extracts are widely used in the treatment of depressive disorders, only a little information on the photosensitizing capacity of St John's wort in humans is available. In the present prospective randomized study we investigated the effect of the Hypericum extract LI 160 on skin sensitivity to ultraviolet B (UVB), ultraviolet A (UVA), visible light (VIS) and solar simulated radiation (SIM). Seventy two volunteers of skin types II and III were included and were divided into six groups, each consisting of 12 volunteers. In the single-dose study the volunteers (n = 48) received 6 or 12 coated tablets (5400 or 10800 mug hypericin). In the steady-state study the volunteers (n = 24) received an initial dose of 6 tablets (5400 mug hypericin), and subsequently 3 x 1 tablets (2700 mug hypericin) per day for 7 days. Phototesting was performed on the volar forearms prior to medication and 6 h after the last administration of Hypericum extract. The erythema-index and melanin-index were evaluated photometrically using a mexameter. After both single-dose and steady-state administration, no significant influence on the erythema-index or melanin-index could be detected, with the exception of a marginal influence on UVB induced pigmentation (p = 0.0471) in the single-dose study. The results do not provide evidence for a phototoxic potential of the Hypericum extract LI 160 in humans when administered orally in typical clinical doses up to 1800 mg daily. This is in accordance with previous pharmacokinetics studies that found hypericin serum and skin levels after oral ingestion of Hypericum extract always to be lower than the assumed phototoxic hypericin threshold level of 1000 ng/mL.

In the current study we examine parameters affecting the metastasis of ocular tumors of in vivo derived B16F10 melanoma. In C57BL/6J beige (bg/bg) mice, with low NK activity, metastasis to the lungs was increased and survival time decreased. In C57BL/6J normal (+/+) mice treatment with PK136, a highly specific monoclonal anti-NK antibody (Ab), caused a depletion of NK cytotoxic activity, as demonstrated using a standard 51Cr release assay. In animals bearing ocular tumors, treatment with PK136 Ab resulted in significantly increased pulmonary metastasis and an altered pattern of metastasis. The effect of combined treatment protocols using LS2616 (linomide) and cyclophosphamide (Cy) was examined in enucleated and unenucleated animals. Treatment with LS2616 and Cy resulted in a significant decrease in mean pulmonary metastases (MPM), a decreased frequency of metastasis to the submandibular lymph nodes and an increase in mean survival time. In enucleated mice this combined treatment protocol resulted in apparent cures, the lowest MPM and the longest survival time observed. When tumor-bearing mice were treated with either silica, carrageenan or sublethal gamma irradiation, no effect on metastasis or survival was observed.

The efficiency of immunization regimens were assessed 45 days post infection with 100 live cercariae/mouse by the number of worm burden, ova count, production of IL-5, eosinophils, and IgE levels in the vaccinated groups compared with the non-immunized group. The results demonstrated a significant reduction of ova count in the livers of vaccinated groups (57.19 and 40.13%) and worm couples compared with the non -immunized group. Furthermore, a decrease of IL-5 level as well as eosinopenia was recorded in both vaccinated groups. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) of adult worms recovered from the immunized groups revealed marked damage on the tegumental surface in males rather than females as well as constrictions and intensive corrugation of intertubercles.",Excluded
2306,"Efficacy analysis of pedicle screw internal fixation of fractured vertebrae in the treatment of thoracolumbar fractures. The present study aimed to discuss the method and effect of posterior internal fixation of thoracolumbar fractures strengthened by the vertical stress pedicle screw fixation of fractured vertebrae. Patients with single thoracolumbar fractures were examined retrospectively. Fourteen patients (group A) had been treated with vertical stress pedicle screw fixation of a fractured vertebra and sixteen patients (group B) received traditional double-plate fixation, as a control. All patients were diagnosed with fresh fractures with a complete unilateral or bilateral pedicle and no explosion of the inferior half of the vertebral body or inferior endplate. In group A, patients received conventional posterior distraction and lumbar lordosis restoration, as well as pedicle screws in the fractured vertebra in a vertical direction to relieve stress to achieve a local stress balance. All patients were followed up postoperatively for 4-18 months (average, 12.6 months). The vertical stress pedicle screw fixation assisted in the reduction of vertebrae fracture, which reduced the postoperative Cobb's angle loss. There was a significant difference in the change of Cobb's angle between the two groups one year after surgery (P<0.01). Conditional application of pedicle screws in a single thoracolumbar fracture enhances the stability of the internal fixation system and is conducive to the correction of kyphosis and maintenance of the corrective effects.",Excluded
1639,"Concurrent paclitaxel and radiation therapy for the treatment of cutaneous angiosarcoma. Introduction: We compared clinical outcomes in patients with cutaneous angiosarcoma receiving concurrent paclitaxel-based chemoradiotherapy (CRT) vs. other modalities (Non-CRT). Material(s) and Method(s): Patients with non-metastatic cutaneous angiosarcoma diagnosed from 1998 to 2018 at two institutions were identified. In the CRT cohort, paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 weekly was given for up to 12 weeks and patients received radiotherapy (RT) during the final 6 weeks of chemotherapy. The RT dose was 50-50.4 Gy delivered in 1.8-2 Gy per fraction with an optional post-operative boost of 10-16 Gy. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank statistics were used to compare the outcomes between the two groups. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result(s): Fifty-seven patients were included: 22 CRT and 35 Non-CRT. The CRT cohort had more patients > 60 years (100% vs. 60%, p < 0.001) and tumors >5 cm (68.2% vs 54.3%, p = 0.023). The median follow-up was 25.8 (1.5-155.2) months. There was no significant difference in 2-year local control (LC), distant control (DC), or progression-free survival (PFS) between the two groups. The 2-year overall survival (OS) was significantly higher for the CRT cohort (94.1% vs. 71.6%, p = 0.033). Amongst the subset of patients in the CRT cohort who received trimodality therapy, the 2-year LC, DC, PFS, and OS was 68.6%, 100%, 68.6%, and 100%, respectively. Conclusion(s): The use of concurrent paclitaxel CRT demonstrates promising outcomes. Given these results, we are currently evaluating the safety and efficacy of this regimen in prospective, phase 2 trial (NCT 03921008).Copyright © 2021 The Authors",Excluded
1950,"A randomized trial of accelerated hyperfractionated radiation therapy and bis-chloroethyl nitrosourea for malignant glioma. A preliminary report of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 83-02. BACKGROUND: The third and final randomization of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 83-02 was performed to identify the maximal tolerated dose and potential efficacy of accelerated hyperfractionated radiation therapy (AHRT) in 1.6 Gy twice-daily fractions for adult malignant glioma., METHODS: From December 1987 to July 1989, 304 patients with malignant glioma were stratified by age, performance status, and histologic findings and randomized to receive total AHRT doses of 48.0 or 54.4 Gy, with 80 mg/m2 of bis-chloroethyl nitrosourea (BCNU) for 3 days every 8 weeks. Distribution of other prognostic factors, including neurologic function, extent of surgery, tumor size, and sex, was comparable in each treatment arm., RESULTS: One Grade 5 radiation therapy (RT)-related toxic effect was reported (in the 54.4-Gy treatment arm), and the incidence of late Grade 3-5 RT-related toxic effects at 18 months was 1% at 48.0 Gy and 4% at 54.4 Gy. The median survival times (MST) for the 48.0 Gy and 54.4 Gy treatment arms were 11.7 and 10.8 months, respectively, comparable to the MST in prior RTOG trials with a similar proportion of patients with glioblastoma multiforme (79%). For the 123 patients who were 60 years of age or older, the MST for the 48.0 Gy and 54.4 Gy treatment arms were 8.9 and 10.4 months, respectively, and compare favorably with the MST of 6.0 months reported with standard RT and BCNU treatment used for 101 patients who were 60 years of age or older in two prior RTOG malignant glioma trials (74-01 and 79-18). Although these results differ significantly (P = 0.0015), this contrast is not significant when adjusted by performance status., CONCLUSIONS: The maximum tolerated dose of AHRT has yet to be identified, and pursuit of this information may most benefit patients with malignant glioma who are 60 years of age or older.",Excluded

AIM: The goal of the study was to examine the prevalence of Graves' disease following I-131 treatment of autonomous goiter with special regard to pretreatment scintigraphic patterns., PATIENTS AND METHOD: Pre- and posttreatment in-vitro and in-vivo parameters were studied in 375 consecutive patients treated with I-131 therapy for nodular or diffuse autonomous goiter. All patients included were within ambulant control for at least 2.5 months following treatment. According to the pretreatment Tc-99m pertechnetate scan 59% (220/375) had multifocal (MF), 23% (86/375) unifocal (UF), 10% (38/375) mixed focal-disseminated (FD) and 8% (31/375) disseminated (D) scintigraphic patterns., RESULTS: In 93.9% (352/375), the autonomous tissue was totally, in 2.1% (8/375) partially and in 1.6% (6/375) insufficiently eliminated. In 2.4% (9/375) a relapse of hyperthyroidism was observed 2 to 10 months following I-131 therapy. In 8 patients a relapse of hyperthyroidism was accompanied or followed by an elevation of the previously non-elevated TSH-receptor antibody (TRAb) level and in 1 patient by an TRAb increase to the upper borderline range implicating Graves' disease. With the prevalence of Graves' disease following I-131 therapy a statistically significant difference in pretreatment Tc-99m pertechnetate scintigraphic patterns was found: 0% of unifocal (0/86) or multifocal (0/220), however 18% (7/38) of focal-disseminated and 7% (2/31) of disseminated scintigraphic patterns. From the 366 patients without relapse of hyperthyroidism 2 (MF) had elevated pre- and posttreatment TRAb levels and 3 (D) had elevated TRAb levels for the first time after I-131 therapy., CONCLUSION: There is a low overall prevalence (2.4%) of Graves' disease following I-131 therapy for nodular or diffuse autonomous goiter. However, the prevalence of posttreatment Graves' disease is highly dependent upon pretreatment scintigraphic patterns exhibiting focal-disseminated or disseminated patterns.",Excluded
3623,"Patterns of relapse in patients with high grade glioma receiving combined treatments including stereotactic re-irradiation for a first relapse. Purpose Bevacizumab and stereotactic treatment are efficient combined or alone in relapse glioma. However, patterns of relapse after this kind of salvage treatment have never been studied. The purpose of this unicentric retrospective analysis was to assess and understand the patterns of relapse of high grade glioma treated with stereotactic radiation, with or without bevacizumab. Patients and methods Twenty patients with high grade glioma relapse received a stereotactic radiation; among them two patients received temozolomide and eight patients received bevacizumab; among the latter, four received also irinotecan. We matched the stereotactic radiation treatment planning scan with the images of the first treatment and of the second relapse in order to determine the patterns of failure and associate dosimetric profile. Results For the total population, median follow-up from the first diagnosis and relapse were 46.1 and 17.6 months, respectively. Among the 13 patients who relapsed, ten did not receive chemotherapy and three received it (P < 0.05), two received temozolomide and one bevacizumab. Patients who received bevacizumab had no ""out-of-field"" recurrences. Among the 32 irradiated relapses, 15 were ""in-field"" recurrences; among them two were treated with bevacizumab and 13 were not (P < 0.05). For the 32 lesions, a favourable prognostic factor of control was the association of a high-dose of irradiation and the use of bevacizumab. Conclusion For patients with relapsed high grade glioma, local control was higher with combined bevacizumab and high-dose stereotactic radiation.Copyright © 2016",Excluded

UNLABELLED: Radioiodine therapy is an established method worldwide for treatment of hyperthyroidism., AIM: The author analyses the results of radioiodine therapy for treatment of functional autonomy performed in the Nuclear Medicine Department of Markusovszky Hospital between November 2005 and February 2007., METHODS: The data of 33 patients (29 women, 4 men; age: 61.9 +/- 9.8 years) were evaluated. 23 patients with multifocal autonomy and 10 patients with unifocal autonomy were treated. Individual dosimetry was performed and the activity applied was calculated using Marinelli's formula. Patients with a complete follow-up for 6 months or more were included (mean follow-up time: 11 months)., RESULTS: Successful elimination of functional thyroid autonomy resulting in either euthyroidism or hypothyroidism occurred in 88% of patients (29/33). The frequency of normalised TSH was 79% (26/33), the rate of post-treatment hypothyroidism was 9% (3/33) and the rate of residual hyperthyroidism was 12% (4/33). Previous treatment with antithyroid drugs had no negative influence on the success rate of radioiodine therapy. In 64% of patients (21/33) the administered activity exceeded 550 MBq, the upper limit of out-patient radioiodine therapy., CONCLUSIONS: The results of radioiodine therapy in the analysed patient group are coherent with the data of several large studies.

3067,"Variant Splicing and Influence of Ionizing Radiation on Human Endogenous Retrovirus K (HERV-K) Transcripts in Cancer Cell Lines. Human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) is the most intact retrovirus in the human genome. There are multiple full-length or near full-length HERV-K proviruses in it. To analyze which HERV-K proviruses give rise to viral transcripts in cancer cell lines and to test whether ionizing radiation can alter the levels of HERV-K transcripts, RT-PCR studies were undertaken using multiple human cancer cell lines. Primers from several positions in the viral genome were used and included pairs designed to cross splice junctions in viral RNAs. In the absence of ionizing radiation, transcripts were detected from multiple HERV-K proviruses in cell lines from human prostate, cervical, head and neck, or breast cancers, and the proviruses from which the transcripts originated varied among the different lines. Only one of 13 cell lines tested (cervical cancer line C33A) failed to show HERV-K transcripts. Spliced RNAs detected included viral RNAs spliced as expected at the conventional viral splice sites, plus several alternatively spliced RNAs. Alternatively spliced transcripts arose from specific proviruses, and were detected in most of the cell lines used. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed to assess the effects of ionizing radiation. These analyses showed that HERV-K transcripts were elevated in four of twelve lines tested, specifically all three prostate cancer lines used and one breast cancer line. The increases were transient, peaking at 24 hours following a single dose of gamma-irradiation that ranged from 2.5 to 20 Gy, and returning to baseline levels by 72 hours. In summary, these studies showed that ionizing radiation can affect the levels of HERV-K transcripts in cells, and these effects vary among different cells. The changes in HERV-K transcript levels might affect multiple biological processes in cells, and future studies of the effects of ionizing radiation on HERV-K are worth pursuing. © 2013 Agoni et al.",Excluded

57,"Distal interphalangeal joint bony dimensions related to headless compression screw sizes. Purpose To determine the radiographic dimensions of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint and to compare these measurements with commonly used headless compression screws. Methods Using standard posteroanterior and lateral radiographs of the hand, we measured the dimensions of the distal and middle phalanges in 60 index, middle, ring, and little fingers. We then compared these measurements with the diameters and lengths of 16 commercially available headless compression screws commonly used to perform DIP joint arthrodesis. Percent compatibility and risk factors for incompatibility were determined. Results In general, commercially available screw diameters were too large given the anatomic dimensions of the DIP joint. The distal phalanx shaft as measured on the lateral view was the narrowest determinant of fit. When the dimensions of all fixation devices were combined, screws were oversized relative to the bony anatomy in 66% of index fingers, 53% of middle fingers, 49% of ring fingers, and 72% of little fingers. This mismatch was greater in women than in men. Only 1 of the compression screw types demonstrated a compatibility rate greater than 90% for the index and little fingers, respectively. A multivariate analysis of independent risk factors showed the likelihood of a compatible fit to vary directly with patient height and to be less likely in the little and index fingers. Interobserver reliability analysis revealed excellent x-ray measurement correlation between observers. Conclusions A size mismatch existed between the anatomic dimensions of the DIP joint and commercially available headless compression screws. Caution must be used when considering these screws for DIP joint arthrodesis, to avoid problems related to screw prominence in the narrow aspects of the distal and middle phalanges. Clinical relevance Headless compression screws are frequently oversized for use in DIP arthrodesis. © 2014 ASSH Published by Elsevier, Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Aims: To analyze the results of postoperative concomitant radiochemotherapy with 5-florouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin (LV) in patients with gastric carcinoma treated in a single institution. Method(s): During 2001-2004, 123 patients with the mean age of 60 years, were treated for adenocarcinoma of the stomach, stage Ib-IV, with postoperative concomitant radiochemotherapy. Radical (R0) and non-radical (R1) resection of the tumor was performed in 107 and 16 patients, respectively. Adjuvant treatment consisted of five cycles of five-day chemotherapy with 5-FU (425 mg/m2) and LV (20 mg/m2) and concomitant radiotherapy with the total dose of 45 Gy. Result(s): The treatment was completed according to the protocol in 101 patients. Stomatitis, dysphagia, and nausea and vomiting of grade three occurred in 32, 27, and 23 patients, respectively. The median follow-up time of 87 survivors was 30.4 months (range 17.4-58.3 months). At two years, locoregional control (LRC), disease-free survival (DFS), disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 86%, 65%, 74%, and 73%, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, the initial Hb level was identified as independent prognostic factor for all survival four endpoints, the involvement of whole stomach with cancer for LRC, the total dose of 5-FU per five-day cycle for DFS, and pT stage for DSS. Conclusion(s): In operable gastric carcinoma, postoperative concomitant radiochemotherapy with 5-FU and LV is feasible and its toxicity acceptable. Its potential to improve the treatment outcome compared to the surgery alone is yet to be tested in well designed prospective randomized studies. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
3548,"High ambient solar UV correlates with greater beta HPV seropositivity in New South Wales, Australia. Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is highly prevalent worldwide and may have a role, with sun exposure, in causing cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Little is known about the relationship of UV exposure and seroprevalence of cutaneous HPVs in the general population. Method(s): Using multiplex serology, we estimated the seroprevalence of 23 beta and 7 gamma HPVs and 7 other antigens (mu HPV1, HPV63, nu HPV41, alpha HPV16; polyomaviruses HPyV7 and MCV; p53) in a population-based sample of 1,161 Australian 45 and Up Study participants with valid data from blood specimens collected from 2010 to 2012. We calculated prevalence ratios (PR) for the association of each antigen with residential ambient solar UV and other UV-related variables. Result(s): Seropositivity for at least one beta or gamma HPV was high at 88% (beta HPVs 74%, gamma HPVs 70%), and less in women than men [e.g., PR beta-2 HPV38 1/4 0.70; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.56-0.87; any gamma 1/4 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84-0.97]. A high ambient UV level in the 10 years before study enrollment was associated with elevated seroprevalence for genus beta (PRtertile3vs1 any beta 1/4 1.17; 95% CI, 1.07-1.28), and beta-1 to beta-3 species, but not for gamma HPVs. Other UV-related measures had less or no evidence of an association. Conclusion(s): Seroprevalence of cutaneous beta HPVs is higher with higher ambient UV exposure in the past 10 years.

493,"Totally automatic definition of renal regions of interest from 99mTc-MAG3 renograms: validation in patients with normal kidneys and in patients with suspected renal obstruction. INTRODUCTION: An image-processing algorithm (AUTOROI) has been developed to totally automatically (or with manual assistance) detect whole-kidney contours and generate renal regions of interest (ROI) for the extraction of the quantitative measurements used in the interpretation of Tc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine (Tc-MAG3) renograms., METHODS: The 18-20th min dynamic frames post-MAG3 injection were used to automatically define boxes surrounding each kidney, which were then transposed to an early composite image for interpolative and directional background subtraction. Sobel operator and unsharp masking were applied for edge enhancement, and the resulting image histograms were equalized to better define poorly functioning kidneys. AUTOROI searched radially from the center of mass to define each kidney's ROI coordinates. AUTOROI was validated using MAG3 studies from 79 patients referred for suspected obstruction (79 left, 77 right kidneys) and 19 kidney donors with normal kidney function and no obstruction. Renal ROIs were manually defined by a nuclear medicine technologist with 20+ years of experience (reference standard) and an American Board of Nuclear Medicine certified physician. AUTOROI and physician ROIs were automatically compared with the reference standard to determine the border definition error., RESULTS: AUTOROI totally automatically detected the renal borders in 89% (172 of 194) of the kidneys from the entire group of 98 patients. The 22 kidneys missed automatically were subsequently detected with the assistance of a single manually placed fiducial point demarcating the liver/kidney boundary. These 22 kidneys were shown to be associated with markedly reduced MAG3 clearance. The mean error of AUTOROI for all 194 kidneys was 6.66+/-3.77 and 7.31+/-4.52 mm for the left and right kidney, respectively. The physician's error was 6.78+/-2.42 and 6.65+/-2.05 mm for the left and right kidney, respectively. This error difference between AUTOROI and the physician was not statistically significant., CONCLUSION: AUTOROI provides an objective and promising approach to automated renal ROI detection.",Excluded
2505,"Type of interventional pain procedure, body weight, and presence of spinal pathology are determinants of the level of radiation exposure for fluoroscopically guided pain procedures. In the recent years new technology has led to the development of a bewildering array of imaging procedures. Yet, conventional radiography remains one of the most used tools to diagnose and to aid procedural interventions. Fluoroscopy guidance facilitates targeted drug delivery or radiofrequency directly to the area of pathology, a benefit that has to be balanced against the risks of radiation exposure. In this prospective observational survey of routine practice, dose area product (DAP) and screening time (ST) were recorded in 127 consecutive patients undergoing fluoroscopically guided spinal procedures along with other probable measures of potentially greater radiation exposure such as weight, type of spinal pathology, the ease of recognition of the anatomical landmarks, and the radiographic quality of the image in terms of contrast and graininess. The mean ST was 34+/-27 seconds (range, 3 to 218 seconds), the mean DAP was 1.18+/-1.08 Gy cm(2) (range, 0.023 to 6.82 seconds). A correlation between weight and DAP was confirmed (r=0.230, P<0.05, Spearman's correlation coefficient). Patients with spinal pathology (n=33) had higher radiation exposure than those without (DAP median=0.85, U=978.00, P<0.005, r=-0.28, Mann-Whitney test).

371,"Management and long-term outcomes of sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma: Twenty-year experience at a single institution. Purpose/Objective(s): Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC) is a rare malignancy of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses generally associated with an aggressive clinical course and poor long-term survival. Optimal management is not well-defined, and varying combinations of surgery (S), radiation therapy (RT) and chemotherapy (CT) have been reported. There have been substantial advances in surgery as well as radiation therapy, which may offer improved outcomes. We review the management approaches, long-term outcomes, and patterns of failure of patients treated at our institution to help define the optimal management for this rare malignancy. Materials/Methods: Fifteen patients with SNUC were treated from 1992- 2012 at our institution, with pathology reviewed and confirmed. Demographic, treatment, and clinical data were collected from medical records. Patients underwent imaging evaluation with CT and/or MRI. Event outcomes were calculated from date of surgery to time of recurrence, death, or last follow-up. Survival statistics were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier and Cox Regression methods. Result(s): There were 10 male and 5 female patients with median age 49 years (range 22-82). Most patients had locally advanced T stage: T2 (n = 2), T3 (n = 5), and T4 (n = 8). At diagnosis, 1 patient was clinically node positive and none had distant metastases. Treatment was as follows: 4 S + postoperative RT +/- chemotherapy (CT); 3 preoperative chemoradiation (CRT) + S; 7 primary CRT; 1 RT alone. Nine had RT to primary site alone, and 6 had elective neck RT. Median dose was 69.5 Gy (range 50.4-70.2). Most received concurrent CT (n = 12). Median follow up was 39 months (range 3-206). At time of analysis, 8 patients are alive, 6 have died and 1 is lost to follow up. KM projected 5-year OS and RFS-rates were 70% and 53%, respectively. Five patients recurred: 1 local, 1 local/neck, 1 neck, 1 distant, 1 local/neck/distant. Median time to recurrence was 7 months. On univariate analysis, there was no statistically significant impact of stage, use of surgery, use of chemotherapy, radiation dose, gender, or age on survival. A trend for improved survival with concurrent CRT was seen (p = 0.097). Conclusion(s): SNUC is a highly aggressive malignancy associated with a high risk of disease recurrence, consistent with other series reported in the literature. There are some long term survivors who were treated with primary CRT or preoperative CRT followed by surgery. Early multimodality therapy is necessary for improved outcomes. The optimal timing and sequence of S, RT and CT should be further investigated.",Excluded
1239,"Clinical features of photodamaged human skin are associated with a reduction in collagen VII. Chronically sun-exposed or photodamaged human skin is characterized by a number of clinical features, including wrinkles. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that underlie these features. We investigated the hypothesis that the mechanism of wrinkle formation may involve loss of anchoring fibrils, composed mainly of collagen VII, which are important in maintaining dermal-epidermal junction integrity. Ten volunteers with moderate to severe photodamage of dorsal forearm skin were recruited to the study. Using immunohistochemistry, transmission electron microscopy and in situ hybridization, we compared collagen VII protein and mRNA content of photodamaged forearm skin with that of sun-protected hip and upper inner arm skin from the same subjects. Numbers of anchoring fibrils per linear microns of basement membrane (mean +/- SEM) were significantly lower in photodamaged skin (1.79 +/- 0.10) as compared with sun-protected hip (2.28 +/- 0.11) and upper inner arm skin (2.21 +/- 0.10) (P < 0.01), and similarly keratinocyte expression of collagen VII mRNA, quantitated as number of positively stained keratinocytes per high power field, was significantly reduced in photodamaged skin (6.3 +/- 2.5) as compared with sun-protected hip (20.0 +/- 5.6) and upper inner arm skin (17.7 +/- 4.9) (P < 0.001).

1378,"Cellular response to an antisense-mediated shift of Bcl-x pre-mRNA splicing and antineoplastic agents. Overexpression of Bcl-xL, an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, negatively correlates with the sensitivity of various cancers to chemotherapeutic agents. We show here that high levels of expression of Bcl-xL promoted apoptosis of cells treated with an antisense oligonucleotide (5'Bcl-x AS) that shifts the splicing pattern of Bcl-x pre-mRNA from the anti-apoptotic variant, Bcl-xL, to the pro-apoptotic variant, Bcl-xS. This surprising finding illustrates the advantage of antisense-induced modulation of alternative splicing versus down-regulation of targeted genes. It also suggests a specificity of the oligonucleotide effects since non-cancerous cells with low levels of Bcl-xL should resist the treatment. 5'Bcl-x AS sensitized cells to several antineoplastic agents and radiation and was effective in promoting apoptosis of MCF-7/ADR cells, a breast cancer cell line resistant to doxorubicin via overexpression of the mdr1 gene. Efficacy of 5'Bcl-x AS combined with chemotherapeutic agents in the PC3 prostate cancer cell line may be translated to clinical prostate cancer since recurrent prostate cancer tissue samples expressed higher levels of Bcl-xL than benign prostate tissue. Treatment with 5'Bcl-x AS may enhance the efficacy of standard anti-cancer regimens and should be explored, especially in recurrent prostate cancer.",Excluded

INTRODUCTION: Of oncological patients who have undergone chest radiation therapy, 20% develop radiation-induced constrictive pericarditis. The purpose of this study was to review our clinic's experience of such cases, focusing on survival and the functional outcome., METHODS: Six patients with a history of previous radiation therapy, aged 33-61 years, most of whom had symptoms of heart failure, underwent radical (2 patients) or partial (4 patients) pericardiectomy., RESULTS: All patients were completely free of cardiovascular events during the 8 years covered by the study. Among the postoperative complications the most serious was low cardiac output syndrome in 4 patients, which was treated successfully., CONCLUSIONS: Radiation-induced constrictive pericarditis is a clinical entity that should be taken into account in the differential diagnosis of oncological patients who show signs of heart failure. Surgery is the only effective treatment. The results are satisfactory, but always depend on associated damage to the myocardium as a result of radiation and on the underlying cancer.",Excluded
2090,"MR enterography in the investigation of unexplained abdominal pain. Introduction: Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE) has an established role in the management of patients with small bowel (SB) Crohn's disease (CD)1 and has the advantages of diagnosing extra-enteric lesions which may be clinically significant2 and being free from the risks of radiation exposure. There is little published data on the use of MRE in the investigation of patients with unexplained chronic abdominal pain. Method(s): A retrospective review of casenotes was conducted of patients who underwent MRE at Southend University Hospital to investigate unexplained abdominal pain and suspected SB disease between January 2008 and October 2010. The patients did not have a pre-existing diagnosis of CD made by colonoscopy or capsule endoscopy (CE). Demographic data, symptoms, previous investigations and final diagnosis were recorded. MRE was performed using a 1.5 Tesla MR scanner following a minimum 6-hour fast and preparation with Klean prep an hour prior to the scan. Two T2-weighted sequences single-shot fast spin-echo and fast imaging employing steady state acquisition were performed in the axial and coronal planes. Result(s): 181 patients (60 male, 121 female) underwent MRE: 43 also had diarrhoea, 14 weight loss and 13 vomiting. The median age was 39 years (range 13 - 85). MRE found clinically significant abnormalities in 33 patients (18.2%): 18/33 had a prior abdominal CT scan, MRE was used to clarify CT findings in 9/33. Findings are as follows: - 12 SB CD (3 CT suggestive) - 3 SB carcinoid tumour (1 CT suggestive, 1 CE suggestive) - 4 adhesional SB obstruction (2 CT abnormal) - 1 SB stricture - 1 gastric GIST - confirmed at resection (normal CT and gastroscopy) - 1 jejunal tumour - adenocarcinoma at resection (normal CT) - 1 duodenal mass with intussusception - villous adenoma at resection (OGD and CT suggestive) - 1 ovarian endometrioma and 1 renal cell carcinoma - confirmed at biopsy or resection - 1 peritoneal metastases - metastatic breast carcinoma at biopsy (CT: colonic thickening and free fluid) - 1 intussusception - 1 splenic mass (CT: splenic mass, granulomatous disease on resection) - 1 retroperitoneal nodes and splenomegaly (CT similar findings, further investigation hypogammaglobulinaemia) - 1 persistent vitello-intestinal cyst (CT normal, confirmed on resection) - 1 gallstones and cholecystitis - 1 PUJ obstruction (CT similar findings) - 1 colonic diverticular disease Conclusion(s): MRE is a useful investigation for unexplained chronic abdominal pain in patients not known to have CD.

OBJECTIVE: We determined the effect of reduced 80-kVp tube voltage on the radiation dose and image quality of coronary CT angiography (CTA) in patients with a normal body mass index (BMI)., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A prospective, multicenter, multivendor trial was performed of 208 consecutive patients with a normal BMI (< 25 kg/m(2)) who had been referred for coronary CTA and did not have a history of coronary revascularization. Patients were randomized to 80-kVp imaging (n = 103) or 100-kVp imaging (n = 105). Three blinded readers graded interpretability and image quality. Study signal, noise, and contrast were also compared., RESULTS: Imaging with 80 kVp instead of 100 kVp was associated with 47% lower median radiation dose (median dose-length product, 62.0 mGy . cm [interquartile range, 54.0-123.3 mGy . cm] vs 117.0 mGy . cm [110.0-225.9 mGy . cm], respectively; 0.9 mSv [0.8-1.7 mSv] vs 1.6 mSv [1.4-3.2 mSv]; p < 0.001 for each) with no significant difference in interpretability (99% vs 99%; p = 0.99) or image quality (median score, 4.0 [interquartile range, 3.6-4.0] vs 4.0 [interquartile range, 3.8-4.0]; p = 0.20). Studies obtained using 80 kVp were associated with 27% increased signal (mean +/- SD, 756 +/- 157 vs 594 +/- 105 HU; p < 0.001), 25% higher contrast (890 +/- 156 vs 709 +/- 108 HU; p < 0.001), and 50% greater noise (55 +/- 15 vs 37 +/- 12 HU; p < 0.001) with resultant 15% and 16% decreases in signal-to-noise (mean +/- SD, 15 +/- 5 vs 17 +/- 5; p < 0.001) and contrast-to-noise (mean +/- SD, 17 +/- 6 vs 21 +/- 5; p < 0.001) ratios, respectively., CONCLUSION: Coronary CTA using 80 kVp instead of 100 kVp was associated with a nearly 50% reduction in radiation dose with no significant difference in interpretability and noninferior image quality despite lower signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios. The use of 80-kVp tube voltage should be considered in dose-reduction strategies for coronary CTA of individuals with a normal BMI.",Excluded
3550,"Innate immune responses of Drosophila melanogaster are altered by spaceflight. Alterations and impairment of immune responses in humans present a health risk for space exploration missions. The molecular mechanisms underpinning innate immune defense can be confounded by the complexity of the acquired immune system of humans. Drosophila (fruit fly) innate immunity is simpler, and shares many similarities with human innate immunity at the level of molecular and genetic pathways. The goals of this study were to elucidate fundamental immune processes in Drosophila affected by spaceflight and to measure host-pathogen responses post-flight. Five containers, each containing ten female and five male fruit flies, were housed and bred on the space shuttle (average orbit altitude of 330.35 km) for 12 days and 18.5 hours. A new generation of flies was reared in microgravity. In larvae, the immune system was examined by analyzing plasmatocyte number and activity in culture. In adults, the induced immune responses were analyzed by bacterial clearance and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of selected genes following infection with E. coli. The RNA levels of relevant immune pathway genes were determined in both larvae and adults by microarray analysis. The ability of larval plasmatocytes to phagocytose E. coli in culture was attenuated following spaceflight, and in parallel, the expression of genes involved in cell maturation was downregulated. In addition, the level of constitutive expression of pattern recognition receptors and opsonins that specifically recognize bacteria, and of lysozymes, antimicrobial peptide (AMP) pathway and immune stress genes, hallmarks of humoral immunity, were also reduced in larvae. In adults, the efficiency of bacterial clearance measured in vivo following a systemic infection with E. coli post-flight, remained robust. We show that spaceflight altered both cellular and humoral immune responses in Drosophila and that the disruption occurs at multiple interacting pathways.",Excluded

1893,"Bone and joint modeling from 3D ankle MRI: Feasibility and comparisonwith radiographs and 2D MRI. Purpose: To evaluate feasibility of creating segmented joint models (bone surface reconstructed x-ray) from 3D isotropic ankle MRI, assess various angular and joint space measurements on models and compare with corresponding radiographs and 2D MRI measurements, and determine differences in time consumption for performing the measurements. Material(s) and Method(s): Under HIPPAA compliance, consecutive series of 27 subjects with 3D ankle MRI isotropic data sets (0.65 mm voxel, fast spin echo, proton density weighted sequence) performed on 3 T scanners were used. Three subjects with incomplete x-ray series were excluded. Thus, a total of 24 subjects, 11 left and 13 right ankles, were included in the study, of which 8 were male and 16 females. Age ranged from 17 to 73 with mean of 46 years. Segmented joint models (bone surface reconstructed x-rays) were created on all isotropic MR data sets by one observer. Three readers independently performed various blinded angular and joint space measurements on the models, corresponding 2D MRI, and radiographs (XR) at study inception and 8 weeks later. Means and standard deviations were calculated. Paired t-tests were performed for each pair (XR vs. 2D, XR vs. 3D and 2D vs. 3D) within each parameter. P values less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant and box plots were generated. Spearman correlation coefficient between measurements was performed to assess Inter-reader agreement. Interclass correlation and time difference analysis was performed. Result(s): 3D segmentation models resembling x-ray were successfully created in all cases within 20 (+/-5) minutes. Good agreement (ICC > 0.65) between all reader measurements was noted across all modalities with the exception of measuring the Talocural angle (3D, 2D, XR), talar pitch (3D), and tibibofibular clear space (2D), which showed weak to poor correlation. Time consumption was significantly greater (p < 0.05) on 2D vs 3D for all measurements except lateral clear space and medial tibiotalar concavity assessments. Time consumption was noted to be significantly greater (p < 0.05) on XR as compared to 3D for nearly half the measurements (5 of 11) for each reader. Conclusion(s): 3D bone and joint segmentation models resembling x-ray are feasible from isotropic ankle MRI data sets, which might lead to possibility of automated measurements by computer in future. While good correlation was noted between all readers, absolute measurement values were significantly different between modalities. The differences in absolute values is likely related to positioning variances (rotated x-ray mortise causing varied joint width, non-angle corrected 2D images, weight bearing vs non weight bearing, and the optimal positioning of reconstructed 3D image). Tighter collimation, a protocol variation, also limited evaluation in some cases by non-inclusion of reference points normally used with XR imaging and contributed to variance. Very good (ICC > 0.7) intrareader agreement was noted for most measurements with a few measurements showing moderate to good correlation (ICC > 0.5 to 0.65), Measurements on the 3D model of joint spaces was significantly faster when compared to 2D and generally faster than XR.",Excluded

2401,"A guide to mammography and other breast imaging procedures. Mammographic studies are performed for both diagnosis of breast disease and screening for cancer. Diagnostic mammography can demonstrate the presence of breast cancer in a symptomatic patient and more specifically, the size, location and extent of tumor. Mammographic screening involves examination of asymptomatic women in an attempt to detect breast cancer before it grows large enough to be palpable. The use of diagnostic mammography is well accepted due to the compelling clinical need for the information provided. The implementation of a mammographic screening program depends upon: (1) indication of a favorable benefit/risk ratio for the population being screened; (2) availability of suitably trained radiologists, medical physicists, and technologists and appropriate mammographic equipment subject to a vigorous QA program; and (3) acceptably low cost. Breast anatomy and function must be understood (Section 2) in order to design and utilize the mammographie techniques which will effectively detect and demonstrate breast cancer. The technique which is employed for the preponderance of mammography examinations is screen-film mammography with a grid. Good screen-film mammography requires dedicated equipment which can provide an appropriate soft x-ray beam (proper choice of operating potential, target, filter, window, HVL) (Section 3), proper compression, a target-film distance of suitable length for the given focal-spot size, and provision for vertical adjustment and mechanical rotation of the tube and image-receptor assembly for proper positioning (Section 2). The two views, which are recommended, are the CC and the MLO view (Section 2) which allow more visualization of the posterior glandular tissues, particularly in the auxiliary tail than a lateral view. The lateral view should also be employed whenever a nonpalpable lesion is discovered, in order to provide accurate three-dimensional localization. Screen-film mammography should be performed by a technologist who has had special training in compression and positioning techniques for the standard and special views used for mammography (ACR, 1999). Only an intensifying screen designed specifically for mammography should be used in combination with a suitable single-emulsion film (Section 3). The combination should be placed in low-absorption cassettes designed for mammography. There are many factors which affect image quality (Section 4). The three major components of image quality are contrast, sharpness and noise. Image quality can be optimized by suitable adjustment of the x-ray spectrum (operating potential, filtration, target material), breast compression, grids, imaging geometry (small focal spot, long target-film distance), choice of screens and films, and optimization of film-processing techniques. Image quality may be checked with suitable phantoms. Section 4 provides information to allow facilities to determine whether the particular combination of x-ray machine, compression devices, technique factors and image receptors in current use, or under consideration for use, for mammography will provide optimum image quality. A major objective of mammography dosimetry is to provide relevant information so that potential radiation risks from alternative techniques may be compared. For this purpose a single-valued dose"" per view for each technique, which corresponds reasonably well to the resulting carcinogenic potential, should be determined. This task involves consideration of tissue vulnerability to radiation effects, anatomy, technique and dosimetry. In addition, a unique dose value for each technique requires that the dose be determined for a fixed-reference breast composition with breast thickness stated. Simple computational models of the breast have been developed for estimation of mammographic dose. Several assumptions are implicit in these models relating to radiation risk, breast anatomy, and technique (Section 5). Three specific points are relevant to radiation risk: (1) breast glandular tissue is most vulnerable as compared with adipose, skin and areo ar tissues; (2) an average breast dose (namely, the mean glandular dose), rather than a maximum dose, is most useful in characterizing risk of carcinogenesis consistent with a linear dose-response relationship; and (3) the population of primary interest is women 40 y and older since younger women are likely to receive only diagnostic and baseline studies. This assumption that the population of primary interest is women 40 y and older limits application of the computational models to the older on average, more adipose breast, which helps justify certain simplifying assumptions. A major technique variable is the degree of compression employed. Firm compression, which is assumed in dose computations, greatly distorts the breast anatomy, making more rectangular the sagittal and transverse cross-sections of the volume that includes the glandular tissue. This greatly simplifies the breast geometry and makes the computational models more appropriate than otherwise would be the case (Section 5). The mean glandular dose (D<inf>g</inf>) meets the stated requirements outlined above. The computational model used in this Report for D<inf>g</inf> assumes that 0.5 cm thick adipose layers enclose a central ""glandular tissue"" containing a uniform mix of glandular and adipose tissues in roughly equal amounts. The procedure for estimating mean glandular dose for a specific population of patients is described in Table 4.3 (Approach II). A basic requirement for maintaining optimum image quality in mammography is implementation of a suitable QA program (Section 6). Each of the items contributing to image quality must be evaluated on a regular basis. The quality administration program (medical audit) evaluates the appropriateness and accuracy of image interpretation (Section 6.3). The benefit from screening by mammography and physical examination in the form of decreased breast cancer mortality has long been accepted for women above age 50 on the basis of a randomized trial (the HIP study, see Section 7), which indicated that the contribution of mammography to decreased breast cancer mortality was significant in older women. The randomized clinical trials of mammographic screening have not demonstrated a benefit for women age 40 to 49, within the first 7 y of starting screening. Those trials for which 10 or more years of follow-up is available, show evidence of a 23 percent benefit in reducing mortality. Although this reduction is smaller than that observed for older women, it is statistically significant and therefore, one can reject the possibility that this may have happened by chance. Compared with mammography practiced in the previous randomized trials, high-quality modern mammography could result in increased benefit. Even a very small benefit (e.g., one percent) more than offsets any risk of radiation-induced breast cancer. The benefit versus risk will be substantial, if analysis of ongoing screening experience demonstrates a reduction in breast cancer mortality rate of 30 percent or more. Among the various imaging methods designed to evaluate the breast for cancer, mammography is the most accurate and most widely used. It has gained clinical acceptance primarily because of its ability to detect a cancer before the tumor mass becomes large enough to be palpable, thereby permitting ""early"" diagnosis. It has also been proven an invaluable tool to distinguish benign from malignant lesions and can facilitate prompt biopsy of cancers, while encouraging clinical observation (rather than biopsy) of many benign masses. Other breast imaging methods have, thus far, been considered less successful; these include thermography, transillumination, ultrasonography, and MRI and MRS all of which do not utilize ionizing radiation. Computed tomography (Section 8.4) and digital mammography (Section 3.3) which use x rays, and therefore involve the potential risk of mammary carcinogenesis are being subjected to clinical investigation to determine their role in breast cancer diagnosis. Explanations of the principles of operation, a chronology of developments, an an extensive discussion of the limitations of each of these methods is contained in Sections 3.3 and 8.4.""",Excluded

Purpose/Objective(s): In recent years, helical tomotherapy has been used for total bone marrow irradiation for sparing of critical organs. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of intensity-modulated arc therapy (IMAT) for total bone marrow irradiation. Materials/Methods: Three patients who received total marrow irradiation with helical tomotherapy, two females and one male, were selected for this dosimetric study. Each patient had one CT scan with normal breathing from the skull to the mid-thigh, and two CT scans at the end of the expiration and inspiration phases. Contours for target volumes and normal organs were drawn to take into account breathing effects. The target volumes included the bone volume from the skull to the mid-thigh, lymph nodes, and spleen. 12 Gy in 8 fractions was prescribed to the target volumes. Varian RapidArc IMAT plans were generated with the same target volumes as the helical tomotherapy plans. For each patient, 23 normal structures were included in plan optimization, including all the major organs in the body. In helical tomotherapy plans, 5 cm jaw width was used. For IMAT planning, eight arc fields were used for each patient to cover the entire target volumes, with the isocenters aligned along the superior-inferior axis. Both the helical tomotherapy and IMAT plans were normalized to cover 85% of the bone volume by 12 Gy. Result(s): The average values of themean doses to the normal organswere 6.0 Gy, 6.0 Gy, and 5.8Gy in helical tomotherapy plans for the three patients; they were 4.8 Gy, 5.4 Gy, and 5.2 Gy, respectively, in IMAT plans. Of the 63 organs that could be compared pairwise, 43 had lower means using IMATand 17 had lowermeans using tomotherapy.Of the 40 organ pairs whose mean doses differed bymore than 10%, 33 had lower means in IMAT plans.D10 (theminimumdose level covering 10%of the volume) for the bone volume were 13.5 Gy, 13.1 Gy, and 13.5 Gy in helical tomotherapy plans for the three patients, respectively; they were 13.7 Gy, 14.4Gy, and 14.3Gy in IMAT plans. Comparable dose coveragewas achieved by IMAT plans for other target volumes. The average beam-on timewas 19.4minutes for helical tomotherapy and approximately 16 minutes for IMAT. Planning time excluding contouring was approximately 4h for each method. The average monitor unit (MU) in helical tomotherapy plans was 17,207 MU; it was 4,916 MU in IMAT plans. Conclusion(s): Compared to helical tomotherapy plans, IMAT plans showed consistent improvement in sparing of normal organs while delivering a somewhat less homogeneous dose to the target volumes for total bone marrow irradiation. This study indicates that IMAT can be used effectively for total bone marrow irradiation. With either treatment lower extremities are most efficiently treated with conventional open fields.",Excluded
1835,"Utility of cone beam computed tomography verification after stereoscopic kV localization in head and neck tumors treated by stereotactic body radiation therapy. Purpose/Objective(s): Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for tumors of the head and neck is an emerging technique gaining popularity as literature regarding its efficacy and safety continues to grow. At our institution, we utilize an x-ray 6D image-guided radiation therapy system (combined infrared-based optical positioning and stereoscopic kV pair localization) for patient positioning followed by soft tissue verification with cone beam CT (CBCT). Here, we identify the magnitude of correction based on CBCT verification after stereoscopic kV pair localization for various anatomic sites of the head and neck and identify subsites in which planning target volume (PTV) margins may be reduced or CBCT may be eliminated. Materials/Methods: The retrospective record was reviewed for patients undergoing SBRT for head and neck tumors between the dates of 6/1/15 and 12/31/15. Patients who received intra-fraction image guidance by stereoscopic kV pair imaging followed by CBCT verification were identified. The magnitude and direction of applied shifts based on CBCT imaging in the vertical, longitudinal, and lateral directions were recorded, from which the vector magnitude of each shift in three dimensions was calculated. Result(s): Thirty-three patients were treated with SBRT for head and neck pathology in the 6-month time period, of which 19 received stereoscopic kV pair localization followed by CBCT verification. For each of the 69 treatments delivered by this method, the vector magnitude was calculated for each shift. The average of these magnitudes was 1.77 mm >=1.75 mm (mean >= standard deviation). For skull base and cervical spine treatments (n = 41), the mean isocenter shift was 1.53 mm >= 1.41 mm, compared to 2.12 mm >= 2.12 mm for non-skull base, non-spine head and neck treatments (n = 28). Conclusion(s): Shifts based on soft tissue localization by CBCT after positioning by stereoscopic kV imaging were typically less than 2 mm for the head and neck treatments in this series, particularly in those treatments directed towards the skull base or cervical spine. For head and neck tumors treated with SBRT near bony anatomy, CBCT verification may not be necessary after stereoscopic kV localization provided that an additional 2 mm margin is added to the PTV in quadrature.",Excluded
2365,"Radiotherapy for primary carcinoma of the trachea. Between 1940 and 1985, 24 cases of primary carcinoma of the trachea were registered at the London Regional Cancer Centre. The most common presenting symptoms were hoarseness, haemoptysis and cough. Twenty patients had epidermoid carcinoma and four had adenoid cystic carcinoma. Because of different clinical behaviours, the two histologies were separately analyzed. Of the 20 patients with epidermoid carcinoma, 19 received radiotherapy as primary treatment and one patient did not receive radiotherapy because of advanced disease. Radiation doses ranged from 4000 to 6000 cGy and most patients had megavoltage irradiation. Treatment result was disappointing. Only one patient remained disease-free at 15-month follow-up and all other patients had persistent or recurrent tracheal tumour. Median survival for all 20 patients was 5 months (range 1 to 19 months). Of the four patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma, two had primary surgery and postoperative radiotherapy and two had primary radiotherapy. Two patients died of disease, at 5 months and 8 years from diagnosis. Two surviving patients had 15-month follow-up: one had persistent disease and the other was free from recurrence. In this study, radiotherapy within the range of doses given was found to be an ineffective primary treatment for tracheal carcinoma.",Excluded
902,"Rotational muscle flaps for high-grade soft tissue sarcomas around the knee provide great function. INTRODUCTION: Our study aims to assess the functional outcomes related to resection of musculoskeletal tumors arising around the knee and coverage using rotational muscle flaps, especially the gastrocnemius muscle flap. METHOD(S): We retrospectively analyzed the charts of 5 patients from 2008 to 2015 who underwent surgery for soft tissue sarcomas arising around the knee and were treated with rotational muscle flaps. At final follow-up, all patients were evaluated using the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) scoring system. Local tumor control, survival, and complications were also recorded. RESULT(S): Average length of follow-up was 24.8 months (range: 5-77 months). MSTS score at final follow-up was 30 for all patients. All patients are currently alive, disease free, pain free, have excellent range of motion (at least 0 to 120 degrees) of the knee, and have unlimited ambulatory capacity without an assist device. All patellas tracked normally. All flaps and skin grafts healed without complications. There were no infections and no instances of chronic edema. There were no local recurrences, complications, or amputations. CONCLUSION(S): Our small cohort of patients who underwent rotational muscle flaps and transfers after resections around the knee have excellent functional outcomes and virtually normal active range of motion. We highly recommend local muscle rotational flaps to protect the bone and joint, augment function, and reduce complication rates when resection results in bare bone, exposed knee joint, or exposed neurovascular structures, especially when performed in conjunction with radiation exposure. The medial and lateral gastrocnemius muscles are reliable sources for these local muscle flaps.",Excluded
2084,"Clinical and radiographic analysis of unilateral versus bilateral instrumented one-level lateral lumbar interbody fusion. Lateral lumbar interbody fusion (LLIF) is a widely applied and useful procedure for spinal surgeries. However, posterior fixation has not yet been decided. We compared the radiographic and clinical outcomes of unilateral versus bilateral instrumented one-level LLIF for degenerative lumbar disease. We conducted a prospective cohort study of 100 patients, who underwent unilateral (group U) or bilateral (group B) instrumented one-level LLIF for degenerative lumbar disease. Forty-one patients in group U were undergoing unilateral pedicle screw instrumentation, and 59 patients in group B were undergoing bilateral pedicle screw instrumentation. Clinical characteristic and demographic data before surgery were compared. The intraoperative data, including operative time with changes in positions, intraoperative blood loss, and X-ray exposure time, as well as the perioperative data, including postoperative hospital stay and clinical and radiographic data were compared. As a result, Group U required a significantly shorter operating time than group B. The subsidence grade and fusion rates exhibited no significant differences in the postoperative radiographic evaluation. Group U had better results in clinical assessments than group B. However, group U required more additional surgeries owing to complications.",Excluded
340,"Thyroid and parathyroid function in long-term survivors of stem cell transplantation after 10-14Gy total body irradiation. Thyroid and parathyroid dysfunction are well described complications of irradiation to the neck. In this study we have evaluated the incidence of thyroid and parathyroid dysfunction in long term survivors of SCT attending a dedicated haematology/ endocrine follow-up clinic. All patients were transplanted for haematological malignancy and had total body irradiation (TBI) as part of their pre-transplant conditioning regimen. 76 patients (37 female) were investigated a median of 18 years post SCT (range 8-29). The median dose of TBI was 12Gy (range 10-14) given in conjunction with cyclophosphamide. 61 patients were treated for CML and 15 patients were treated for acute leukemia. 21 out of 76 patients (28%) developed hypothyroidism and there were no cases of hyperthyroidism. Among male patients the prevalence was 26% compared to <1% in normal populations. Among women the prevalence was 30% compared to a normal prevalence of 0.1-2%. The median time after SCT that hypothyroidism developed was 13 years but the range was wide at 4.5-24 years. None of our patients had laboratory evidence of hypoparathyroidism (low calcium with inappropriately non-elevated PTH). 16 patients had a raised PTH level. Of these, 12/16 had a calcium level in the lower end of the normal range (2.16-2.4 mmol/l) making primary hyperparathyroidism unlikely. The majority (11/12) of these patients had low vitamin D levels making secondary hyperparathyroidism the most likely diagnosis. Of four patients with elevated PTH and calcium levels >2.4 mmol/ l, none had convincing evidence of primary hyperparathyroidism. One patient had renal impairment and secondary/tertiary hyperparathyroidism; a second was taking bendrofluazide; a third was vitamin D deficient. A fourth patient was hypocalciuric with a 24 hour urinary calcium/creatinine ratio <0.01; this excludes primary hyperparathyroidism and makes the diagnosis of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia likely. In summary, there was a high prevalence of hypothyroidism (28%) among our patients. Conversely there were no cases of primary hyperparathyroidism or hypoparathyroidism but longer follow up will be necessary to clarify the effect of these doses of TBI on parathyroid function. Secondary hyperparathyroidism was frequent, particularly in association with low vitamin D levels. We conclude that indefinite surveillance is needed to identify thyroid dysfunction after SCT and vitamin D levels should be part of routine annual follow up investigations.",Excluded
1791,"Capacity of primary hospitals for diabetes treatment in six Chinese provinces: A cross-sectional survey. Background Establishment of a hierarchical medical system is one of the major tasks outlined in China's ambitious health reform, and the ultimate success of this system depends on the treatment capacity of primary hospitals. Among the priorities of primary hospitals is the provision of quality services for chronic diseases, including diabetes, atypical and epidemic chronic disease in China. We aimed to estimate the capacity of primary hospitals for diabetes treatment in six Chinese provinces. Methods We did a cross-sectional survey in China using qualitative and quantitative methods. First, we interviewed 24 related experts (five primary hospital principals, six general practitioner, five drug experts, five medical device experts, two clinical experts, and one health system expert) to establish the capacity standard of primary hospital for diabetes treatment in the hierarchical medical system. Next, we surveyed the treatment capacity with regards to human resources, drug supply, and medical equipment in 28 primary hospitals (17 urban and 11 rural) in six provinces in China (Shanghai, Fujian, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, and Guizhou) between May 20 and July 12, 2016. Finally, we compared the survey results against the standard. We adopted purposive sampling, and used chi2 test and rank sum test for data analyses. Ethics approval was granted by Sichuan University, and all participants provided oral informed consent. Findings The primary hospitals surveyed had a mean of 1.76 general practitioners (SD 2.03) per million residents. The mean number of general practitioners per million residents was 1.48 (1.18) for rural hospitals and 1.92 (2.41) for urban hospitals, which were lower than the standard (2-3, based on the expert interviews and policy review). 11 (65%) urban primary hospitals provided three or more types of drugs, compared with four (36%) rural primary hospitals. Urban primary hospitals had a mean of 8.35 (SD 4.44) types of diabetes drugs and rural ones had 4.45 (3.33), although expert interviews and policy reviews indicated that primary hospitals need provide seven types of drugs that are often used in the clinic. 27 (96%) primary hospitals provided metformin, 26 (93%) sulfonylureas, 18 (64%) alphaglucosidase inhibitors, 16 (57%) insulin, 15 (54%) hypoglycaemic proprietary Chinese medicine, 11 (39%) glinides, and nine (32%) thiazolidinediones; newer antidiabetic drugs such as DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, and GLP-1 receptor agonists were scarcely supplied. All 28 primary hospitals were equipped with blood glucose meters, blood pressure instruments, and electrocardiograph machines; 25 (89%) had biochemical analysers, 27 (96%) B ultrasound machines, 20 (71%) colour Doppler ultrasound machines and x-ray machines, and eight (29%) fundus mirrors, while expert interviews showed that primary hospitals should have with all of these equipment. No significant difference in availability of medical equipment was recorded between rural and urban primary hospitals (p>0.05). Interpretation Primary hospitals in China, especially those in rural areas, do not have sufficient human resources and drugs for diabetes treatment, although they generally have adequate medical equipment. Strategies to enhance the capacity of primary hospitals for diabetes treatment need to increase the number of health-care workers and drug supply.",Excluded
3446,"Is the paradise in the Caribbean? Prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in HIV+ patients treated at a clinic in Puerto Rico. Background: Existent studies have demonstrated that HIV+ population suffer from low bone density, increasing their risk of fractures, which has been linked to the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and even HIV itself. Currently, there aren't studies published regarding vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency in HIV+ patients in the Caribbean (latitude 18degree00N 66degree37W). Our hypothesis is that HIV+ patients with or without HAART who live in the Caribbean have 25-hydroxyvitamin D severe deficiency (<=25 nmol/l), deficiency (<=50 nmol/l) or insufficiency (>50 nmol/l <=75 nmol/l). Methodology: A retrospective chart review was conducted among files from HIV+ adults >49 year managed at private clinic. A data collection tool was designed to gather demographic characteristics (age, gender, race/ethnicity), vitamin D levels, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), viral load, CD4 cell count, 25-OHD levels, time with HIV infection (date of diagnosis), AIDS defining illness, current or former IVDU, tobacco use, current ARV therapy (PI or NNRTI based), time on ARV (number of years since first ARV regimen), co-morbid conditions, multivitamin use, vitamin D supplementation used and dose, and other medications. Result(s): All patients were Hispanic, 62.8% men, and mean age was 57 years. Twenty-two patients (51%) had deficient/insufficient vitamin D levels vs 21 patients (49%) who had normal vitamin D levels. Among patients with vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency, 95.5% were taking ART; 68% were on a PI based regimen, and 32% on a non-PI based regimen. Eighteen patients (82%) with deficient/insufficient vitamin D levels had a BMI<30 vs 4 patients (18%) with a BMI>30. Ten patients (46%) with deficient/insufficient levels had a total daily intake of <=800 IU of vitamin D vs 6 patients (27%) which were taking a total daily intake of >800 IU of vitamin D; 6 (27%) patients with deficient/ insufficient levels were not taking any vitamin D supplementation. Four patients (18%) with deficiency/ insufficiency were currently smokers. Fifteen patients (68%) with deficiency/insufficiency had been infected for 1-10 years, 7 patients (32%) had been infected for more than 11 years. Conclusion(s): Inadequate vitamin D levels were highly prevalent among HIV+ patients treated at a clinic in the Caribbean. Although, location of the population is in the Caribbean, were there is no difference in the solar radiation between seasons, less than 50% of the HIV population had the sufficient vitamin D levels. Even in patients using more than 400 IU of vitamin D level per day, more than 50% of them had inadequate vitamin D levels. Additional studies in this area are needed to determine the necessary amount of vitamin D for the HIV infected patients to maintain sufficient vitamin D levels.",Excluded
2071,"Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and a dosimetric factor for predicting symptomatic radiation pneumonitis in non-small-cell lung cancer patients treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy. OBJECTIVES: To identify the factors that predict the progression of radiological radiation pneumonitis (RP) to symptomatic RP, and to evaluate the usefulness of the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as a marker of RP severity and prognosis in stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 61 patients treated between January 2010 and December 2015. Patients' demographic characteristics, clinical data, laboratory findings and treatment parameters were analyzed to determine the predictive factors associated with progression from radiological RP to symptomatic RP., RESULTS: Forty-seven patients (77%) exhibited radiological RP at a median of 78 days after radiation therapy (RT) completion, and 15 (32%) of these patients developed symptomatic RP. The interval between RT completion and radiological RP presentation was shorter in patients who progressed to symptomatic RP (P = .001); progression was highly probable if this latency period was <=2 months (P = .002). Stage and RT technique correlated with symptomatic RP development (P = .046 and P = .046, respectively). Among dosimetric factors, a V20 (defined as the lung volume receiving >=20 Gy) of >30% was the most significant predictor of symptomatic RP (P = .001). The NLR and C-reactive protein level at radiological RP were higher in patients who developed symptomatic RP (P = .067 and P = .012, respectively). On multivariate analysis, a V20 >30% and an NLR at radiological RP >6 were associated with symptomatic RP development., CONCLUSION: The NLR at radiological RP is a useful biomarker for predicting symptomatic RP development after CCRT in stage III NSCLC patients.

3489,"Factors influencing aversion to specific electrodiagnostic studies. Objective: To compare the degree of discomfort caused by nerve conduction studies (NCS) versus needle electromyography (EMG), and to determine what factors predict aversion to one test or the other. Method(s): Two hundred patients underwent both EMG and NCS, and were asked to indicate which test was more uncomfortable. Responses were then correlated with demographic information, testing characteristics, and medical histories to identify any notable associations. Result(s): Of the 200 patients, 58.5% (117) of the patients found the NCS more uncomfortable than EMG. Sixty-one percent (11/18) of the younger patients (18-29 years old) found EMG more uncomfortable (P = 0.08), whereas 68% (40/59) of the older patients (age greater than 60 years old) found NCS more uncomfortable (P = 0.05). Sixty-seven percent (14/21) of the patients whose BMI was less than 22 kg/m2 rated EMG as more uncomfortable (P = 0.01). Sixty-nine percent (27/39) of the patients whose BMI was greater than or equal to 38 found the NCS more uncomfortable (P = 0.02). A positive correlation existed between NCS discomfort and number of nerves tested. 67% (35/52) of the patients with polyneuropathy found NCS more uncomfortable. Conclusion(s): Nerve conduction studies are more uncomfortable than needle EMG in the majority of patients, and predictions regarding which test will be more uncomfortable for a given patient are possible. Nerve conduction studies are more uncomfortable than needle EMG for most patients, and predictions regarding which test will be more uncomfortable for a given patient are possible.Copyright © 2014 The Authors.

2962,"Thyroid function is not associated with brown adipose tissue volume and 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in young euthyroid adults. PURPOSE: Thyroid hormones (THs) are important mediators of brown adipose tissue (BAT) differentiation. However, the association of TH concentrations with human BAT is unclear. The present work examines the associations between circulating thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and THs concentrations (i.e. free tri-iodothyronine, FT3, and free thyroxine, FT4), under thermoneutral [22-23C] and cold-induced conditions, and BAT volume, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) uptake and mean radiodensity. METHOD(S): A total of 106 young healthy, euthyroid adults (34 men/72 women; 22.0 +/- 2.1 years old; 24.9 +/- 4.6 kg/m2) participated in this cross-sectional study. BAT volume, 18F-FDG uptake and mean radiodensity were assessed after 2 h of personalized (i.e., contemplating each individual's shivering threshold) cold exposure via positron emission tomography/computerized tomography (PET/CT) static scanning. TSH and THs levels were determined before (thermoneutral) and 1 h after the cold exposure. RESULT(S): Cold exposure increased circulating FT4 (P=0.038) and reduced of TSH levels (P<=0.001). Conversely, the FT3 serum concentration was not modified by cold exposure (P=0.435). No associations were found between the TSH and THs thermoneutral (all P>0.289) or cold-induced levels (all P>0.067) and BAT volume,18F-FDG uptake and mean radiodensity. These findings were independent of sex and body mass index. CONCLUSION(S): Thyroid function is modulated by cold exposure, yet it is not associated with BAT volume or glucose metabolism assessed after 2h of cold exposure in young healthy, euthyroid adults.",Excluded

2132,"The effect of electromagnetic field emitted by a mobile phone on the inhibitory control of saccades. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether exposure to a pulsed high-frequency electromagnetic field (pulsed EMF) emitted by a mobile phone has short-term effects on the inhibitory control of saccades., METHODS: A double-blind, counterbalanced crossover study design was employed. We assessed the performance of 10 normal subjects on antisaccade (AS) and cued saccade (CUED) tasks as well as two types of overlap saccade (OL1, OL2) task before and after 30 min of exposure to EMF emitted by a mobile phone or sham exposure., RESULTS: After EMF or sham exposure, we observed a slight but significant shortening of latency in the CUED and OL2 tasks. AS amplitude decreased as well as the saccade velocities in the AS, CUED, and OL1 tasks after exposure. These changes occurred regardless of whether exposure was real or sham. The frequencies of pro-saccades in the AS task, saccades to cue in the CUED task, and prematurely initiated saccades in the overlap (OL2) task did not change significantly after real or sham EMF exposure., CONCLUSIONS: Thirty minutes of mobile phone exposure has no significant short-term effect on the inhibitory control of saccades., SIGNIFICANCE: The cortical processing responsible for saccade inhibition is not affected by exposure to EMF emitted by a mobile phone.

808,"Using low pressure, NPWT for wound preparation & the management of split-thickness skin grafts in 3 patients with complex wound. The use of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is well established in the management of hard-to-heal wounds. One institution, familiar with NPWT's capabilities as well as its shortcomings (eg, pain at dressing changes and pain with the maximum recommended setting of 125 mm Hg), sought a viable alternative. A low pressure, negative pressure wound therapy (LP-NPWT) system, using subatmospheric pressure levels of 75 mm Hg and a low-adherence dressing, was evaluated to prepare the wound bed for split-thickness skin graft (STSG) on three patients. One patient was a healthy 23-year-old man with extensive trauma-related soft tissue wounds. The two women--54 and 47 years old--had multiple comorbidities. One had a lower extremity fasciotomy wound and the other had a dehisced surgical wound with a history of irradiation. Wound area was reduced >60% in all three wounds in 3 to 6 weeks as new granulation tissue developed. The average pain reported was moderate (4 to 5 on a Visual Analogue Scale), ranging from 2 to 10 during dressing changes to 1 to 7 between dressing changes; pain levels reported tended to decrease as therapy progressed. Little or no trauma on dressing removal and no signs of infection were noted. In all cases, STSGs, followed by 4 days of LP-NPWT were applied and all wounds healed. The results from these three cases suggest that the LP-NPWT system is a useful healing adjunct for complex wound bed preparation and graft management. Clinical studies to quantify the effects of LP-NPWT technology and compare its safety and efficacy to other negative pressure systems are needed.",Excluded

Objectives: To compare single-energy (SECT) and dual-energy (DECT) abdominal CT examinations in matched patient cohorts regarding differences in radiation dose and image quality performed with second- and third-generation dual-source CT (DSCT). Method(s): We retrospectively analysed 200 patients (100 male, 100 female; mean age 61.2 +/- 13.5 years, mean body mass index 27.5 +/- 3.8 kg/m2) equally divided into four groups matched by gender and body mass index, who had undergone portal venous phase abdominal CT with second-generation (group A, 120-kV-SECT; group B, 80/140-kV-DECT) and third-generation DSCT (group C, 100-kV-SECT; group D, 90/150-kV-DECT). The radiation dose was normalised for 40-cm scan length. Dose-independent figure-of-merit (FOM) contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were calculated for various organs and vessels. Subjective overall image quality and reader confidence were assessed. Result(s): The effective normalised radiation dose was significantly lower (P < 0.001) in groups C (6.2 +/- 2.0 mSv) and D (5.3 +/- 1.9 mSv, P = 0.103) compared to groups A (8.8 +/- 2.3 mSv) and B (9.7 +/- 2.4 mSv, P = 0.102). Dose-independent FOM-CNR peaked for liver, kidney, and portal vein measurements (all P <= 0.0285) in group D. Subjective image quality and reader confidence were consistently rated as excellent in all groups (all >=1.53 out of 5). Conclusion(s): With both DSCT generations, abdominal DECT can be routinely performed without radiation dose penalty compared to SECT, while third-generation DSCT shows improved dose efficiency. Key Points: * Dual-source CT (DSCT) allows for single- and dual-energy image acquisition. * Dual-energy acquisition does not increase the radiation dose in abdominal DSCT. * Third-generation DSCT shows improved dose efficiency compared to second-generation DSCT. * Dose-independent figure-of-merit image contrast was highest with third-generation dual-energy DSCT. * Third-generation DSCT shows improved dose efficiency for SECT and DECT.Copyright © 2016, European Society of Radiology.",Excluded

Objective: To review the therapeutic strategy in Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) treated with radiotherapy (RT) discussed in a multidisciplinary tumour board. Method(s): Clinical records of patients with a diagnosis of MCC and with an indication to undergo RT at the European Institute of Oncology between 2003 and 2018 were reviewed retrospectively. Result(s): Twenty-six patients were included in the analysis (median age 65 years, range 42-87). Nineteen received adjuvant RT, 4 exclusive RT, and the remainder palliative RT. Intensity-modulated RT was used in 13 cases, a 3D conformal technique in 11 cases, and stereotactic RT in 2 cases. No major toxicities were recorded. The median relapse-free survival (RFS) after adjuvant RT was 20.5 months, while for unknown primary MCC, it was 23 months. In the adjuvant setting, median polyomavirus-positive RFS was 21.5 months (range 1-49) and median polyomavirus-negative RFS was only 14 months (range 4-45). Overall, RFS of polyomavirus-positive and polyomavirus-negative patients was 10.5 and 8 months, respectively. After adjuvant RT, only 1 out of 10 patients had a recurrence in the RT field. At the time of data collection, 16 patients were alive with no evidence of disease, 1 patient was alive with advanced status of disease, 8 patients died of disease progression, and 1 patient died of other causes. Conclusion(s): The management of unknown primary and polyomavirus-positive cases, which had a better prognosis in our series, may benefit from a multidisciplinary approach, given the limited data available regarding optimal treatment.Copyright © Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori 2020.",Excluded

All patients were subjected to x-ray and MRI of the hip and, during the first examination in our surgery, a hip echography using the Migliore-Tormenta technique. The rehabilitation protocol consisted of a combination of Manual Therapy and Physical Exercises and started at the moment of the first injection. The program lasted 6 weeks and each patient was treated once or twice a week. The goal of the program was to increase mobility, strength, and control of the hip joint. Outcome Measures: At the beginning of the study we evaluated active and passive hip range of motion (ROM) and the general joint functions through functional movements tests (Step Up, Trendelemburg Test, Deep Squat Test) and special tests (FABER Test, Ober Test, Thomas Test, Compression Test, Hip Prone Extension Test). After the initial evaluation we worked out an individual treatment protocol for each patient, focusing on the treatment of their own dysfunctions. Manual Therapy treatment consisted of a combination of soft tissue manipulation, myofascial stretching, and mobilization and/or manipulation techniques targeting movement limitations. Each Manual Therapy session lasted from 30 to 45 minutes. After the Manual Therapy treatment patients performed physical exercises consisting of joint mobility, followed by strength and neuromuscular control exercises. We used elastic resistance exercises, core training, balance training, and gait exercises. Patients were recommended to continue the entire exercise program at home between the physiotherapy sessions. At the end of the program we suggested that patients continue exercises at home in order to maintain the results, and to undergo a Manual Therapy session each month. Result(s): Patients who had HA injections combined with Manual Therapy and Exercise Therapy showed a greater reduction in pain VAS (.68%) than patients that had only HA injections (,49%). Regarding the functional state of the hip joint, patients treated with the combination of HA injections and rehabilitation showed a decrease of Lequesne index values (.58%) compared to patients who had only injections (35%). Conclusion(s): Our findings show that the combination of intra-articular injections of HA under ultrasound guide together with Manual Therapy associated with Exercise Therapy seems to be a better solution than HA Injection only in the conservative treatment of patients with hip osteoarthritis.",Excluded

A study was conducted at Department of Anatomy, Basic Medical Sciences Institute, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) Karachi, to investigate the distribution of epidermal melanin with respect to age and ethnic groups in Pakistan and intensity of epidermal melanin under ultraviolet radiation among the inhabitants population of Karachi. Epidermal melanin in 5mum thick vertical paraffin embedded sections of eighty human skin samples were studied with light microscopy from different age and ethnic groups with schmort technique. The quantity of epidermal melanin diminished as the age advanced. There was no significant difference among different ethnic groups in Pakistan, and the amount of epidermal melanin was significantly higher in exposed than in unexposed parts of body among the population of Karachi. The distribution of epidermal melanin appeared to be inversely proportional to the advancing age, it remained constant among different ethnic groups of Pakistan, but the intensity was significantly higher in exposed than in unexposed parts of body among Karachiites.",Excluded
998,"Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia-a diagnostic enigma!. LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1: Recognize the clinical features of Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2: Discuss the management of Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. CASE: In 2019, an 87-year-old Caucasian male with a history of chronic back pain presented to his primary care doctor's office with a chief complaint of low back pain. In 2004, an X-ray of the lumbosacral spine revealed mild lumbar spondylosis. His back pain began after bending over to pick up his wife. He denied recent trauma, fevers, chills, intravenous drug use, unexplained weight loss, history of malignancy, saddle anesthesia, bowel or bladder incontinence or progressive weakness. He was referred to pain medicine for consideration of steroid injection. MRI lumbar spine was ordered which showed a pathologic compression fracture of L4 with abnormal bone marrow involvement of the left iliac wing. MRI cervical, thoracic spine and CT chest, abdomen and pelvis were ordered to work up malignancy. CT was without metastatic disease. Repeat MRI showed diffuse heterogeneous bone marrow signal concerning for an infiltrating process. The patient was referred to oncology clinic. His father passed away from lymphoma. Physical exam revealed a well appearing male without adenopathy or midline spinal tenderness. Labs showed WBC 7.2, Hb 15.1, platelet count 250, monocytes elevated to 1.0. IgM was elevated to 1,694 while IgG and IgA levels were decreased. 24-hour urine protein collection was negative. Bone marrow biopsy showed CD5 negative/CD10 negative B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder involving approximately 35% of the marrow cellularity. The differential included marrow involvement by a B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma such as lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (favored by the presence of IgM monoclonal gammopathy) and marginal zone lymphoma. The MYD88 L265P mutation was negative. IMPACT/DISCUSSION: Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia is a rare clinicopathologic entity demonstrating bone marrow infiltration by lymphoplasmacytic cells and a serum IgM gammopathy. Elderly, white males are more commonly affected with an annual incidence of 3-4 persons per million. Symptoms are due to the infiltration of lymphoplasmacytic cells in the bone marrow and IgM gammopathy of the blood. Milder symptoms can be secondary to anemia and organomegaly, while more severe symptoms can be due to CNS involvement and hyperviscosity syndrome. Diagnosis is made by monoclonal IgM gammopathy and a bone marrow biopsy demonstrating greater than 10% infiltration by small lymphocytes with a typical immunophenotype. The differential diagnosis includes IgM MGUS, CLL, marginal zone lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma. Asymptomatic patients are managed by observation alone while symptomatic patients are treated with chemotherapy. CONCLUSION(S): * Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia is a rare clinicopathologic entity demonstrating bone marrow infiltration by lymphoplasmacytic cells and a serum IgM gammopathy. * Asymptomatic patients can be managed by observation alone while symptomatic patients are treated with chemotherapy.",Excluded
483,"Is final TNM staging a predictor for survival in locally advanced rectal cancer after preoperative chemoradiation therapy?. Background: Neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy has improved the local control rate and overall survival in locally advanced rectal cancers. The purpose of this retrospective study is to evaluate the correlation between the final pathologic stage and survival in these patients. Method(s): Patients with biopsy-proven rectal carcinoma, pretreatment staging by magnetic resonance imaging such as T3 or T4 tumors, or node-positive disease were treated with preoperative concomitant 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy and radiation, followed by radical surgical resection. Clinical outcome with survival, disease-free survival, recurrence rate, and local recurrence rate were compared with each T and N findings using the American Joint Committee on Cancer Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) staging system. Result(s): A total of 248 patients were enrolled in this study. Overall survival and disease-free survival at 1, 3, and 5 years were 97.1, 92, and 89.9% and 87.5, 71.1, and 69.5%, respectively. Thirty-six patients (14.5%) had a pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant therapy. The recurrence rate was significantly different between the pathologic complete response group and residual group (5.6 vs 31.1%; P = .002). Five-year disease-free survival was significantly better in the complete response group than the residual tumor group (93 vs 66%; P = .0045). There was no statistical difference in survival or locoregional recurrence rate between these two groups. Conclusion(s): Posttreatment pathologic TNM stage is correlated to disease-free survival and tumor recurrence rate in locally advanced rectal cancer after preoperative chemoradiation. Also, pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant treatment has its oncologic benefit in both overall recurrence and disease-free survival. © 2007 Society of Surgical Oncology.",Excluded
2049,"Radiotherapy of the neuroaxis for palliative treatment of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. Background: Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis occurs in about 5% of solid tumors and may seriously compromise quality of life. Aim of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility of craniospinal irradiation with and without intrathecal chemotherapy and its efficacy with regard to symptom palliation and survival Patients and Methods: 16 patients (mean age 46 years; nine breast cancers, five lung cancers, one renal cell cancer, one tumor of unknown primary site) with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis occurring after a median interval from primary tumor diagnosis of 5 months (0-300 months) received craniospinal irradiation between October 1995 and May 2000. The median total dose was 36 Gy (a 1.6-2.0 Gy). Ten patients were additionally treated with intrathecal methotrexate (15 mg per cycle, 2-8 cycles). Result(s): Median survival was 12 weeks, 8 weeks after radiotherapy alone, 16 weeks after combined modality treatment. 14 patients died from disease. Eleven patients (68%) experienced regression of their neurological symptoms during or soon after completion of radiotherapy. Seven patients regained their ability to walk, six had pain reduction, three regression of bladder and bowel incontinence. In three patients symptom progression and in two patients no change occurred. Side effects were: myelo-suppression (CTC) Grade I: n = 2, Grade II: n = 4, Grade III: n = 4 patients and Grade IV: n = 1. Nine patients had dysphagia, seven mucositis, three suffered from nausea. No late toxicity was observed. Conclusion(s): Craniospinal radiotherapy is feasible and effective for palliative treatment of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. As far as the small patient number permits any definite conclusions, combined modality treatment seems superior to irradiation alone.",Excluded
1301,"Lung cancer-current clinical profile and diagnostic challenges. Background: Lung cancer is the most common cancer in men worldwide. The incidence continues to rise in both males and females with wide geographical variability. Lung cancer has a high fatality rate. Early detection of lung cancer has better treatment outcome as early lung cancers can be operated. But the diagnosis of lung cancer is delayed due to many factors. Aims and Objectives: The aim of this study was to analyze the current clinico-pathological profile and epidemiological trends in lung cancer patients from a single tertiary care centre with emphasis on given on gender association and delay in detection due to misdiagnosis as tuberculosis Material(s) and Method(s): A retrospective analysis of the data of in-patients diagnosed as Primary lung cancer in the department of pulmonary medicine at SDSTRC& Rajiv Gandhi institute of chest diseases, Bengaluru, Karnataka from August 2015 to September 2017. Result(s): Lung cancer study is still a disease predominant in old age males. Smoking is one of the major causative factors. In Non smokers, females and young age group (<40yrs) adenocarcinoma was commoner than squammous cell carcinoma.17 patients (16.5%) were mis-diagnosed as tuberculosis before the definitive diagnosis was made. Conclusion(s): Due to widespread prevalence of tuberculosis, lung cancer poses a diagnostic challenge. A significant number of lung cancer patients in our country still continue to be misdiagnosed as tuberculosis. Poor diagnostic resources and economic constraints along with low clinical suspicion lead to delay in diagnosis of lung cancer resulting in poor prognosis and survival.Copyright © 2018 Bentham Science Publishers.",Excluded
1180,"Cardiac exposure in the dynamic conformal arc therapy, intensity-modulated radiotherapy and volumetric modulated arc therapy of lung cancer. Purpose: To retrospectively evaluate the cardiac exposure in three cohorts of lung cancer patients treated with dynamic conformal arc therapy (DCAT), intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), or volumetricmodulated arc therapy (VMAT) at our institution in the past seven years. Methods and Materials: A total of 140 lung cancer patients were included in this institutional review board approved study: 25 treated with DCAT, 70 with IMRT and 45 with VMAT. All plans were generated in a same commercial treatment planning system and have been clinically accepted and delivered. The dose distribution to the heart and the effects of tumor laterality, the irradiated heart volume and the beam-to-heart distance on the cardiac exposure were investigated. Result(s): The mean dose to the heart among all 140 plans was 4.5 Gy. Specifically, the heart received on average 2.3, 5.2 and 4.6 Gy in the DCAT, IMRT and VMAT plans, respectively. The mean heart doses for the left and right lung tumors were 4.1 and 4.8 Gy, respectively. No patients died with evidence of cardiac disease. Three patients (2%) with preexisting cardiac condition developed cardiac disease after treatment. Furthermore, the cardiac exposure was found to increase linearly with the irradiated heart volume while decreasing exponentially with the beam-to-heart distance. Conclusion(s): Compared to old technologies for lung cancer treatment, modern radiotherapy treatment modalities demonstrated better heart sparing. But the heart dose in lung cancer radiotherapy is still higher than that in the radiotherapy of breast cancer and Hodgkin's disease where cardiac complications have been extensively studied. With strong correlations of mean heart dose with beam-to-heart distance and irradiated heart volume, cautions should be exercised to avoid long-term cardiac toxicity in the lung cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy.Copyright © 2015 Ming et al.

1189,"Dynamic visual acuity during walking after long-duration spacefl ight. Introduction: Astronauts experience alterations in gaze control as a result of adaptive changes in eye-head coordination produced by microgravity exposure. This may lead to potential changes in postfl ight visual acuity during head and body motion. Method(s): We gathered dynamic visual acuity (DVA) data from 14 astronauts and cosmonauts after longduration (~6 mo) stays in space. Walking was used to induce self-motion and visual acuity was determined by sequentially presenting Landolt ring optotypes on a computer display placed 4 m in front of subjects. Acuity assessments were made while seated (static condition) and walking (dynamic condition) at 6.4 km . h-1 on a motorized treadmill. In each condition, a psychophysical threshold detection algorithm minimized the required number of optotype presentations by maximizing the amount displayed around the subject's acuity threshold. The difference between static and dynamic acuity measures provided a metric of change in the subjects' ability to maintain gaze fi xation on the visual target while walking. Result(s): A decrement in postfl ight visual acuity during walking was found. A mean dynamic acuity decrement of approximately 0.75 eye-chart lines was observed 1 d after returning from space. The population mean showed a consistent improvement in DVA performance during the fi rst postfl ight week. Discussion(s): The recovery curves for individual subjects did not necessarily follow a pattern of continuous improvement with each passing day. When adjusted for previous long-duration fl ight experience, the population mean showed an unexpected DVA reduction in the re-adaptation curve that is similar to recovery patterns observed in prism adaptation studies.",Excluded
3068,"Residential radon and lung cancer in Sweden: risk analysis accounting for random error in the exposure assessment. A large epidemiologic study on residential radon exposure and lung cancer has been conducted in Sweden. An attempt is now made to quantify the impact of random error in the exposure assessment on the risk estimate for lung cancer in this study. The study included 1,360 lung cancer cases, diagnosed from 1980 to 1984, and 2,847 population controls. Radon measurements were performed in 8,992 dwellings occupied by the study subjects some time since 1947. Questionnaires provided information on smoking and other risk factors. Imprecision in the retrospective exposure assessment for radon was estimated from a Monte Carlo technique modeling Swedish conditions. Adjusted risk estimates were obtained from regression analyses based on expected values for true time-weighted average residential radon concentration (TWA), conditional on observed TWA. Without adjustment for random error in the TWA estimates, the linear excess relative risk coefficient was 0.10 per 100 Bq m(-3), but an excess relative risk of about 0.15 to 0.20 per 100 Bq m(-3) was suggested following adjustment. The potentially significant consequences of errors in the retrospective radon exposure assessment should be taken into consideration in the risk estimation as well as in comparisons of results of different studies and in future pooled analyses.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: from a clinical and public health perspective, it is important to understand the influence of seasonality on the serum vitamin D level to adequately assess and interpret an individual measurement. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyse the effects of seasonal conditions on 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) serum levels in a population-based cohort of older people., METHODS: between March 2009 and April 2010 the 25(OH)D serum level was assessed in 1,418 community-dwelling individuals living in Germany aged >=65 years (56.7% men) with no subscribed vitamin D supplementation. Least-square means of monthly 25(OH)D serum levels with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated, adjusted for gender, age and body mass index. Additionally, the proportion of vitamin deficiency (<20 ng/ml), insufficiency (20-<30 ng/ml) and sufficiency (30 ng/ml or higher) were estimated for each month. Finally, mean values of daily total global solar radiation and daylight were calculated for each month., RESULTS: the minimum 25(OH)D serum level was observed in March with 15.4 ng/ml (SD = 6.56 ng/ml) and the maximum in August with 25.6 ng/ml (SD = 6.59 ng/ml).

Purpose: To determine feasibility and efficacy of concurrent paclitaxel and cisplatin with definitive hyperfractionated radiotherapy (HFRT) in locally advanced head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Patients and Methods: Forty-two patients stages III to IV head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma were enrolled in 2 consecutive prospective trials from August 1998 to January 2006. In study 1, 16 patients received HFRT in 2 courses of 39.6 Gy each with a split of 2 weeks with concurrent paclitaxel (175 mg/m) and cisplatin (100 mg/m) on days 1, 21, 36, and 57. In study 2, 26 patients received a continuous course of 74.4 Gy of HFRT with concurrent weekly paclitaxel (50 mg/m) and cisplatin (30 mg/m). Result(s): Tumor locations included oropharynx 48%, hypopharynx 24%, larynx 12%, paranasal sinuses 7%, salivary gland 2%, oral cavity 2% and unknown primary 5%. In study 1, all patients received 3 to 4 cycles of chemotherapy and completed the programmed radiotherapy course. In study 2, 69% received 5 to 6 cycles of chemotherapy and 92% completed the irradiation. Overall, 93% of objective responses were observed (complete 76%, partial 17%). Median follow-up was 50 months (range: 12-97). Pattern of recurrence was local 8%, distant 13%, and combined 3%.

2148,"The effect of body mass index on fluoroscopic time and radiation dose during lumbar transforaminal epidural steroid injections. OBJECTIVE: Transforaminal epidural steroid injections (TFESIs) are a commonly used, effective treatment for radicular pain. Accurate delivery of the injected medication helps to ensure maximum therapeutic efficacy and to decrease possible adverse events, and fluoroscopy is the preferred and most common image-guidance modality used to ensure accurate needle placement during lumbar TFESIs. However, fluoroscopic-guided lumbar TFESIs put patients at risk because of radiation exposure. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and fluoroscopy time and radiation dose during lumbar TFESIs., DESIGN: A retrospective study design was used., SETTING: The study was conducted at an academic orthopedic center. All procedures were performed by physicians board-certified in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&R) and with subspecialty certification in sports medicine, or by a trainee under close supervision from an attending physician., PARTICIPANTS: Participants were patients who underwent fluoroscopic-guided lumbar TFESIs between February 2013 and March 2015 with a documented height/weight, fluoroscopy time, and radiation dose., INTERVENTIONS: All patients received unilateral or bilateral lumbar TFESIs with fluoroscopic guidance. Fluoroscopy time and dose were recorded., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measures were fluoroscopy time and radiation dose. A Bonferroni correction was implemented for multiple comparisons, defining statistical significance at p<.01., RESULTS: A total of 2,443 injections were performed on 1,548 patients. There were 419 normal, 572 overweight, and 557 obese patients, respectively. There were 1,426 first-time injections and 1,017 repeat injections. Sixty-nine percent (1,681) were unilateral injections, and 26.4% (645) were single level injections. A trainee was involved in 1,361 (55.7%) of the injections performed. The mean fluoroscopy time for all injections was 30.0+/-17.5 seconds, and the mean radiation dose was 2,164+/-1,484 mGy-cm(2). The mean fluoroscopy time was 27.7+/-15.2 seconds for normal weight patients, 30.0+/-21.0 seconds for overweight patients, and 32.2+/-15.1 seconds for obese patients, showing a significant difference between groups (p<.001). The mean radiation doses for each group were 1,376+/-450, 1,911+/-653, and 3,029+/-640 mGy-cm(2), respectively, with a significant increase in radiation dose with increasing BMI (p<.001)., CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study demonstrate that fluoroscopy radiation dose and fluoroscopy time during lumbar TFESIs are increased in patients with an elevated BMI, and in patients of greater age, but the presence of a trainee had no effect on fluoroscopy time.

Objective: To understand the effects of positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) evaluation on patients with previously untreated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with clinical evidence of regional lymph node involvement. Study Design: Prospective blinded study. Setting(s): Tertiary care cancer center. Subjects and Methods: Informed consent was obtained and data collected from 52 consecutive previously untreated patients with HNSCC and clinical evidence of cervical metastasis. All patients underwent conventional evaluation for HNSCC and whole body PET/CT. Data were evaluated by 5 independent reviewers, who performed TNM staging per the American Joint Committee on Cancer (seventh edition) manual and proposed a treatment plan prior to viewing, and after reviewing, PET/CT. Cases where at least 3 of 5 reviewers agreed were considered significant. Result(s): There were 0 patients for whom review of the PET/CT altered the T-class assessment (95% CI, 0-6.8), 12 (23.1%) for whom PET/CT altered N classification (95% CI, 12.5-34.5), and 2 (3.8%) for whom PET/CT altered the M classification (95% CI, 0.5-13.2). For 5 patients (9.6%), overall stage was altered per PET/CT review (95% CI, 3.2-21). For 3 patients (5.8%), PET/CT findings prompted reviewers to alter treatment recommendations (95% CI, 1.2-15.9). Conclusion(s): When added to more conventional patient evaluation, PET/CT results in changes to the TNM categories, but overall staging and treatment were less frequently affected. Whether PET/CT should be used routinely for patients with stage III and IV HNSCC is still subjective and merits further study.Copyright © American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation 2018.",Excluded

1365,"Dosimetric feasibility of real-time MRI-guided proton therapy. PURPOSE: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a prime candidate for image-guided radiotherapy. This study was designed to assess the feasibility of real-time MRI-guided proton therapy by quantifying the dosimetric effects induced by the magnetic field in patients' plans and identifying the associated clinical consequences., METHODS: Monte Carlo dose calculation was performed for nine patients of various treatment sites (lung, liver, prostate, brain, skull-base, and spine) and tissue homogeneities, in the presence of 0.5 and 1.5 T magnetic fields. Dose volume histogram (DVH) parameters such as D95, D5, and V20 as well as equivalent uniform dose were compared for the target and organs at risk, before and after applying the magnetic field. The authors further assessed whether the plans affected by clinically relevant dose distortions could be corrected independent of the planning system., RESULTS: By comparing the resulting dose distributions and analyzing the respective DVHs, it was determined that despite the observed lateral beam deflection, for magnetic fields of up to 0.5 T, neither was the target coverage jeopardized nor was the dose to the nearby organs increased in all cases except for prostate. However, for a 1.5 T magnetic field, the dose distortions were more pronounced and of clinical concern in all cases except for spine. In such circumstances, the target was severely underdosed, as indicated by a decrease in D95 of up to 41% of the prescribed dose compared to the nominal situation (no magnetic field). Sites such as liver and spine were less affected due to higher tissue homogeneity, typically smaller beam range, and the choice of beam directions. Simulations revealed that small modifications to certain plan parameters such as beam isocenter (up to 19 mm) and gantry angle (up to 10degree) are sufficient to compensate for the magnetic field-induced dose disturbances. The authors' observations indicate that the degree of required corrections strongly depends on the beam range and direction relative to the magnetic field. This method was also applicable to more heterogeneous scenarios such as skull-base tumors., CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the dosimetric feasibility of real-time MRI-guided proton therapy and delivering a clinically acceptable dose to patients with various tumor locations within magnetic fields of up to 1.5 T. This work could serve as a guide and encouragement for further efforts toward clinical implementation of hybrid MRI-proton gantry systems.",Excluded
1577,"Allogeneic stem cell transplantation after autologous SCT for primary mediastinal b cell lymphoma in the rituximab era: A retrospective study by the EBMT lymphoma working party. Introduction: Evidence from the DLBCL setting suggests that allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) is a reasonable salvage therapy for patients progressing despite undergoing autologous SCT (autoSCT and even as an alternative to autoSCT. Data regarding the effects of alloSCT in patients with primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma (PMBCL) are very limited. The objective of the current study was to investigate the outcome of alloSCT in patients with PMBCL who were previously treated with rituximab-based regimens and autoSCT. Materials (or patients) and Methods: All EBMT registered patients diagnosed with PMBCL who had undergone alloSCT between 2001 and 2011 as second transplant after a previous autoSCT were eligible. Patient characteristics, disease- and transplant-related data were collected from MED-A forms. Centers with potentially eligible patients were contacted to provide additional treatment and follow-up information, including a written histopathology report. Result(s): 12 patients, 5 females (42%) and 7 males with confirmed PMBCL, were included. The median age was 27 years, ranging from 21-to 61 years. Median time from diagnosis to alloSCT and from autoSCT to alloSCT were 14 (IQR 11-17 months and 7 months (IQR 4-9) respectively. Fifty-eight percent (N=7) had received at least 3 chemotherapeutic regimens prior allograft; 11 (92%) had been treated with rituximab-containing regimen and 67% (N=8) received mediastinal irradiation prior allosct. Evaluation of disease status at transplantation revealed that 42% (n=5) were in CR1/PR1 (alloSCT was performed here as part of a tandem transplant program), 17% (n=2) were in CR/PR>1 and 42% (n=5) were transplanted with refractory disease. 50% (n=6) were transplanted with residual mediastinal mass larger than 5 cm. Within a median follow up of 36 months, only 3 patients remained alive, whereas 9 patients died due to disease progression (n=3) or non-relapse mortality (n=6). Discussion(s): The current preliminary study does not suggest that alloSCT for PMBCL in the rituximab era can benefit a large proportion of patients. Larger studies are warranted to further define the role of allograft in this specific indication.",Excluded
3365,"The relative frequency in which empiric dosages of radioiodine would potentially overtreat or undertreat patients who have metastatic well-differentiated thyroid cancer. The dosage of (131)I for the treatment of metastatic well-differentiated thyroid cancer is typically selected empirically. Benua and Leeper implemented a method to estimate the maximum dosages of (131)I that could be administered to a patient so as not to exceed a maximum tolerated radiation absorbed dose (MTD), which was defined as 200 rads (cGy) to the blood. The objective of this study was to determine the frequency of (131)I treatments in which the patient (1) would have exceeded the MTD (i.e., overtreatment) or (2) would have been able to receive higher dosages of (131)I thereby delivering a potentially higher radiation absorbed dose to their metastases (i.e., undertreatment) had the patient been administered various assumed empiric dosages of (131)I. The dosimetrically-determined maximum tolerated radioactivities (MTA) to deliver 200 rads to the blood (MTD) were tabulated at our facility. Data were then grouped to determine the percentage of patients who would have received less than or more than the MTD for various assumed empiric dosages of (131)I. A total of 127 dosimetries were performed. For assumed empiric dosages of (131)I (100 mCi, 150 mCi, 200 mCi, 250 mCi, and 300 mCi), the percentage of treatments for which patients would have exceeded the MTD were less than 1%, 5%, 11%, 17%, and 22%, respectively, and could have received a higher dosage of (131)I were more than 99%, 95%, 89%, 83%, and 78%, respectively. A significant number of patients receiving various empiric dosages of (131)I may exceed 200 rads (cGy) to the blood (potential overtreating). Likewise, the majority of patients may be able to receive much higher dosages of (131)I relative to empiric dosages thereby delivering potentially higher radiation absorbed doses to the metastases without exceeding 200 rads (cGy) to the blood (potential undertreating).",Excluded

Sun radiation is indispensable to our health, however, a long term and high exposure could lead to erythema, premature skin aging and promotion of skin tumors. An underlying pathomechanism is the formation of free radicals. First, reactive oxygen species (*OH, *O2 -) and then, secondary lipid oxygen species (C centered radicals, CCR) are formed. A high amount of free radicals results in oxidative stress with subsequent cell damage. In dermatological research different skin models are used, however, comparative data about the cutaneous radical formation are missing. In this study, the radical formation in porcine-, (SKH-1) murine-, human- ex vivo skin and reconstructed human skin (RHS) were investigated during simulated sun irradiation (305-2200 nm), with X-band EPR spectroscopy. The amount of radical formation was investigated with the spin probe PCA exposed to a moderate sun dose below one minimal erythema dose (MED, ~25 mJ/cm2 UVB) in all skin models. Furthermore, the *OH and *CCR radical concentrations were measured with the spin trap DMPO within 0-4 MED (porcine-, human skin and RHS). The highest amount of radicals was found in RHS followed by murine and porcine, and the lowest amount in human ex vivo skin. In all skin models, more *OH than CCR radicals were found at 0-4 MED. Additionally, this work addresses the limitations in the characterization with the spin trap DMPO. The measurements have shown that the most comparable skin model to in vivo human skin could differ depending on the focus of the investigation. If the amount of radial production is regarded, RHS seems to be in a similar range like in vivo human skin. If the investigation is focused on the radical type, porcine skin is most comparable to ex vivo human skin, at an irradiation dose not exceeding 1 MED. Here, no comparison to in vivo human skin is possible.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
853,"Outcome Prediction After Surgery and Chemoradiation of Squamous Cell Carcinoma in the Oral Cavity, Oropharynx, and Hypopharynx: Use of Baseline Perfusion CT Microcirculatory Parameters vs. Tumor Volume. Purpose: To assess whether pretreatment perfusion computed tomography (PCT) may predict outcome in chemoradiated patients with oral cavity, oropharynx, and hypopharynx squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA) after surgical excision. Material(s) and Method(s): Twenty-one patients with SCCA were examined before treatment. The primary site was oral cavity in 6, oropharynx in 7, and hypopharynx in 8 patients; there were 11 T2, 6 T3, and 4 T4 tumors. PCT was performed at the level of largest tumor diameter based on standard neck CT. The data were processed to obtain blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV), mean transit time (MTT), and permeability surface area product (PS). Regions of interest were free-hand positioned on the lesions to obtain PCT measurements. Tumor volume was also calculated. Follow-up was performed with positron emission tomography (PET)/CT and endoscopy. Pearson correlation coefficient was used for comparison between the subgroups. A regression model was constructed to predict recurrence based on the following predictors: age, gender, tumor (T) and nodal (N) stage, tumor volume, and PCT parameters. Result(s): BFmean, BFmax, BVmean, BVmax, MTTmean, PSmean, and PSmax were significantly different between patients with and without tumor recurrence (0.0001, p < 0.04). T stage, tumor volume, N stage, BFmax, BVmax, MTTmean, and radiation dose (p < 0.001) were independent predictors for recurrence. Cox proportional hazards model for tumor recurrence revealed significantly increased risk with high tumor volume (p = 0.00001, relative risk [RR] 7.4), low PSmean (p = 0.0001, RR 14.3), and low BFmax (p = 0.002, RR 5.9). Conclusion(s): Our data suggest that PCT parameters have a prognostic role in patients with SCCA. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
