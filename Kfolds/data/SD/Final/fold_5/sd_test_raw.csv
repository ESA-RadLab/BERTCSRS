4072,"Chromosomal aberrations in C-arm fluoroscopy, CT-scan, lithotripsy, and digital radiology staff. We have assessed chromosome-type aberrations and micronuclei in the peripheral lymphocytes of personnel working with C-arm fluoroscopy, multi-slice CT-scan, lithotripsy, and digital radiology medical procedures. The study population comprised of 46 exposed workers and 35 controls matched for age, gender, and other confounding factors. Chromosome-type aberrations and micronuclei were analyzed and compared with occupational dosimetry data. The highest frequency of both chromosome aberrations (1.62 CA/100 cells) and MN (MN = 7.47 +/- 2.55) was observed in the operating room group. According to occupational dosimetry, surgeons and medical staff received 0-2.99 mSv over the previous year, well below the limit established by the International Committee on Radiation Protection. An increased level of chromosomal aberrations was observed among workers exposed in the operating rooms. We recommend that operating room radiation safety programs be improved and better supervised, in particular for orthopedic surgeons and personnel performing fluoroscopically guided procedures.

4081,"[FOXO tanscription factor role in radiation adaptive response and hormisis in Drosophila melanogaster]. Previously we put forward a hypothesis about the role of FOXO-dependent mechanisms of stress-response gene activation after irradiation in radiation hormesis (Moskalev, 2008). To testify this assumption we analyze the influence of gamma-irradiation on duration of larvae development and imago lifespan in Drosophila strains with different FOXO function activity. We revealed that in FOXO hypomorphic allele homozygote strains the hormesis and adaptive response (increasing of larvae stage duration and longevity) were absent, in contrast to B wild type strain Canton-S and FOXO-heterozygotes.",Included
4114,"Genetic susceptibility to thymic lymphomas and K-ras gene mutation in mice after exposure to X-rays and N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea. PURPOSE: Ras activation is one of the major mechanisms for the development of murine thymic lymphomas by radiation and chemical carcinogens. To gain insight into the relationship between genetic susceptibility and ras gene mutation, the frequency and spectrum of ras gene mutation was examined in thymic lymphomas from susceptible and resistant mice., MATERIALS AND METHODS: K- and N-ras mutations in thymic lymphomas that arose in X-ray-irradiated and N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-treated mice of susceptible C57BL/6, rather resistant C3H and their hybrid B6C3F1 were analysed by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism and subsequent DNA sequencing., RESULTS: C57BL/6 exhibited a higher incidence of thymic lymphomas after exposure to X-rays and ENU than C3H, with B6C3F1 being intermediate. K-ras gene mutations occurred frequently in the pathogenesis of ENU-induced thymic lymphomas in susceptible C57BL/6 as opposed to resistant C3H. The ras mutations were more frequent in ENU-induced thymic lymphomas than X-ray-induced thymic lymphomas, and with the latter, there was no clear evidence for strain differences, suggesting that the genetic susceptibility to X-rays was independent of ras activation. The mutations of K-ras in thymic lymphomas from C57BL/6 were predominantly GGT to GAT in codon 12, whereas this mutation type was never found in those from C3H. No strain difference was observed in the nucleotide sequence or expression levels of O(6)-alkylguanine alkyltransferase, indicating that this enzyme did not account for the genetic susceptibility to ras activation., CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that there is a clear strain and carcinogen dependency of K-ras mutation and that the frequency of ras mutation might determine the genetic susceptibility to ENU-induced lymphomagenesis, whereas pathways independent of ras activation might determine the susceptibility to X-ray-induced lymphomagenesis.",Included

4121,"Multifaceted applications of pre-mature chromosome condensation in radiation biodosimetry. Background: Biodosimetry with persistent cytogenetic indicators in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) plays crucial role in regulatory/medical management of individuals overexposed to radiation. Conventional methods require ~48 h culture and have limited dose range (0.1-5Gy) applications due to checkpoint arrest/poor stimulation. G0-Phase Premature chromosome condensation (G0-PCC) allows chromosome aberration analysis within hours after blood collection. Due to high skill demand, applications of G0-PCC were not very well explored and being re-visited worldwide. Among all aberrations, analysis of excess chromosomal fragments is quickest. Radiation dose response curve for the fragments has been reported. Purpose(s): In present study, excess fragment analysis has been addressed in detail, in addition to validation of radiation dose response curve, gender variation in the response, dose dependent repair kinetics, minimum detection limit (MDL), duration and accuracy of final dose estimation with 5blindfolded, ex vivo irradiated samples have been studied. In extension, feasibility of multiparametric dosimetry with Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) based endpoints were qualitatively explored. Material(s) and Method(s): PBLs were exposed to Gamma-Radiation and G0-PCC was performed at different time points. Decay kinetics and dose response curve were established. Gender Variation of the frequency of the fragments was assessed at 0, 2 and 4 Gy. FISH was performed with G0-PCC applying centromere probe, whole chromosome paints, multi-color FISH and multi-color banding probes. Result(s): Radiation response curve for fragments was found to be linear (Slope 1.09 +/- 0.031 Gy-1). Background frequency as well as dose response did not show significant gender bias. Based on variation in background frequency of fragments MDL was calculated to be ~0.3 Gy. Kinetics of fragment tested at 0, 4, 8, 16 and 24 h showed exponential decay pattern from 0 to 8 h and without further decay. Final dose estimation of five samples was completed within 13 man-hours. Dicentric chromosomes, translocations, insertions and breaks were identifiable in combination with centromere FISH and WCP. Advanced methods employing multicolor FISH and multi-color banding were also demonstrated with PCC spreads. Conclusion(s): G0-PCC, can be useful tool for high dose biodosimetry with quick assessment of fragment frequency. Further, it holds potential for multi-parametric dosimetry in combination with FISH.© Copyright © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group LLC.",Included
4127,"Radiation and host factors in human thyroid tumors following thymus irradiation. In this paper thyroid tumor data from the 1971 survey of the Rochester, New York thymus irradiated population are further analyzed to study radiobiological and host factors. The analyses were based on the approximately 2650 irradiated subjects and 4800 sibling controls who had 5 or more years of follow-up. Twenty-four thyroid cancers and 52 thyroid adenomas were found in the irradiated group, and 0 thyroid cancers and 6 adenomas among the controls. The overall risk estimates were 3.8 thyroid cancers/106 PY-rad and 4.5 thyroid adenomas/106 PY-rad. The dose-response data (thyroid dose range of 5 to > 1000 rad) for thyroid cancer indicate both a linear and a dose-squared component, but no dose-squared component is evident for thyroid adenomas. At lower total doses (< 400 rad) there was a suggestion that dose fractionation diminished the thyroid cancer response, but a similar fractionation effect was not found for thyroid adenomas. The temporal pattern of tumors suggested an extended plateau of excess tumor production, rather than a 'wavelike' temporal pattern. There was no evidence for an inverse relationship between thyroid radiation dose and thyroid cancer latency. Female and Jewish subjects had a higher risk of radiation-induced thyroid cancer than did their respective counterparts. The additive and multiplicative models of radiation effects were compared with respect to sex differences; neither model provided a superior fit to the data. The tentative nature of the conclusion is stressed because of the relatively small number of thyroid cancers.",Included
4134,"Effects of (12)C(6+) ion radiation and ferulic acid on the zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryonic oxidative stress response and gene expression. The effects of carbon ion irradiation and ferulic acid (FA) on the induction of oxidative stress and alteration of gene expression were studied in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. Zebrafish embryos at 8 hpf were divided into seven groups: the control group; the 1Gy, 3Gy and 7Gy irradiation groups; and three FA-pre-treated irradiation groups. In the irradiated groups, a significant increase in the teratogenesis of the zebrafish embryos and oxidative stress was accompanied by increased malondialdehyde (MDA) content, decreased glutathione (GSH) content and alterations in antioxidant enzyme activities (such as catalase [CAT] and superoxide dismutase [SOD]). Moreover, the mRNA levels for Cu/Zn-sod, Mn-sod, cat and gpx, the genes encoding these antioxidant proteins, were altered significantly. However, the mRNA expression patterns were not in accordance with those of the antioxidant enzymes and were more sensitive under low-dose irradiation. In addition, we detected the mRNA expression of ucp-2 and bcl-2, which are located at the mitochondrial inner membrane and related to reactive oxidative species (ROS) production. In the irradiated groups, the mRNA level of ucp-2 was significantly increased, whereas the mRNA level of bcl-2 was significantly decreased. Supplementation with FA, an antioxidant, was better able to reduce the irradiation-induced oxidative damage marked by changes in mortality, morphology, antioxidant enzyme activities and the MDA and GSH content, as well as in the mRNA expression levels. Overall, this study provided helpful information about the transcriptional effects of irradiation to better understand the mechanism of carbon ion-induced oxidative stress and FA-induced radioprotective effects.

The new treadmill protocol has three level-grade stages (3-min each) at 70, 80, and 90% of estimated VO2peak. The protocol maintains the third stage speed while grade increases each minute to produce work rates equivalent to 100, 107, and 115% of the estimated VO2peak. We compared the new protocol's peak and submaximal responses to those observed during a NASA graded exercise test. All mean protocol differences, including peak work rate (-1.8%), VO2peak (-6.4%), HRpeak (-2.4%), and VEpeak (-9.7%), were not significantly different from the expected measurement errors. We observed similar results for indices (the oxygen uptake at a HR of 150 and the HR's at 70, 80, and 90% of VO2peak) of the submaximal HR-VO2 relationship.

The quantitative transmission of Litomosoides carinii by Liponyssus bacoti to un-irradiated and irradiated hamsters and mice is described. Both young and adult, un-irradiated and irradiated hamsters were highly susceptible to L. carinii but mice (un-irradiated or irradiated) were poor hosts. All hamsters (18 un-irradiated and seven irradiated) became infected. Seven out of nine mice in an un-irradiated series became infected. There was apparently 'age resistance' or 'young susceptibility' in the hamsters. The susceptibility of young hamsters appeared similar to that of new-born Carworth white rats and cotton rats. The pattern of infection in un-irradiated and irradiated hamsters was similar. Results from irradiated animals were insufficient to draw any clear conclusions on the effect of irradiation to susceptibility to infection with L. carinii. X-irradiation apparently did not affect the innate susceptibility cr resistance of hamsters and mice to worms. The duration and intensity of microfilaraemia was apparently higher in irradiated hamsters.",Excluded
4137,"Phase 1 trial of allogeneic gene-modified tumor cell vaccine RCC-26/CD80/IL-2 in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Preclinical studies showed that the allogeneic tumor cell line RCC-26 displayed natural immunogenic potential that was enhanced through expression of CD80 costimulatory molecules and secretion of interleukin-2. Here we report the study of RCC-26/CD80/IL-2 cells in a phase 1 vaccine trial of renal cell carcinoma patients with metastatic disease (mRCC). Fifteen patients of the HLA-A*0201 allotype, with at least one metastatic lesion, were included. Irradiated vaccine cells were applied in increasing doses of 2.5, 10, and 40x106 cells over 22 weeks. Primary study parameters included safety and toxicity. Sequential blood samples were analyzed by interferon-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot assays to detect tumor antigen-associated (TAA) effector cells. The vaccine was well tolerated and the designated vaccination course was completed in 9 of 15 patients. Neither vaccine-induced autoimmunity nor systemic side effects were observed. Delayed-type hypersensitivity skin reactions were detected in 11 of 12 evaluated patients and were particularly strong in patients with prolonged survival. In parallel, vaccine-induced immune responses against vaccine or overexpressed TAA were detected in 9 of 12 evaluated patients. No tumor regressions occurred according to RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) criteria; however, median time to progression was 5.3 months and median survival was 15.6 months, indicating substantial disease stabilization. We conclude that vaccine use was safe and feasible in mRCC. Clinical benefits were limited in these patients with advanced disease; however, immune monitoring revealed vaccine-induced responses against multiple TAAs in the majority of study participants. These results suggest that this vaccine could be useful in combination therapies and/or minimal residual disease. © Copyright 2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Excluded

4139,"[Intraoperative radiotherapy in abdominal-pelvic cancer surgery]. Intraoperative radiotherapy consists in the irradiation of the affected area, exposed using anesthesiological and laparotomic procedures, following the removal of a neoplasia using palliative or macroscopically radical surgical. This increases local tumour control and augments the selectivity of treatment between healthy and neoplastic tissues, thus obtaining a marked improvement in survival or palliation. The authors analyse the data reported in international literature regarding the possible use of intraoperative radiotherapy in patients undergoing abdomino-pelvic oncological surgery. The aim of the study was to evaluate this method for use in selected and combined treatment in which surgery represents an obligatory step. Studies were carried out in a few highly specialised centres given that special technical, logistic and professional skills were required. The populations studied were often very small with a marked prevalence of feasibility studies compared to random studies. In spite of this intraoperative radiotherapy is undoubtedly indicated in locally advanced gastric, rectal and vesical neoplasia, it represents a valid palliative solution in pancreatic neoplasia and in pelvic recidivation, and an effective alternative solution to mutilating surgery in the initial stages of vesical cancer. Positive results are obtained in prostate and uterine cancer, but they are reported by non-conclusive studies. Toxicity is acceptable and non-limiting within a given range of doses and irradiated volume. The ""repercussion"" in terms of knowledge, experience, scientific integration between oncological surgeons and radiotherapists is basic, with a marked improved in the management of cancer treatment.",Excluded
4140,"Biodegradable esophageal stents in benign and malignant strictures - A single center experience. Background and study aims: Biodegradable (BD) esophageal stents were recently developed mainly for refractory benign strictures, but experience and available literature are limited. Patients and Methods: This was a retrospective observational study. All patients who had BD stents inserted due to refractory benign esophageal strictures or malignant strictures, or were awaiting radical radiotherapy/chemotherapy or neo-adjuvant therapy and esophagectomy between March 2011 and July 2015 were included. Result(s): Stent placement was successful in all patients. Ten patients with benign strictures (3 male, median age 80.5 years, IQR: 68.75-89.5) were followed-up for a median of 171.5 weeks (IQR: 24-177.25). The interval between dilatations prior to the first BD stent placement (median: 34.25 days, IQR: 23.06-48.29) was significantly shorter than the interval between the first BD stent placement and the first intervention required (median: 149.5 days, IQR: 94.25-209.5) and this difference was statistically significant (P=0.012). Ten patients with esophageal cancer (8 male, median age: 69 years, IQR: 59.25-80.75) were included and they were followed up for a median of 36 weeks (IQR: 26-58). Only 1 completed radical radiotherapy successfully, but developed refractory post-radiotherapy stricture. No one proceeded to esophagectomy and 50% required a self-expanding metal stent (SEMS) at a median of 134 days (IQR: 100-263) following stent placement. Conclusion(s): BD stents were successfully deployed in both benign and malignant strictures. They offered a prolonged dilatation-free interval in benign strictures, yet in the majority of patients, strictures recurred. In malignant strictures, stent patency was similar to that of benign strictures, which suggests a potential value in ensuring adequate oral intake during oncologic therapy. In our cohort, however, use of stents did not contribute to improved outcome.Copyright © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart, New York.",Excluded
4141,"Establishing the European diagnostic reference levels for interventional cardiology. Interventional cardiac procedures may be associated with high patient doses and therefore require special attention to protect the patients from radiation injuries such as skin erythema, cardiovascular tissue reactions or radiation-induced cancer. In this study, patient exposure data is collected from 13 countries (37 clinics and nearly 50 interventional rooms) and for 10 different procedures. Dose data was collected from a total of 14,922 interventional cardiology procedures. Based on these data European diagnostic reference levels (DRL) for air kerma-area product are suggested for coronary angiography (CA, DRL = 35 Gy cm2), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI, 85 Gy cm2), transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI, 130 Gy cm2), electrophysiological procedures (12 Gy cm2) and pacemaker implantations. Pacemaker implantations were further divided into single-chamber (2.5 Gy cm2) and dual chamber (3.5 Gy cm2) procedures and implantations of cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemaker (18 Gy cm2). Results show that relatively new techniques such as TAVI and treatment of chronic total occlusion (CTO) often produce relatively high doses, and thus emphasises the need for use of an optimization tool such as DRL to assist in reducing patient exposure. The generic DRL presented here facilitate comparison of patient exposure in interventional cardiology.Copyright © 2018 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica",Excluded
4142,"Selective brain responses to acute and chronic low-dose X-ray irradiation in males and females. Radiation exposure is known to have profound effects on the brain, leading to precursor cell dysfunction and debilitating cognitive declines [Nat. Med. 8 (2002) 955]. Although a plethora of data exist on the effects of high radiation doses, the effects of low-dose irradiation, such as ones received during repetitive diagnostic and therapeutic exposures, are still under-investigated [Am. J. Otolaryngol. 23 (2002) 215; Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97 (2000) 889; Curr. Opin. Neurol. 16 (2003) 129]. Furthermore, most studies of the biological effects of ionizing radiation have been performed using a single acute dose, while clinically and environmentally relevant exposures occur predominantly under chronic/repetitive conditions. Here, we have used a mouse model to compare the effects of chronic/repetitive and acute low-dose radiation (LDR) exposure (0.5Gy) to ionizing radiation on the brain in vivo. We examined the LDR effects on p42/44 MAPK (ERK1/ERK2), CaMKII, and AKT signaling-the interconnected pathways that have been previously shown to be crucial for neuronal survival upon irradiation. We report perturbations in ERK1/2, AKT, and CREB upon acute and chronic/repetitive low-dose exposure in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of mice. These studies were paralleled by the analysis of radiation effects on neurogenesis and cellular proliferation. Repetitive exposure had a much more pronounced effect on cellular signaling and neurogenesis than acute exposure. These results suggest that studies of single acute exposures might be limited in terms of their predictive value. We also present the first evidence of sex differences in radiation-induced signaling in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. We show the role of estrogens in brain radiation responses and discuss the implications of the observed changes.",Included

UNLABELLED: Clinical trials are increasingly investigating the effects of intracoronary radiation for the treatment of de-novo lesions, restenosis (without stents), and in-stent restenosis. As the first group in Germany, we had the opportunity to use the Novoste system within the international multicenter studies BETA-CATH, START and BRIE and report our preliminary experience regarding safety and feasibility of intracoronary brachytherapy with this afterloader. A total of 95 patients were enrolled. The Novoste system was used in 92 patients (104 lesions). Ischemic complications were not observed; therefore, radiation was performed as planned. The mean applied dose was 16 +/- 2 Gy (14-20 Gy, at 2 mm distance) and mean exposure time was 202 +/- 27 s (165-261 s). The addition of brachytherapy increased the total duration of the intervention for 17 +/- 8 min. At the body surface of the patients, the following dose rates were measured: left chest wall: 99 +/- 52 microSv/h; groin 3 +/- 3 microSv/h. All patients received ASS 300 mg/d o.d. Patients with stent implantation in the same session received 250 mg b.i.d. Ticlopidin or 75 mg Clopidogrel o.d. for at least three months. Total mortality and infarct rate was 0. There was no acute, subacute or late stent thrombosis., CONCLUSION: Our first experience with the Novoste Beta-Cath system showed that intracoronary brachytherapy can be safely and simply performed in the cath lab. There were no acute complications. To avoid the possible risk of late stent thrombosis, Ticlopidin or Clopidogrel must be administered for at least three months.",Excluded

Objective: We aimed to determine the frequency and risk of malignancy (ROM) for indeterminate thyroid nodules, categories III (B3) and IV (B4) of the Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (BSRTC), at a large institution in Israel. Additionally, we investigated the impact of redefining follicular neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP) as non-malignant on malignancy rates. Method(s): In this retrospective study of all thyroid fine needle aspirations (FNAs) performed at Tel Aviv-Sourasky Medical Center between January 2013 and December 2015, we assessed ROM for B3 and B4 nodules. Potential risk factors thought to affect a-priori ROM were assessed. Suspected NIFTP lesions were re-examined, and if proven, reclassified as benign. Result(s): 3701 nodules were sampled in 2919 FNAs performed on 2674 patients. B3 reports comprised 7.7% of all nodules (n = 284); B4 represented 3.6% (n = 132). In multivariate logistic regression, male gender, being of former Soviet Union origin, and smoking increased ROM for B3 nodules by a factor of 7.97 (P = 0.002; CI: 2.2-23.4), 9.15 (P = 0.021; CI:1.4-60.0), and 11.0 (P = 0.001; CI 2.8-44.8), respectively. Reclassifying NIFTP decreased ROM from 14% to 12.5% for B3, and from 26.7% to 25% for B4 nodules. NIFTP comprised 9.5% of previously diagnosed resected malignant tumors. Conclusion(s): The relative frequencies of B3 and B4 nodules and their associated malignancy rates were consistent with previous series. Risk factors identified for malignancy may help characterize patients most likely to benefit from surgery. Reclassifying NIFTP had a substantial impact on the ROM in the resected tumors previously diagnosed as malignant.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd, BASO ~ The Association for Cancer Surgery, and the European Society of Surgical Oncology",Excluded
4145,"Remotely Guided Breast Sonography for Long-Term Space Missions: A Case Report and Discussion. Background: Space radiation can cause different types of cancers in crewmembers, especially during long-term space missions. Introduction: To date, a complete bilateral breast ultrasound has not been performed at the International Space Station (ISS). A breast screening imaging technique could be a useful tool for early identification of breast cancer in astronauts. We hypothesized that breast ultrasound performed by a crewmember while being remotely guided by a specialist from the ground could be an essential tool for medical diagnosis in space. This project aimed to test an ultrasound screening protocol for breast tissue using real-time remotely guided telemedicine techniques. Materials and Methods: One female volunteer, with no previous medical experience, performed a self-scanned bilateral breast ultrasound exam guided by a remote sonographer. Dynamic ultrasound images were collected using a 25 mm broadband linear array transducer. To simulate fluid shift on the volunteer during microgravity, the bed was tilted -6. Results: Recorded ultrasound images were analyzed by radiologists, comparing the findings with a gold standard. The experiment demonstrated that real-time remotely guided sonography exam is feasible and can yield meaningful clinical results. Discussion: This case study showed that remotely guided breast ultrasound can be performed and might become an important tool for diagnosis of breast cancer in space missions. Conclusion: The results cannot be generalized based on one subject, and additional research is warranted in this area in addition to its validation on the ISS. This technique, however, has potential for use as part of preventive medicine procedures for long-term space missions at the ISS, and eventually for human settlements on the Moon and Mars.

4147,"First-arterial-pass dual-energy CT for assessment of myocardial blood supply: Do we need rest, stress, and delayed acquisition? Comparison with SPECT. Purpose: To compare the relative contributions of rest, stress, and delayed acquisitions with the accuracy of dual-energy (DE) computed tomography (CT) for the assessment of myocardial blood supply. Material(s) and Method(s): With institutional review board approval and HIPAA compliance, 55 consecutive patients (10 women, 45 men; mean age, 62 years 6 10) clinically referred for cardiac single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) who were known to have or were suspected of having coronary artery disease were prospectively enrolled. DE CT studies were acquired during adenosine stress, at rest, and after 6-minute delay. The DE CT iodine distribution maps were visually assessed for perfusion deficits or late iodine enhancement. Per-segment agreement between modalities was investigated with k statistics. Test characteristics for the detection of perfusion deficits were calculated for combinations of rest, stress, and delayed DE CT acquisition, with SPECT as reference standard. Result(s): At SPECT, 714 segments were considered normal, 192 showed fixed perfusion defects, and 29 showed reversible perfusion deficits. Sensitivity of rest-only DE CT was 92%, and specificity was 98%. Stress-only, rest-stress, stress and delayed, and the combination of all three had a sensitivity of 99% and a specificity of 97%. Of 29 segments with reversible perfusion deficits at SPECT, 13 (45%) were misclassified by using rest-stress DE CT as fixed perfusion deficits. With stress DE CT plus delayed acquisition, 13 of 192 (7%) segments with fixed perfusion deficits at SPECT were misclassified as reversible. Conclusion(s): Rest-stress acquisition should be the protocol of choice for assessment of the myocardial blood supply in DE CT. The accuracy of DE CT is not increased by the addition of a delayed DE CT acquisition, which may therefore be omitted to reduce radiation exposure. With rest-stress DE CT, almost one-half of defects that are reversible at SPECT were classified as fixed; radiologists and clinicians need to be aware of this incongruence when they interpret DE CT myocardial perfusion studies. © 2014 RSNA.",Excluded
4148,"Infratentorial craniospinal irradiation for von Hippel-Lindau: A retrospective study supporting a new treatment for patients with CNS hemangioblastomas. Patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome with diffuse CNS hemangioblastomas have morbidity related to their disease and require a lifetime of surgical resections. Ninety-seven percent of tumors progress, and 5-year surgery rates are 20%-60%. Stereotactic radiosurgery and fractionated radiotherapy have had limited success. For the first time, we have used infratentorial craniospinal radiation therapy (ICSRT) for VHL patients with CNS hemangioblastomas. Consecutive VHL patients treated at the National Institutes of Health with radiographic evidence of hemangioblastomas were included if they received ICSRT. Patients underwent neurologic examinations and imaging at 3- to 12-month intervals. Seven patients with 84 hemangioblastomas met eligibility criteria. ICSRT was commonly administered to 43.2 Gy in 24 fractions. Mean pre-ICSRT tumor volume was 5.48 cm3. At a mean follow-up of 73.8 months, mean post-ICSRT tumor volume was 6.87 cm3, and 91 tumors were identified. Complete radiographic resolution was achieved in 17.9% of lesions. Although many patients were no longer optimal surgical candidates, only 4 surgeries were needed for symptomatic lesions after ICSRT, compared with 33 prior. Acute toxicity was mild and no patient developed grade >=1 late spinal cord toxicity according to the criteria of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer, despite the high dose that the entire spinal cord received. Clinical and radiographic stability or resolution was demonstrated in the majority of tumors. Tumor growth rate in this study was less than reported in natural history studies, and the rate of surgical intervention was reduced.

OBJECTIVES: Baxter's methylene blue (MB) photoinactivation of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is a method that effectively removes any intracellular potentially infectious agent, such as prions, by filtration combined with an improved photochemical virus inactivation on a single unit of FFP. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate clinical and biochemical tolerance of MB-treated plasma in healthy human volunteers., METHODS: The design was a crossover randomized trial. Twelve subjects received alternatively treated and nontreated autologous FFP. Coagulation parameters were tested as well as clinical and biochemical parameters., RESULTS: No clinical or statistically significant difference was detected for any of the parameters., CONCLUSION: Transfusion of FFP treated for viral reduction by an improved MB photoinactivation method was shown to be safe and did not affect the normal function of coagulation proteins. We consider this method as a valuable alternative to other methods described as it combines the photoinactivation with a filtration step removing any intracellular infectious agents, such as prions.",Excluded
4150,"Utility of postoperative radiographs after anterior lumbar interbody fusion with or without posterior instrumentation. STUDY DESIGN.: Retrospective clinical and radiographical review. OBJECTIVE.: To evaluate the utility of plain radiographical surveillance after anterior lumbar interbody fusion and determine to what extent radiographical findings affect postoperative decision making. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA.: Postoperative radiographical surveillance is a ubiquitous practice among spine surgeons, which lacks evidence and has received growing attention in an environment of increasing health care cost and receding resources. Lumbar interbody fusions are being performed with increasing frequency from numerous approaches; nonetheless, there are no evidence-based guidelines for postoperative radiographical evaluation of patients after these procedures. METHODS.: One hundred forty-six consecutive patients who underwent anterior lumbar interbody fusion with or without short segment posterior fusion from 2008 to 2011 were reviewed. Exclusion criteria were less than 6 months of follow-up, prior surgery, hybrid constructs with disc arthroplasty, and concurrent posterior fusion of greater than 3 levels. Three hundred fifty-nine radiographical series and 330 clinic notes of the included 67 patients were reviewed. Radiographs were evaluated for abnormalities and clinic notes reviewed for any changes in clinical management by multiple reviewers. Interobserver reliability, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated. RESULTS.: There was no single instance of a change in treatment course based on radiographical findings alone in any of the 330 clinic visits of the 67 included patients during an average 15.8-month postoperative follow-up period. Thirty-four of the 67 patients (51%) had some change in their management on the basis of their clinical symptoms and/or examination. Interobserver agreement for change in management was 0.96 (kappa = 0.918). Sensitivity (6%), specificity (97%), positive predictive value (67%), and negative predictive value (50%) were calculated. CONCLUSION.: Routine postoperative radiographical surveillance has minimal value for asymptomatic patients after anterior lumbar interbody fusion with or without posterior fusion. Obtaining a limited number of postoperative films of these patients in the absence of clinical symptoms or risk factors could significantly reduce health care costs and unnecessary radiation exposure. © 2013, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Excluded
4151,"Lhermitte's sign following head and neck radiotherapy. Lhermitte's sign is an uncommon sequel of radiotherapy to the cervical spinal cord. Although the exact mechanism underlying its occurrence remains unclear; it is felt to be the result of a temporary interference with the turnover and synthesis of myelin, leading to focal demyelination. We have undertaken a detailed analysis of the radiation delivered to four patients who developed the sign after irradiation for malignancies of the head and neck. Our data support the view that radiation dose is crucial to its development, but calculations using the linear-quadratic radiobiological model raise interesting questions regarding the dose-response relationship. In particular, we find that calculations of biologically effective doses are predictive of a late rather than an early normal tissue response. The onset of symptoms after irradiation was apparent in all four patients within 4 months, with resolution in all being complete within a further 6 months: The recognition of this benign transient form of radiation-induced paraesthesia and its differentiation from the later onset, progressive and unremitting symptoms associated with radiation myelopathy is essential in reassuring patients undergoing head and neck irradiation.",Excluded
4152,"Occupational radiation exposure to the surgeon. Increased use of intraoperative fluoroscopy exposes the surgeon to significant amounts of radiation. The average yearly exposure of the public to ionizing radiation is 360 millirems (mrem), of which 300 mrem is from background radiation and 60 mrem from diagnostic radiographs. A chest radiograph exposes the patient to approximately 25 mrem and a hip radiograph to 500 mrem. A regular C-arm exposes the patient to approximately 1,200 to 4,000 mrem/min. The surgeon may receive exposure to the hands from the primary beam and to the rest of the body from scatter. Recommended yearly limits of radiation are 5,000 mrem to the torso and 50,000 mrem to the hands. Exposure to the hands may be higher than previously estimated, even from the mini C-arm. Potential decreases in radiation exposure can be accomplished by reduced exposure time; increased distance from the beam; increased shielding with gown, thyroid gland cover, gloves, and glasses; beam collimation; using the low-dose option; inverting the C-arm; and surgeon control of the C-arm.",Excluded

Introduction and Objective: It is a routine practice to get postoperative X-ray done after supracostal access in PCNL. Although the incidence of hydro-pneumothorax is very less and routine X-ray chest unnecessarily increase the radiation exposure to patients. The aim of our study was to assess the role of postoperative X-ray chest after supra costal puncture in PCNL for the detection and management of pneumothorax and/or hydrothorax. Material(s) and Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed 347 patients who underwent PCNL at our institute between Jan. 2007 and February 2011. 66.6% were male and 33.4% were female. Out of 347 PCNL supracostal upper calyceal puncture was done in 102 patients: 54 on right side and 48 on left side. In 23 patients three punctures were made and 31 patients required two tracts for complete stone clearance. Result(s): All punctures were done between 11-12th intercostal space and all patients underwent a post operative X-ray chest. In 1 patient hydro pneumothorax was detected which improved after intercostal chest tube drainage. One patient had mild pleural effusion which was managed conservatively. Both these patients had complaint of respiratory difficulty in postoperative period. In rest of the patients chest X-rays were normal and had no respiratory discomfort in post operative period. Conclusion(s): Routine post operative X-ray chest is not mandatory after every PCNL with supracostal access. When intra-operative pneumothorax is suspected or patient complain of respiratory difficulty in postoperative period then X-ray chest should be done.,Excluded

OBJECTIVES: To retrospectively evaluate outcomes among cancer survivors previously treated with thoracic radiotherapy (RT) who later underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)., METHODS: From 1998 to 2012, 76 patients first received curative RT (>30 Gy, except for Hodgkin lymphoma patients) involving the heart and lungs followed by PCI. Heart and lung-specific dosimetric parameters were correlated with overall survival (OS) and cardiac-specific survival by Cox variate methods., RESULTS: The mean interval between cancer diagnosis and PCI was 3.7 years (range, 0.1 to 12.6 y). Median follow-up since cancer diagnosis was 5.5 years. At analysis, 46 patients (61%) were alive, 5 (7%) died of cardiac causes, and 9 (12%) of cancer. Higher maximum RT heart dose was related to poorer OS since PCI (P=0.009). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (P=0.005) and higher mean heart dose (P<0.001) were related to poorer OS since cancer diagnosis. beta-Blockers, higher mean heart dose (hazard ratio [HR]=1.49, P<0.001), and percentage of targeted volume or organ receiving >=40 Gy for heart doses (HR=1.32, P<0.001) were associated with poorer non-cancer-specific survival since cancer diagnosis. Diabetes (HR=3.84, P=0.008) and increased percentage of targeted volume or organ receiving >=45 Gy (HR=1.01 per additional 100 cm irradiated, P=0.01) for the heart decreased major adverse cardiac event-free survival., CONCLUSIONS: Prior heart and lung-directed RT had volume-dependent and dose-dependent adverse effects on long-term cardiac outcomes for patients subsequently treated with PCI.

Importance: Oral mucositis causes substantial morbidity during head and neck radiotherapy. In a randomized study, doxepin mouthwash was shown to reduce oral mucositis-related pain. A common mouthwash comprising diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid is also widely used., Objective: To evaluate the effect of doxepin mouthwash or diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash for the treatment of oral mucositis-related pain., Design, Setting, and Participants: A phase 3 randomized trial was conducted from November 1, 2014, to May 16, 2016, at 30 US institutions and included 275 patients who underwent definitive head and neck radiotherapy, had an oral mucositis pain score of 4 points or greater (scale, 0-10), and were followed up for a maximum of 28 days., Interventions: Ninety-two patients were randomized to doxepin mouthwash (25 mg/5 mL water); 91 patients to diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid; and 92 patients to placebo., Main Outcome and Measures: The primary end point was total oral mucositis pain reduction (defined by the area under the curve and adjusted for baseline pain score) during the 4 hours after a single dose of doxepin mouthwash or diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash compared with a single dose of placebo. The minimal clinically important difference was a 3.5-point change. The secondary end points included drowsiness, unpleasant taste, and stinging or burning. All scales ranged from 0 (best) to 10 (worst)., Results: Among the 275 patients randomized (median age, 61 years; 58 [21%] women), 227 (83%) completed treatment per protocol. Mucositis pain during the first 4 hours decreased by 11.6 points in the doxepin mouthwash group, by 11.7 points in the diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash group, and by 8.7 points in the placebo group. The between-group difference was 2.9 points (95% CI, 0.2-6.0; P = .02) for doxepin mouthwash vs placebo and 3.0 points (95% CI, 0.1-5.9; P = .004) for diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash vs placebo. More drowsiness was reported with doxepin mouthwash vs placebo (by 1.5 points [95% CI, 0-4.0]; P = .03), unpleasant taste (by 1.5 points [95% CI, 0-3.0]; P = .002), and stinging or burning (by 4.0 points [95% CI, 2.5-5.0]; P < .001). Maximum grade 3 adverse events for the doxepin mouthwash occurred in 3 patients (4%); diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash, 3 (4%); and placebo, 2 (2%). Fatigue was reported by 5 patients (6%) in the doxepin mouthwash group and no patients in the diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash group., Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients undergoing head and neck radiotherapy, the use of doxepin mouthwash or diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash vs placebo significantly reduced oral mucositis pain during the first 4 hours after administration; however, the effect size was less than the minimal clinically important difference.

4157,"Evaluation of non ionizing radiation around the dielectric heaters and sealers: A case report. Dielectric heaters and sealers present the most common source of occupational exposure to excessive radio frequency (RF) fields. These systems are used industrially to heat or melt dielectric materials. Nowadays, the effects of high frequency electromagnetic (EM) fields on the health have been discussed frequently but there are few health studies done for workers around dielectric heaters and sealers. In this study, the leakage fields around dielectric heaters and sealers (27.12MHz) were measured in MKE Mechanical and Chemical Industry Corporation, Gazi Rocket Factory and evaluated in terms of standards. It has been observed that operators exposed to same RF fields with occupational exposure limits. Many workers have health complaints, such as elevated body temperatures in the factory. Safe distances or areas for workers should be recommended in these systems. Protective measures could be implemented to minimize these exposures. Further measurements and occupational exposure studies of RF exposed women and men are needed to demonstrate the levels of exposed Radio Frequency Radiation (RFR). Precautions should therefore be taken either to reduce the leakage fields or minimise the exposed fields. 2010 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.",Excluded

Background: Acoustic radiation force impulse elastography (ARFI) is a new ultrasound based method for the non-invasive evaluation of liver fibrosis. The aim of our paper was to find out which one, the mean or then median values of ARFI measurements, is the most accurate for liver stiffness (LS) evaluation. Patients and Methods: Our study included 179 subjects (92 females and 87 males, mean age 46.9+/-15.9): 69 subjects without fibrosis (healthy volunteers - considered F0 Metavir), 8 subjects with F1, 25 subjects with F2, 24 patients with F3 (all patients underwent liver biopsy) and 53 patients with liver cirrhosis (16 with liver biopsy and 37 with clinically, ultrasonographic and/or endoscopic signs of cirrhosis). In each patient we performed ARFI (by using a Siemens Acuson S2000TM ultrasound system) and: 10 measurements (mean and median values were calculated, measured in meters/second). We compared the diagnostic performance of ARFI mean and median values. Result(s): A direct, strong, linear correlation (Spearman rho=0.663) was found between median ARFI measurements and fibrosis (p<0.0001), as well as between mean ARFI measurements and fibrosis (rho=0.655) (p<0.0001). There were not statistically significant differences between the predictive values of mean and median values of ARFI measurements for significant fibrosis (F>=2 Metavir), severe fibrosis (F>=3 Metavir) and cirrhosis, as seen in the following table: Conclusion(s): For ARFI evaluation of liver fibrosis, mean or median values can probably be used with the same diagnostic performances.

Strategies that reduce food system mass without negatively impacting food intake, acceptability, and resulting astronaut health and performance are essential for mission success in extreme operational environments such as space exploration. Here, we report the impact of substituting the spaceflight standard breakfast with energy equivalent, calorically-dense meal replacement bars (MRBs) on consumption, acceptability, and satiety and on associations with physical and behavioral health outcomes in high-performing subjects completing 30-day missions in the isolated and confined operational environment of NASA's Human Exploration Research Analog (HERA) habitat. MRB implementation was associated with reduced daily caloric intake, weight loss, and decrements in mood and neurobehavioral functioning, with no significant impacts on somatic symptoms and physical functioning. Food acceptability ratings suggest that flavor, texture, and menu fatigue attributed to limited variety are contributing factors, which are exacerbated by a daily implementation schedule. Meal replacement strategies for short-duration missions are operationally feasible, moderately acceptable, and can contribute to the practical goal of mass reduction, but more work is needed to define and optimize flavors, variety, and implementation schedules that sustain adequate nutrition, physical and behavioral health, and operational performance over time in isolated, confined, and extreme mission environments.Copyright © 2020",Excluded

4161,"Clinical criteria for obtaining maxillofacial computed tomographic scans in trauma patients. BACKGROUND: Over 150,000 patients present with maxillofacial trauma annually to emergency rooms in the United States. Although maxillofacial computed tomography is a sensitive screening tool for identifying facial fractures, indiscriminate use leads to unnecessary radiation exposure and substantial costs. A decision instrument is needed to ensure computed tomographic evaluation of patients at high risk for facial fracture and limit computed tomography use in low-risk patients., METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of all patients evaluated at a Level I trauma center over a 3-year period. Inclusion criteria were maxillofacial examination on presentation, maxillofacial computed tomography, and head computed tomography. A total of 525 patients met the enrollment criteria., RESULTS: Injury to the maxillofacial skeleton occurred in 332 patients (63.2 percent). The presence of any of the following five physical examination criteria identified patients at high risk for facial fracture: bony stepoff or instability, periorbital swelling or contusion, Glasgow Coma Scale score less than 14, malocclusion, or tooth absence. These criteria identified all but six of the 332 patients with a facial fracture (sensitivity, 98.2 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 96.5 to 99.1 percent). The negative predictive value was 87.8 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 76.3 to 94.2 percent). No patient determined by these criteria to be at low risk for a facial fracture required surgical treatment. If these criteria had been applied to the study population, radiographic imaging could have been avoided in 9.3 percent of patients., CONCLUSIONS: A decision instrument based on clinical criteria can ensure appropriate screening of patients at high risk for facial fracture. Application of this instrument may reduce unnecessary maxillofacial imaging.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To characterize, at the histopathologic and molecular levels, the irradiated epidermis in cases of human skin fibrosis induced by radiotherapy., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Surgical samples were obtained from 6 patients who had developed cutaneous fibronecrotic lesions from 7 months to 27 years after irradiation. The proliferation and differentiation status of the irradiated epidermis was characterized with specific markers using immunohistochemical methods., RESULTS: All samples presented with hyperplasia of the epidermis associated with local inflammation. The scar epidermis exhibited an increased expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, which revealed hyperproliferation of keratinocytes. Furthermore, an abnormal differentiation was found, characterized by the expression of K6 and K16, and by alterations in protein amounts and localization of cytokeratins, involucrin, and transforming growth factor-beta1., CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that late damage of irradiated skin is not only characterized by fibrosis in the dermis but also by hyperplasia in the epidermis.

Formation of conformal dose distribution was obtained by multileaf (40-pair) collimator with a 0.25 mm accuracy of positioning. Frame fixation was standard. Dose distribution was calculated via XiO system. Patient positioning inaccuracy was measured by X-ray Volume Imaging (XVIm). The correction of patient's position was preformed automatically with HexaPod system, resulting in 0.1 mm accuracy by linear coordinates and 0.1degree by angular coordinates. Result(s): In the 6-months of postradiation period the stabilization of tumor and regression of symptoms was found in all patients. At the 12 months follow-up period tumor shrinking was found in 3 patients, in other cases the stabilization of tumor was observed. There were no severe adverse events. Conclusion(s): Our moderate experience of SRT of patients with brain tumors shows an effectiveness of the method. Moreover, in cases of tumor localization in eloquent areas and in patients with high operative risk, SRT implementation presents as the only accessible type of treatment.

In this study, we examined the effect of metformin use on pathologic complete response (pCR) rates and outcomes in rectal cancer. The charts of 482 patients with locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma treated from 1996 to 2009 with chemoradiation and TME were reviewed. Median radiation dose was 50.4 Gy (range 19.8-63). Nearly, all patients were treated with concurrent 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy (98%) followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (81.3%). Patients were categorized as nondiabetic (422), diabetic not taking metformin (40), or diabetic taking metformin (20). No significant differences between groups were found in clinical tumor classification, nodal classification, tumor distance from the anal verge or circumferential extent, pretreatment carcinoembryonic antigen level, or pathologic differentiation. pCR rates were 16.6% for nondiabetics, 7.5% for diabetics not using metformin, and 35% for diabetics taking metformin, with metformin users having significantly higher pCR rates than either nondiabetics (P = 0.03) or diabetics not using metformin (P = 0.007). Metformin use was significantly associated with pCR rate on univariate (P = 0.05) and multivariate (P = 0.01) analyses. Furthermore, patients taking metformin had significantly increased disease-free (P = 0.013) and overall survival (P = 0.008) compared with other diabetic patients. Metformin use is associated with significantly higher pCR rates as well as improved survival. These promising data warrant further prospective study. © 2013 The Authors.

Continuous accelerated irradiation of 7-days per week is equal to accelerated fractionation with concomitant boost of 7 fractions in 5-days per week: Report on phase 3 clinical trial in head-and-neck cancer patients. Purpose: To report long-term results of randomized trial comparing 2 accelerated fractionations of definitive radiation therapy assessing the need to irradiate during weekend in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Methods and Materials: A total of 345 patients with SCC of the oral cavity, larynx, and oro- or hypo-pharynx, stage T2-4N0-1M0, were randomized to receive continuous accelerated irradiation (CAIR: once per day, 7 days per week) or concomitant accelerated boost (CB: once per day, 3 days per week, and twice per day, 2 days per week). Total dose ranged from 66.6-72 Gy, dose per fraction was 1.8 Gy, number of fractions ranged from 37-40 fractions, and overall treatment time ranged from 37-40 days. Result(s): No differences for all trial end-points were noted. At 5 and 10 years, the actuarial rates of local-regional control were 63% and 60% for CAIR vs 65% and 60% for CB, and the corresponding overall survival were 40% and 25% vs 44% and 25%, respectively. Confluent mucositis was the main acute toxicity, with an incidence of 89% in CAIR and 86% in CB patients. The 5-year rate of grade 3-4 late radiation morbidity was 6% for both regimens. Conclusion(s): Results of this trial indicate that the effects of accelerated fractionation can be achieve by delivering twice-per-day irradiation on weekday(s). This trial has also confirmed that an accelerated, 6-weeks schedule is a reasonable option for patients with intermediate-stage head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma because of the associated high cure rate and minimal severe late toxicity. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

4169,"A simple and effective daily pain management method for patients receiving radiation therapy for painful bone metastases. Purpose: The incidence of painful bone metastases increases with longer survival times. Although external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) is an effective palliative treatment, it often requires several days from the start of treatment to produce a measurable reduction in pain scores and a qualitative amelioration of patient pain levels. Meanwhile, the use of analgesics remains the best approach early on in the treatment course. We investigated the role of radiation therapists as key personnel for collecting daily pain scores to supplement assessments by physician and oncology nursing staff and manage pain more effectively during radiation treatment. Methods and Materials: Daily pain scores were obtained by the radiation therapists for 89 patients undertaking a total of 124 courses of EBRT for bone metastases and compared with pretreatment pain scores. The majority of patients (71%) were treated to 30 Gy (range, 20-37.5) in 10 fractions (range, 8-15 fractions). Result(s): One hundred nineteen treatment courses (96%) were completed. Pain scores declined rapidly to 37.5%, 50%, and 75% of the pretreatment levels by Days 2, 4, and 10, respectively. Pain was improved in 91% of patients with only 4% of worse pain at the end of treatment. Improved pain scores were maintained in 83% of patients at 1-month follow-up, but in 35% of them, the pain was worse than at the end of treatment.

4170,"Phosphorylation of Ser312 contributes to tumor suppression by p53 in vivo. The tumor suppressor p53 is a master sensor of stress, and posttranslational modifications are key in controlling its stability and transcriptional activities. p53 can be phosphorylated on at least 23 Ser/Thr residues, the majority of which are phosphorylated by stress-related kinases. An exception is Ser315 in human p53 (Ser312 in mouse), which is predominantly phosphorylated by cell cyclerelated kinases. To understand the biological importance of Ser312 phosphorylation in vivo, wegenerated p53Ser312Ala knock-in mice. We show here that, although Ser312 is not essential for mouse life span under normal physiological conditions, Ser312Ala mutation dampens p53's activity during embryonic development. This is evident from its partial rescue of embryonic lethality caused by Mdm4 deletion. In agreement with the notion that Ser312 mutation weakens p53 function, Ser312Ala mice are alsomore susceptible to tumorigenesis following a sublethal ionizing radiation dose. Importantly, in the cohort studied, Ser312 mutation predisposes mice to develop thymic lymphomas and liver tumors, partly due to p53Ser312Ala's inability to fully induce a set of p53 target genes including p21 and cyclin G1. Thus, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of Ser312 is required for p53 to function fully as a tumor suppressor in vivo.",Excluded

A significantly higher complete response rate was observed with doses equal to or above 55 Gy and with doses corresponding to cumulative radiation effect (CRE) values of 1700 radiation effect units (reu) or more. In multivariate analysis, decreasing time from the first diagnosis of bladder carcinoma to radiation treatment and 1 or more transurethral resections was associated with a significant increase in survival; increases in T category and sedimentation rate were negative prognostic factors. Although both radiation dose and CRE levels had a significant effect on survival in univariate analysis, an increase in CRE levels alone was associated with a significant increase in survival in multivariate analysis. However, the most important predictor of survival was whether the patient showed a complete local response or not. This study emphasises the importance of treating patients with an adequate radiation dose over a short period of time in order to achieve the maximum radiobiological effect and thereby increase the possibility of cure.",Excluded

4174,"Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy for Unresectable/Locally Recurrent Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate outcomes for patients with unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) treated with hypofractionated proton or photon radiation therapy (HF-RT)., METHODS: We retrospectively identified 66 patients with ICC who were treated with HF-RT from 2008 to 2018. Median age at RT was 76 years (range 30-92), including 27 patients (41%) aged >= 80 years. Median RT dose was 58.05 Gy (range 37.5-67.5), all delivered in 15 daily fractions. Thirty-two patients received proton RT and 34 patients received photon RT., RESULTS: Median follow-up times from diagnosis and RT start were 21 months and 14 months, respectively. In total, five patients (7.6%) developed local failure. The 2-year outcomes were 84% local control (LC) and 58% OS. Among the 51 patients treated with definitive intent, the 2-year LC rate was 93% and the OS rate was 62%. On multivariate analysis for LC, older age was associated with a lower risk of local failure [hazard ratio (HR) 0.91; p = 0.02], while prior surgery (HR 16.5; p = 0.04) and macrovascular invasion (HR 123.93; p = 0.02) were independently associated with an increased risk of local failure. On multivariate analysis for OS, female sex (HR 0.33; p = 0.001) and prior chemotherapy (HR 0.38; p = 0.003) remained significantly associated with OS. On multivariate analysis for OS, compared with photon RT, there was a trend towards improved survival with proton RT (HR 0.50; p = 0.05). The rate of overall grade 3 + toxicity was 11%. One patient developed radiation-induced liver disease and was treated with corticosteroids., CONCLUSIONS: HF-RT yields high rates of local control and is an effective modality to optimize biliary control for unresectable/locally recurrent ICC.",Excluded

4177,"Proton versus photon craniospinal irradiation for hematologic malignancies involving the CNS: Effectiveness and toxicity in the setting of stem cell transplant. Purpose/Objective(s): Craniospinal irradiation (CSI) improves local control of leukemia and lymphoma with CNS involvement. However, for adult patients anticipating subsequent autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT), cumulative acute organ and neurotoxicity is of concern, as CSI fields are extensive and salvage therapy and SCT conditioning regimens are also toxic. We compared toxicity profiles and outcomes of patients receiving proton vs. photon CSI prior to SCT. Materials/Methods: We identified 87 consecutive patients (age>18) treated at our institution with CSI for hematologic malignancy with CNS involvement from 2011-2015. Of these, 37 patients received CSI prior to SCT using proton or photon technique. Outcomes were compared by CSI technique, including: acute toxicities from CSI through SCT admission plus 100 days, long-term neurotoxicity, disease response, and overall survival. We compared proton vs. photon CSI using Fisher's exact test and Wilcoxon rank sum test. Result(s): In 37 patients, 38% received proton and 62% photon CSI, for CNS involvement of ALL (49%), AML (22%), CLL (3%), CML (14%), lymphoma (11%) and myeloma (3%) (PZ0.77, no difference by CSI technique). Allogeneic SCT was used in 95% of patients, with 53% in 1st or 2nd complete remission before SCT. Myeloablative conditioning was used for 76%. CSI was used for consolidation in 81% and to treat gross CNS disease in 19% (PZ0.22, no difference). Median radiation dose (range) was: 24 Gy (23.4-30.6) for protons and 24 Gy (19.6-30) for photons (PZ0.03). By CSI technique, only acute mucositis risks differed: Lower rates of RTOG Grade 1-3 mucositis occurred with proton CSI compared with photon CSI (7% vs. 44%, P=0.03; 1 Grade 3 with protons vs. 5 Grade 1, 3 Grade 2, and 2 Grade 3 with photons). No other differences by CSI technique were observed, including infection (16%) and GI (30%) toxicity. No toxicity differences by CSI technique were apparent during SCT admission, including mucositis (49%), infection (43%), and acute graft vs. host disease (42%); or after SCT, including severe neurotoxicity characterized by diffuse demyelination (3%). No differences were found for admission median length of stay (32 days) or ICU use (26%). Successful engraftment occurred in 95% of patients (PZ0.67, no difference). Forty-seven percent of patients ultimately progressed or died, but only one patient had a CNS relapse through last follow-up (PZ0.36, no difference). Conclusion(s): In our cohort, CSI offered excellent local control for CNSinvolved hematologic malignancies in the pre-SCT setting. Proton CSI demonstrated improved acute mucositis profile during the radiation course and subsequently, comparable peri-transplant and long-term toxicity and disease outcomes compared with photon CSI.",Excluded
4178,"The Artemis Program: An Overview of NASA's Activities to Return Humans to the Moon. NASA is developing a two-phased approach to quickly return humans to the Moon and establish a sustainable presence in orbit and on the surface. The two phases run in parallel, and both have already begun, with selection of the first Gateway element, the Power and Propulsion Element, solicitation activities focused on an American-built, industry-provided Human Landing System, and discussions with industry and international partners about potential opportunities for collaboration. Phase 1 is driven exclusively by the administration's priority to land the first woman and the next man on the lunar South Pole by 2024. In this phase, NASA and its partners will develop and deploy two Gateway components: the Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) that will launch in 2022, and the Habitation and Logistics Outpost (HALO), a minimal habitation capability) that will launch in 2023. Both will launch on commercial rockets, as will Gateway logistics deliveries to outfit the ship and provide supplies for surface expeditions. This initial Gateway configuration represents the beginning of its capability buildup, and the primary components required to support the first human expedition to the lunar South Pole. NASA's baseline reference approach for human expeditions on the surface is for Human Landing Systems to aggregate and dock to the Gateway, then deploy to the lunar South Pole with two astronauts aboard. Phase 2 is focused on advancing the technologies that will foster a sustainable presence on and around the Moon - a lasting and productive presence enabled by reusable systems, access for a diverse body of contributing partners, and repeatable trips to multiple destinations across the lunar surface. In this Phase, we will advance sustainable systems to make surface expeditions more repeatable and affordable. While the Gateway is the first of its kind to be funded, the concept has been proposed for decades as a necessary and foundational capability for a sustainable return to the Moon, and a port for vehicles embarking to farther destinations. It supports every tenet of Space Policy Directive-1 and the infrastructure it provides is critical to an accelerated return to the Moon, and access to more parts of the Moon than ever before. The Gateway also provides a unique platform to conduct cross-discipline science. Science instruments, both internal and external to the Gateway, have the potential to reveal new findings in space science, Earth science, and biological research data from deep space. Additionally, the broad science community will be able to utilize the communications and data relay capabilities of the Gateway, beginning with the PPE in Phase 1. This paper will outline the cross-discipline activities NASA is currently conducting, and those the agency anticipates conducting in the future to successfully implement Phases 1 and 2 in the lunar vicinity, all while preparing for humanity's next giant leap: Mars. 2020 IEEE.",Excluded
4179,"Benefits for bone from resistance exercise and nutrition in long-duration spaceflight: Evidence from biochemistry and densitometry. Exercise has shown little success in mitigating bone loss from long-duration spaceflight. The first crews of the International Space Station (ISS) used the ""interim resistive exercise device"" (iRED), which allowed loads of up to 297 lb(f) (or 1337 N) but provided little protection of bone or no greater protection than aerobic exercise. In 2008, the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED), which allowed absolute loads of up to 600 lb(f) (1675 N), was launched to the ISS. We report dietary intake, bone densitometry, and biochemical markers in 13 crewmembers on ISS missions from 2006 to 2009. Of these 13, 8 had access to the iRED and 5 had access to the ARED. In both groups, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase tended to increase during flight toward the end of the mission (p = 0.06) and increased 30 days after landing (p < 0.001). Most markers of bone resorption were also increased in both groups during flight and 30 days after landing (p < 0.05). Bone densitometry revealed significant interactions (time and exercise device) for pelvis bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (p < 0.01), hip femoral neck BMD (p < 0.05), trochanter BMD (p < 0.05), and total hip BMD (p < 0.05). These variables were unchanged from preflight only for ARED crewmembers, who also returned from flight with higher percent lean mass and lower percent fat mass. Body mass was unchanged after flight in both groups. All crewmembers had nominal vitamin D status (75 +/- 17 nmol/L) before and during flight. These data document that resistance exercise, coupled with adequate energy intake (shown by maintenance of body mass determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry [DXA]) and vitamin D, can maintain bone in most regions during 4- to 6-month missions in microgravity. This is the first evidence that improving nutrition and resistance exercise during spaceflight can attenuate the expected BMD deficits previously observed after prolonged missions.

Thyroid hormones accelerate bone metabolism. Thus, supraphysiologic doses of this hormone might be used as a model to accelerate bone metabolism during bed rest and potentially simulate space flight. The objective of the study was to quantitate the changes in bone turnover after low doses of triiodothyronine (T(3)) added to short-term bed rest. Nine men and 5 women were restricted to bed rest for 28 days with their heads positioned 6 degrees below their feet. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or oral T(3) at doses of 50 to 75 microg/d in a single-blind fashion. Calcium balance was measured over 5-day periods; and T(3), thyroxine, thyroid-stimulating hormone, immunoreactive parathyroid hormone, osteocalcin, bone alkaline phosphatase, and urinary deoxypyridinoline were measured weekly. Triiodothyronine increased 2-fold in the men and 5-fold in the women during treatment, suppressing both thyroxine and thyroid-stimulating hormone. Calcium balance was negative by 300 to 400 mg/d in the T(3)-treated volunteers, primarily because of the increased fecal loss that was not present in the placebo group. Urinary deoxypyridinoline to creatinine ratio, a marker of bone resorption, increased 60% in the placebo group during bed rest, but more than doubled in the T(3)-treated subjects (P < .01), suggesting that bone resorption was enhanced by treatment with T(3). Changes in serum osteocalcin and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, markers of bone formation, were similar in T(3)- and placebo-treated subjects.

4181,"Statistical shape modeling predicts patellar bone geometry to enable stereo-radiographic kinematic tracking. Complications in the patellofemoral (PF) joint of patients with total knee replacements include patellar subluxation and dislocation, and remain a cause for revision. Kinematic measurements to assess these complications and evaluate implant designs require the accuracy of dynamic stereo-radiographic systems with 3D-2D registration techniques. While tibiofemoral kinematics are typically derived by tracking metallic implants, PF kinematic measurements are difficult as the patellar implant is radiotransparent and a representation of the resected patella bone requires either pre-surgical imaging and precise implant placement or post-surgical imaging. Statistical shape models (SSMs), used to characterize anatomic variation, provide an alternative means to obtain the representation of the resected patella for use in kinematic tracking. Using a virtual platform of a stereo-radiographic system, the objectives of this study were to evaluate the ability of an SSM to predict subject-specific 3D implanted patellar geometries from simulated 2D image profiles, and to formulate an effective data collection methodology for PF kinematics by considering accuracy for a variety of patient pose scenarios. An SSM of the patella was developed for 50 subjects and a leave-one-out approach compared SSM-predicted and actual geometries; average 3D errors were 0.45 +/- 0.07 mm (mean +/- standard deviation), which is comparable to the accuracy of traditional segmentation. Further, initial imaging of the patella in five unique stereo radiographic perspectives yielded the most accurate representation. The ability to predict the remaining patellar geometry of the implanted PF joint with radiographic images and SSM, instead of CT, can reduce radiation exposure and streamline in vivo kinematic evaluations.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
4182,"Biodistribution and radiation dosimetry in healthy volunteers of a novel tumour-specific probe for PET/CT imaging: BAY 85-8050. Purpose: Novel tracers for the diagnosis of malignant disease with PET and PET/CT are being developed as the most commonly used 18F deoxyglucose (FDG) tracer shows certain limitations. Employing radioactively labelled glutamate derivatives for specific imaging of the truncated citrate cycle potentially allows more specific tumour imaging. Radiation dosimetry of the novel tracer BAY 85-8050, a glutamate derivative, was calculated and the effective dose (ED) was compared with that of FDG. Method(s): Five healthy volunteers were included in the study. Attenuation-corrected whole-body PET/CT scans were performed from 0 to 90 min, at 120 and at 240 min after injection of 305.0 +/- 17.6 MBq of BAY 85-8050. Organs with moderate to high uptake at any of the imaging time points were used as source organs. Total activity in each organ at each time point was measured. Time-activity curves (TAC) were determined for the whole body and all source organs. The resulting TACs were fitted to exponential equations and accumulated activities were determined. OLINDA/EXM software was used to calculate individual organ doses and the whole-body ED from the acquired data. Result(s): Uptake of the tracer was highest in the kidneys due to renal excretion of the tracer, followed by the pancreas, heart wall and osteogenic cells. The mean organ doses were: kidneys 38.4 +/- 11.2 muSv/MBq, pancreas 23.2 +/- 3.8 muSv/MBq, heart wall 17.4 +/- 4.1 muSv/MBq, and osteogenic cells 13.6 +/- 3.5 muSv/MBq. The calculated ED was 8.9 +/- 1.5 muSv/MBq. Conclusion(s): Based on the distribution and dose estimates, the calculated radiation dose of BAY 85-8050 is 2.67 +/- 0.45 mSv at a patient dose of 300 MBq, which compares favourably with the radiation dose of FDG (5.7 mSv). © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
4183,"Comparative toxicity of synchrotron and conventional radiation therapy based on total and partial body irradiation in a murine model. Synchrotron radiation can facilitate novel radiation therapy modalities such as microbeam radiation therapy (MRT) and high dose-rate synchrotron broad-beam radiation therapy (SBBR). Both of these modalities have unique physical properties that could be exploited for an improved therapeutic effect. While pre-clinical studies report promising normal tissue sparing phenomena, systematic toxicity data are still required. Our objective was to characterise the toxicity of SBBR and MRT and to calculate equivalent doses of conventional radiation therapy (CRT). A dose-escalation study was performed on C57BLJ/6 mice using total body and partial body irradiations. Dose-response curves and TD50 values were subsequently calculated using PROBIT analysis. For SBBR at dose-rates of 37 to 41 Gy/s, we found no evidence of a normal tissue sparing effect relative to CRT. Our findings also show that the MRT valley dose, rather than the peak dose, best correlates with CRT doses for acute toxicity. Importantly, longer-term weight tracking of irradiated animals revealed more pronounced growth impairment following MRT compared to both SBBR and CRT. Overall, this study provides the first in vivo dose-equivalence data between MRT, SBBR and CRT and presents systematic toxicity data for a range of organs that can be used as a reference point for future pre-clinical work.",Excluded
4184,"Radon testing in rapid access lung clinics: an opportunity for secondary prevention. Background: Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas and a level 1 carcinogen. It acts synergistically with cigarette smoke to cause lung cancer. In Ireland, radon is estimated to be associated with 13 % of all lung cancers. Rapid access lung cancer clinics (RALC's) were established in the UK and Ireland to improve lung cancer management outcomes. There has been no attempt to date to provide advice on household radon exposure assessments in this setting. Aim(s): We performed a prospective feasibility study of radon assessment in our RALC to test the hypothesis that patients would avail of this service and that it would provide an opportunity for secondary prevention in at risk persons. Method(s): We investigated household radon levels in consecutive patients who were newly referred with symptoms of lung cancer to the RALC in Galway University Hospital, Ireland over a 6-month period. Result(s): Of 50 patients enrolled, 42 returned valid results. Overall 21 % of patients had radon levels recorded above the national reference level. Only 5 % of patients were aware of the association between radon gas and lung cancer. Smokers were significantly less likely to engage fully in radon testing.

Purpose: Treatment planning of skull based meningiomas can be difficult due to the irregular shaped target volumes and proximity to critical optic structures. This study evaluated the use of HyperArc (HA) radiosurgery optimization and delivery in conjunction with multicriteria optimization (MCO) to create conformal and efficient treatment plans for conventionally fractionated radiation therapy to difficult base-of-skull (BOS) lesions. Methods and Materials: Twelve patients with BOS meningioma were retrospectively planned with HA-specific optimization algorithm, stereotactic normal tissue objective (SRS-NTO), and conventional automatic normal tissue objective to evaluate normal brain sparing (mean dose and V20 Gy). MCO was used on both SRS-NTO and automatic normal tissue objective plans to further decrease organ-at-risk doses and target dose maximum to within clinically acceptable constraints. Delivery efficiency was evaluated based on planned monitor units. Result(s): The SRS-NTO in HA can be used to improve the mid- and low-dose spread to normal brain tissue in the irradiation of BOS meningiomas. Improvement in normal brain sparing can be seen in larger, more irregular shaped lesions and less so in smaller spherical targets. MCO can be used in conjunction with the SRS-NTO to reduce target dose maximum and dose to organ at risk without sacrificing the gain in normal brain sparing. Conclusion(s): HA can be beneficial both in treatment planning by using the SRS-NTO and in delivery efficiency through the decrease in monitor units and automated delivery.Copyright © 2021",Excluded

Electromagnetic navigation with or without endobronchial ultrasound for diagnosis of the above has been well described. Bronchoscopic Trans Bronchial Access Tool is a novel endoscopic technique that creates a virtual pathway to the lesion and is less limited by location of the airway. The CrossCountryTM Transbronchial Access Tool (CovidienTM, Plymouth, MN, USA) is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved off airway device that utilizes a catheter equipped guide sheath for a trans-parenchymal approach to a distal lesion. Cone beam computer tomography (CBCT) is a real-time onsite extrathoracic navigational modality used in the bronchoscopy suite that allows for an open working channel. All three of the above modalities can have reasonable diagnostic yields when used independently. While utilizing the above tools we frequently found ourselves in situations where one technique was not enough, prompting the use of a combination of modalities to obtain the most efficient and accurate diagnosis. We are reporting the feasibility and safety of utilizing these three modalities in conjunction with one another. Method(s): Patients with peripheral pulmonary nodules on chest computed tomography underwent a navigation bronchoscopy under general anesthesia. CBCT and radial ultrasound was used in every case to confirm navigation to the target lesion. Lesions without definitive airways leading to them were accessed with the transbronchial access tool (TBAT). Result(s): Electromagnetic bronchoscopy using CBCT and radial US was performed on 22 patients from April 2016 to September 2016. The TBAT tool was used in 7 patients.

4192,"Mortality from solid cancers other than lung, liver, and bone in relation to external dose among plutonium and non-plutonium workers in the Mayak Worker Cohort. Exposure to ionizing radiation has well-documented long-term effects on cancer rates and other health outcomes in humans. While in vitro experimental studies had demonstrated that the nature of some radiation effects depend on both total dose of the radiation and the dose rate (i.e., the pattern of dose distribution over time), the question of whether or not the carcinogenic effect of radiation exposure depends on the dose rate remains unanswered. Another issue of interest concerns whether or not concomitant exposure to external gamma rays and inhaled plutonium aerosols has any effect on the external exposure effects. The analyses of the present paper focus on the risk of solid cancers at sites other than lung, liver, and bone in Mayak workers. Recent findings are reviewed indicating that there is no evidence of plutonium dose response for these cancers in the Mayak worker cohort. Then the evidence for differences in the external dose effects among workers with and without the potential for exposure to alpha particles from inhaled plutonium is examined. It is found that there is no evidence that exposure to plutonium aerosols significantly affects the risk associated with external exposure. While the Mayak external dose risk estimate of an excess relative risk of 0.16 per Gy is somewhat lower than an appropriately normalized risk estimate from the Life Span Study of Japanese atomic bomb survivors, the uncertainties in these estimates preclude concluding that the external dose excess relative risks of this group of solid cancers differ in the two cohorts.",Included

4194,"Variability in the amount of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose excreted in urine measured from oncology patients during PET/computed tomography imaging. The objectives of this work were to estimate the amount of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (F-FDG) excreted (AFE) in the patient urine during the uptake phase as percentage of the injected activity and to examine the effect of blood glucose levels (BGL) on the excreted amount and whether it varies among men and women using statistical analysis methods. Radiation dose rates were measured at 1 m from 50 patients, 24 men and 26 women, before and after the first void using a calibrated ionization chamber. The F-FDG was injected in the patients using a calibrated automatic dose injection system. Statistical analysis using hypothesis testing was carried out. Patients with BGL above 5 mmol/l had a higher AFE of 12.3% in comparison with 8.3% of the patients with BGL below 5 mmol/l. A statistically nonsignificant correlation (r=0.183, P<0.249) between AFE and BGL was found; a nonsignificant difference was found in the AFE measured among the male and female patients. The AFE measured was 12+/-6%, with a range of (2-30%). There was a wide variation in the first void time of 39+/-8 min, with a range of (17-68) min. A simple noninvasive measurement method is presented that enabled the estimation of the amount of F-FDG excreted from the patient during voiding. Statistical analysis concluded that the amount of F-FDG excreted does not depend on sex, but is perhaps influenced by BGL.",Excluded
4195,"Nimotuzumab in combination with radiotherapy in high grade glioma patients: A single institution experience. Nimotuzumab, a humanized antibody targeting epidermal growth factor receptor, has potent anti-proliferative, antiangiogenic, and pro-apoptotic effects in vitro and in vivo. It also reduces the number of radio-resistant CD133+ glioma stem cells. The antibody has been extensively evaluated in patients with advanced head and neck, glioma, lung, esophageal, pancreatic, and gastric cancer. In this single institution experience, 35 patients with anaplastic astrocytoma (AA ) or glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) were treated with irradiation and 200 mg doses of nimotuzumab. The first 6 doses were administered weekly, together with radiotherapy, and then treatment continued every 21 days until 1 year. The median number of doses was 12, and the median cumulative dose was thus 2400 mg of nimotuzumab. The most frequent treatment-related toxicities were increase in liver function tests, fever, nausea, anorexia, asthenia, dizziness, and tremors. These adverse reactions were classified as mild and moderate. The median survival time was 12.4 mo or 27.0 mo for patients with GBM or AA patients, respectively, who received curative-intent radiotherapy in combination with the antibody. The survival time of a matched population treated at the same hospital with irradiation alone was decreased (median 8.0 and 12.2 mo for GBM and AA patients, respectively) compared with that of the patients who received nimotuzumab and curative-intent radiotherapy. We have thus confirmed that nimotuzumab is a very well-tolerated drug, lacking cumulative toxicity after maintenance doses. This study, in a poor prognosis population, validates the previous data of survival gain after combining nimotuzumab and radiotherapy, in newly diagnosed high-grade glioma patients. © 2014 Landes Bioscience.",Excluded
4196,"Chromatic organization of ganglion cell receptive fields in the peripheral retina. This study addresses the chromatic properties of receptive fields in the subcortical visual pathway of primates. There is agreement that, in the central visual field, many cells belonging to the parvocellular (PC) division of the subcortical pathway show red-green opponent responses, that a subgroup of cells belonging to the koniocellular (KC) pathway shows blue-yellow opponent responses, and that magnocellular (MC) pathway cells show only weak signs of chromatic input. However, the chromatic properties of ganglion cells in the peripheral retina are poorly understood. Here, we measured the temporal-chromatic properties of ganglion cells in extracellular in vivo recordings from peripheral macaque retina. We show that the chromatic responsivity of peripheral KC (""blue-on"") and MC cells is very similar to that of their counterparts in the foveal retina. Cone-opponent responses are expressed only at low temporal frequencies (<10 Hz) in the majority of peripheral PC cells, and some peripheral PC cells show non-opponent response properties. With these exceptions, the chromatic properties of ganglion cells are essentially preserved throughout the first 50 degrees of visual eccentricity. The main change seen in passing from foveal to peripheral retina is that all ganglion cell classes become more responsive to high temporal-frequency modulation.",Excluded
4197,"MediGuide in supraventricular tachycardia: Initial experience from a multicentre registry. AimsCurrently, fluoroscopy-based catheter visualization is the standard modality in invasive electrophysiological procedures. Recently a new technology for non-fluoroscopic visualization of diagnostic (since 2010) and ablation catheters (since May 2012) has been introduced. The MediGuideTM-Technology (MediGuide) projects catheter tips on prerecorded cine loops in a high time resolution.Methods and resultsWe report on MediGuide-based supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) cases [atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT), atrioventricular reentry tachycardia (AVRT), Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW), ectopic atrial tachycardia (EAT) and typical atrial flutter) from two European centres. In all patients, diagnostic and/or ablation catheters with a special sensor were used to perform the ablation procedures. All procedural data such as acute success, duration of the procedure, fluoroscopy time, and dose and patients' characteristics were analyzed and compared with conventionally ablated patients (n = 1865). Procedure-related complications during the hospital stay were recorded. A total of 24 consecutive patients were analyzed: no significant difference to the control group was seen in the baseline characteristics. The MediGuide patients were predominantly male (66%), aged 58 +/- 14 years and were ablated for 6 AVNRT (25%), 4 AVRT/WPW (17%), 1 EAT (4%), and 13 typical atrial flutter (54%). The acute success rate was 100% (98% in the control group, n.s.). The median fluoroscopy time was 0.5 +/- 1.4 min (10.2 +/- 9.6 in the control group, P < 0.001), the median fluoroscopy dose was 187 +/- 554 cGy cm2 (996 +/- 2593 cGy cm2, P < 0.05). Mean procedure time was 70 +/- 25 min (60 +/- 36 min, n.s.). No complications during the hospital stay were recorded.ConclusionIn several different forms of supraventricular tachycardias the MediGuide-Technology contributed to a dramatic reduction in irradiation exposure. With a median fluoroscopy time of 30 s all SVT cases were effectively performed with no complications; the fluoroscopy burden can be significantly reduced not only for the patient but also for the nurses and the physicians performing the case. The overall procedure times are not prolonged due to the use of MediGuide Technology compared with a control group of >1800 patients undergoing conventional ablation procedures. © 2013 The Author.",Excluded
4198,"Evaluation of new bone formation in irradiated areas using association of mesenchymal stem cells and total fresh bone marrow mixed with calcium phosphate scaffold. The consequences of the treatment of the squamous cell carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract (bone removal and external radiation therapy) are constant. Tissue engineering using biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) is considered as a promising alternative. We previously demonstrated the efficacy of BCP and total fresh bone marrow (TBM) in regenerating irradiated bone defect. The aim of this study was to know if adding MSC to BCP + TBM mixture could improve the bone formation in irradiated bone defects. Twenty-four Lewis 1A rats received a single dose of 20 Gy to the hind limbs. MSC were sampled from non-irradiated donors and amplified in proliferative, and a part in osteogenic, medium. 3 weeks after, defects were created on femurs and tibias, which were filled with BCP alone, BCP + TBM, BCP + TBM + uncommitted MSC, or BCP + TBM + committed MSC. 3 weeks after, samples were removed and prepared for qualitative and quantitative analysis. The rate of bone ingrowth was significantly higher after implantation of BCP + TBM mixture. The adding of a high concentration of MSC, committed or not, didn't improve the bone regeneration. The association BCP + TBM remains the most efficient material for bone substitution in irradiated areas.Copyright © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Excluded

4202,"Cetuximab plus chemoradiotherapy for HIV-associated anal carcinoma: A phase II AIDS malignancy consortium trial. Purpose Squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal (SCCAC) is characterized by high locoregional failure (LRF) rates after definitive chemoradiation (CRT), associated with anogenital human papilloma virus, and often appears in HIV infection. Because cetuximab enhances the effect of radiation therapy in human papilloma virus-associated oropharyngeal SCC, we hypothesized that adding cetuximab to CRT would reduce LRF in SCCAC. Methods Forty-five patients with stage I to III SCCAC and HIV infection received CRT: 45 to 54 Gy radiation therapy to the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes plus eight once-weekly doses of concurrent cetuximab and two cycles of cisplatin and fluorouracil. The study was designed to detect at least a 50% reduction in 3-year LRF rate (one-sided a, 0.10; power, 90%), assuming a 35% LRF rate from historical data. Results The 3-year LRF rate was 42% (95% CI, 28% to 56%; one-sided P = .9) by binomial proportional estimate using the prespecified end point (LRF or alive without LRF and followed , 3 years), and 20% (95% CI, 10% to 37%) by Kaplan-Meier estimate in post hoc analysis using definitions and methods consistent with historical data. Three-year rates by Kaplan-Meier estimate were 72% (95% CI, 56% to 84%) for progression-free survival and 79% (95% CI, 63% to 89%) for overall survival. Grade 4 toxicity occurred in 26%, and 4% had treatment-associated deaths. Conclusion HIV-associated SCCAC is potentially curable with definitive CRT. Although addition of cetuximab may result in less LRF, the 20% recurrence and 26% grade 4 toxicity rates indicate the continued need for more-effective and less-toxic therapies.Copyright © 2016 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",Excluded
4203,"A modified method of shell windowing for producing somatic or germline chimeras in fertilized chicken eggs. Stage X chick blastoderms following oviposition were accessed via a small window in the egg. Windowing, however, substantially reduces the hatchability of eggs containing early embryos. For example, only 32 of 389 (8.2%) eggs hatched after standard windowing with or without irradiation or injection. Ex ovo culture systems can overcome this problem but are labor intensive. A modification of a standard windowing technique has yielded an average hatch rate of 32% for 892 windowed eggs independent of incubator type, gamma-irradiation, or injection of the embryo. This was a fourfold increase over a standard windowing method. Similar hatch rates were observed using fertile eggs from five chicken lines [Barred Plymouth Rock (BR), Athens-Canadian (AC), Line 0, SPAFAS, and commercial White Leghorns (WL)]. The modification involves covering the egg shell membrane with PBS after grinding away the shell and before piercing the membrane. The window is then sealed by overlaying with fresh shell membrane and cementing it in place once it has dried. The method has been used successfully for the production of somatic and germline chimeras because donor BR blastodermal cells injected into Stage X, gamma-irradiated recipient embryos from WL or AC yielded a hatch of 33.7%, of which 42.3% were feather chimeras. Two of 11 cockerels tested were germline mosaics bearing at least 1% BR sperm.

4205,"Comparison of 3D confromal radiotherapy and intensity modulated radiotherapy with or without simultaneous integrated boost during concurrent chemoradiation for locally advanced head and neck cancers. Objective: Radiotherapy techniques have evolved from 3D conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) to intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) where boost fields are delivered either sequentially (IMRTseq) or with a simultaneous integrated boost (IMRT+SIB). Our goal was to compare the outcomes of patients treated with IMRT+SIB to traditional standards. Method(s): We analyzed the efficacy and toxicity of patients treated with concurrent chemoradiation using 3D-CRT, IMRTseq or IMRT+SIB. Between 1993 and 2012, 379 patients with non-metastatic Stage III-IV head and neck squamous cell cancer were treated with concurrent chemoradiation using 3D-CRT (n = 125), IMRTseq (n = 120) and IMRT+SIB (n = 134). Result(s): Patients treated with any technique had similar rates of 2y local control, 2y regional control, 2y progression free survival and 2y overall survival. Patients treated with IMRT +SIB had lower rates acute toxicity according to Grade 3 or greater mucositis (3D-CRT: 44.0% vs. IMRTseq: 36.7% vs. IMRT+SIB: 22.4%; P<.0001), dermatitis (3D-CRT: 44.0% vs. IMRTseq: 20.0% vs. IMRT+SIB: 7.5%; P<.0001) and feeding tube placement during radiotherapy (3D-CRT: 80.0% vs. IMRTseq: 50.8% vs. IMRT+SIB: 44.0%; P<.0001) as well as late toxicity as measured by feeding tube use (P<.0001) and tracheostomy use (P<.0001). On multivariate analysis, IMRT+SIB predicted for less mucositis, dermatitis and feeding tube use compared to 3D-CRT and for less dermatitis compared to IMRTseq. Conclusion(s): Compared to 3D-CRT and IMRTseq, IMRT+SIB provided similar outcomes and potentially less toxicity indicating it is a feasible technique for chemoradiation in locally advanced head and neck cancer. © 2014 Spiotto, Weichselbaum.",Excluded
4206,"Definitive radical external beam radiotherapy for rectal cancer: evaluation of local effectiveness and risk of late small bowel damage. AIM: To present a retrospective analysis of results of definitive radiotherapy for rectal cancer., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty-one consecutive patients with rectal cancer (32% primary, 61% pelvic recurrence and 7% after R2 resection) who could not be treated with surgery underwent external beam radiotherapy. A median tumour dose of 64 Gy was given with 1.8-2.5 Gy per fraction using 2D or 3D technique. In 46% of patients, concurrent 5-Fu-based chemotherapy was given. The median follow-up was 54 months., RESULTS: Clinical complete response was achieved in 39% of patients. Five-year cumulative incidence of local failure, overall survival and cancer specific survival were 76%, 26% and 30%, respectively. Of 11 patients with local control, in five cases the tumour was larger than 5 cm and in the other five the tumour was fixed. Two patients, regarded as locally controlled had non-progressive tumour without local symptoms at the last follow-up of 54 and 118 months post-radiotherapy. Late toxicity occurred in 22% of patients, all with acceptable severity. There was no bowel obstruction requiring surgery despite that in 18 patients the small bowel dose was >60 Gy to a mean volume of 51 cm(3)., CONCLUSION: Definitive radio(chemo)therapy provides a chance for local control even in patients with large fixed or recurrent rectal cancer.",Excluded

Background: A carcinoma is the underlying cause of superior vena cava syndrome (SVCS) in 95-97% of patients. The aim of our study is to retrospectively analyse the outcome of patients after local radiotherapy compared to literature data. Patients and Methods: In 35 consecutively registered patients, irradiated because of SVCS, different primary carcinomas (lung, breast, head-and-neck, Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) were ascertained. Distant metastases had already been diagnosed in 33 patients. Chemotherapy had previously been given in seven patients. Result(s): In 30 patients, radiotherapy obtained a reduction of symptoms within 5-9 days. However, in seven patients, radiotherapy had to be stopped early because of local progress and tumor induced complications. Local recurrences were observed in six patients. The 1-year overall survival rate was 15.6%. Survival rate depended significantly on the performance status (p<0.004). Conclusion(s): Based on literature data our results are comparable regarding the incidence, the radio-oncological procedure and the response to treatment. These data confirm that radiotherapy is the standard treatment in most patients suffering from SVCS. However, it should be determined if endovascular stenting, which is more frequently considered in the last few years in patients with a tumor induced SVCS, may be a useful option as a simultaneous or sequentially given treatment to optimize the palliative effect.",Excluded
4209,"Cell-mediated immunity in operable bronchial carcinoma: the effect of injecting irradiated autologous tumour cells and BCG. In 52 patients undergoing tests of cell-mediated immunity before surgical resection of bronchial carcinoma a positive tuberculin test result was found in 71% compared with 68% of age- and sex-matched controls. Sensitisation to DNCB occurred in 52% of 37 patients but in 78% of controls. There was depression of lymphocyte transformation by PPD in 19 patients compared with controls (P=0.001), but there was no difference in lymphocyte transformation by PHA or pokeweed mitogen between 34 patients and controls. In a pilot study patients were randomly allocated to autograft (eight) or non-autograft (seven) groups. The autograft group were given an intradermal injection of a suspension of irradiated autologous tumour-cells mixed with intradermal BCG on the day of operation. Tests of cell-mediated immunity were repeated two weeks after operation. Five patients in each group received a course of radiotherapy to the mediastinum three weeks after operation. There was a rise in cutaneous tuberculin reactivity (P=0.08) and total leucocyte count (P=0.09) in the autograft group postoperatively with a fall in total lymphocyte and T lymphocyte counts in the non-autograft group (P less 0.05). These differences, however, were not followed by any difference in the frequency of tumour recurrence or the survival rate two years after operation. The results show that the immunological surveillance mechanism is impaired even in patients with early bronchial carcinoma and that it is possible to overcome postoperative immunological depression with specific immunotherapy combined with BCG. This treatment did not produce any clinical advantage in this small number of patients and the skin lesions caused the patients considerable discomfort.",Excluded
4210,"Changes in tumor oxygenation during combined treatment with split- course radiotherapy and chemotherapy in patients with head and neck cancer. Purpose: To evaluate the changes in tumor oxygenation during definitive split-course radiochemotherapy in locally advanced head and neck cancer (lymph nodes and primaries). Material(s) and Method(s): Twenty-four patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer were investigated pretherapeutically and during a defined course of radiochemotherapy (RCTh) with a total dose of 70 Gy given in 35 fractions over 9 weeks (2-week break after 30 Gy). In weeks 1 and 6, the patients received chemotherapy (5 FU and mitomycin C) concomitant with irradiation. The oxygen partial pressure measurements were carried out using polarographic needle probes in combination with a microprocessor-controlled device (pO2 histograph/KIMOC). Times of measurements were before therapy, at the end of week 3 (30 Gy), after a 2- week break (30 Gy) and at the end of therapy if measurable lesion was found (70 Gy). Result(s): There was a significant reduction in the median pO2 (P < 0.005, n = 18) and an increase in the hypoxic fraction (defined as the percentage of pO2 values of <5 mm Hg) after application of 30 Gy (P < 0.05, n = 18). This effect was partially reversed at the end of the 2-week break. During the break an increase in the median pO2 (P = 0.05, n = 12) and a decrease in the hypoxic fraction could be observed. Towards the end of therapy (70 Gy) a significant decrease (P = 0.02, n = 13) in the median pO2 occurred. Corresponding to this, the hypoxic fraction increased during the last 4 weeks of therapy (P = 0.06, n = 13). Conclusion(s): Statistically significant changes in oxygenation in locally advanced head and neck cancer were found during a split-course radiochemotherapy. This information was obtained in a homogenous group of patients under well-defined therapeutic conditions. The decrease in the tumor oxygenation status at doses of 30 and 70 Gy are important findings because they are in contrast to the concept of continuous improvement of the oxygenation status during fractionated radiotherapy.",Excluded

Objective/Background The aim was to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a new method for pre-operative calculation of an appropriate C-arm position for iliac bifurcation visualisation during endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) procedures by using three dimensional computed tomography angiography (CTA) post-processing software. Methods Post-processing software was used to simulate C-arm angulations in two dimensions (oblique, cranial/caudal) for appropriate visualisation of distal landing zones at the iliac bifurcation during EVAR. Retrospectively, 27 consecutive EVAR patients (25 men, mean +/- SD age 73 +/- 7 years) were identified; one group of patients (NEW; n = 12 [23 iliac bifurcations]) was compared after implementation of the new method with a group of patients who received a historic method (OLD; n = 15 [23 iliac bifurcations]), treated with EVAR before the method was applied. Results In the OLD group, a median of 2.0 (interquartile range [IQR] 1-3) digital subtraction angiography runs were needed per iliac bifurcation versus 1.0 (IQR 1-1) runs in the NEW group (p = .007). The median dose area products per iliac bifurcation were 11951 mGy*cm2 (IQR 7308-16663 mGy*cm2) for the NEW, and 39394 mGy*cm2 (IQR 19066-53702 mGy*cm2) for the OLD group, respectively (p = .001). The median volume of contrast per iliac bifurcation was 13.0 mL (IQR: 13-13 mL) in the NEW and 26 mL (IQR 13-39 mL) in the OLD group (p = .007).

Purpose: The aim of this study is to report on clinical and dosimetric endpoints for development of esophagus toxicity (ET) in patients treated with thoracic stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). Methods and materials: One hundred thirty-one patients were treated from 2006 to 2014 with SBRT for primary, recurrent, and metastatic lung tumors. Thirty-four had central lesions. We collected esophageal dosimetric data including Dmax, D1cc, D5cc, and D10cc. We recorded the percent circumferential luminal overlap at 10 Gy intervals from 10 Gy to Dmax, as well as at 24, 39, and 50 Gy, by dividing the extent of overlapping isodose by total esophagus luminal circumference (calculated by 2pi(a2 + b2/2)). Result(s): Of 34 patients included for analysis, 9 had ET and 2 of which had high-grade ET. The mean axial percent esophagus encompassed by 24, 39, and 50 Gy isodose lines of patients with ET vs. no ET was 38.9 vs. 11.5 %, 8.8 vs. 2.3 %, and 5.7 vs. 0.5 % (p = 0.04, 0.16, 0.13, respectively). Mean maximum point dose, D1cc and D5cc for patients with ET vs. those without was 31.2 Gy vs. 18.2 Gy, 25.5 Gy vs. 14.1 Gy, 19.6 Gy vs. 10.0 Gy (p = 0.045, 0.067, 0.071, respectively). Multiple treatment sites and previous thoracic radiation were significantly associated with ET. Conclusion(s): Previous thoracic RT, multiple-site irradiation, and percent esophageal overlap with 39 and 50 Gy isodose lines were most significantly associated with ET. These predictive factors can risk stratify SBRT patients for ET, and the dosimetric factors should be considered in treatment planning to decrease the risk of ET.Copyright © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded

X-ray fluoroscopy is applied in therapeutic procedures, including endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) that is frequently performed. The ERCP procedure is aimed at imaging the pancreatic duct and biliary tracts., MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this paper radiation risk to the gastrenterologist performing ERCP procedures was investigated. The procedures were performed by a single gastroenterologist in the ERCP Laboratory, University Clinical Hospital Military Memorial Medical Academy - Central Veterans' Hospital in Lodz, Poland. The study comprised 2 series of measurements, one taken during the procedures with continuous fluoroscopy mode, the other during procedures with fluoroscopy in pulsed mode at a frequency of 3 pulses/s. Exposure parameters, anatomical data of patient and dose equivalents for the eyes, skin of the hand and the effective dose for whole body of the gastroenterologist were recorded during each procedure., RESULTS: The collected data cover 70 ERCP procedures - 40 procedures were controlled by continuous fluoroscopy and 30 by pulsed fluoroscopy. The results reveal that pulsed fluoroscopy makes it possible to reduce doses received by the gastroeneterologist from 45% to 60% compared to continuous fluoroscopy., CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography procedures can cause radiation risk to the gastroenterologist performing them. The use of continuous fluoroscopy can result in achieving an equivalent dose to eye lens nearly 20 mSv per year, i.e., the decreased annual limit recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP).

Background and purpose To evaluate the outcome of malignant salivary gland tumours treated with neutron therapy to assess the potential for other high linear energy transfer (LET) beams. Materials and methods Neutrons at iThemba LABS are produced by the reaction of 66 MeV protons on a beryllium target. A median dose 20.4 Gy, in 12 fractions in 4 weeks or 15 fractions in 5 weeks, was given to 335 patients with 176 irresectable, 104 macroscopically residual and 55 unresected tumours. Results Locoregional control was 60.6% at 5 years and 39.1% at 10 years and DSS was 66.8% and 53.7% at 5 and 10 years respectively. In the univariate analysis T4, >4 cm, high grade, squamous carcinoma, unresected and irresectable tumours, and positive nodes were significantly worse for LRC. In the multivariate analysis tumours >6 cm, squamous carcinoma, irresectable tumours and nodes were significantly worse for LRC. Tumours >6 cm, high grade, squamous carcinoma and nodes were significantly worse for DSS. Neither LRC nor DSS was influenced by age, sex, site, dose, fractionation or for initial or recurrent disease. Conclusions Neutron therapy appears to be the treatment of choice for macroscopically incompletely excised and irresectable salivary gland tumours with improved survival rates.

4216,"A role for neutrophil elastase in the progression of solar elastosis. Hairless (SKH-1) mice were mated with Beige (C57B/bb) mice to produce a hairless mouse deficient in neutrophil elastase (hhbb). These mice were exposed to 0.09J UVB irradiation for 5 months to see if neutrophil elastase was an important factor in elastin remodeling and development of solar elastoses. Analysis of peritoneal neutrophils confirmed that the hhbb mouse was deficient in elastase, retaining only 10% as much activity as the normal littermates (hhHb). Skin MPO activity was equally elevated in all the mice receiving UVB suggesting an equal influx of inflammatory cells. The absolute breaking strength of the skin in both the hhBb and hhbb mice was not altered by UVB treatment over the 5 month exposure period. Elastin quantitated biochemically as desmosine, or visualized histologically, was increased following UVB exposure in the normal mice. In the elastase deficient mice, however, the elastin fibers appeared to be unaffected by exposure to UVB irradiation at this level. The results suggest that neutrophil elastase is an important mediator in the development of solar elastosis resulting from continued exposure to UVB irradiation.",Excluded

These include immunohistochemical measures for hypoxia and proliferation, volume doubling time (VDT) and local tumour control after fractionated irradiation or after single dose irradiation under clamp hypoxia., RESULTS: We found several significant correlations between the published gene expression signatures and tumour parameters. Several signatures, like the proliferation and wound signature correlated with BrdU labelling index. Further a 'stemness'-related gene signature showed a strong negative correlation with hypoxic fraction., CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous assessment of immunohistochemistry, in vivo tumour properties and gene expression profiling in a comprehensive set of xenograft models can be used to validate and potentially infer biological information about prognostic gene signatures.",Excluded

4220,"Health profiles of 996 melanoma survivors: The M. D. Anderson experience. Background: The incidence and survival of melanoma are increasing, but little is known about its long-term health effects in adult survivors. Method(s): A health survey was available from 996 melanoma survivors (577 treated with surgery alone, and 391 with combined treatments). Their medical/physiologic and psychosocial responses were analyzed and compared with those of the survivors from other cancers. Result(s): The melanoma survivors were 44.8 +/- 12.8 years of age at diagnosis (significantly younger than the survivors of other cancers) and 63.7 +/- 12.8 years at survey. Melanoma survivors were less likely to report that cancer had affected their health than survivors of other cancers (15.8% vs. 34.9%). The 577 individuals treated with surgery alone reported arthritis/osteoporosis, cataracts, and heart problems most frequently (less often than survivors of other cancers). The 391 individuals who had undergone combined treatments reported circulation problems and kidney problems generally as often as survivors of other cancers. Health problems were not associated with number of decades since diagnosis but with age at diagnosis, treatment modality, and family relationships. Conclusion(s): We present information from a large cohort of long-term survivors of melanoma. As a group, they were less likely to report that cancer had affected their overall health than survivors of other cancers; a number of disease related and psychosocial factors appear to influence their health profiles. © 2006 Stava et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
4221,"Butterfly wing colours: scale beads make white pierid wings brighter. The wing-scale morphologies of the pierid butterflies Pieris rapae (small white) and Delias nigrina (common jezabel), and the heliconine Heliconius melpomene are compared and related to the wing-reflectance spectra. Light scattering at the wing scales determines the wing reflectance, but when the scales contain an absorbing pigment, reflectance is suppressed in the absorption wavelength range of the pigment. The reflectance of the white wing areas of P. rapae, where the scales are studded with beads, is considerably higher than that of the white wing areas of H. melpomene, which has scales lacking beads. The beads presumably cause the distinct matt-white colour of the wings of pierids and function to increase the reflectance amplitude. This will improve the visual discrimination between conspecific males and females. Copyright 2004 The Royal Society",Excluded
4222,"Observer variation in target volume delineation of lung cancer related to radiation oncologist-computer interaction: a 'Big Brother' evaluation. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To evaluate the process of target volume delineation in lung cancer for optimization of imaging, delineation protocol and delineation software., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eleven radiation oncologists (observers) from five different institutions delineated the Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) including positive lymph nodes of 22 lung cancer patients (stages I-IIIB) on CT only. All radiation oncologist-computer interactions were recorded with a tool called 'Big Brother'. For each radiation oncologist and patient the following issues were analyzed: delineation time, number of delineated points and corrections, zoom levels, level and window (L/W) settings, CT slice changes, use of side windows (coronal and sagittal) and software button use., RESULTS: The mean delineation time per GTV was 16 min (SD 10 min). The mean delineation time for lymph node positive patients was on average 3 min larger (P = 0.02) than for lymph node negative patients. Many corrections (55%) were due to L/W change (e.g. delineating in mediastinum L/W and then correcting in lung L/W). For the lymph node region, a relatively large number of corrections was found (3.7 corr/cm2), indicating that it was difficult to delineate lymph nodes. For the tumor-atelectasis region, a relative small number of corrections was found (1.0 corr/cm2), indicating that including or excluding atelectasis into the GTV was a clinical decision. Inappropriate use of L/W settings was frequently found (e.g. 46% of all delineated points in the tumor-lung region were delineated in mediastinum L/W settings). Despite a large observer variation in cranial and caudal direction of 0.72 cm (1 SD), the coronal and sagittal side windows were not used in 45 and 60% of the cases, respectively. For the more difficult cases, observer variation was smaller when the coronal and sagittal side windows were used., CONCLUSIONS: With the 'Big Brother' tool a method was developed to trace the delineation process. The differences between observers concerning the delineation style were large. This study led to recommendations on how to improve delineation accuracy by adapting the delineation protocol (guidelines for L/W use) and delineation software (double window with lung and mediastinum L/W settings at the same time, enforced use of coronal and sagittal views) and including FDG-PET information (lymph nodes and atelectasis).",Excluded
4223,"Intensification by temozolomide and fractionated stereotactic boost in high grade gliomas: A long term analyses of phase II study. Purpose: the aim of this phase II study was to assess local control, survival and toxicity using intensification 3D-Conformal Radiation Therapy (3D-CRT) by concomitant Temozolomide (TMZ) and Fractionated Stereotactic Conformal Radiation Therapy (FSCRT) boost in patients with high grade gliomas (HGG). Materials: patients (>= 18 years old) affectedby HGG (III and IV gradeWHO), with a CTV1 (tumor bed +/- residual tumour) < 8 cm were enrolled into this study. Total radiation dose (6940 cGy) was administered using a combination of two different techniques: conformal 3D-RT and FSCRT Radiation dose of 3D-CRT was 5040 cGy if FSCRT boost was concomitant plus sequential or 5940 cGy if only sequential. FSCRT was 1900 cGy if concomitant plus sequential boost or 1000 cGy if only sequential boost. These two different schedules were tailored by CTVI diameter ( 6 em or over 6 em until 8cm). Temozolomide(75 mg/m2 ) wasadministered during the first two or four weeks of radiotherapyrelated to FSCRTmodality. After the end of RTTemozolomide (150-200 mg/m2 ) was administered for at least 6 cycles. Result(s): 43 patients (38 glioblastoma multiforme [GBM] and 5 anaplastic astrocytoma) were enrolled: 27 (63 %) were male and 16 (37%) female. Median age was 53 years (range 25-72yrs). RTOGneurological toxicity GI-2 and G3 were t2% and 3%, respectively. Late neurological toxicity included two cases (4.8 %) of histologically-proven radio-necrosis (at 14 and 24 months).

4224,"A comparison of leg length discrepancy with function and satisfaction scores after cemented total hip replacement. Introduction: Total Hip replacement (THR) is considered an effective surgical intervention for the relief of chronic pain and functional disability. However, a proportion of patients experience a poor outcome. Leg length discrepancy (LLD) can be introduced, or not corrected, at the time of operation. Previous research has shown that patients with LLD reported a lower functional outcome than those with equal leg lengths. We report on a cohort of 146 patients with a minimum of 3-year follow-up who underwent cemented total hip replacement. We have compared the data when looking at independent variables including age, sex, BMI, femoral head size, offset of stem, grade of surgeon, surgical approach and cup type. Material(s) and Method(s): 146 patients were followed up for a mean of 3.66 years (range 3.25-4.5 years). There were 96 females and 45 males. The mean age at surgery was 77 years (range 50-95 years). All patients were reviewed in clinic or contacted by postal survey for assessment of function and satisfaction. The pre-operative X-rays were compared with early post-operative X-rays. LLD was assessed radiologically according to the method of Woolson, as modified by Konyves and Bannister, on plain sequential AP pelvis radiographs by 2 independent observers. Result(s): Mean LLD was 2 mm (range -10 mm to +14 mm). No significant association was found for the above independent variables. The overall stem alignment was satisfactory. A non-significant reduction in function (measured by oxford hip score, SF- 12 and satisfaction score) was noted in association with LLD of greater than 5 mm. Discussion(s): We report radiological LLD after cemented THR. This has previously been reported as being linked to function. We found a non-significant correlation between reported function and satisfaction with LLD. However 94% of our observed limb lengths were within 1 cm of the other side. There was no significant association between LLD and other independent variables.",Excluded
4225,"A sentinel case series of cancer patients with occupational exposures to electromagnetic non-ionizing radiation and other agents. Background. There are reports that intense prolonged occupational exposure to non-ionizing radiation may increase risks for cancer. We previously have reported a sentinel cluster, of 7 workers with high exposures and short latent periods, and individual patients with brain cancer high occupational exposures and short latent periods. We present a sentinel case series (n=47, 40M, 7F) of cancer patients, referred to our medical unit with occupational exposures to non-ionizing radiation of all types. Objectives. Our aims were to report the findings on tumour types, age of first diagnosis, and latency, to describe their exposures and to examine the hypothesis that latencies for all tumour types (solid tissue, hematolymphatic, testicular) were coherently related to high occupational exposures starting at young ages. Methods. We divided the patients into groups by latency. We categorized each patient's exposures in regard to types of radiation, far or near field exposure and direct body contact. For some we had data on frequencies, for others we provided assessments. We also present the patient data categorized by age of diagnosis.We used a case-case type comparison to examine latencies for tumour types [solid, hematolymphatic (HL), testicular]. Results. 15 patients developed cancer with latent periods of less than 5 years and 12 patients with latent periods between 5 and 10 years. The remaining 20 patients had longer latent periods between first occupational exposure to EMF and diagnosis of cancer. 6 patients (12.7%) had multiple tumours. 12 patients (25.5%) reported cancer cases in co-workers. In the <5 years latency group there were 8 hematolymphatic cancers, 3 testicular cancers and 6 solid tumours [head & neck (including brain) and GI tract]. In all latency groups there were patients who were exposed to intense levels of electromagnetic fields (EMF), to several types of EMF, or to EMF in combination with ionizing radiation (IR) or other exposures, and patients who had direct body contact with the equipment, were in direct focus of high radiation, or worked in small, electronically dense environments. Case classification by age showed shorter latencies with younger ages, but this association is complicated by the fact that shorter latencies co-vary with younger ages especially for testicular tumours. But patients with testicular and hematolymphatic tumours had shorter latencies than those with solid tumours. Conclusion. Many of the patients were young and had extremely short latent periods, especially for HL and testicular cancers. The fact that latent periods for testes were very short, HL longer and solid still longer suggests a coherent and biologically plausible pattern of latency in relation to the onset of exposure to EMF and other agents. The findings strengthen the hypothesis that these exposures may possibly be the major cause of many of these tumours. The findings state the case for (1) better modelling of exposure sources and penetration into the body and (2) preventive and protective measures based on control of exposure at source, barriers, and personal protection.",Excluded
4226,"Anthropometric factors and cutaneous melanoma: Prospective data from the population-based Janus Cohort. The aim of the present study was to prospectively examine risk of cutaneous melanoma (CM) according to measured anthropometric factors, adjusted for exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR), in a large population-based cohort in Norway. The Janus Cohort, including 292,851 Norwegians recruited 1972-2003, was linked to the Cancer Registry of Norway and followed for CM through 2014. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of CM with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Restricted cubic splines were incorporated into the Cox models to assess possible non-linear relationships. All analyses were adjusted for attained age, indicators of UVR exposure, education, and smoking status. During a mean follow-up of 27 years, 3,000 incident CM cases were identified. In men, CM risk was positively associated with body mass index, body surface area (BSA), height and weight (all ptrends < 0.001), and the exposure-response curves indicated an exponential increase in risk for all anthropometric factors. Weight loss of more than 2 kg in men was associated with a 53% lower risk (HR 0.47, 95% CI: 0.39, 0.57). In women, CM risk increased with increasing BSA (ptrend = 0.002) and height (ptrend < 0.001). The shape of the height-CM risk curve indicated an exponential increase. Our study suggests that large body size, in general, is a CM risk factor in men, and is the first to report that weight loss may reduce the risk of CM among men.Copyright © 2017 UICC",Excluded
4227,"Reciprocal translocations as an indicator for radiation exposures in the low dose range. A few years back, the frequency of dicentrics was determined shortly after exposure in five accidentally exposed radiation workers. In all cases the observed dicentric yield was significantly higher in comparison with the background level, and the resulting estimated whole body doses lay between 0.2 and 0.3 Gy. Now, a number of years later (1 to 11 years), the frequency of translocations has been determined by means of the FISH technique. Chromosomes 2, 4 and 8 were painted. The measured translocation frequency lay, however, within the range of the spontaneous variation between individuals. No radiation exposure could, therefore, be proven. In two further cases, the dicentrics were determined by means of the conventional Giemsa staining technique, and the translocations by means of chromosome painting carried out on the same blood samples, which were taken about 3 and 10 years, respectively, after the radiation exposure. The dose estimates obtained on the basis of dicentric frequency using the Qdr method, and on the basis of FISH detected translocations, are compared.

4230,"Urological applications of computerized axial tomography. Computerized tomography (CT scanning) of the chest and abdomen has been used as a diagnostic technique in more than 7,200 patients since 1974, 250 of whom had histological proved disorders of the genitourinary system and retroperitoneum. On the basis of this experience CT scanning has been found to be safe and effective, and offers certain advantages over conventional techniques. The number, extent and content of adrenal and renal mass lesions can be determined with relatively great accuracy. The presence and extent of metastases into the retroperitoneum, liver and chest often can be shown by CT scanning when other tests are negative. Placement of needles for aspiration, biopsy, injection of contrast medium or insertion of drainage tubes can be done accurately under computerized tomographic control. Air contrast scanning of the bladder can be of real help in staging bladder tumors, espically in obese patients. Computerized tomography in itself is non-invasive, carries a low radiation exposure comparable to other radiographic procedures and therefore, can, be valuable in following the course of patients with various diseases during and after therapy. While CT scanning will not replace other diagnostic procedures it should lead to a more judicious selection of potentially hazardous tests, such as angiography, aspiration and open biopsy.",Excluded

After radiotherapy treatment, there is an increased incidence of localized atherosclerosis in patients with Hodgkin's disease, breast cancer, and head and neck cancer. Here, we established a mouse model to study the development and progression of radiation-induced atherosclerosis and to compare the phenotype of these lesions with age-related atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis-prone ApoE-/- mice fed a regular chow diet received single radiation doses of 14 Gy or sham treatments (0 Gy) to the neck, including both carotid arteries. At 22, 28, and 34 weeks after irradiation, blood samples were taken, and the arterial tree was removed for histological examination. Cholesterol levels in irradiated mice were not significantly different from age-matched controls, and markers of systemic inflammation (soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and C-reactive protein) were not elevated. The lesions in irradiated arteries were macrophage rich, with a remarkable influx of inflammatory cells, predominantly granulocytes. Intraplaque hemorrhage and erythrocyte-containing macrophages were seen only in lesions of irradiated arteries. Based on these data, we propose that irradiation accelerates the development of macrophage-rich, inflammatory atherosclerotic lesions prone to intraplaque hemorrhage.",Included
4232,"Cumulative radiation dose from medical imaging procedures in patients undergoing resection for lung cancer. Background: Radiation dose from diagnostic imaging procedures is not monitored in patients undergoing surgery for lung cancer. Evidence suggests an increased lifetime risk of malignancy of 1.0% per 100 millisieverts (mSv). As such, recommendations are to restrict healthcare and radiation workers to a maximum dose of 50 mSv per year or to 100 mSv over a three-year period. The purpose of this study was to estimate cumulative effective doses of radiation in patients undergoing lung cancer resection and to determine predictors of increased exposure. Method(s): We identified 94 consecutive patients undergoing resection for non-small cell lung cancer. Radiologic procedures performed from one year prior to resection until two years postresection were recorded. Estimates of effective doses (mSv) were obtained from published literature and institutional records. Predictors of dose greater than 50 mSv per year and greater than 100 mSv per three years were examined statistically. Result(s): The majority of patients (median age = 67 years) had stage IA cancer (52%). In the three-year period, patients had 1,958 radiologic studies (20.8/patient) including 398 computed tomographic (CT) scans (4.23/patient) and 211 positron emission tomography (PET) scans (2.24 per patient). The three-year median estimated radiation dose was 84.0 mSv (interquartile range, 44.1 to 123.2 mSv). The highest dose was in the preoperative year. In any one year, 66% of patients received more than 50 mSv, while 19% received over 100 mSv. Over the three-year period, 43.6% of patients exceeded 100 mSv. The majority of the radiation (89.8%) was from CT or PET scans. On multivariate analysis, a history of previous malignancy (odds ratio [OR] 3.8; confidence interval [CI] 1.14 to 12.7), postoperative complications (OR 6.16; CI 1.42 to 26.6), and postoperative surveillance with PET-CT (OR 13.2; CI 4.34 to 40.3) predicted exposure greater than 100 mSv over the three-year period. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates that lung cancer patients often receive a higher dose of radiation than that considered safe for healthcare and radiation workers. The median cumulative dose reported in this study could potentially increase the individual estimated lifetime cancer risk by as much as 0.8%. Although risk-benefit considerations are clearly different between these groups, strategies should be in place to decrease radiation doses during the preoperative workup and postoperative period. © 2011 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.",Excluded
4233,"Stereotactic body radiation therapy for melanoma and renal cell carcinoma: Impact of single fraction equivalent dose on local control. Background: Melanoma and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are traditionally considered less radioresponsive than other histologies. Whereas stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) involves radiation dose intensification via escalation, we hypothesize SBRT might result in similar high local control rates as previously published on metastases of varying histologies. Method(s): The records of patients with metastatic melanoma (n = 17 patients, 28 lesions) or RCC (n = 13 patients, 25 lesions) treated with SBRT were reviewed. Local control (LC) was defined pathologically by negative biopsy or radiographically by lack of tumor enlargement on CT or stable/declining standardized uptake value (SUV) on PET scan. The SBRT dose regimen was converted to the single fraction equivalent dose (SFED) to characterize the dose-control relationship using a logistic tumor control probability (TCP) model. Additionally, the kinetics of decline in maximum SUV (SUVmax) were analyzed. Result(s): The SBRT regimen was 40-50 Gy/5 fractions (n = 23) or 42-60 Gy/3 fractions (n = 30) delivered to lung (n = 39), liver (n = 11) and bone (n = 3) metastases. Median follow-up for patients alive at the time of analysis was 28.0 months (range, 4-68). The actuarial LC was 88% at 18 months. On univariate analysis, higher dose per fraction (p < 0.01) and higher SFED (p = 0.06) were correlated with better LC, as was the biologic effective dose (BED, p < 0.05). The actuarial rate of LC at 24 months was 100% for SFED >=45 Gy v 54% for SFED <45 Gy. TCP modeling indicated that to achieve >=90% 2 yr LC in a 3 fraction regimen, a prescription dose of at least 48 Gy is required. In 9 patients followed with PET scans, the mean pre-SBRT SUVmax was 7.9 and declined with an estimated half-life of 3.8 months to a post-treatment plateau of approximately 3. Conclusion(s): An aggressive SBRT regimen with SFED >= 45 Gy is effective for controlling metastatic melanoma and RCC. The SFED metric appeared to be as robust as the BED in characterizing dose-response, though additional studies are needed. The LC rates achieved are comparable to those obtained with SBRT for other histologies, suggesting a dominant mechanism of in vivo tumor ablation that overrides intrinsic differences in cellular radiosensitivity between histologic subtypes. © 2011 Stinauer et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded

A retrospective review is presented on 145 patients who underwent limb-sparing surgery and radiation therapy (with or without adjuvant chemotherapy) for their primary soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities on protocol between 1975 and 1986. The focus on our analysis was the acute and long term toxicity of treatment on limb function. The most common acute complication was skin reaction, occurring in 52 patients (36%). Long term (occurring after more than 1 year following all treatment) treatment complications in the extremity were as follows: bone fracture = 6%; contracture = 20%; pain requiring narcotics = 7%; edema greater than 2+ = 19%; moderate to severe decrease in range of motion = 32%; moderate to severe decrease in manual muscle strength = 20%; orthotic device required = 9%; cane or crutch required = 7%; chronic infection = 9%; and tissue induration = 57%. Three amputations for treatment complications were required. Inclusion of more than 50% of the joint in the radiation portal was associated with a higher frequency of contracture. High nominal standard dose (greater than 1760 rets, greater than 63 Gy at 1.8 Gy per fraction) resulted in more painful limbs as well as limbs with increased edema, decreased manual muscle strength, decreased range of motion, and skin telangiectasias. Edema was more often noted in patients with a longer radiation portal (greater than 35 cm), as was tissue induration. Chronic ulcer or infection was more frequently seen in patients with lower extremity tumors and when more than 75% of the extremity diameter was irradiated. Although chemotherapy given concurrent with radiation therapy was associated with a higher number of acute skin reactions, this did not appear to translate into increased long term morbidity. The percentage of patients ambulating without assistive devices and with mild or no pain was 84%. Careful attention to the techniques of radiation therapy may have a significant impact on minimizing acute and long term complications of limb sparing treatment for extremity soft tissue sarcoma.",Excluded

Stereotactic radiation therapy is an evolving modality to treat otherwise unresectable liver metastases. In this analysis, two local therapies: 1) single session robotic radiosurgery (RRS) and 2) percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) were compared in a total of 60 heavily pretreated colorectal cancer patients. Methods. Thirty patients with a total of 35 colorectal liver metastases not qualifying for surgery that were treated in curative intent with RRS were prospectively followed. To compare efficacy of both treatment modalities, patients treated with RFA during the same period of time were matched according to number and size of the treated lesions. Local tumor control, local disease free survival (DFS), and freedom from distant recurrence (FFDR) were analyzed for efficacy. Treatment-related side effects were recorded for comparison. Results. The median diameter of the treated lesions was 33 mm (7-53 mm). Baseline characteristics did not differ significantly between the groups. One- and two-year local control rates showed no significant difference but favored RRS (85% vs. 65% and 80% vs. 61%, respectively). A significantly longer local DFS of patients treated with RRS compared to RFA (34.4 months vs. 6.0 months; p < 0.001) was found. Both, median FFDR (11.4 months for RRS vs. 7.1 months for RFA p = 0.25) and the recurrence rate (67% for RRS and 63% for RFA, p > 0.99) were comparable. Conclusion.

Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of combined textural feature analysis of contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) and static O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) PET for the differentiation between local recurrent brain metastasis and radiation injury since CE-MRI often remains inconclusive. Method(s): Fifty-two patients with new or progressive contrast-enhancing brain lesions on MRI after radiotherapy (predominantly stereotactic radiosurgery) of brain metastases were additionally investigated using FET PET. Based on histology (n = 19) or clinicoradiological follow-up (n = 33), local recurrent brain metastases were diagnosed in 21 patients (40%) and radiation injury in 31 patients (60%). Forty-two textural features were calculated on both unfiltered and filtered CE-MRI and summed FET PET images (20-40 min p.i.), using the software LIFEx. After feature selection, logistic regression models using a maximum of five features to avoid overfitting were calculated for each imaging modality separately and for the combined FET PET/MRI features. The resulting models were validated using cross-validation. Diagnostic accuracies were calculated for each imaging modality separately as well as for the combined model. Result(s): For the differentiation between radiation injury and recurrence of brain metastasis, textural features extracted from CE-MRI had a diagnostic accuracy of 81% (sensitivity, 67%; specificity, 90%). FET PET textural features revealed a slightly higher diagnostic accuracy of 83% (sensitivity, 88%; specificity, 75%). However, the highest diagnostic accuracy was obtained when combining CE-MRI and FET PET features (accuracy, 89%; sensitivity, 85%; specificity, 96%).

Patients were randomly assigned to five different protocols: retrospective ECG-gating and tube current reduction to 4% outside the pulsing window at 120 (protocol A) and 100 kV (B), prospective ECG-triggering at 120 (C) and 100 kV (D), and prospective ECG-triggering at 100 kV with attenuation-based tube current modulation (E). Radiation dose parameters and image noise were determined and compared., RESULTS: Protocol A resulted in an effective dose of 1.3 +/- 0.2 mSv, protocol B in 0.8 +/- 0.2 mSv, protocol C in 1.0 +/- 0.2 mSv, protocol D in 0.6 +/- 0.1 mSv, and protocol E in 0.7 +/- 0.1 mSv. Effective doses were significantly lower (P < 0.001) with 100 kV when compared to 120 kV protocols, and were significantly lower (P < 0.001) for prospective versus retrospective ECG-gating. No significant difference was found between protocol D and E. Significant negative correlations were found between the CTDI(vol) and heart rate for both retrospective ECG-gating protocols (protocol A: r = -0.98, P < 0.001; protocol B: r = -0.83, P < 0.001). The mean image noise was 29.0 +/- 6.7 HU, with no significant differences between the five protocols. The image noise was significantly correlated with the body weight (r = 0.21, P < 0.05) and BMI (r = 0.31, P < 0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: Effective dose of calcium scoring using dual-source CT ranges from 0.6 to 1.3 mSv. Prospective triggering and lower tube voltage significantly reduces the radiation but yield similar image noise.",Excluded
4242,"Impact of Radiation Dose Reduction in Abdominal Computed Tomography on Diagnostic Accuracy and Diagnostic Performance in Patients with Suspected Appendicitis: An Intraindividual Comparison. RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To determine the intraindividual impact of radiation dose reduction in abdominal computed tomography (CT) on diagnostic performance in patients with suspected appendicitis., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was approved by the institutional review board. Seventy-five patients who underwent standard contrast-enhanced abdominal CT for suspected appendicitis between 2004 and 2009 were retrospectively included. Low-dose CT reconstructions with 75%, 50%, and 25% of the original radiation dose level were generated by applying realistic reduced-dose simulation. Two blinded, independent readers assessed image quality, signal-to-noise ratio, and diagnostic confidence on each dataset. Diagnostic accuracy for detection of appendicitis and complications were calculated for each reader. Paired univariate tests were used to determine intraindividual differences., RESULTS: Among 75 subjects included in the analysis (57% female, mean age: 41 +/- 18 years), the prevalence of histopathologically confirmed appendicitis was 59%. Signal-to-noise ratio and subjective image quality of 50% and 25% reduced-dose CTs were significantly lower than the reference datasets (all P < .005). Appendicitis was correctly identified in all reference and low-dose datasets (sensitivity: 100%, negative predictive value: 100%). Presence of complications was correctly detected in all reference, 75%, and 50% datasets, but was decreased in 25% datasets (sensitivity: 77.8% and negative predictive value: 97.4%). Diagnostic confidence was high for original and 75% datasets, but significantly lower for 50% and 25% datasets (P < .001)., CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that diagnostic accuracy in abdominal CT acquisitions acquired at 75% and 50% of radiation dose is maintained in patients with suspected appendicitis, whereas further reduction of radiation exposition is associated with decreased diagnostic performance.

4243,"Cosmic rays activity and monthly number of deaths: a correlative study. We studied the relation between the intensity of cosmic rays, the level of solar/geomagnetic activity, and the monthly numbers of deaths in a large hospital in Israel and in all Lithuania. The Israeli data include 30526 hospital deaths, two groups of fatal suicides (2359, 2763), and 15435 suicidal attempts for two periods of 108 and 236 consecutive months. The national data for the entire Republic of Lithuania include 424925 deaths for the period of 120 consecutive months. Cosmic rays intensity was measured by an Apatity neutron monitor. We obtained the data on solar, geomagnetic radiovawe propagation, ionosphere ionization hours, proton flux of two energy levels (>90 and 60 MeV) from the National Geophysical Data Center at Goddard Space Flight Center, National Space Environment Center at Boulder, Colorado, USA, and from the Institute of Terrestrial Magnetism, Ionosphere and Radio Wave Propagation (IZMIRAN), Russia. We calculated Pearson coefficients and their probabilities for correlation between monthly space activity level and monthly number of male and female deaths from different causes. Cosmic rays activity revealed significant negative correlation with solar/geomagnetic activity indices and related physical phenomena levels. This activity strongly correlated with flux of protons with the energies >90 MeV proton flux and did not exhibit significant correlation with 60 MeV proton fluxes. Cosmic rays intensity correlation with monthly numbers of deaths was strong for noncardiovascular deaths, suicides, and traffic accidents. The correlation was much weaker for deaths caused by ishemic heart disease and strokes.",Excluded
4244,"Latent and lytic Epstein-Barr virus gene expression in the peripheral blood of astronauts. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent and replicative gene transcription was analyzed in peripheral blood B-lymphocytes from astronauts who flew on short-duration (~11 days) Shuttle missions and long-duration (~180 days) International Space Station (ISS) missions. Latent, immediate-early, and early gene replicative viral transcripts were detected in samples from six astronauts who flew on short-duration Shuttle missions, whereas viral gene transcription was mostly absent in samples from 24 healthy donors. Samples from six astronauts who flew on long-duration ISS missions were characterized by expanded expression of latent, immediate-early, and early gene transcripts and new onset expression of late replicative transcription upon return to Earth. These data indicate that EBV-infected cells are no longer expressing the restricted set of viral genes that characterize latency but are expressing latent and lytic gene transcripts. These data also suggest the possibility of EBV-related complications in future long-duration missions, in particular interplanetary travel. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Excluded

4246,"Does race influence survival for esophageal cancer patients treated on the radiation and chemotherapy arm of RTOG 85-01?. Purpose: In reported retrospective non-randomized trials of treatment of esophageal carcinoma, blacks have a lower survival from esophageal cancer than whites. None of these studies has accounted for the extent of disease, or the methods and quality of treatment. We reviewed the data that included only patients treated on the chemoradiation arm of the RTOG-8501 esophageal carcinoma trial to see if there were differences in overall survival between black and white patients receiving the same standard of care. Methods and Materials: One hundred-nineteen patients, 37 blacks and 82 whites were evaluated who met the criteria for receiving chemoradiation of 5000 cGy and four courses of Cisplatin (75 mg/m2) and Fluorouracil (1000 mg/m2 for 4 days). Result(s): Blacks had squamous histology only, with 86% of blacks having weight loss of 10 lbs. or more compared to 56% of whites (p = 0.001). In addition, blacks had larger tumors and more difficulty eating (p = 0.010). Overall, there was no difference in the Kaplan-Meier median survival estimate by race (p = 0.2757). Only when we limited the analysis to the 'squamous histology' subgroup, stratified according to age >70 vs. <70 years (p = 0.0002), and nodal status (p = 0.0177) in a Cox regression model analysis, did race appear to be a significant factor (p = 0.0012). However, using the entire database, the age effect was found to be a 'bimodal' effect, wherein the 'youngest' ( 70 years) did poorly. Because of the dramatic differences in the age and histology distributions between blacks and whites, this issue could not be resolved in the subset of squamous only who received chemoradiation. Conclusion(s): The increasing incidence of adenocarcinoma among white patients without a corresponding increase of this histology in blacks reflects a difference in diet and or lifestyle compared to blacks that deserves additional study. When treated aggressively with chemoradiation, race did not appear to be a statistically significant factor for overall survival.",Excluded

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Myocardial perfusion and left ventricular function (LVF) were assessed after percutaneous transmyocardial laser revascularization (PTMR) in patients not amenable to conventional revascularization, with a comparison of two laser systems., STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: PTMR was performed with an Eclipse laser in 15 patients, and with a Biosense DMR in 10 patients. (201)Thallium scintigraphy, coronary angiography, and ventriculography were performed at baseline and at the 7.5+/-4.3-month follow-up. All patients in the Biosense DMR group and 10 in the Eclipse group underwent NOGA mapping before PTMR and after follow-up., RESULTS: The event-free survival rates were comparable, and the angina scores of all patients improved significantly, but more so in the Biosense DMR group than in the Eclipse group (1.2+/-1.1 vs. 2.3+/-0.9, P < 0.05). Both, the electrical activity assessed by NOGA mapping and the normalized (201)thallium uptake at redistribution improved significantly in the treated segments after Biosense DMR, while the global LVF decreased insignificantly in the Eclipse group., CONCLUSIONS: PTMR resulted in significant improvements in the clinical symptoms, but the electrical activity improved only in the Biosense DMR group, without transforming to a better LVF.

4250,"Concurrent palliative chemoradiation leads to survival and quality of life benefits in poor prognosis stage III non-small-cell lung cancer: A randomised trial by the Norwegian Lung Cancer Study Group. Background:The palliative role of chemoradiation in the treatment of patients with locally advanced, inoperable non-small-cell lung cancer stage III and negative prognostic factors remains unresolved. Method(s):Patients not eligible for curative radiotherapy were randomised to receive either chemoradiation or chemotherapy alone. Four courses of intravenous carboplatin on day 1 and oral vinorelbin on days 1 and 8 were given with 3-week intervals. Patients in the chemoradiation arm also received radiotherapy with fractionation 42 Gy/15, starting at the second chemotherapy course. The primary end point was overall survival; secondary end points were health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and toxicity. Result(s):Enrolment was terminated due to slow accrual after 191 patients from 25 Norwegian hospitals were randomised. Median age was 67 years and 21% had PS 2. In the chemotherapy versus the chemoradiation arm, the median overall survival was 9.7 and 12.6 months, respectively (P<0.01). One-year survival was 34.0% and 53.2% (P<0.01). Following a minor decline during treatment, HRQOL remained unchanged in the chemoradiation arm. The patients in the chemotherapy arm reported gradual deterioration during the subsequent months. In the chemoradiation arm, there were more hospital admissions related to side effects (P<0.05). Conclusion(s):Chemoradiation was superior to chemotherapy alone with respect to survival and HRQoL at the expense of more hospital admissions due to toxicity. © 2013 Cancer Research UK.",Excluded
4251,"Prognostic Factors Predict Oncological Outcome in Older Patients With Head and Neck Cancer Undergoing Chemoradiation Treatment. Purpose: Older patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) represent a challenging group, as frailty and comorbidities need to be considered. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and side effects of curative and palliative (chemo) radiation ([C]RT) with regard to basic geriatric screening in older patients. Method(s): This study included HNC patients aged >=70 years who were treated with curative or palliative (C)RT. Clinicopathological data including Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), Karnofsky performance status (KPS), and treatment data were analyzed as predictors of overall survival (OS). Result(s): A total of 271 patients (median age, 74 years) were enrolled. The majority had UICC stage III/IV (90%) and underwent curative treatment (85.2%). A total of 144 (53.1%) patients received definitive and 87 (32.1%) had adjuvant (C)RT. Overall, 40 patients (14.8%) received palliative (C)RT. Median follow-up duration (curative setting) was 87 months, and the 2- and 5-year OS rates were 57.8 and 35.9%, respectively. Median OS was significantly different for age <=75 vs. >75 years, CCI <6 vs. >=6, KPS >=70 vs. <70%, Tx/T1/T2 vs. T3/T4, and adjuvant vs. definitive (C)RT, respectively. Age 70-75 years (p = 0.004), fewer comorbidities when CCI < 6 (p = 0.014), good KPS >= 70% (p = 0.001), and adjuvant (C)RT (p = 0.008) independently predicted longer survival. Palliative RT resulted in a median OS of 4 months. Conclusion(s): Older age, lower KPS, higher CCI, and definitive (C)RT are indicators of worse survival in older patients with HNC treated curatively. Without a comprehensive geriatric assessment in patients aged >75 years, the KPS and CCI can be useful tools to account for ""fitness, vulnerability or frailty"" to help in treatment decision-making.© Copyright © 2021 Stromberger, Yedikat, Coordes, Tinhofer, Kalinauskaite, Budach, Zschaeck, Raguse, Kofla, Heiland, Stsefanenka, Beck-Broichsitter, Dommerich, Senger and Beck.",Excluded

4253,"Image quality from high-resolution CT of the lung: comparison of axial scans and of sections reconstructed from volumetric data acquired using MDCT. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to compare the image quality of reconstructed thin sections obtained from a 16-MDCT scanner with that of axial high-resolution CT scans of the same patient. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fifty consecutive patients referred for CT of the chest underwent 16-MDCT and, subsequently, axial high-resolution CT. The volumetric raw data from the MDCT scans were reconstructed into slices 2-mm thick using a high-spatial-frequency reconstruction algorithm. Two blinded reviewers independently rated the images from both methods for subjective image-quality criteria. The results were tested for statistical significance using Wilcoxon's signed rank test, and p values of less than 0.05 were considered significant. The effective dose for axial high-resolution CT and volumetric MDCT was calculated. RESULT(S): Motion artifacts were significantly more common on high-resolution CT scans than on reconstructed thin-section images (p < 0.001). The two methods differed significantly in lung attenuation (p = 0.008), mainly because of the presence of ground-glass opacities. The assessment of ground-glass attenuation was superior on axial high-resolution CT. The effective doses were 3.8 mSv for MDCT and 0.9 mSv for high-resolution CT. CONCLUSION(S): Reconstructed high-resolution images generated from a single MDCT data acquisition are of comparable quality to images obtained using conventional axial high-resolution CT. However, contiguous MDCT is not recommended for diseases showing predominantly ground-glass patterns, because axial high-resolution CT delineates ground-glass attenuation significantly better.",Excluded

Purpose: The aim of this prospective multi-institutional phase 2 study was to investigate disease control, survival outcomes, and toxicity after thoracic three-dimensional radiation therapy (3D-RT) with concurrent chemotherapy for newly diagnosed stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods and Materials: Eligible patients were 18 to 80 years of age, had a Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score 70%, and newly diagnosed stage IV NSCLC with limited metastatic disease (defined as involving 3 organs). Patients received platinum-doublet chemotherapy with concurrent irradiation to the primary tumor. Primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and acute toxicity. Result(s): From May 2008 to May 2012, 198 eligible patients were enrolled from 7 cancer centers. Most patients died with distant metastasis; only 10% died with isolated primary recurrence. Median OS time was 13.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11.7-14.3); OS rates were 53.5% at 1 year, 15.8% at 2 years, and 9.2% at 3 years. Median progression-free survival (PFS) time was 9.0 months (95% CI: 7.7-10.3); corresponding PFS rates were 30.8%, 8.2%, and 6.1%. The 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year local (primary tumor) control rates were 78.8%, 57.7%, and 55.4%. Multivariate analysis showed that delivery of 63 Gy to the primary tumor (PZ.014), having a primary tumor volume <134 cm3 (PZ.008), and having a stable or higher KPS score after treatment (PZ.01) were independent predictors of better OS. The most common severe (grades 3-4) acute toxicities were hematologic: leukopenia (37.9%), thrombocytopenia (10.1%), and anemia (6.9%). No patients experienced grade 4 or 5 radiationrelated toxicity; 2.5% had acute grade 3 pneumonitis, and 6.6% had acute grade 3 radiation esophagitis. Conclusion(s): Thoracic 3D-RT to the primary tumor with concurrent chemotherapy led to satisfactory survival outcomes with acceptable toxicity. Radiation dose, primary tumor volume, and PFS after treatment all predicted survival in these patients with limited-metastasis NSCLC.Copyright © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

This study evaluated multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) scans performed on potential living donors for adult-to-adult liver transplantation (LDLT), with the aim of identifying significant findings that could be used to exclude potential transplantation donors. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 151 consecutive potential adult donors for LDLT from May 2007 to January 2015. Liver parenchyma steatosis, focal hepatic mass or intraabdominal malignancy, vascular variations, and donor liver volume were evaluated via MDCT. Grounds for excluding potential donors were also recorded and analyzed. Of the 151 potential donors, nine (6.0%) had moderate to severe fatty liver, 37 (24.5%) had hepatic arterial variants, 22 (14.6%) had significant portal venous variants, and more than half were found to have right accessory inferior hepatic vein. No intraabdominal malignancies were found. Eighty-eight potential donors were rejected, with the most common cause being insufficient recipient volume or remnant donor volume (47.7%), moderate to severe parenchymal steatosis (10.2%), and recipient expiration prior to transplantation (8.0%). An additional 16 potential donors were excluded by the surgical team due to the complexity of their portal venous variations. The rate of exclusion by pre-transplant imaging evaluation with MDCT was 33.8%. MDCT can provide accurate quantification of donor liver volume and steatosis severity along with precise demonstration of vascular variants, which are crucial for the preoperative evaluation of LDLT. However, MDCT may be ineffective for evaluating the biliary system without hepatobiliary-excreted contrast agent and has the disadvantage of ionizing radiation.Copyright © 2017",Excluded

AIMS: To evaluate the outcome of intravitreal bevacizumab in the treatment of radiation-induced cystoid macular oedema among patients who underwent external beam radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma., METHODS: Five patients were recruited. The length of time from the last external beam radiation therapy to presentation ranged from 12 months to 15 years. Intravitreal bevacizumab (1.25 mg/0.05 ml) was given and repeated monthly injections were administered until best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) improved to 6/9 or until 3 further injections did not show further improvement in BCVA. BCVA was measured and fundus photography, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fluorescein angiography were performed at baseline. BCVA and OCT were recorded at each monthly visit. The duration of follow-up ranged from 6 months to 2 years., RESULTS: Five patients (7 eyes) were recruited. At the final visit, 3 eyes (71.4%) showed reduction in the central subfield thickness (CST; mean reduction of 17.6%, range 9-149 microm) with improvement in BCVA, whilst 2 eyes worsened in terms of CST and final BCVA. Another 2 eyes remained altered in BCVA despite slight improvement in CST., CONCLUSION: The use of intravitreal bevacizumab in this group of patients showed variable response in terms of CST and BCVA outcome but remains a viable option to treat this challenging condition.

4257,"Importance of surveillance and success of salvage strategies after definitive chemoradiation in patients with esophageal cancer. Purpose: Patients with esophageal carcinoma (EC) who are treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy (bimodality therapy [BMT]) experience frequent relapses. In a large cohort, we assessed the timing, frequency, and types of relapses during an aggressive surveillance program and the value of the salvage strategies. Patients and Methods: Patients with EC (N = 276) who received BMT were analyzed. Patients who had surgery within 6 months of chemoradiotherapy were excluded to reduce bias. We focused on local relapse (LR) and distant metastases (DM) and the salvage treatment of patients with LR only. Standard statistical methods were applied. Result(s): The median follow-up time was 54.3 months (95% CI, 48.4 to 62.4). First relapses included LR only in 23.2% (n = 64), DM with or without LR in 43.5% (n = 120), and no relapses in 33.3% (n = 92) of patients. Final relapses included no relapses in 33.3%, LR only in 14.5%, DM only in 15.9%, and DM plus LR in 36.2% of patients. Ninety-one percent of LRs occurred within 2 years and 98% occurred within 3 years of BMT. Twenty-three (36%) of 64 patients with LR only underwent salvage surgery, and their median overall survival was 58.6 months (95% CI, 28.8 to not reached) compared with those patients with LR only who were unable to undergo surgery (9.5 months; 95% CI, 7.8 to 13.3). Conclusion(s): Unlike in patients undergoing trimodality therapy, for whom surveillance/salvage treatment plays a lesser role,1 in the BMT population, approximately 8% of all patients (or 36% of patients with LR only) with LRs occurring more than 6 months after chemoradiotherapy can undergo salvage treatment, and their survival is excellent. Our data support vigilant surveillance, at least in the first 24 months after chemotherapy, in these patients.Copyright © 2014 by American Society of Clinical Oncology. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Each patient received 4 irradiations (laser or placebo) twice a week, for two consecutive weeks (blinded to the type of irradiation received). Infrared laser (AsGaAI) irradiations were applied to the affected mucosa in scanning mode, wavelength of 790 nm, output power of 20 mW and fluence of 6 J/cm2. A visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to assess the therapeutic effect before and after each irradiation, and at all the control time periods: 7, 14, 30, 60 and 90 days after the last irradiation. One researcher delivered irradiation and another recorded the results. Both researchers were blinded, the first to the results, and the second to the type of radiation applied. The results were categorized according to the percentage of symptom level variation, and showed a statistically better response in LG in only two categories of the control checkpoints (p=0.02; Fisher's Exact Test).

4260,"The Relationship between Media Consumption and Health-Related Anxieties after the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Disaster. Background:The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster caused a global panic by a release of harmful radionuclides. In a disaster setting, misusage of contemporary media sources available today can lead to disseminated incorrect information and panic. The study aims to build a scale which examines associations between media and individual anxieties, and to propose effective media usages for future disaster management. Method(s):The University of Tokyo collaborated with the Fukushima local government to conduct a radiation-health-seminar for a total of 1560 residents, at 12 different locations in Fukushima. A 13 item questionnaire collected once before and after a radiation-seminar was used on factor analysis to develop sub-scales for multiple regression models, to determine relationships between the sub-scales and media type consumed. A paired t-test was used to examine any changes in sub-scale of pre- and post-seminar scores. Result(s):Three sub-scales were revealed and were associated with different media types: was with rumors, while concern for the future was positively associated with regional-newspapers and negatively with national-newspapers. Anxiety about social-disruption was associated with radio. The seminar had a significant effect on anxiety reduction for all the three sub-scales. Conclusion(s):Different media types were associated with various heightened concerns, and that a radiation seminar was helpful to reduce anxieties in the post-disaster setting. By tailoring post-disaster messages via specific media types, i.e., radio, it may be possible to effectively convey important information, as well as to calm fears about particular elements of post-disaster recovery and to combat rumors. © 2013 Sugimoto et al.",Excluded

4262,"Seven cases of radiation-induced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. We report 7 cases of radiation-induced skin cancer. The diagnosis was based on the history of radiotherapy for benign skin diseases (5 cases) and of occupational exposures to medical doctors (2 cases). All cases were squamous cell carcinomas which arose from chronic radiodermatitis. The estimated latent period of these tumors ranged from 6 to 64 years, with an average of 29.9 years. After surgical treatments of the lesions, no local recurrences were observed in all cases. Benign skin diseases had sometimes been treated with low-energy radiation before the 1960s. Considering the estimated latent period, the peak time point of developing risk of radiation-induced skin cancer by such treatment has been already passed, however, the danger of it should not be ignored in future. In association with multiplicity of radiation usage, occupational exposure of radiation may develop the risk of occurrence of skin cancer in future. Therefore, we should recognize that radiation-induced skin cancer is not in the past. In the cases of chronic skin diseases showing warty keratotic growth, erosion and ulcer, we should include chronic radio-dermatitis in the differential diagnosis. It is necessary to recall all patients about the history of radiotherapy or radiation exposure.

We examined the mortality risks among 2463 individuals who were exposed in utero to atomic bomb radiation in Hiroshima or Nagasaki in August 1945 and were followed from October 1950 through 2012. Individual estimates of mother's weighted absorbed uterine dose (DS02R1) were used. Poisson regression method was used to estimate the radiation-associated excess relative risk per Gy (ERR/Gy) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for cause-specific mortality. Head size, birth weight, and parents' survival status were evaluated as potential mediators of radiation effect. There were 339 deaths (216 males and 123 females) including deaths from solid cancer (n = 137), lymphohematopoietic cancer (n = 8), noncancer disease (n = 134), external cause (n = 56), and unknown cause (n = 4). Among males, the unadjusted ERR/Gy (95% CI) was increased for noncancer disease mortality (1.22, 0.10-3.14), but not for solid cancer mortality (- 0.18, < - 0.77-0.95); the unadjusted ERR/Gy for external cause mortality was not statistically significant (0.28, < - 0.60-2.36). Among females, the unadjusted ERRs/Gy were increased for solid cancer (2.24, 0.44-5.58), noncancer (2.86, 0.56-7.64), and external cause mortality (2.57, 0.20-9.19). The ERRs/Gy adjusted for potential mediators did not change appreciably for solid cancer mortality, but decreased notably for noncancer mortality (0.39, < - 0.43-1.91 for males; 1.48, - 0.046-4.55 for females) and external cause mortality (0.10, < - 0.57-1.96 for males; 1.38, < - 0.46-5.95 for females). In conclusion, antenatal radiation exposure is a consistent risk factor for increased solid cancer mortality among females, but not among males. The effect of exposure to atomic bomb radiation on noncancer disease and external cause mortality among individuals exposed in utero was mediated through small head size, low birth weight, and parental loss.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).",Excluded

Purpose: To elucidate the clinical behavior and treatment outcome of low-grade primary orbital lymphoma arising from mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). Methods and Materials: Forty-eight patients with pathologically confirmed marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of MALT were treated with radiotherapy (RT). Thirty-eight patients (79.1%) received thorough staging workup studies including bone marrow biopsy. Radiation doses ranged from 5.4 to 30.6 Gy (median, 30.6 Gy). Median follow-up period was 70 months. Result(s): Only 2 patients revealed extraorbital lymphoma involvement (bone marrow, skin). Forty-six of 52 eye lesions showed complete response to RT. Six lesions demonstrated a partial response and showed gradual regression during the follow-up period of 39-72 months. Three patients experienced local recurrences at 34, 48, and 52 months after RT, which seemed to be related to improper use of the lens shield. Salvage re-RT was successful. The 10-year actuarial relapse-free survival, cause-specific survival, and overall survival rates were 93.1%, 97.9%, and 86.9%, respectively. Conclusion(s): Most of the MALT lymphoma of the orbit was localized at diagnosis and extraorbital relapse rarely occurred. Therefore, extensive staging workup at the time of diagnosis and follow-up studies to detect distant relapse may not be obligatory.

Purpose: To analyze the effect of automatic tube potential selection with tube current modulation (APSCM) and iterative reconstruction on image quality, diagnostic accuracy, and radiation dose at computed tomographic (CT) angiography and compare it with APSCM-only and body mass index (BMI)-based examination protocols. Material(s) and Method(s): This study was approved by the institutional review board, and informed consent was obtained from all patients. Images from 185 patients who underwent a BMI-based protocol and 197 patients who underwent an APSCM protocol with filtered back projection (FBP) and an APSCM protocol with sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction (SAFIRE) were retrospectively evaluated. Diagnostic performance was compared with that of conventional coronary angiography in a subgroup of 51 patients. Statistical analysis was performed by using the independent or paired t test, Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon signed rank test, x2 statistics, linear weighted k statistics, and generalized estimating equation. Result(s): The APSCM group with SAFIRE had a significant reduction in image noise and a significant increase in CT number, contrast enhancement, signal-to-noise ratio, and contrast-to-noise ratio compared with the APSCM group with FBP (P < .0001) and the BMI-based group (P < .001, except P = .002 for image noise). Image quality and diagnostic accuracy showed no significant difference between the three groups. The use of APSCM resulted in a significant reduction in radiation dose compared with the BMI-based protocol. Conclusion(s): The combination of SAFIRE and APSCM at coronary CT angiography significantly improves objective image quality while maintaining diagnostic accuracy and reduced radiation dose. © RSNA, 2013.",Excluded
4266,"Computer systems analysis of spaceflight induced changes in left ventricular mass. Circulatory adaptations resulting in postflight orthostasis have frequently been observed in response to space travel. It has been postulated that a decrement in left ventricular mass (LVM) found after microgravity exposure may be the central component in this cardiovascular deconditioning. However, a physiologic mechanism responsible for these changes in the myocardium has not been determined. In this study, we examined the sequential alterations in echocardiographic measured LVM from preflight to landing day and 3 days into the postflight recovery period. In a previous study in returning astronauts we found a comparative 9.1% reduction in postflight LVM that returned to preflight values by the third day of recovery. This data was further evaluated in a systems analysis approach using a well-established advanced computer model of circulatory functioning. The computer model incorporates the physiologic responses to changes in pressures, flows and hydraulics within the circulatory system as affected by gravitational forces. Myocardial muscle progression to atrophy or hypertrophy in reaction to the circulatory load conditions is also included in the model. The integrative computer analysis suggests that these variations in LVM could be explained by simple fluid shifts known to occur during spaceflight and can reverse within a few days after reentry into earth's gravity. According to model predictions, the reductions in LVM found upon exposure to microgravity are a result of a contraction of the myocardial interstitial fluid space secondary to a loss in the plasma volume. This hypothesis was additionally supported by the published ground-based study in which we followed the alterations in LVM and plasma volume in normal subjects in which hypovolemia was induced by simple dehydration. In the hypovolemic state, plasma volume was reduced in these subjects and was significantly correlated with echocardiographic measurements of LVM. Based on these experimental findings and the performance of the computer systems analysis it appears that reductions in LVM observed after spaceflight may be secondary to fluid exchanges produced by common physiologic mechanisms. Reductions in LVM observed after microgravity exposure have been previously postulated to be a central component of spaceflight-induced cardiovascular deconditioning. However, a recent study has demonstrated a return of astronauts' LVM to preflight values by the third day after landing through uncertain mechanisms. A systems analysis approach using computer simulation techniques allows for a dissection of the complex physiologic control processes and a more detailed examination of the phenomena. From the simulation studies and computer analysis it appears that microgravity induced reductions in LVM may be explained by considering physiologic fluid exchanges rather than cardiac muscle atrophy. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

4267,"Gene alterations as predictors of radiation-induced toxicity in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Background: Optimizing the therapeutic ratio for radiation therapy (RT) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is uniquely challenging owing to high rates of early and late toxicity involving nearby organs at risk. These toxicities have a profound impact on treatment compliance and quality of life. Emerging evidence suggests that RT dose alone cannot fully account for the variable severity of RT-related adverse events (rtAEs) observed in HNSCC patients. Next-generation sequencing has become an increasingly valuable tool with widespread use in the oncology field and is being robustly explored for predicting rtAEs beyond dosimetric data. Method(s): Patients who had Foundation Medicine sequencing data and received RT for primary or locally recurrent HNSCC were selected for this study. Early and late toxicity data were collected and reported based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0. Dosimetric parameters were collected for pertinent structures. Result(s): A total of HNSCC 37 patients were analyzed in this study. Genetic alterations in BRCA2, ERBB3, NOTCH1 and CCND1 were all associated with higher mean grade of toxicity with BRCA2 alteration implicated in all toxicity parameters evaluated including mucositis, early dysphagia, xerostomia and to a lesser extent, late dysphagia. Interestingly, patients who exhibited alterations in both BRCA2 and ERBB3 experienced a twofold or greater increase in early dysphagia, early xerostomia and late dysphagia compared to ERBB3 alteration alone. Furthermore, several gene alterations were associated with improved toxicity outcomes. Within an RT supersensitive patient subset, alterations were found in TNFAIP3, HNF1A, SPTA1 and CASP8. All of these alterations were not found in the RT insensitive patient subset. We found 17 gene alterations in the RT insensitive patient subset that were not found in the RT supersensitive patient subset. Conclusion(s): Despite consistent RT dosimetric parameters, patients with HNSCC experience heterogeneous patterns of rtAEs. Identifying factors associated with toxicity outcomes offers a new avenue for personalized precision RT therapy and prophylactic management. Here, next-generation sequencing in a population of HNSCC patients correlates several genetic alterations with severity of rtAEs. Further analysis is urgently needed to identify genetic patterns associated with rtAEs in order to reduce harmful outcomes in this challenging population.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).",Excluded
4268,"Higher levels of metastasis-inducing S100A4 protein levels are associated with less favourable treatment response to disease modifying antirheumatic drugs in female patients with recent-onset rheumatoid arthritis. Background Metastasis-inducing S100A4 protein was identified as a pro-inflammatory and pro-destructive factor in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Our research group has previously demonstrated that S100A4 is significantly elevated in peripheral blood, synovial fluid and synovial tissue of RA patients and that the levels of S100A4 correlate with disease activity. Objectives To evaluate the levels of S100A4 in serum of patients with recent-onset RA and to characterize the association of S100A4 with disease activity and response to treatment. Methods Serum levels of S100A4 protein were measured by ELISA in 59 patients with recent-onset RA (symptom duration <6 months) before and 3 months after initiation of treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, and cross-sectionally in 42 healthy controls. IgM rheumatoid factor (IgM-RF), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were analysed at baseline. Clinical disease activity (DAS28) was assessed at baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months after initiation of treatment. The degree of radiographic joint damage was calculated from x-rays using the Sharp-van der Heijde Score (SHS) at baseline and at month 12. Results Mean DAS28 (SD) significantly decreased from 5.36 (1.42) at baseline to 3.09 (1.52) at month 3 (n=59) and to 2.69 (1.19) at month 12 (n=40), respectively (p<0.0001). Of the 40 patients with available radiographs, 9 (23%) showed an increase in SHS (SHS >0) after 12 months. The levels of serum S100A4 protein were significantly higher in patients with recent-onset RA compared to healthy controls (646.60+/-602.60 vs. 46.97+/-30.12 ng/ml; p<0.001) and significantly decreased after 3 months of treatment (to 388.10+/-521.00; p<0.001). There was positive correlation of baseline levels of S100A4 with IgM-RF (r=0.611; p<0.0001) and ACPA levels (r=0.471; p<0.001). After adjustment for IgM-RF, the levels of S100A4 at baseline (r=0.403; p<0.05) as well as at month 3 (r=0.548; p<0.01) were positively correlated with DAS28 after 12 months of treatment in female patients (n=28). There was no correlation in male patients. The levels of S100A4 did not correlate with disease activity at baseline or with the change of disease activity over time. Furthermore, there was no association between baseline levels or changes of SA100A4 and achievement of DAS28 remission or radiographic progression. Conclusions Our results indicate that circulating S100A4 levels are significantly higher in patients with recent-onset RA compared to healthy individuals and that higher S100A4 levels at baseline or at month 3 might have predictive potential for worse treatment response at month 12, at least in female patients with recent-onset RA.",Excluded
4269,"Is selective nerve root block necessary for learning percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy: a comparative study using a cumulative summation test for learning curve. Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of lumbar spine selective nerve root block (SNRB) experience on the learning efficiency of percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy (PELD) for junior trainees. Method(s): A total of 480 patients undergoing single-level PELD performed by eight junior trainees were included. The trainees were divided into two groups based on whether they had previous SNRB experience (group A, yes; group B, no). Surgical proficiency was defined as total operation time less than 65 minutes and cumulative radiation exposure time no more than 40 seconds. The learning curve was analyzed by cumulative summation (CUSUM) test. Clinical evaluations included Macnab classification, visual analog scale (VAS)-low back score, VAS-leg score, and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Follow-up information at 12 months was also obtained. Result(s): Integral number of cases before achieving an acceptable surgical level in group A (47.75 +/- 2.50 cases) was significantly smaller than that in group B (56.50 +/- 1.29 cases, p < 0.05), along with less accumulated failure (18.75 +/- 0.96 cases vs. 25.50 +/- 1.75 cases, p < 0.05). The two groups were comparable in clinical outcomes. Forty-seven cases of complications were observed, with 17 in group A and 30 in group B (p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Previous experience of SNRB improved the performance of PELD with shorter operation time and less radiation exposure. SNRB practice may reduce the complication rate without a significant effect on the recurrence of symptoms and reoperation.Copyright © 2020, SICOT aisbl.",Excluded
4270,"Salivary gland cancer in the United States. The risk of salivary gland cancer (SGC) is increased in atomic bomb survivors and after radiotherapy, but other risk factors are not well established. Some studies have suggested an association of SGC with breast cancer and with exposure to various viruses or UVB radiation. Corroborating evidence of these associations was sought by using population-based registries to examine the demographic distribution of SGC, patterns of secondary primary cancers after SGC, and risk of SGC with AIDS. SGC incidence per 100,000 persons did not change between 1973 and 1992, averaging 1.2 in males and 0.8 in females, with a steep age gradient. To examine the relationship between UVB exposure and SGC, population-based, age-adjusted incidence rates of SGC were plotted against the UVB insolation of each registry site. Regression analysis suggested no correlation between SGC incidence and increasing UVB insolation (beta = 0.10, R2 = 0.08). SGC also did not appear to be associated with second cancers that have been linked to herpes or papilloma viruses or with AIDS [observed/expected (O/E) ratio, <2.8], but all of these conditions are so uncommon that only very large relative risks would have been statistically significant. Women with SGC before age 35 had a statistically nonsignificant elevation in breast cancer risk [O/E, 3.30; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.66-9.65], and older women had no increased risk of breast cancer. SGC patients were at increased risk for nonsalivary, second-primary oropharyngeal cancers (O/E, 3.27; 95% CI, 2.00-5.05), thyroid cancer (O/E, 3.31; 95% CI, 1,07-7.73), and lung cancer (O/E, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.45-2.35), particularly in patients whose SGC was treated with radiotherapy (O/E, 2.83; 95% CI, 2.06-3.80). In summary, SGC remains rare and does not appear to be associated with AIDS, virally related malignancies, or UVB. Patients who have had SGC, however, should be monitored for subsequent oropharyngeal, thyroid, and lung cancers.",Excluded
4271,"Safety and efficacy of minimally invasive percutaneous nephrolithotomy in the treatment of patients with medullary sponge kidney. The purpose of this study was to review the safety and efficacy of the minimally invasive percutaneous nephrolithotomy in the treatment of medullary sponge kidney patients with complex renal calculi. Sixteen medullary sponge kidney patients with complex renal calculi underwent minimally invasive percutaneous nephrolithotomy procedures in our center were entered into this retrospective study. The data analyzed included patients' demographics, stone burden, operative time, operative blood loss, length of hospital stay, complications according to the modified Clavien system, and stone-free rate. All the patients in this study had complex renal stones that included 14 multiple stones and 3 partial staghorn calculi. The mean stone surface area was 779.5 +/- 421.1 mm2. Preoperative urinary tract infection was noted in 5 (31.2 %) patients. Minimally invasive percutaneous nephrolithotomy was successfully completed in 15 renal units in 14 patients. Two patients failed the procedure. The mean operative time was 87.3 +/- 32.3 min. Mean hemoglobin drop was 25.3 +/- 16.5 g/L. An initial stone-free rate of 60 % was achieved after the procedure, and the final stone-free rate was 86.6 % after auxiliary second look and/or shock-wave lithotripsy. Clavien grade I and II complications occurred in 3 (21.4 %) patients including the one (7.1 %) patient who required transfusion. All the complications were managed conservatively. No major complications occurred. This retrospective analysis confirmed that minimally invasive percutaneous nephrolithotomy was a safe alternative treatment for the medullary sponge kidney patients with complex renal calculi. This procedure provided an acceptable stone-free rate and low incidence of high-grade complications. Stone-free rate further could be further improved with auxiliary procedures.Copyright © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
4272,"Effects of a compound vitamin B mixture in combination with GeneTime R on radiation-induced oral mucositis. OBJECTIVE: Both compound vitamin B mixtures and GeneTime R have been used in treatment of oral inflammation. This study aimed to assess the therapeutic effects of a compound vitamin B mixture combined with GeneTime R on radiation-induced oral mucositis., METHODS: A total of 100 patients with radiation-induced oral mucositis were randomly divided into a control group (vitamin B alone; n = 50 patients) and an observation group (vitamin B plus GeneTime R, n = 50 patients). Clinical outcomes were compared between the two groups for the following 3 weeks., RESULTS: The observation group had a significantly greater number of grade 0-I patients and significantly fewer grade II-IV patients than the control group. Among patients in the observation group, a significantly greater number of ulcers healed within 1-2 weeks, compared with those in patients in the control group. Significantly fewer ulcers healed among patients in the observation group at 3 weeks; notably, there were fewer ulcers to heal in the observation group, compared with the control group., CONCLUSIONS: Use of a compound vitamin B mixture combined with GeneTime R exerted obvious therapeutic effects on radiation-induced oral mucositis and markedly shortened ulcer healing time.

4273,"Phase III trial of concurrent thoracic radiotherapy with either first- or third-cycle chemotherapy for limited-disease small-cell lung cancer. Background: We compared late thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) with early TRT in the treatment of limited-disease small-cell lung cancer (LD-SCLC). Patients and Methods: Patients with LD-SCLC received four cycles of etoposide plus cisplatin every 21 days. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either TRT administered concurrently with the first cycle (early TRT) or the third cycle (late TRT) of chemotherapy. The primary end point was complete response rate. Result(s): Two hundred twenty-two patients were randomly assigned. Late TRT was not inferior to early TRT in terms of the complete response rate (early versus late; 36.0% versus 38.0%). Other efficacy measures including overall survival [median, 24.1 versus 26.8 months; hazard ratio (HR) 0.90; 95% CI 0.18-1.62] and progression-free survival (median, 12.4 versus 11.2 months; HR 1.10; 95% CI 0.37-1.84) were not different between two arms. No statistical difference was noted in the pattern of treatment failures. However, neutropenic fever occurred more commonly in the early TRT arm than the late TRT arm (21.6% versus 10.2%; P = 0.02). Conclusion(s): In LD-SCLC treatment, TRT starting in the third cycle of chemotherapy seemed to be noninferior to early TRT, and had a more favorable profile with regard to neutropenic fever. © The Author 2013.

AIM: Tumor response and normal tissue toxicity of seven-day-per-week continuous accelerated irradiation (CAIR) for patients with esophageal carcinoma were evaluated and compared to conventional irradiation (CR)., METHODS: Sixty patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus were randomized into two groups: the CAIR group (30 patients) and the CR group (30 patients). Patients in the CAIR group received radiotherapy (RT) with 2 Gy/fraction per day at 7 d/wk with a total dose of 50-70 Gy (average dose 64.2 Gy). The overall time of irradiation was 3.6-5.0 wk (average 4.6 wk). RT in the CR group was 2 Gy/fraction per day at 5 d/wk with a total dose of 40-70 Gy (average dose 61.7 Gy). The overall time of irradiation was 4.0-7.0 wk (average 6.4 wk)., RESULTS: The data showed that the immediate tumor response to RT was better in the CAIR group than in the CR group. Efficiency rates (CR plus PR) were 82.8% (24/29) and 58.6% (17/29), respectively (P = 0.047). In both groups the incidences of esophagitis and tracheitis were insignificant (P = 0.376, 0.959), and no patient received toxicity that could not be tolerated., CONCLUSION: CAIR shortens overall treatment time and is well tolerated by patients. It may be superior to CR in enhancing the local response of tumor, but its remote effect for esophageal carcinoma awaits further follow-up.",Excluded
4275,"pH-Sensitive and Long-Circulation Nanoparticles for Near-Infrared Fluorescence Imaging-Monitored and Chemo-Photothermal Synergistic Treatment Against Gastric Cancer. Gastrectomy is the primary therapeutic option for gastric cancer. Postoperative treatment also plays a crucial role. The strategy to improve the postoperative prognosis of gastric cancer requires a combined system that includes a more efficient synergistic treatment and real-time monitoring after surgery. In this study, photothermal-chemotherapy combined nanoparticles (PCC NPs) were prepared via pi-pi stacking to perform chemo-photothermal synergistic therapy and continuous imaging of gastric cancer. PCC NPs had a spherical morphology and good monodispersity under aqueous conditions. The hydrodynamic diameter of PCC NPs was 59.4 +/- 3.6 nm. PCC NPs possessed strong encapsulation ability, and the maximum drug loading rate was approximately 37%. The NPs exhibited extraordinary stability and pH-response release profiles. The NPs were rapidly heated under irradiation. The maximum temperature was close to 58degreeC. PCC NPs showed good biocompatibility both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the NPs could effectively be used for in vivo continuous monitoring of gastric cancer. After one injection, the fluorescent signal remained in tumor tissues for nearly a week. The inhibitory effect of PCC NPs was evaluated in a gastric cancer cell line and xenograft mouse model. Both in vitro and in vivo evaluations demonstrated that PCC NPs could be used for chemo-photothermal synergistic therapy. The suppression effect of PCC NPs was significantly better than that of single chemotherapy or photothermal treatment. This study lays the foundation for the development of novel postoperative treatments for gastric cancer.© Copyright © 2020 Zhou, Sun, Zhou and Zhang.",Excluded

All computed tomography (CT) examinations were performed in two groups with the same tube voltage (100 kV), flow rate of contrast medium (5.0 mL/s), and iodine dose (22.8 g). An automatic mAs and low concentration contrast medium (300 mgI/mL) were used in group A, whereas effective mAs was reduced by a factor 0.6 along with HCCM (400 mgI/mL) in group B. Radiation dose was assessed (CT dose index [CTDIvol] and dose length product), and vessel-based objective IQ for various regions of interest (enhancement, noise, signal-to-noise ratio, and contrast-to-noise ratio), subjective IQ, noise, and motion artifacts were analyzed overall and vessel-based with a 5-point Likert scale., RESULTS: The CT attenuation of coronary arteries and image noise in group B were significantly higher than those in group A (ranges: 507.5-548.1 Hounsfield units vs 407.5-444.5 Hounsfield units; and 20.3 +/- 8.6 vs 17.7 +/- 8.0) (P <= 0.0166).

4279,"Fluselenamyl: Evaluation of radiation dosimetry in mice and pharmacokinetics in brains of non-human primate. Introduction: To allow quantitative assessment of therapeutic efficacy for therapeutic interventions (either approved or undergoing FDA approvals) for either inhibiting or reducing development of Abeta pathophysiology in vivo, 18F-labelled tracers, such as Florbetapir, Florbetaben, and Flutemetamol have been approved. Previously, we have reported on development and preclinical validation of 18F-Fluselenamyl, comprising traits of translatable Abeta imaging agents. Herein, we report the dosimetry data for 18F-Fluselenamyl to provide radiation dose deposited within organs and determine effective dose (ED) for human studies, while also evaluating its pharmacokinetics in the nonhuman primate brains. Method(s): To evaluate safety profiles of 18F-Fluselenamyl for enabling its deployment as a PET imaging agent for monitoring Abeta pathophysiology in vivo, we estimated the human radiation dosimetry extrapolated from rodent biodistribution data obtained by standard method of organ dissection. Animal biodistribution studies were performed in FVB/NCR mice (20 males, 20 females), following tail-vein injection of the tracer. Following euthanasia of mice, organs were harvested, counted, radiation dose to each organ and whole body was determined using the standard MIRD methodology. For evaluation of pharmacokinetics in non-human primates, following intravenous injection of the tracer, dynamic PET scan of rhesus monkey brains were performed, and co-registered with MR for anatomical reference. Parametric images of tracer transport rate constant and distribution volume relative to cerebellum were generated using a simplified reference tissue model and a spatially-constraint linear regression algorithm. Result(s): The critical organ in humans has been determined to be the gall bladder with a gender average radiation absorbed dose of 0.079 mGy/MBq with an effective dose of 0.017 mSv/MBq and 0.020 mSv/MBq, in males and females, respectively. Therefore, these data provide preliminary projections on human dosimetry derived from rodent estimates, thereby defining safe imaging conditions for further validations in human subjects. Additionally, the tracer penetrated the non-human primate brain and excreted to background levels at later-time points thus pointing to the potential for high signal/noise ratios during noninvasive imaging. Tissue time activity curves (TACs) also show fast initial uptake with maximum projection of activity at 2-6 min post administration followed by clearance of activity at later time-points from cortex, cerebellum, and white matter of nonhuman primate brain. Parametric images confirmed that the 18F-Fluselenamyl has relative high transport rate constant at striatum, thalamus, and cortex. Conclusion(s): The data obtained from radiation dosimetry studies in mice indicate that 18F-Fluselenamyl can be safely used for further evaluation in humans. Additionally, 18F-Fluselenamyl demonstrated ability to traverse the blood brain barrier (BBB) and indicated high initial influx, followed by clearance to background levels in non-human primate brains. Combined information indicates that 18F-Fluselenamyl would be a potential candidate for detecting amyloid plaques in the living human brain.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
4280,"Correlation of factors affecting correction of meniscal extrusion and outcome after medial meniscus root repair. Introduction: Meniscus extrusion in medial meniscus posterior root tears (MMPRT) is a consistent MRI finding and correction of extrusion is a primary objective of the meniscal root repair. The purpose of the study is to evaluate feasibility of correction of extrusion and correlation of various factors affecting the postoperative extrusion correction and outcomes in all degenerative medial meniscus posterior roots (MMPRTs). Method(s): A retrospective study of patients who presented with degenerative MMPRTs following trivial incident (Jun 2014 and Aug 2018) and included isolated Laprade type 2 root tear with extrusion in MRI. Patients with ligament injuries, tricompartmental arthritis, malalignment (> 50) and irreparable meniscal tears excluded. All patients underwent arthroscopic trans-tibial tunnel suture pull-out repair. A screening MRI was taken at a 6-month follow-up and functional scores (IKDC and Lysholm's) at final follow-up. The effects of age, gender, duration of symptoms, hip-knee-ankle angle on weight-bearing X-rays, ICRS grading of cartilage status, and MRI data (extrusion distance, tunnel location and healing status of meniscus) on outcomes were analysed. Result(s): MMPRT (n = 54) with a mean follow-up of 34.6 months (24-48). Mean functional outcomes improved postoperatively IKDC (43.40 +/- 5.16-78.65 +/- 5.11, p < 0.001) and Lysholm's (65.27 +/- 4.28-83.16 +/- 4.83, p < 0.001) scores at final follow-up. 57.4% (31) had good correction of extrusion, 3.7% (2) no correction and 38.8% (21) showed increase in extrusion postoperatively. Of all the factors we explored, age, ICRS (low grade) and knee varus (less 2.5 degree) affected extrusion correction. Patients with healed (41 patients), partially healed (9 patients) and anatomic tunnel placement (46 patients) had better extrusion correction than those with non-healing (4 patients) and non-anatomical tunnel (8 patients). Conclusion(s): Patients younger than 50 years, with low grade cartilage damage (ICRS 1, 2), lower KL grade and varus alignment (< 2.50) had good correction of extrusion. Correction of extrusion/progression of extrusion did not influence the clinical outcome at the short-term. The progression of meniscal extrusion is inevitable even after successful repair in elderly and high-risk patients.

4282,"Effect of fluoroscopic X-rays combined with iodinated radiographic contrast media on human hematological parameters. Introduction: Fluoroscopic X-rays are widely used for examinations around the world. Technicians often use an iodinated radiographic contrast media during fluoroscopic X-ray examinations. Objective(s): This study examined the impact on hematological parameters for human blood and morphology of red blood cells that were exposed to fluoroscopic X-ray combined with iodinated radiographic contrast media, i.e., iopromid, iohexol, and iodixanol. Method(s): Blood samples from male and female subjects were incubated with 5 mgI/mL of iodinated radiographic contrast media for 5 min, then were irradiated using fluoroscopic X-rays (70 kV, 0.8 mA) for 10, 30, and 60 min. Hematological parameters of the blood samples were determined by a clinical service center, and morphology of red blood cells was examined by light microscope. Comparison of mean values of hematological parameters based on the student's t-tests between irradiated blood alone, iodinated radiographic contrast media-incubated blood alone, and combination-exposed blood to each corresponding control blood was performed. Result(s): These data showed no change in the hematological parameters and morphology of red blood cells in irradiated blood alone, iodinated radiographic contrast media-incubated blood alone, and combination-exposed blood in both male and female subjects when compared to control blood at all fluoroscopic X-ray times. Conclusion(s): These finding suggested that there were no harmful effects following fluoroscopic X-rays combined with iodinated radiographic contrast media when human blood was irradiated in an in vitro condition.Copyright © 2021, Korean Society of Environmental Risk Assessment and Health Science.",Included
4283,"Morphologic alterations in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma after preoperative high dose rate intraluminal brachytherapy. BACKGROUND: Total esophagectomy specimens from 4 patients given preoperative high dose rate intraluminal brachytherapy (HDRILBT) of 20 Gray (GY) in 2 fractions of 10 Gy each week were reviewed for radiation changes., METHODS: In all patients, preoperative biopsy specimens showed moderate to poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with minimal to negligible keratin production. The esophagectomy specimens were sampled at the resection margins, the edge of irradiated length, 1 cm from the proximal and distal edge of visible tumor, the center of the tumor, and the lymph nodes., RESULTS: Radiation change in the form of fibrosis was limited to the submucosa at the resection margins, the circular muscle layer at the edge of irradiated length, and full thickness at 1 cm from the edge of the visible tumor and the center of the tumor. Surface epithelium did not show any changes at the resection margins but did show basal cell hyperplasia at the edge of the irradiated length and ulceration at 1 cm from the edge of the visible tumor and the center of the tumor. Endarteritis obliterans was seen only 1 cm from the edge of the visible tumor and the center of the tumor. Necrosis, intense keratin formation, and giant cell reaction were observed at the center of the tumor. When compared with the preradiotherapy biopsies, the amount of keratin in the postradiotherapy specimens was extensive. HDRILBT may cause induction of the keratin gene in the irradiated cells to stimulate differentiation toward better differentiated cells., CONCLUSIONS: HDRILBT may cause the keratin gene in the irradiated cells to induce differentiation toward better differentiated cells. Preoperative high dose rate intraluminal brachytherapy may have a role in improving the prognosis of patients with early esophageal cancer treated with a combination of radiotherapy and surgery.",Excluded

Objective: The aim of our study is to analyse the results of percutaneous radiofrequency trigeminal rhizotomy for treatment of idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia. Method(s): We inspected the results of 106 patients with the diagnoses of idiopathic neuralgia that treated with percutaneous radiofrequency trigeminal rhizotomy retrospectively. The scores of visual analog scale(VAS) were noted preoperative and postoperative periods at 1st, 3rd, 6th and 12th months and were used for statistical analysis. Result(s): Mean age of 106 patients was 67.31+/-8.85 years. Duration of symptoms was 19.1+/-13.1 months. Duration of symptoms did not change significantly according to gender (p=0.755), or site of trigeminal pain (p=0.158). There was not any statistical significance between gender, effected branch of trigemial nerve and side of the pain. Preoperative mean VAS score was 9.6+/-0.75. Postoperative mean VAS score values were 3.25+/-2.44 at first month, 3.23+/-2.43 at third months, 3.12+/-2.78 at sixth months and 2.59+/-3.18 at postoperative twelfth months. We found statistically significant difference between preoperative and postoperative 1st, 3rd, 6th and 12th months VAS scores (p<0.001). Conclusion(s): Percutaneous radiofrequency trigeminal rhizotomy is the minimally invasive treatment modality with lower complication rates and it has a high rate of efficacy when compared with invasive methods. It is most cost-effective procedure to choose if the pain recurs.Copyright © 2018, AVES Ibrahim KARA. All rights reserved.",Excluded
4285,"Clinical and molecular recursive partitioning analysis of high-grade glioma treated with IMRT. Introduction: Despite multimodal treatment for high-grade gliomas, prognosis remains grim. Prior Radiation Therapy Oncology Group-Recursive Partitioning Analysis (RTOG-RPA) reports indicate based on pretreatment and treatment-related factors, a subset of patients experience a significantly improved survival. Since the development of the RTOG-RPA, high-grade gliomas have seen the widespread introduction of temozolomide and tumor oncogenetics. Here we aimed to determine whether the RTOG-RPA retained prognostic significance in the context of modern treatment, as well as generate an updated RPA incorporating both clinical and genetic variables. Method(s): Patients with histologically proven glioblastoma, gliosarcoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, and anaplastic oligodendroglioma treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) between 2004 and 2017 were reviewed. The primary endpoint was overall survival from date of diagnosis. Primary analysis compared actual survival rates to that expected of corresponding RTOG-RPA class. Secondary analysis utilized the rpart function to recursively partition overall survival by numerous clinical and genetic pretreatment and treatment-related variables. A tertiary analysis recursively partitioned a subset of patients in which the status of all genetic markers were known. Result(s): We identified 878 patients with histologically proven high-grade glioma treated with IMRT and 291 patients in our genetic subset. Median overall survival for the entire cohort was 14.2 months (95% confidence interval, 13.1-15.3). Applying the RTOG-RPA to our cohort validated the relative prognostic ordering of the survival classes except class II. Generating our new RPA created 7 significantly different survival classes (P<0.001, chi 2 =584) with median survival ranging from 96.4 to 2.9 months based on age, histology, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation status, radiation fractions, tumor location, radiation dose, temozolomide status, and resection status. Our second RPA of our genetic subset generated 5 significantly different survival classes (P<0.001, chi 2 =166) with survival ranging from 65.3 to 5.6 months based on age, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutation status, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation status, neurological functional classification, hospitalization during IMRT, temozolomide status, and Karnofsky performance status. Conclusion(s): The RTOG-RPA retains partial prognostic significance, however, should be updated to reflect recent advancements. This series represents a large RPA analyzing both clinical and genetic factors and generated 7 distinct survival classes. Further assessment of patients with fully available genetic markers generated 5 distinct survival classes. These survival classifications need to be validated by a prospective data set and compared against the RTOG-RPA to determine whether they provide improved prognostic power.© Copyright 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

4287,"Preoperative radiotherapy contributes to induction of proliferative activity of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating T-cells in oral squamous cell carcinoma. In order to evaluate host immune response to cancer, many methods have been applied. However, in the field of oral squamous cell carcinoma, evaluation of host immune response on the basis of proliferative activity of tumor-infiltrating T-cells (TIL) has not been reported. Therefore, we applied double immunohistochemical staining of proliferation markers Ki-67 and CD8 to surgically resected and paraffin-embedded tissue sections for 35 cases of oral squamous cell carcinoma. With this method, there was a significant correlation between the percentage of Ki-67+CD8+TIL and the intra-tumor epithelium infiltration rate of CD8+TIL (P=0.0237). In the process of analysis, we found that the proliferative activity of CD8+TIL tended to correlate (P=0.0859) with clinical N factor (lymph node metastasis), which was previously reported to suppress host immune response. We therefore assumed there was another factor inducing host immune response. The proliferative activity of CD8+TIL was well correlated with preoperative radiotherapy (P=0.0200) while there was no significant correlation between the proliferative activity of CD8+TIL and other clinical factors; age, tumor size, clinical stage, pathological N factor (P=0.5410, 0.7769, 0.1041, and 0.1072, respectively). Our present results strongly imply that preoperative radiotherapy is a very important factor in oral squamous cell carcinoma inducing host immune response regardless of the clinical factors present.",Excluded
4288,"Randomized clinical trial on 7-days-a-week post-operative radiotherapy vs concurrent post-operative radiochemotherapy in locally advanced cancer of the oral cavity/oropharynx: a report on acute normal tissue reactions. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to evaluate acute normal tissue reactions and treatment compliance in a randomized clinical trial on 7-days-a-week post-operative radiotherapy (p-CAIR) vs post-operative concurrent radiochemotherapy (p-RTCT) in locally advanced cancer of the oral cavity/oropharynx. The sample analyzed at present represents approximately 30% of the intended future trial size., METHODS: The patients were randomly assigned to receive 63 Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions 7 days a week (n = 44) or 63 Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions 5 days a week with concurrent cisplatin 80-100 mg per square metre of body surface area on Days 1, 22 and 43 of the course of radiotherapy (n = 40). Acute mucosal reactions were scored using the modified Dische system., RESULTS: 15 (17.9%) patients, including 5 patients in p-CAIR and 10 patients in p-RTCT, did not comply with the assigned radiation treatment, mostly because of rapid tumour progression or deteriorating general performance. In p-RTCT, 22 (55%) patients received less than the intended three courses of chemotherapy mostly owing to haematological toxicity. The average maximum mucosal severity score was 14.2 in p-CAIR compared with 13.4 in p-RTCT; the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.31)., CONCLUSION: The schedules compared (p-CAIR and p-RTCT) did not differ considerably with respect to acute mucosal reactions. Haematological toxicity in p-RTCT was elevated compared with p-CAIR. Both schedules were considered tolerable with respect to acute toxicity, which justifies further recruitment to the trial., ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: The results show that early mucosal reactions are comparable in both trial arms but haematological toxicity is more pronounced during radiochemotherapy.",Excluded

4290,"Radiation esophagitis in the treatment for lung cancer. We retrospectively studied the 62 patients with primary lung cancer (56 males and 6 females) who were admitted to our department from January 1990 to December 1996. They were treated with radiation therapy (twice daily) for the chest, including the esophagus. The total radiation dose was 55.6Gy (mean). Esophagitis occurred in 48 patients (77%) after 29.7Gy (mean) of radiation. The symptoms of esophagitis included pharyngeal or chest pain, especially during swallowing. The incidence of esophagitis in the patients (n=46) who received chemotherapy before radiation was significantly higher than that in the patients (n=16) who did not receive it (87% vs. 50%; p<0.05). Esophagitis occurred in 22 (81%) among 27 patients who were given the preventive medicine. In spite of the optimal or supplemental administration of mucosal coating agents, esophagitis improved only in six patients (12%). Severe esophagitis was also observed in some patients, including two patients whose irradiation was terminated and one patient who was treated with intravenous hyperalimentation. Although radiation esophagitis is a very common complication in the treatment for lung cancer, it is refractory to usual treatments. Consequently, it is necessary to develop more effective prophylactic and treatment methods for radiation esophagitis.",Excluded
4291,"Twice-daily Thoracic Radiotherapy for Limited-stage Small-cell Lung Cancer Does Not Increase the Incidence of Acute Severe Esophagitis. PURPOSE: Acute esophagitis is common after thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) given with chemotherapy for limited-stage small-cell lung cancer (LS SCLC). Although twice-daily TRT to 45 Gy in 30 fractions is considered standard, some clinicians are reluctant to use this schedule because of its perceived impracticality and risk of severe esophagitis. We reviewed a single-institution experience with severe (grade >= 3) esophagitis after TRT with chemotherapy for LS SCLC., PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 504 patients were identified as having received TRT (>=45 Gy) with platinum-containing chemotherapy for LS SCLC at MD Anderson Cancer Center in 1987 through 2012. Patients with complete or good partial response were offered prophylactic cranial irradiation. Esophagitis was scored retrospectively with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, V3.0. Clinical variables were analyzed for possible association with acute grade >= 3 esophagitis., RESULTS: At a median follow-up time of 23.9 months (range, 1.2-240.8 months), 103 (20%) patients had experienced grade >= 3 esophagitis. In univariate analysis, TRT dose >= 60 Gy was the only factor associated with severe esophagitis (odds ratio [OR], 1.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-3.30; P = .043); use of twice-daily TRT was not (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.61-1.52; P = .867). The significance of TRT to >= 60 Gy was maintained in multivariate Cox regression analysis adjusted for tumor size (OR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.05-3.46; P = .034)., CONCLUSIONS: TRT to >= 60 Gy predicted acute severe esophagitis, but twice-daily fractionation did not. Standard-dose 45-Gy twice-daily TRT should not be avoided for fear of severe esophagitis. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
4292,"The impact of PET/CT on radiotherapy of anal cancer. Purpose: To compare Transanal endoscopic Ultrasound (TAUS) and abdominal Ultrasound (US) with PET/CT in detecting regional lymph noDe metastases in patients with anal cancer. The impact of the PET/CT on the treatment plan was evaluated. Materials: Ninety-five (95) patients referred to our clinic between July 1st 2005 and December 31 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. All patients had biopsy-proven primary squamous cell cancer of the anal canal. There were 65 females (68%) and 30 males (32%), and the median age was 58 (age range 35-88 years). All patients were staged during anaesthesia with 3- Dimensional Transanal Endoscopic Ultrasound (TAUS) and US of the inguinal regions. Seventy-seven (77) patients were furthermore examined with US of the abdomen. All 95 patients underwent whole-body FDG-PET/CT as part of radiotherapy planning. The detection of suspicious perirectal, internal iliac and inguinal lymph nodes by TAUS/US and PET/CT, respectively, was evaluated. Suspicious perirectal and internal iliac lymph noDe were not biopsied. Suspicious inguinal lymph nodes were biopsied with few exceptions. Result(s): Twenty-eight patients were diagnosed with suspicious perirectal noDe metastases. TAUS identified 24 of the patients. PET/CT identified 15, nine of which had not been seen on TAUS. Eleven patients were diagnosed with suspicious internal iliac noDe metastases, all of which were detected on PET/CT. One of these patients had not been examined with abdominal US. US diagnosed suspicious internal iliac nodes in one patient.Inguinal nodes suspicious of malignancy were visualized on either US or PET/CT in 41 patients. Seventeen (17) of these had confirmed malignant disease on biopsy, and 15 had confirmed benign disease. All 17 patients (100%) with malignant inguinal nodes were diagnosed by PET/CT, whereas US identified 16 of the 17 patients (94%). PET/CT detected suspicious inguinal nodes in 10 patients, which had not been seen on US. On biopsies one of these was proven malignant, three were benign and six did not have any biopsy. Five patients had their treatment changed from radiotherapy alone to concomitant chemoradiotherapy due to the finding of lymph noDe metastases on the PET/CT. Two of these patients had suspicious perirectal nodes, one patient had internal iliac nodes, and the final two patients had inguinal lymph noDe metastasis, of which one was proven malignant on biopsy, and in the other case no biopsy was performed.Six patients were radiated on either one or both inguinal regions as a consequence of additional inguinal noDe metastases detected on the PET/CT. (Table presented) Conclusion(s): Compared to TAUS/US,PET/CT seems important for especially the N2/3-stage in anal cancer and resulted in additional inguinal irradiation of either one or both sides in six patients. The detection of additional lymph noDe metastases on PET/CT resulted in five patients receiving concomitant chemoradiotherapy instead of radiotherapy alone. It is a limitation of this study that not all suspicious lymph nodes were biopsied. However, the true sensitivity and specificity of any staging technique cannot be determined unless the patients undergo a full lymph noDe exairesis. Finally, a minor part of the patients had not been examined with US of the abdomen which makes it impossible to compare PET/CT and US regarding the detection of internal iliac metastases in these cases.",Excluded
4293,"Dentists' use of digital radiographic techniques: Part I - intraoral X-ray: a questionnaire study of Swedish dentists. OBJECTIVE: The present study aims to gain knowledge about the dentist's use and choice of digital intraoral imaging methods., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A questionnaire sent to 2481 dentists within the Swedish Dental Society contained questions about the type of X-ray technique used, problems experienced with digital radiography, and reasons for choosing digital technology, and about indications, clinic size and type of service. Response rate was 53%., RESULTS: Ninety-eight percent of the dentists had made the transition to digital radiography; only 2% used film technique, and solid-state detector (SSD) was the most used digital technique. More years in service decreases the likelihood of applying individual indications for performing a full mouth examination. More retakes were done with SSDs compared to storage phosphor plates. Reasons for choosing digital techniques were that work was easier and communication with the patients improved. However, dentists also experienced problems with digital techniques, such as exposure and projection errors and inadequate image quality. The Swedish Radiation Safety Authority states that all radiological examinations should be justified, something not always followed., CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that 98% of the respondents, Swedish dentists within the Swedish Dental Society, used digital techniques, and the most used was the solid-state technique.",Excluded
4294,"Efficacy and safety of single-session argon plasma coagulation in the management of chronic radiation proctitis. Background: Chronic radiation proctitis (CRP) manifests as rectal bleeding 12 to 24 months after pelvic radiotherapy. No criterion standard of treatment has been established, although argon plasma coagulation (APC) has increasingly become the treatment of choice. Previous studies have applied APC over multiple sessions, necessitating increased numbers of treatments. Objective(s): To assess the safety and efficacy of large-volume APC application in the treatment of CRP with the intention of a single-session treatment protocol. Design(s): Prospective study. Setting(s): Tertiary referral hospital. Patient(s): Over an 8-year period, consecutive patients with CRP with rectal bleeding were prospectively enrolled. Intervention(s): Large-volume APC application to affected rectal mucosa. Main Outcome Measurements: Number of treatments, bleeding scores, complications. Result(s): Fifty patients (mean age 72.1 years; range 51-87 years) were treated; 45 were men (prostate cancer). The mean period between radiotherapy and initial APC treatment was 23 months (range 4-140 months). Seventeen (34%) patients had grade A endoscopic severity, 23 (46%) grade B, and 10 (20%) grade C. Other therapies failed in 16 (32%) patients. The mean number of treatments was 1.36 (range 1-3) with a mean follow-up of 20.6 months (range 6-48 months). Sixty-eight percent of patients were successfully treated after 1 session and 96% after 2 sessions. Bleeding scores improved in all patients (P < .001). Seventeen (34%) patients experienced short-term, self-limiting complications; 1 (2%) patient experienced a long-term complication. Limitation(s): Nonrandomized study. Conclusion(s): Large-volume APC treatment was successful in the treatment of CRP, including those in whom other therapies had previously failed, and resulted in a decreased number of treatments compared with other published studies. The benefits were offset by an increased incidence of short-term complications but no increase in long-term complications. © 2010 American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.",Excluded

Background: Local recurrence (LR) rates in patients with retroperitoneal sarcoma (RPS) are high, ranging from 40% to 80%, with no definitive studies describing the best way to administer radiation. Intraoperative electron beam radiation therapy (IOERT) provides a theoretical advantage for access to the tumor bed with reduced toxicity to surrounding structures. The goal of this study was to evaluate the role of IOERT in high-risk patients. Method(s): An institutional review board approved, single institution sarcoma database was queried to identify patients who received IOERT for treatment of RPS from 2/2001 to 1/2009. Data were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, Cox regression, and Fisher Exact tests. Result(s): Eighteen patients (median age 51 y, 25-76 y) underwent tumor resection with IOERT (median dose 1250 cGy) for primary (n = 13) and recurrent (n = 5) RPS. Seventeen patients received neoadjuvant radiotherapy. Eight high-grade and 10 low-grade tumors were identified. Median tumor size was 15 cm. Four patients died and two in the perioperative period. Median follow-up of survivors was 3.6 y. Five patients (31%) developed an LR in the irradiated field. Three patients with primary disease (25%) and two (50%) with recurrent disease developed an LR (P = 0.5). Four patients with high-grade tumors (57%) and one with a low-grade tumor (11%) developed an LR (P = 0.1). The 2- and 5-y OS rates were 100% and 72%. Two- and 5-y LR rates were 13% and 36%. Conclusion(s): Using a multidisciplinary approach, we have achieved low LR rates in our high-risk patient population indicating that IOERT may play an important role in managing these patients. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

OBJECT: In this study the authors evaluated levels of radiation exposure to surgeons' protected and unprotected hands during fluoroscopically assisted vertebroplasty., METHODS: The amount of radiation administered to 30 patients during 41 procedures in a controlled prospective trial over 6 months was assessed, comparing radiation exposure to the right and left hands in two neurosurgeons. Effective skin doses were evaluated using thermoluminescent finger dosimeters (ring dosimeters). The ratios of finger dosimeter exposure were compared between the glove-protected and unprotected left hands of two surgeons and both unprotected right hands. In addition, dose-area product (DAP) and fluoroscopy times were recorded in all patients. The mean treatment-effective dose to the surgeons' hands was 0.49 +/- 0.4 mSv in the glove-protected left hand and 1.81 +/- 1.31 mSv in the unprotected left hand (p < 0.05). The mean effective hand doses were 0.59 +/- 0.55 mSv in the unprotected right hand of the glove-protected surgeon and 0.62 +/- 0.55 mSv in the unprotected right hand of the control surgeon. The total corresponding fluoroscopy time was 38.55 minutes for the protected surgeon and 41.23 minutes for the unprotected one (p > 0.05). Lead glove shielding resulted in a radiation dose reduction of 75%. The total DAP for all procedures was 256,496 mGy/cm2 and 221,408 mGy/cm2 (p > 0.05) for the protected and unprotected surgeons, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasizes the importance of surgeons wearing lead glove protection on their leading hands during percutaneous vertebroplasty procedures and demonstrates a 75% reduction rate of exposure to radiation.",Excluded

Ultraviolet-A1 (UVA1) phototherapy is effective for a variety of dermatological diseases. We examined the effectiveness and reliability of low-dose UVA1 phototherapy (60kJ/m2/treatment) in patients suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We studied the changes in immunological parameters. Methods. The patients received a 9-week course of phototherapy according to the following regimen: five times a week during the first 3 weeks, three times a week during the second 3 weeks and twice during the last 3 weeks. Among other things, we analysed the proportions of T helper 1 (Th1), Th2, T cytotoxic (Tc1) and Tc2 cell populations in the peripheral blood of patients by flow cytometric detection of intracytoplasmic interferongamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin 4 (IL-4). Results. Our study showed the improvement of clinical symptoms determined by the subjective clinical disease activity scoring and the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI). By the end of UVA1 phototherapy, the mean value of SLEDAI had decreased from 7.2+/-5.6 to 0.9+/-1.8, which was significant (P = 0.005). Immunological investigations detected a decrease in the frequency of IFN-gamma-producing Th1 and Tc1 cells and a decrease in the Th1/Th2 and Tc1/Tc2 ratios after UVA1 therapy. Conclusion. According to the literature, IFN-gamma has a pathogenic role in the development of SLE. We observed a decreased proportion of IFN-gamma-secreting cells, which we think is presumably one of the beneficial effects of UVA1 therapy. On the basis of our study, UVA1 phototherapy does seem to be an effective adjuvant in the treatment of SLE patients. © The Author 2005.

4299,"Cerebral metastases pathology after radiosurgery: a multicenter study. BACKGROUND: To the authors' knowledge, comprehensive human pathologic investigations that explore fundamental radiosurgical effects on metastatic brain tumors are sparse in the literature. The objective of this study was to analyze histopathologic findings in a set of clinically recurrent cerebral metastases after patients underwent stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)., METHODS: In a series of 7500 patients who underwent radiosurgery, 2020 patients (27%) harbored cerebral metastases. Eighteen of 2020 patients (0.9%) underwent subsequent craniotomy for tumor removal anywhere from 1 month to 59 months after they received high-dose irradiation. Histologic and immunohistochemical investigations were performed on the surgically resected tissue specimens. These specimens were within the radiosurgical treatment volume of the metastatic tumor., RESULTS: Light microscopy revealed 3 basic categories of histologic responses: acute-type, subacute-type, and chronic-type tissue reactions. A moderate-to-intense inflammatory cell reaction was seen in the tissue responses of well controlled neoplasms (i.e., in patients who had neoplasms that required craniotomy for recurrent disease > 5 months after SRS), whereas the inflammatory reaction was missing or sparse in poorly controlled neoplasms (patients who required craniotomy for recurrent disease < 5 months after SRS). This reaction was seen within the irradiated tumor volume and not in the peritumoral area nor in areas remote from the radiosurgical treatment volume. Immunohistochemical characterization demonstrated the presence of prominent CD68-positive macrophage and CD3-positive T-lymphocyte populations. A progressively severe vasculopathy also was observed with increasing time after radiosurgery., CONCLUSIONS: Although causality has not been established, a brisk inflammatory response and more severe vasculopathy were observed in lesions in which recurrences were more delayed.

The findings were verified by proctoscopy, histology and subjective personal well being. In ten patients we determined the daily cortisol profiles. Six months post irradiation ten patients underwent barium enema of the colon. During therapy no major complaints were recorded. The proctoscopic findings showed little changes concerning the submucous vascular walls. In none of the patients any kind of late lesion could be observed. The daily cortisol profile did not show any aberration of the physiological patterns. In conclusion the local therapy of Colifoam can be considered an additional treatment of radiation-induced colitis (proctitis).",Excluded
4301,"Impact of shoulder deformation on volumetric modulated arc therapy doses for head and neck cancer. PURPOSE: When using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) for head and neck cancer, setup errors regarding the shoulders can create loss of target coverage or increased organ-at-risk doses. This study created variations of realistic shoulder deformations to understand the associated VMAT dosimetric effects and investigated water-equivalent thickness (WET) differences using in-house software., METHODS: Ten patients with head and neck cancer with lower neck involvement were retrospectively and randomly enrolled. Their retrospective analysis comprised treatment planning using RayStation 5.0 (RaySearch Laboratories, Stockholm, Sweden), shoulder deformation of 5-15mm in three-dimensional axes using the ImSimQA package (Oncology Systems Limited, Shrewsbury, Shropshire, UK), and evaluation of the clinical impact of the dose distribution after recalculating the dose distribution using computed tomography images of deformed shoulders and deforming the dose distribution. Additionally, our in-house software program was used to measure WET differences for shoulder deformation., RESULTS: WET differences were greater in the superoinferior (SI) direction than in the other directions (the WET difference was >20mm for 15-mm SI deformation). D99%, D98%, and D95% for all clinical target volumes were within 3%. Local dose differences of more than +/-10% were found for normal tissues at the level of the shoulder for 15-mm movement in the SI direction., CONCLUSIONS: Shoulder deformation of >6mm could cause large dose variations delivered to the targeted tissue at the level of the shoulder. Thus, to ensure delivery of appropriate treatment coverage to the targeted tissue, shoulder deformation should be taken into consideration during the planning stage.

Severe combined immunodeficient mice bearing uveal melanoma tumors or engineered MC1R-positive and -negative tumors were studied for biodistribution and efficacy. Radiation dosimetry was calculated using mouse biodistribution data and blood clearance kinetics from Sprague-Dawley rat data. Results: High biostability, MC1R-specific cytotoxicity, and high binding affinity were observed. Limiting toxicities were not observed at even the highest administered activities. Pharmacokinetics and biodistribution studies revealed rapid blood clearance (<15 min), renal and hepatobillary excretion, MC1R-specific tumor uptake, and minimal retention in other normal tissues. Radiation dosimetry calculations determined pharmacokinetics parameters and absorbed alpha-emission dosages from 225Ac and its daughters. Efficacy studies demonstrated significantly prolonged survival and decreased metastasis burden after a single administration of 225Ac-DOTA-MC1RL in treated mice relative to controls. Conclusion: These results suggest significant potential for the clinical translation of 225Ac-DOTA-MC1RL as a novel therapy for metastatic uveal melanoma.

4303,"Treatment results and prognostic factors for advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Objective: To review our experience with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) for patients with advanced resectable squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the larynx and to evaluate the factors affecting survival and larynx preservation. Study design: Retrospective study. Subjects and methods: The records of 102 patients with stage III or IV resectable SCC of the larynx treated with CCRT between February 1994 and March 2009 were reviewed. Of 102 patients, 59 were treated with high-dose regimens, including cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), methotrexate, and leucovorin or docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-FU, and 43 were treated with low-dose regimens, including carboplatin and uracil-tegafur or S-1. Radiotherapy was delivered 5 days a week using a single daily fraction of 1.8-2.0 Gray (Gy), to a total dose of 66.0-70.2 Gy. Overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and DSS with larynx preservation were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods. The log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to identify significant prognostic factors for DSS and DSS with larynx preservation. Result(s): The 5-year OS and DSS for all patients treated with CCRT were 63.9 and 70.7 %, respectively. The 5-year DSS with larynx preservation was 54.1 %. On multivariate analysis, N stage, synchronous multiple primary cancers, and the contents of chemotherapy were significant predictors of OS for patients undergoing CCRT; T stage, N stage, and the contents of chemotherapy were significant prognostic factors for larynx preservation. Conclusion(s): The treatment method including the indication for CCRT may be determined by the contents of the chemotherapy and the T and N stages of laryngeal SCC. It is important to diagnose multiple synchronous primary cancers before CCRT. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
4304,"Acute toxicity in pelvic radiotherapy; a randomised trial of conformal versus conventional treatment. BACKGROUND: A prospective, randomized clinical trial to assess the effect of reducing the volume of irradiated normal tissue on acute reactions in pelvic radiotherapy accured 266 evaluable patients between 1988 and 1993., PURPOSE: This is the definitive analysis to assess the differences between the conformal and conventional arms of the trial., MATERIALS AND METHODS: In both arms, patients were treated with 6 MV X-rays using a 3-field technique (in all but 5 cases) consisting of an anterior and two wedged lateral or posterior oblique fields; in the conventional arm, rectangular fields were employed, whereas in the conformal arm, the fields were shaped with customized blocks drawn according to the beam's-eye-view of the target volume. The most common dosage was 64 Gy in 2-Gy fractions 5 times a week, although a subgroup (of ca. bladder patients) were treated with 30-36 Gy in once-a-week 6 Gy fractions. Each patients completed a comprehensive acute toxicity scoring questionnaire concentrating on bowel and bladder problems, tiredness and nausea, before the start of treatment, weekly during and for 3 weeks after the end of treatment and then monthly for a further 2 months. compliance was excellent., RESULTS: There were no differences between the patients in the two arms with respect to age, gender, tumour type (52% prostate, 41% bladder, 5% rectum, 2% other) fractionation/dosage, anterior field size, weight, or baseline symptoms. Substantial differences in normal-tissue volumes (rectum, bladder, etc.) were achieved: median high-dose volume (HDV) of 689 cm3 for the conformal technique versus 792 cm3 for the conventional. A clear pattern of an increase in symptoms during RT, followed by a decrease after RT, was observed for the patient group as a whole. However, a very extensive analysis has not revealed any (statistically) significant differences between the two arms in level of symptoms, nor in medication prescribed. The disparity between our findings and those of other, non-randomized studies is discussed., CONCLUSIONS: The data on late effects must be collected and analyzed before any definite conclusions can be drawn on the benefits of conformal therapy in the pelvis.",Excluded

Purpose: Navigation is emerging as a useful adjunct in percutaneous, minimally invasive spinal surgery (MIS). The aim of this study was to compare C-Arm navigated, O-Arm navigated and conventional 2D-fluoroscopy assisted MIS thoracic and lumbosacral spine fixation techniques in terms of operating time, radiation exposure and accuracy of pedicle screw (PS) placement. Method(s): Retrospective observational study of 152 consecutive adults who underwent MIS fixations for spinal instability: 96 2D-fluoroscopy assisted, 39 3D-C-Arm navigated and 27 using O-Arm navigated. Result(s): O-Arm navigation significantly reduced PS misplacement (1.23%, p) compared to 3D-C-Arm navigation (7.29%, p = 0.0082) and 2D-fluoro guided placement (5.16%, p = 0379). 3D-C-Arm navigation was associated with lower procedural radiation exposure of the patient (0.4 mSv) than O-Arm navigation (3.24 mSv) or 2D-fluoro guidance (1.5 mSv). Operative time was comparable between three modalities. Conclusion(s): O-Arm navigation provides greater accuracy of percutaneous instrumentation placement with an acceptable procedural radiation dose delivered to the patients and comparable operative times.

4307,"The effects of radiofrequency hyperthermia on pain and function in patients with knee osteoarthritis: a preliminary report. BACKGROUND: The clinical evidence of the efficacy of hyperthermia on osteoarthritis (OA) has not yet been clearly established. In addition, the application of a modality that can control the temperature inside the joints has not been reported. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of percutaneous radiofrequency hyperthermia, which could safely raise the temperature of the body core, in patients with OA knees., METHODS: Temperature changes inside the knee joint without OA were measured during exposure to radiofrequency. Radiofrequency hyperthermia was performed on 12 OA knees by exposure to 8 MHz and 200 W for 20 min, 3 times, at 1-week intervals. The clinical outcome was evaluated by use of the Lequesne index (LI) and the Japan Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scale. The osteoarthritis research society international (OARSI) responder criteria were also analyzed., RESULTS: Radiofrequency hyperthermia of 8 MHz and 200 W for 20 min increased the temperature inside the joint from 34.4 to 39.4degreeC. The LI decreased by 3.55 points from baseline during the 3 weeks. The JOA scale improved significantly during the period, reaching 86.25 points at the final examination from baseline of 67.5 points. 67% of patients had a response to the therapy according to OARSI criteria. No side effects were observed., CONCLUSIONS: Radiofrequency hyperthermia can safely increase the temperature inside the knee joint. Radiofrequency hyperthermia on OA knees provides a remarkable pain relief effect and can improve the patients' daily life. In the future, clinical studies should be performed with a protocol containing more cases, with appropriate control groups.",Excluded
4308,"Regional correlation between estimated UVB levels and skin cancer mortality in Japan. Most ecological studies investigating the relationship between incidence and/or mortality of skin cancer and surrogate measures of ultraviolet radiation B (UVB) have been conducted among the Caucasian population. The objective of the present study was therefore to assess the geographical correlation between ambient UVB estimates and regional mortality rates for skin cancer in Japan. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for malignant melanoma and other malignant neoplasms of the skin was calculated by sex, region and time-period for all deaths occurring in the period 1973-1994. The Spearman's correlation coefficient was calculated between estimated ambient UVB and regional SMRs for the two types of skin cancer. There was no geographical correlation between UVB and skin cancer mortality, except for a significantly negative correlation in malignant melanoma among males and a significantly negative correlation in other malignant neoplasms of the skin confined to unexposed anatomic sites of the body among females. The characteristic ecological relationship adds to the importance of conducting further epidemiological studies at the individual level in Japan.",Excluded
4309,"Octreotide acetate enables the administration of chemoradiotherapy, including the oral anticancer drug S-1, in gastric cancer patients with malignant gastrointestinal obstruction. Advanced gastric cancer frequently RESULTS in the inability to ingest food or drink orally, a condition called malignant gastrointestinal obstruction (MGO). MGO is clinically defned as a gastrointestinal outlet obstruction caused by a large tumor, or malignant bowel obstruction with peritoneal dissemination. MGO impacts the quality of life by interfering with oral intake and by causing gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Octreotide acetate (OA) is an analogue of somatostatin which has been increasingly used to relieve gastrointestinal symptoms since it decreases the secretion of digestive juices and increases the absorption of water and electrolytes. In Japan, the oral anticancer drug S-1 was recently adopted as a key chemotherapeutic agent in advanced gastric cancer; however, its oral formulation precludes its utility in the MGO setting. This is a pilot study of chemoradiotherapy plus OA in gastric cancer with MGO. Patients were initially treated with OA to control gastrointestinal symptoms. Following resolution of their symptoms, the patients received chemotherapy with S-1 plus low-dose cisplatin and radiation. Irradiation was targeted at the primary tumor and surrounding lesions, including the lymph nodes. Grade 4 toxicity was observed in only 1 patient, and no treatment-related deaths were noted. After treatment, 3 patients achieved a partial response and 4 achieved stable disease. Of the 9 patients, 8 were able to tolerate solid food orally and were discharged. The outcomes of these cases suggest that OA is a useful adjunctive therapy that enables advanced gastric cancer patients with MGO to receive S-1-containing chemotherapy.",Excluded
4310,"A prospective nonrandomized phase I/II study of carbon ion radiotherapy in a favorable subset of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). BACKGROUND: Although concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) has become the standard approach for unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC), most patients are not candidates for this treatment because of comorbidities. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) in LA-NSCLC patients., METHODS: Patients with stage IIA to IIIA (UICC 7th edition) LA-NSCLC were enrolled in a sequential phase I/II trial. For a phase I dose escalation study, the total prescribed dose was increased by 4 Gray equivalents (GyE) in 2 steps, from 68 to 72 GyE and then to 76 GyE, using 16 fractions over 4 weeks. After determining the recommended dose, the phase II trial was started in an expanded cohort., RESULTS: Of the 36 patients treated in phase I, 2 grade 3 adverse events (radiation pneumonitis and tracheoesophageal fistula) were observed in the 76 GyE group. Accordingly, for phase II, the next consecutive 26 patients were treated with 72 GyE, with no grade 3 to 5 toxicities resulting. A total of 62 eligible patients were recruited. The majority of patients (49 of 62) were N0 or N1 patients, and the rest (13 of 62) were single-station N2 patients. The median follow-up period was 25.2 months. The 2-year local control rate (LCR) and overall survival (OS) for the entire cohort were 93.1% and 51.9%, respectively. In particular, patients with cT3-4N0 had an excellent prognosis; the 2-year OS and LCR were 69.3% and 100%, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Short-course CIRT monotherapy shows promise as an effective nonsurgical treatment for inoperable LA-NSCLC.

4311,"Boron neutron capture therapy using cyclotron-based epithermal neutron source and borofalan (10B) for recurrent or locally advanced head and neck cancer (JHN002): An open-label phase II trial. Background and purpose: Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) can be performed without reactors due to development of cyclotron-based epithermal neutron source (C-BENS), which is optimized for treatment for deeper-seated tumors. The purpose of this study was to evaluate efficacy and safety of cyclotron-based BNCT with borofalan (10B) for recurrent or locally advanced head and neck cancer. Material(s) and Method(s): In this open-label, phase II JHN002 trial of BNCT using C-BENS with borofalan (10B), patients with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma (R-SCC) or with recurrent/locally advanced non-squamous cell carcinoma (R/LA-nSCC) of the head and neck were intravenously administered 400 mg/kg borofalan (10B), followed by neutron irradiation. The tumor dose was determined passively as the mucosal maximum dose of 12 Gy-Eq. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR). Post-trial observational JHN002 Look Up study was planned for evaluating locoregional progression-free survival (LRPFS). Result(s): Eight R-SCC and 13 R/LA-nSCC patients were enrolled. All R-SCC patients had prior radiotherapy with a median dose of 65.5 Gy (range, 59.4-76.0 Gy). The ORR for all patients was 71%, and complete response/partial response were 50%/25% in R-SCC and 8%/62% in R/LA-nSCC. The 2-year overall survival for R-SCC and R/LA-nSCC were 58% and 100%, respectively. The median LRPFS was 11.5 months for R-SCC. Frequently observed adverse events included alopecia (95%), hyperamylasemia (86%), and nausea (81%).

4313,"Mortality Analysis of the Life Span Study (LSS) Cohort Taking into Account Multiple Causes of Death Indicated in Death Certificates. Mortality analyses have been performed using underlying causes of death as reported on death certificates; these are uniquely determined for a deceased person according to the World Health Organization coding system. Comorbidities, the disease conditions other than the underlying cause of death from death certificates recording multiple causes of death, have rarely been explored in Life Span Study subjects. The purpose of this study was to clarify associations between atomic bomb radiation exposure and mortality from combinations of the underlying cause of death and comorbidities. The focused follow-up period was 1977-2003, prior to which death certificate accuracy was unreliable. The study cohort was comprised of 10,017 people for whom the category ""all circulatory disease"" was listed as the underlying cause of death, of which heart disease (rheumatic, hypertensive and ischemic heart disease) and stroke were major subtypes. Comorbidities considered were pneumonia, renal disease, diabetes mellitus, cancer and the major circulatory disease subtypes listed above. Poisson regression models were used for analyses. Excess relative risks (ERRs) for mortality at 1 Gy were significantly increased when cancer was comorbid with all circulatory disease, heart disease, ischemic heart disease or stroke, ranging from 0.61 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.13, 1.41; N = 177 for all circulatory diseases to 1.60 (CI: 0.07, 4.86; N = 42) for ischemic heart disease. Among the other comorbidities, only diabetes comorbid with heart disease had a significant radiation dose response (ERR at 1 Gy of 0.62, CI: 0.10, 1.46; N = 128). It remains uncertain if the high ERRs with comorbid cancers were anomalous due to the small number of cases or some dissimilarity in statistical methodologies, or if this might suggest some pathogenetic basis for increased fatality. For this reason, further investigation is required.Copyright © 2017 by Radiation Research Society.",Excluded

4315,"Proton beam therapy combined with selective intra-arterial infusion chemotherapy for locally advanced tongue cancer. Background: The standard treatment for locally advanced tongue cancer is surgery. However, the patient's quality of life is lost. As a newly non-operative treatment, we report the efficacy and toxicity of proton beam therapy combined with selective intra-arterial infusion chemotherapy (PBT-IACT) for locally advanced tongue cancer. Method(s): Between February 2009 and August 2012, 45 cases of stage III-IV(M0) squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue (28 men and 17 women) were treated by PBT-IACT at Southern TOHOKU Proton Therapy Center. Median age was 58 years (range:24-83 years), and clinical stage III/IVA/IVB were 11/32/2 respectively. In case of surgery, the patients required subtotal or total resection of the tongue. Initially, 2 courses of systemic chemotherapy and prophyractic whole neck irradiation (36Gy/20fr.) were performed. Subsequently, for gross tumor targets, PBT (33Gy/15fr.) and IACT were administered via the superficial temporal artery by continuous infusion of cisplatin with sodium thiosulphate. For PBT, 1 or 2 portals of 210 MeV proton beam were arranged in optimal angles to avoid overdosing the risk organ. Systemic chemotherapy was performed only for age of 70 years or younger. Result(s): The median follow-up was 27 months (range:8-48 months). Over all survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and local control (LC) rates at 2 years were 88%,78%, 80%, respectively. LC of cervical lymph node metastases at 2 years was 86%. As the early toxic event, grade 3 mucositis (32/45) and blood/bone marrow toxicity (22/45) were observed. Within 6 months after this therapy, mandibular osteomyelitis occurred in 1 case. Conclusion(s): PBT-IACT appeared to be safe and has a good LC rate for locally advanced tongue cancer.

Background and Aims: Stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) is a relatively new treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The outcomes of SABR for previously untreated solitary HCC unfit for ablation and surgical resection were evaluated. Method(s): Untreated solitary HCC patients treated with SABR were retrospectively studied. Between 2005 and 2012, 221 HCC patients underwent SABR. Among them, patients with untreated solitary HCC, treated with only SABR or SABR preceded by transarterial chemoembolization, were eligible. Based on baseline liver function and liver volume receiving >=20Gy, 35-40Gy in five fractions was prescribed to the planning target volume surface. Result(s): Sixty-three patients were eligible, with a median follow-up duration of 31.1 (range 12.0-88.1) months. No patients were lost to follow-up. Twenty patients were treated with only SABR. In 43 patients treated with SABR preceded by transarterial chemoembolization, accumulation of lipiodol in the tumor remained complete in five, a partial defect in 38 on pre-SABR computed tomography. The 1-, 2-, and 3-year local control rates were 100%, 95%, and 92%, respectively; the intrahepatic recurrence-free rates were 76%, 55%, and 36%, respectively; and the overall survival rates were 100%, 87%, and 73%, respectively. Grade 3 laboratory toxicities in the acute, subacute, and chronic phases were observed in 10, 9, and 13 patients, respectively, and ascites occurred in one patient.

4322,"Trends in the incidence of sudden deaths and heart diseases in fukushima after the great east Japan earthquake. On March 11, 2011, a great earthquake, known as the Great East Japan Earthquake, hit northeastern Japan, resulting in a tsunami that caused a nuclear disaster, the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident, forcing about 160,000 people to evacuate. We, therefore, sought to examine the effects of this evacuation on the onset of cardiovascular diseases and sudden death (SD) in Fukushima Prefecture, three years after the earthquake. We divided the evacuation zone into two areas, whole evacuation zone (Area 1) and partial evacuation zone (Area 2), and we defined the north district of the prefecture as the control area (Area 3). We cross-referenced the death certificate data with data from the Fukushima Prefecture acute myocardial infarction registration survey. For each area, we tallied the number of people who fell into the SD, myocardial infarction (MI), and MI suspected groups. We calculated the age-adjusted incidence rates and analyzed the differences in the adjusted incidence rates across three years using a Poisson regression model. The age-adjusted death rate of the SD group was significantly higher in 2011 in all areas than in 2012 or 2013 (P < 0.05). The total death rate was higher in Area 1 in March 2011, just after the disaster, than in the other two areas. The rate of SD was also higher in Area 1 than in the other areas in March 2011. The incidence of sudden cardiac death might have increased just after the Great East Japan Earthquake in the evacuation area, but not in other areas in Fukushima Prefecture.Copyright © 2019, International Heart Journal Association.

4323,"Recurrent Atypical Meningiomas: Combining Surgery and Radiosurgery in One Effective Multimodal Treatment. Objective Owing to their rarity and proteiform pathologic features, the clinical behavior of atypical meningiomas is not yet well characterized. Though the extent of resection is believed to be a key determinant of prognosis, limited data exist regarding optimal management of patients with recurrent disease. Methods In this 20-year retrospective case series, we reviewed the medical records of 46 patients with recurrent atypical meningomas (185 lesions, 89 of which were local, 78 marginal, and 18 distant recurrences); treatment was radiosurgery (n = 60), surgery (n = 56), or both (n = 8). The median follow-up period was 53 months. Outcome measures were length of overall survival and disease-free intervals and prognostic factors for survival. Results Overall, the median progression-free survival was 26 months at the first recurrence and 100 months thereafter (the sum of the later intervals). Multivariate analysis showed that no treatment-related factors influenced prognosis, whereas recurrence at the skull base was a significant tumor-related factor limiting further treatment. Irrespective of treatment type, the recurrence-free interval was increasingly shorter during the clinical course, with a higher occurrence of marginal and distant lesions migrating to the midline and to the skull base. In sporadic cases, disease-free intervals were longer after wide craniotomy, tumor and dural resection with tumor-free margin. Conclusions The disease-free interval was substantially similar after surgery and radiosurgery for treating recurrent disease in patients with atypical meningiomas. Surgery is the mainstay for prolonging survival, while radiosurgery can be an adjuvant strategy to gain time for clinical observation and planning aggressive surgical treatment.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

CT was performed for restaging of suspected recurrence based on clinical findings and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). PET findings were correlated with CEA levels and biopsy findings. PET was considered positive if there was abnormal presacral soft-tissue uptake greater than surrounding activity. Result(s): Of the 68 patients, 42 were PET-positive and 26 were negative. Of the 42 PET-positive patients, 27 had biopsy-proven recurrent cancer, CEA was elevated in 26 patients and normal in one patient. CEA was normal in 12 of 15 patients with positive PET and negative biopsy. Among the 26 PET-negative patient, CEA was normal in 14, without disease elsewhere. CEA was elevated in 12 patients with negative PET (three had inflammation on biopsy, one mucinous adenocarcinoma, and eight had malignancy at extrapelvic sites. Conclusion(s): FDG PET/CT and CEA are complementary in follow-up of presacral soft tissue in rectal cancer restaging. Abnormal presacral FDG uptake with elevated CEA indicates presacral recurrence, whereas positive PET with normal CEA does not usually indicate recurrence. Negative PET with normal CEA can be considered benign avoiding the need for biopsy.",Excluded
4325,"Diagnostic value of iterative reconstruction algorithm in low kV CT angiography (CTA) with low contrast medium volume for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) planning: image quality and radiation dose exposure. OBJECTIVE: : To evaluate image quality and radiation dose exposure of low-kV (100 kV) and low contrast medium (CM) volume CT angiography (CTA) in patients candidate to Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI), in comparison with standard CTA protocol., METHODS: : 79 patients candidate for TAVI were prospectively enrolled in this study and examined with 256-MDCT. 42 patients were evaluated using study-group protocol (100 kV; whole-body retrospective ECG-gating; with 50 ml of CM; iterative reconstruction algorithm) while 37 patients underwent a standard CTA study (120 kV; ECG-gating for chest; 100 ml of CM; FBP reconstruction). Overall image quality was evaluated using a 4-point scale. Vascular enhancement (HU) was then assessed in each patient by manually drawing multiple ROIs in lumen of 7 segments of the whole aorta. The radiation dose exposure of both groups was calculated and all data were compared and statistically analyzed., RESULTS:: On low-kV protocol, higher mean attenuation values were achieved in all the measurements as compared to standard protocol. There were no significant differences in the image quality evaluation in both groups. Mean radiation dose value of study group was significantly lower than in control group (reduction of 20%)., CONCLUSION: : Low kV and low CM volume CTA protocols allow TAVI planning to be carried out with high quality images and a significant reduction in the radiation dose as compared to the standard CTA protocol., ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: : Low-kV CTA for pre-operative assessment of patients candidates for TAVI, permits to achieve a significant reduction of radiation dose exposure and contrast medium volume, reducing the risk of contrast induced nephropathy.",Excluded
4326,"Interaural intensity difference and ear advantage in listening to dichotic consonant-vowel syllable pairs. The right-ear advantage (REA) is typically observed in verbal dichotic listening, indicating a left hemisphere superiority for speech processing. The REA could be thought of as a bottom-up, stimulus-driven laterality effect, caused by the preponderance of the contralateral neural fibers from the right ear to the auditory/speech processing areas in the left temporal lobe. The REA can, however, be modified by explicitly requiring the listeners to focus their attention alternatively on the left or right-ear stimuli, thus either countering or enhancing the bottom-up processes through top-down attentional control. In the present study, we manipulated the strength of the bottom-up REA by inducing an intensity difference between the right-ear and left-ear speech inputs in order to make the REA either weaker (left-ear input>right-ear input) or stronger (left-ear input<right-ear input) and also examined how this manipulation affected the top-down attention modulation effects. Twenty healthy participants listened to dichotic presentations of consonant-vowel syllable pairs with different attention instructions. The results showed that the interaural intensity difference significantly affected the ear advantage in the predicted way. It also interacted with the top-down control effects, attentional control having a stronger effect when attending to the ear that had a weaker sound intensity, as compared to when the intensities were equal.",Excluded
4327,"Sparing bilateral neck level IB in oropharyngeal carcinoma and xerostomia outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To assess whether sparing neck-level IB in target delineation of node-positive (N+) oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPC) can improve xerostomia outcomes without compromising locoregional control (LRC)., METHODS: A total of 125 N+ OPC patients with a median age of 57 years underwent chemoradiation between May 2010 and December 2011. A total of 74% of patients had T1-T2 disease, 26% T3-T4, 16% N1, 8% N2A, 48% N2B, 28% N2C; 53% base of tongue, 41% tonsil, and 6% other. Patients were divided into those who had target delineation sparing of bilateral level IB (the spared cohort) versus no sparing (the treated cohort). Sparing of contralateral high-level II nodes was also performed more consistently in the spared cohort. A prospective xerostomia questionnaire (patient reported) was given at each patient follow-up visit to this cohort of patients to assess late xerostomia. Clinical assessment (observer rated) at each patient follow-up visit was also recorded., RESULTS: The 2-year LRC for the spared and treated cohorts was 97.5% and 93.8%, respectively (median follow-up, 23.2 mo). No locoregional failures occurred outside of treatment fields. The spared cohort experienced significant benefits in patient-reported xerostomia summary scores (P=0.021) and observer-rated xerostomia scores (P=0.006). In addition, there were significant reductions in mean doses to the ipsilateral submandibular gland (63.9 vs. 70.5 Gy; P<0.001), contralateral submandibular gland (45.0 vs. 56.2 Gy; P<0.001), oral cavity (35.9 vs. 45.2 Gy; P<0.001), and contralateral parotid gland (20.0 vs. 24.4 Gy; P<0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: Target delineation sparing of bilateral level IB nodes in N+ OPC reduced mean doses to salivary organs without compromising LRC. Patients with reduced target volumes had better patient-reported xerostomia outcomes.",Excluded
4328,"Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil improves survival of patients with advanced esophageal cancer compared with conventional concurrent chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil. Purpose: To compare treatment outcomes and adverse events between concurrent chemoradiotherapy with docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil (DCF-RT) and conventional concurrent chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (CF-RT). Methods and Materials: We retrospectively investigated treatment outcomes and adverse events in 121 patients with advanced esophageal cancer who underwent concurrent chemoradiotherapy with CF-RT (n = 83) or DCF-RT (n = 38). In the CF-RT group, patients were administered cisplatin (70 mg/m2) and 5-fluorouracil (700 mg/m2) for 5 days; in the DCF-RT group, patients were administered docetaxel (50 mg/m2), cisplatin (50 mg/m2), and 5-fluorouracil (500 mg/m2) for 5 days. The radiotherapy dose was 1.8-2 Gy per session, up to a total of 50-60 Gy. Result(s): The complete response (CR) rate was 37.8% in the CF-RT group and 52.6% in the DCF-RT group. Overall survival (OS) rates at 2 and 3 years were 45.0% and 37.5%, respectively, in the CF-RT group and 62.9% and 56.7%, respectively, in the DCF-RT group, with a significant intergroup difference (p = 0.032). Progression-free survival rates at 2 and 3 years were 44.1% and 36.9%, respectively, in the CF-RT group and 45.0% and 45.0%, respectively, in the DCF-RT group (p = 0.10). Local control rates at 2 and 3 years were 59.1% and 54.6%, respectively, in the CF-RT group and 71.8% and 71.8%, respectively, in the DCF-RT group (p = 0.12). The incidence of Grade 3/4 leukopenia was 55.4% (n = 46) in the CF-RT group and 78.9% (n = 30) in the DCF-RT group, with a significant intergroup difference (p = 0.022). The incidence of Grade 3/4 neutropenia was 47.0% (n = 39) in the CF-RT group and 65.8% (n = 25) in the DCF-RT group, with a notable albeit not statistically significant difference between the groups (p = 0.054). There were no significant intergroup differences in anemia, thrombocytopenia, radiation-induced dermatitis, radiation esophagitis, or late adverse events. Conclusion(s): Rates of OS and CR were improved after treatment with DCF-RT compared with CF-RT. Although DCF-RT-treated patients had higher rates of leukopenia, treatment safety was ensured through proper management of myelotoxicity. DCF-RT is a promising treatment regimen for advanced esophageal cancer.Copyright © Ivyspring International Publisher.",Excluded
4329,"Glutamatergic input is coded by spike frequency at the soma and proximal dendrite of AII amacrine cells in the mouse retina. In the mammalian retina, AII amacrine cells play a crucial role in scotopic vision. They transfer rod signals from rod bipolar cells to the cone circuit, and divide these signals into the ON and OFF pathways at the discrete synaptic layers. AII amacrine cells have been reported to generate tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive repetitive spikes of small amplitude. To investigate the properties of the spikes, we performed whole-cell patch-clamping of AII amacrine cells in mouse retinal slices. The spike frequency increased in proportion to the concentration of glutamate puffer-applied to the arboreal dendrite and to the intensity of the depolarizing current injection. The spike activity was suppressed by L-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid, a glutamate analogue that hyperpolarizes rod bipolar cells, puffer-applied to the outer plexiform layer. Therefore, it is most likely that the spike frequency generated by AII amacrine cells is dependent on the excitatory glutamatergic input from rod bipolar cells. Gap junction blockers reduced the range of intensity of input with which spike frequency varies. Application of TTX to the soma and the proximal dendrite of AII amacrine cells blocked the voltage-gated Na(+) current significantly more than application to the arboreal dendrite, indicating that the Na(+) channels are mainly localized in these regions. Our results suggest that the intensity of the glutamatergic input from rod bipolar cells is coded by the spike frequency at the soma and the proximal dendrite of AII amacrine cells, raising the possibility that the spikes could contribute to the OFF pathway to enhance release of neurotransmitter.",Excluded
4330,"The role of FDG-PET/CT in detection of gastric cancer recurrence. AIM: The purpose of this study was to retrospectively determine the efficacy and usefulness of 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) in detecting and re-staging recurrent gastric cancer patients with clinical or radiological suspicion of recurrence. METHOD(S): This retrospective study has been conducted on 41 patients who were treated gastrectomy and postoperatively radiotherapy or/and chemotherapy. Histopathologic diagnosis revealed 2 signet ring cell carcinoma, and 39 adenocancer. All of the patients referred to our department for restaging due to clinical findings, tumor markers and/or radiologic suspicion of recurrence during follow-up.27 out of 41 were male and 14 female. The mean age was 58+/-10 years (range 30-75 years). FDG-PET/CT was applied twice to all patients. The first FDG- PET/CT was for staging and restaging. The second was for restaging due to clinical findings, tumor markers and/or radiologic suspicion of recurrence during follow-up. The standard of reference for tumor recurrence consisted of histopathologic confirmation or clinical follow-up information for at least 6 month after FDG-PET/CT examinations. RESULT(S): Cause of the first FDG-PET/CT application was due to staging in 24 patients and restaging in 17. FDG-PET/CT was negative in 14 patients and positive in 27. Out of 27, 7 patients had recurrence in gastric area, 7 patients had both recurrence and metastases and, 13 patients had metastases Histological verification was done in 11 patients who were re-operated after the first FDG-PET/CT. The second FDG-PET/CT application to 27 patients was for the assessment of the response to the treatment applied. 4 patients had full metabolic recovery, 11 had progression and 12 had regression. For 17 patients whose first FDG-PET/CT results were negative, the second FDG-PET/CT application was due to restaging for the suspicion of metastases in other radiologic modalities in 6 and high tumor marker levels in 8 patients. The results for the 17 patients were metastases in 5 and negative in 9 patients CONCLUSION(S): FDG-PET/CT is helpful in confirming the presence of recurrence particularly in patients who were highly suspicious of recurrence, because of its high positive predictability.",Excluded
4331,"Critical analysis of lumbar interspinous devices failures: A retrospective study. Interspinous devices (IDs) were introduced in the 90s. Since then, they have rapidly become very popular for the minimally invasive treatment of lumbar pain disorders. They feature different shapes and biomechanical characteristics, and are used in the spine degenerative pathologies or as motion segment stabilizers (dynamic stabilization) or to obtain the decompression of neurological structures. The indications seem to be rather narrow and still to be verified in terms of their clinical efficacy. However, IDs are being extensively utilized beyond their classical indications with the inevitable risk of a clinical failure. The aim of the present work was to carry out a critical analysis of the causes of failure in a series of 19 patients. From January 2007 to March 2009, 19 patients with residual painful syndrome after the implantation of IDs were observed. The series includes 11 males and 8 females with a mean age of 53.6 years (range 38-84 years) who were operated on elsewhere and who underwent revision surgery at our hospital. The inclusion criteria were low back pain and/or radiculopathy after the device implantation without improvement of the painful symptomatology, radiculopathy with signs of sensory and motor deficit, intermittent neurogenic claudication, and infection. All patients were thoroughly re-assessed with new standard imaging examinations such as MRI and CT scans, considering the following image features: the position of the device with respect to the spinous processes (X-ray), the intervertebral disc disease of the level operated upon or of the adjacent levels (MRI), the segmental instability (dynamic X-rays), the severity of the canal stenosis (CT). The accurate evaluation of the clinical and imaging parameters revealed three main causes of failure: errors of indication, technical errors and the structural failure of the ID. The most frequent cause of failure was a wrong indication. The results of the study are presented and the causes of failure are discussed in detail. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Excluded
4332,"Early Experience and Lessons Learnt with Customized Fenestrated Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Reconstruction for Aortic Arch Pathology in an Asian Population. Purpose: Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is the preferred treatment of descending thoracic aorta pathology. However, TEVAR in the aortic arch remains challenging. Customized fenestrated TEVAR (fTEVAR) allows extension of the proximal seal zone, while preserving the involved supra-aortic vessels. There is a paucity of information on fTEVAR; hence, we aim to evaluate our early experience and lessons learnt with fTEVAR in the aortic arch. Method(s): This is a retrospective single-centre review of fTEVAR endografts for aortic arch pathology over 24 months. Seven patients with mean age of 72.8 years (range 63-84 years) were included. A total of 15 supra-aortic branches were treated [left subclavian artery (n = 7), left carotid artery (n = 5), innominate artery (n = 1), bovine origins (n = 2)], involving a total of nine fenestrations and six scallops. No supra-aortic debranching was required. Result(s): Median follow-up was 15 months. Technical success was 86%, and one patient had malalignment of the fTEVAR endograft requiring salvage with double chimney technique. There were no early endoleaks with one type 2 endoleak detected in the follow-up period. Two access site pseudoaneurysms required intervention. There was a learning curve involved reflected by higher than average mean operative time of 224 min with average radiation dose of 3029.86 mGy and mean contrast volume of 283 mls. Conclusion(s): fTEVAR in the aortic arch is feasible in Asian patients, although there was a learning curve involved, and careful patient selection is advised. Longer term data in a larger population are required to assess its durability.Copyright © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature and the Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe (CIRSE).",Excluded
4333,"The efficacy of tin-filtration for computed tomography in diagnosing urolithiasis. INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the radiation dose and image quality of computed tomography urograms (CTU) using tin-filtration compared to conventional CTU (without tin-filtration) examinations in patients with suspected urolithiasis., METHODS: Group 1 consisted of 100 patients who were examined using the tin-filtered CTU protocols (Sn100kVp or Sn150kVp); Group 2 consisted of 100 patients who were examined using the same protocols but without tin-filtration (GE-NI41 or GE-NI43). The scanning protocol was based on the patients' body weight (<80kg and >=80kg). The effective doses of all scans were compared between the two groups. Subjective image quality was evaluated by two blinded radiologists. The objective image quality was assessed for noise, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and figure-of-merit (FOM) using the CTU scans acquired from both the tin-filtered and non-tin-filtered protocols., RESULTS: Tin-filtration resulted in the reduction of effective radiation dose ranging between 72% to 88% for the >=80kg and <80kg patient groups respectively. For both groups, tin-filtration resulted in no significant differences in SNR and a significant increase in FOM. For the <80kg group, tin-filtration resulted in significantly noisier images but with no significant difference in CNR. For the >=80kg group, tin-filtration resulted in significantly higher CNR. There was no significant difference in subjective image quality when assessed by the radiologists in terms of diagnostic confidence for urolithiasis., CONCLUSION: Tin-filtration significantly reduces patient dose while maintaining diagnostic image quality of CTUs for patients with suspected urolithiasis.

4334,"Efficacy of model-based iterative reconstruction technique in non-enhanced CT of the renal tracts for ureteric calculi. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR), statistical iterative reconstruction (SIR), and filtered back projection (FBP) image reconstruction algorithms in the delineation of ureters and overall image quality on non-enhanced computed tomography of the renal tracts (NECT-KUB). This was a prospective study of 40 adult patients who underwent NECT-KUB for investigation of ureteric colic. Images were reconstructed using FBP, SIR, and MBIR techniques and individually and randomly assessed by two blinded radiologists. Parameters measured were overall image quality, presence of ureteric calculus, presence of hydronephrosis or hydroureters, image quality of each ureteric segment, total length of ureters unable to be visualized, attenuation values of image noise, and retroperitoneal fat content for each patient. There were no diagnostic discrepancies between image reconstruction modalities for urolithiasis. Overall image qualities and for each ureteric segment were superior using MBIR (67.5 % rated as 'Good to Excellent' vs. 25 % in SIR and 2.5 % in FBP). The lengths of non-visualized ureteric segments were shortest using MBIR (55.0 % measured 'less than 5 cm' vs. ASIR 33.8 % and FBP 10 %). MBIR was able to reduce overall image noise by up to 49.36 % over SIR and 71.02 % over FBP.

BACKGROUND: A new multisource phase-controlled radiofrequency (MPCRF) device is widely used for skin tightening and rejuvenation in Asia., OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of MPCRF objectively and histologically., METHODS: An MPCRF device with real-time impedance control was evaluated. Ten Japanese patients were treated one side of the face, and the untreated side served as a control. Three-dimensional (3-D) imaging was performed to evaluate the posttreatment volume change. An independent observer assessed the 3-D images. Histologic evaluations of elastin were performed by Victoria Blue staining in 5 Japanese patients., RESULTS: Objective assessments evaluated by a 3-D color schematic representation showed improvement in skin laxity after the final treatment in all patients. The treated side improved markedly compared with the untreated side; however, even the untreated side slightly improved. The elastin density was significantly increased compared with controls in all 5 Japanese patients (p = .0013). Induced elastin appeared to be relatively thin elastic fibers without irregular elastic fibers, such as solar elastosis. Side effects were not observed, and the patients reported feeling comfortable throughout the study., CONCLUSION: Multisource phase-controlled radiofrequency treatments provide stimulation of elastin and skin-tightening results safely and effectively, and thus are beneficial for improving skin laxity and rhytides.",Excluded
4336,"Intratreatment Response Assessment With 18F-FDG PET: Correlation of Semiquantitative PET Features With Pathologic Response of Esophageal Cancer to Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy. Purpose: This prospective study seeks to extract semiquantitative positron emission tomography (PET) features from 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET scans performed before and during neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for esophageal cancer and to compare their accuracy in predicting histopathologic response. Methods and Materials: From 2012 to 2016, 26 patients with esophageal cancer underwent pretreatment and intratreatment PET scans during chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery. Median patient age was 63 years (interquartile range, 58-68 years); 26 patients had esophageal adenocarcinoma, and 3 had esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The intratreatment PET scan was performed at a median of 32.4 Gy (interquartile range, 30.6-32.4 Gy). PET features of the primary site including maximum standardized uptake value (SUV), SUV mean, metabolic tumor volume, and total lesion glycolysis were extracted from the pretreatment and intratreatment PET scans. Patients were histopathologic responders if there was complete or near-complete tumor response by modified Ryan scheme. Mean values of PET features were compared between histopathologic responders and nonresponders. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to compare the accuracy of PET features in predicting histopathologic response. Result(s): Eleven patients (42%) were histopathologic responders. PET features most discriminatory of histopathologic response on AUC analysis were volumetric PET features from the intratreatment PET including metabolic tumor volume based on manual contour (AUC, 0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.52-0.93) and total lesion glycolysis based on semiautomatic 40% SUV threshold (AUC, 0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.53-0.94). Conclusion(s): Volumetric PET features from the intratreatment PET were the most accurate predictors of histopathologic response.Copyright © 2018",Excluded
4337,"Acute phase response before treatment predicts radiation esophagitis in non-small cell lung cancer. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Radiation esophagitis (RE) represents an inflammatory reaction to radiation therapy (RT). We hypothesized that aspects of the physiologic acute phase response (APR) predicts RE., MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 285 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with definitive radiation. The primary analysis was the association of pretreatment lab values reflective of the APR with symptomatic (grade 2) RE. Univariate and multivariate odds ratios (ORs) were calculated to test associations of clinical and pretreatment lab values with RE. Optimal cutpoints and multivariable risk stratification groupings were determined via recursive partitioning analysis., RESULTS: Pretreatment platelet counts were higher and hemoglobin levels lower in patients who developed RE (P<0.05). Based on these two pre-treatment risk factors, an APR score was defined as 0 (no risk factors), 1 (either risk factor), or 2 (both risk factors). APR score was significantly associated with RE in both univariate (OR = 2.3 for each point, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5-3.4, P = 0.001) and multivariate (OR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.3-3.4, P = 0.002) analyses., CONCLUSIONS: The APR score may represent a novel metric to predict RE. However, pending validation in an independent dataset, caution is advised when interpreting these results given their retrospective and thus exploratory nature. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Method(s): A total of 27 patients with MCS were treated in Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, China from October 1997 to March 2011. Demographic information and follow-up data were obtained and statistically analyzed. Result(s): Among the 27 patients, 9 were males and 18 were females with a mean age of 30.4 years (ranging from 14 years to 51 years). The median follow-up time was 42.6 months (ranging from 6 months to 104 months). Among the total number of tumor cases, 22 and 5 were detected in bone tissues and extra-skeletal sites, respectively. A total of 25 patients underwent surgery, but only 17 achieved the standard surgical margin of wide excision. Among these patients, 16 and 13 were subjected to chemotherapy and irradiation. The threeand five-year survival rates were 65% and 49.5%, respectively. Conclusion(s): MCS is a rare tumor resulting in morbidity with local recurrences and long-term metastases. In this study, standard multimodal regimens were proposed to treat MCS. The results recommended wide resection with suitable surgical margins as the preferred treatment. However, further studies should be conducted because the information about the benefits of chemotherapy and radiotherapy for the control of local or systemic symptoms of MCS remains insufficient.",Excluded
4339,"Predicting severe acute radiation pneumonitis in patients with non-small cell lung cancer receiving postoperative radiotherapy: Development and internal validation of a nomogram based on the clinical and dose-volume histogram parameters. Background and purpose: Postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) can potentially lead to radiation pneumonitis. We aim to develop a nomogram predicting the severe acute radiation pneumonitis (SARP, grade >=3) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving PORT. Material(s) and Method(s): Clinical and dose-volume histogram (DVH) factors were collected from 109 patients between 2006 and 2017. The endpoint was the development of SARP within 3 months after PORT. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the prognostic value of each factor in predicting SARP. Nomogram was generated based on multivariate regression coefficients. Area under the ROC curve (AUC), calibration curves, and decision curve analyses (DCA) were conducted to validate the model. Result(s): Univariate and multivariate analysis indicated that total lung mean dose (tlMD) (OR: 1.003, 95%CI: 1.001-1.006, p = 0.013), percentage of ipsilateral lung volume receiving >=5 Gy (ilV5) (OR: 1.084, 95%CI: 1.020-1.151, p = 0.009), and concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) (OR: 4.091, 95%CI: 1.331-12.572, p = 0.014) were independent prognosticators of SARP and were included in the nomogram. ROC curves revealed the AUC of the nomogram was 0.842, which was much higher than any factor alone (tlMD: 0.769; ilV5: 0.744; CCRT: 0.661). Calibration curves showed favorable consistency between the predicted SARP and the actual observation. DCA showed satisfactory positive net benefits of the model among most of the threshold probabilities, indicating great clinical effect. Conclusion(s): We identified that the tlMD (>10.8 Gy), ilV5 (>64.9%), and CCRT could predict SARP among patients with NSCLC receiving PORT.

4340,"Evaluation of gait speed after applying kinesio tape on quadriceps femoris muscle in patients with knee osteoarthritis. BACKGROUND: Knee osteoarthritis is a chronic degenerative disease, known as the most common cause of difficulty walking in older adults and subsequently is associated with slow walking. Functional decline, increased risk of falls and the presence of pain are, in many studies, related to the muscle weakness caused by osteoarthritis especially weakness of the quadriceps muscles. Many studies have shown that the strength of the quadriceps femoris muscle can affect gait, by improving or weakening it. Kinesio Tape is a physiotherapeutic technique, which reduces pain and increases muscular strength by irritating the skin receptors. AIM: This study aimed to verify if the application of Kinesio Tape on quadriceps femoris muscle increases gait speed while decreasing the time needed to accomplish the 10-meter walk test in patients with knee osteoarthritis and also in subjects without knee osteoarthritis. METHOD(S): In this study, we observed the change of gait speed with the help of the 10-meter walk test before, one day and three days after the application of Kinesio Tape in quadriceps femoris muscle. We compared the results of the time needed to perform the 10-meter walk in two groups. In the first group, the Patients group, participated 102 out-patients with a clinical diagnosis of primary knee osteoarthritis, while in the second group, the Control group, participated 73 subjects with a main excluding criterion a clinical diagnosis of primary knee osteoarthritis. RESULT(S): Our results indicated that there was a significant decrease of time needed to perform the 10-meter walk test in both groups three days after application of Kinesio Tape on quadriceps femoris muscle. However, there was not a significant change one day after the application of Kinesio Tape compared before its application in both groups. CONCLUSION(S): Our results indicated that there was a significant decrease in time needed to accomplish the 10-meter walk test. Kinesio Tape is a technique that can be used especially when changing walking stereotypes is a long-term goal of the treatment.Copyright © 2018 Klejda Tani, Irena Kola, Vjollca Shpata, Fregen Dhamaj.

4341,"Risk factors and clinical courses of chemoradiation-related arterio-esophageal fistula in esophageal cancer patients with clinical invasion of the aorta. Background: Although concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is a standard treatment for esophageal cancer invading adjacent structures (T4-EC), arterio-esophageal fistula (AEF) occurs occasionally as a critical adverse event of T4-EC with CRT. The frequency, clinical course, and risk factors of AEF related to CRT are not well known. Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed 48 patients with T4-EC invasion of the aorta who were treated with 5-fluorouracil, cisplatin, and concurrent radiotherapy at our institution between September 2002 and April 2009. Treatment-related AEF was defined as AEF without obvious tumor progression. We evaluated the frequency, clinical courses, and risk factors of AEF. Result(s): The median survival time was 10.6 months with a median follow-up time of 33.3 months. The 2-year survival rate was 25%. Treatment-related AEF was observed in 7 patients (14.6%) and 4 of them died of massive bleeding due to aortic AEF. In the other 3 patients with non-aortic AEF, hemorrhage could be arrested by transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE). In the univariate analysis of risk factors for AEF, lower serum cholesterol level was a risk factor for AEF (OR 14.7; 95% CI 1.58-137; P = 0.008). Conclusion(s): Although CRT has a curative potential even for patients with T4-EC invading the aorta, we should be aware of the relatively high incidence of treatment-related AEF. TAE may be successful in rescuing a non-aortic AEF patient. Low serum cholesterol level may be a risk factor for AEF, but further investigation is needed. © 2011 Japan Society of Clinical Oncology.",Excluded
4342,"Lung cancer screening. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) in adults of age 55 to 80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and are currently smoking or have quit within the past 15 years. This recommendation is largely based on the findings of the National Lung Screening Trial. Both policy-level and clinical decision-making about LDCT screening must consider the potential benefits of screening (reduced mortality from lung cancer) and possible harms. Effective screening requires an appreciation that screening should be limited to individuals at high risk of death from lung cancer, and that the risk of harm related to false positive findings, overdiagnosis, and unnecessary invasive testing is real. A comprehensive understanding of these aspects of screening will inform appropriate implementation, with the objective that an evidence-based and systematic approach to screening will help to reduce the enormous mortality burden of lung cancer.",Excluded

Background: Based on the hypothesis of synergistic effect of avelumab with cetuximab and radiotherapy, this new combination is tested in a randomised trial against two well-established standard of care (SOC) in locally advanced squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck (LA-SCCHN). Method(s): This phase III trial comprises two cohorts of patients deemed fit to receive cisplatin (100 mg/m2 Q3W) (cohort 1) or unfit to cisplatin (cohort 2). The SOC was Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) with cisplatin in cohort 1 (arm A) and with weekly cetuximab in cohort 2 (arm D). In both cohorts, experimental arms (arms B and C) were IMRT with cetuximab and avelumab (10 mg/kg day 7 and every 2 weeks) followed by avelumab every two weeks for 12 months. A safety phase was planned among the first 41 patients in experimental arms by monitoring grade >=IV adverse events (AEs) with an unacceptable rate of 35%. Result(s): Between September 2017 and August 2018, 82 patients with LA-SCCHN were randomised including 41 patients in experimental arms. All patients of experimental arms except one (arm C) received entire radiotherapy as planned. Most common grade >=III AEs were mucositis, radio-dermatitis, and dysphagia. Grade >=IV AEs occurred in 5/41 (12%) patients, all in arm C (no grade V). This rate was acceptable according to the hypotheses of the safety phase. In the SOC arms, grade >=IV AEs occurred in 3/21 patients (14%) in arm A and 2/20 (10%) in arm D. One grade V haemorrhage occurred in arm A. Conclusion(s): The avelumab-cetuximab-RT combination was tolerable for patients with LA-SCCHN, and the approval was given for continuing the trial without modification.

The availability of equipment that provides photon and electron beams of energies from 4 MeV to 25 MeV permits optimal dose distribution throughout the treatment volume. Since no difference in the biological effectiveness of electrons compared with megavoltage photons has been demonstrated in laboratory studies, there is no hesitation in combining electrons with photons. The selection of the various energies, the combination of electrons with photons, and the ratio of the given doses of each beam depend on the location of the tumor and the maximum depth to be treated. With the use of one beam alone, a combination of 25 MeV and 4 to 6 MeV photon beams, or a combination of photons and electrons, the most effective treatment plan with the available beams can be designed for any clinical situation.",Excluded

Partially segregated neuronal pathways (""what"" and ""where"" pathways, respectively) are thought to mediate sound recognition and localization. Less studied are interactions between these pathways. In two experiments, we investigated whether near-threshold pitch discrimination sensitivity (d') is altered by supra-threshold task-irrelevant position differences and likewise whether near-threshold position discrimination sensitivity is altered by supra-threshold task-irrelevant pitch differences. Each experiment followed a 2 x 2 within-subjects design regarding changes/no change in the task-relevant and task-irrelevant stimulus dimensions. In Experiment 1, subjects discriminated between 750 Hz and 752 Hz pure tones, and d' for this near-threshold pitch change significantly increased by a factor of 1.09 when accompanied by a task-irrelevant position change of 65 micros interaural time difference (ITD). No response bias was induced by the task-irrelevant position change. In Experiment 2, subjects discriminated between 385 micros and 431 micros ITDs, and d' for this near-threshold position change significantly increased by a factor of 0.73 when accompanied by task-irrelevant pitch changes (6 Hz). In contrast to Experiment 1, task-irrelevant pitch changes induced a response criterion bias toward responding that the two stimuli differed. The collective results are indicative of facilitative interactions between ""what"" and ""where"" pathways.

4347,"Treatment for microcarcinoma of the thyroid - Clinical experience. AIMS AND BACKGROUND: Papillary microcarcinoma of the thyroid is a specific subgroup of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and account for up to 30% of all PTC. According to the World Health Organization, papillary microcarcinoma of the thyroid (PMC) is defined as a papillary thyroid carcinoma measuring <=10 mm in the greatest dimension. The relative rate of PMC is increasing in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) mainly due to more frequent use and improvement of ultrasonography and fine-needle aspiration biopsy, and also more accurate histopathological examination of surgical specimens. The high incidence of PMC found in autopsy studies (up to 35%) suggests that most of them have a benign behavior. The locoregional recurrence has been reported in up to 20% of PMC patients and several cases of distant metastases have also been described. The 'ideal' therapeutic approach in PMC patients remains a subject of debate among endocrinologists and surgeons. Treatment of PMC in different departments varies from partial thyroidectomy to total thyroidectomy and radioiodine treatment. The main question in this group of patients is ""How should PMC patients be treated?"" The aim of this study was to investigate retrospectively the frequency and clinical behavior of PMC of the thyroid gland in our department and also to identify the optimal treatment of this group of patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this retrospective study, we evaluated 120 patients with PMC in our department (between 1997 and 2005). The mean age of patients at diagnosis was 43 +/- 13 years (range 17-67 years). The female to male ratio was 87.5% (105 females, 15 males). The mean follow-up period of patients in this study was 45 months (16-84 months). Surgical treatment of patients with PMC in our department consisted of a bilateral total thyroidectomy in 25 patients (21%), and a bilateral near total thyroidectomy in 95 patients (79%). In the evaluation of our patients, multifocal PMC had a relative frequency of 15% (18/120 patients). The patients were informed about the different therapeutic strategies and the possible necessity for more frequent radioiodine treatment to eliminate thyroid remnants. All of the patients in our retrospective study had radioiodine (RAI) ablation therapy for residual thyroid tissue. RESULT(S): All patients received an RAI treatment dose which ranged from 75-150 mCi (2.7-5.5 GBq). Our criteria for ablation are as follows: negative I-131 WBS and very low serum Tg levels (<1 ng/mL). In 112/120 patients (93.3%), the thyroid remnant was ablated with a single dose of I-131 75-150 mCi (2.7-5.5 GBq). A second radioiodine treatment was necessary in 8 patients (7%), because of locoregional recurrence (required mean cumulative doses of 8.2-11 GBq I-131). Locoregional reccurence occurred in 2 patients with unifocal tumor, without capsular invasion or lymph node metastases and in 6 patients with multifocal tumor and/or in patients with capsular invasion or lymph node metastases. After a second radioiodine treatment, all of these 8 patients were ablated. All 120 patients remained free from disease (negative I-131 whole body scan, unmeasurable thyroglobulin levels) after a median follow-up period of 45 months and there was no recorded disease-related mortality. CONCLUSION(S): The treatment of patients with PMC should be no different from the treatment of patients with PTC, and thyroidectomy followed by radioiodine therapy may be a possible option for treatment of papillary microcarcinoma. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",Excluded

Background: Changes in the esophageal microbiome correlate with esophageal disease, but the effects of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drugs are incompletely characterized. Our objective was to identify the effects of PPI use on the microbial community of the esophagus. Method(s): Mucosal biopsies of the distal esophagus were analyzed using a customized esophageal microbiome qPCR panel array (EMB). Patient demographics, use of PPIs, duration of use and dose were recorded. Result(s): Fifty-eight patients were included. Mean age was 60.5 years. Ninety percent (52/58) of patients were on PPIs. Mean dose was 42.7 mg. Mean duration of use was 2.5 years. The use of PPIs led to a significant difference in absolute levels of only one organism, Actinomyces, in the entire array (p < 0.01). Among patients who used proton pump inhibitors, there was no significant association between dose and absolute levels of any organism. Similarly, there was no association between duration of use and absolute levels of any organism.

Purpose/Objective(s): The purpose of this study was to evaluate the longterm treatment outcomes and patterns of failure in patients with primary ocular adnexal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma treated with involved-field radiation therapy. Materials/Methods: Patients who were pathologically diagnosed as Stage IE/IIE ocular adnexal MALT lymphoma and underwent radiation therapy were retrospectively analyzed. Since 2006, 55 patients received radiation therapy and were followed up for more than 6 months at our institution. At initial presentation, 53 patients had Stage IE disease and two had Stage IIE disease. There were 28 men and 27 women. The median age was 66 years (range, 39-90 years). Local control (LC), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): The median follow-up period was 47 months (range, 6-90 months). The median radiation dose was 30 Gy (range, 30-30.6 Gy in 15- 17 fractions). All patients were treated by radiation alone, but oral steroid was used for four patients who had double vision at the beginning of treatment. Thirty-four patients were treated with 6 MV photon beams with a wedged pair of fields. Nineteen patients with a lesion confined to the conjunctive or eyelid were treated with 9 MeV electron beams with a single anterior field. In the remaining two patients, combination of the two beams was used. A lead lens block was used in 16 patients. Six patients had bilateral lesions and were treated simultaneously. The 5-year LC rate was 100%. In two patients, local recurrence was suspected at 44 and 46 months, respectively, after radiation therapy, but both of them were diagnosed to have IgG4-related inflammation by biopsy, with no evidence of malignancy upon histological and immunohistochemical examinations. The 5-year PFS and OS rates were 89% and 100%, respectively. Four patients had recurrence at a distant site. The median time to recurrence was 24 months. Three of the four patients received systemic chemotherapy with R-CHOP and another patient is being followed up without second line treatment. One patient developed retinal detachment incidentally during radiation therapy and underwent surgery thereafter. There was no other Grade 3 or higher acute morbidity. Eleven patients had Grade 2 late morbidity (dry eye, 2; cataract, 9). Sixteen patients had Grade 3 cataract. No patients had severe late adverse events other than cataract. Conclusion(s): Patients with localized ocular adnexal MALT lymphoma achieved excellent local control after 30 Gy of radiation therapy alone. Local regrowth of the mass was observed in two patients, but both were diagnosed as IgG4-related disease.

4354,"Relationship between body composition and development of diabetes in non-obese Japanese subjects. Background : Body mass index (BMI) is a simple and good index to detect individuals with high risk of developing diabetes, though not all obese people develop diabetes. In comparison with populations in USA and Europe, Asian populations have a lower frequency of obesity, and a relatively higher risk of diabetes in non-obese populations. Although epidemiology studies reveal association between body composition and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, very few studies have examined the relationship between body composition and these risk factors in non-obese subjects. Objectives : The purpose of this prospective cohort study was to examine association of body composition with incidence of diabetes, a CVD risk factor, in non-obese Japanese subjects. Methods : The subjects of this study were 1,137 non-obese subjects without diabetes at baseline (368 males and 769 females, with an average age of 65.2) in the Hiroshima Adult Health Study that consists of atomic bomb survivors and their controls. Body composition was estimated by whole body DXA during the period from 1994 through 1996. We used percentages of trunk, leg, and arm fat in relation to total soft tissue mass as surrogate indicators of body fat distribution, and the ratio of appendicular lean mass/height2 (ALM/H2) as a surrogate indicator of appendicular muscle mass volume. Diabetes was defined by fasting glucose >=126mg/dl (7.0 mmol/L) or random glucose >= 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L), a history of diabetes diagnosis by a medical institution, or current treatment for diabetes. Results : During the follow-up period lasting until 2011, 133 subjects developed diabetes. In Cox regression analyses with adjustment for BMI, presence of hypertension and dyslipidemia, radiation dose, and smoking and alcohol consumption status, significant negative association was observed between ALM/H2 and diabetes risk in men. Regarding body fat distribution, trunk fat percentage was positively associated with the incidence of diabetes and it was statistically significant only in men. On the other hand, leg fat percentage was significantly and negatively associated with the incidence of diabetes in women. . Significant association between the percentage of arm fat and diabetes risk was not observed in either gender. Conclusions : Among non-obese subjects, we found body composition to be associated with diabetes risk. Therefore, for Japanese people, body composition may be a useful tool for identifying individuals with high risk of developing diabetes.",Excluded
4355,"Association between trunk and leg fat and incidence of diabetes. Background: General obesity defined by body mass index (BMI) is a major risk factor of diabetes mellitus (DM). Although body fat distribution is also considered to be a predictor of DM, only a few longitudinal studies have examined the association between DM risk and body composition, estimated directly using such methods as DEXA, in particular with reference to Asian populations who have a higher prevalence of DM at lower BMI levels compared with CaucAsians. Objective(s): To determine whether fat distribution is associated with DM incidence, independently of BMI, in an elderly Japanese population. Method(s): We analyzed 1,550 subjects without DM (472 men and 1,078 women, average age of 65.3 years) in the Adult Health Study, consisting of atomic bomb survivors and their controls, whose body composition was measured using DEXA during the period 1994-96. Fat-mass percentages for the trunk and legs were calculated by dividing each of the specific body partTMs fat mass by total soft tissue mass. DM was defined as glucose 126mg/dl fasting or 200mg/dl nonfasting, or physician-diagnosed DM, or the use of medication for DM. We followed-up through the end of 2011. Result(s): During a mean follow-up period of 11.4 years, 85 men and 110 women developed DM. Almost 20% of men and 28% of women were overweight/obese (BMI25kg/m2) at baseline. After multivariate analysis with adjustment made for age, metabolic syndrome risk factors other than central obesity, radiation dose, and smoking and alcohol consumption status, only overweight/obese women had a significant association with DM incidence compared with non-obese women (relative risk [RR] 1.52; 95% CI 1.01-2.27). Percentages of trunk fat and leg fat were associated with incidence of DM, independently of each other, after adjustment for age, BMI, and other risk factors. Increased percentage of trunk fat was a significant risk factor for incidence of DM; the RR for 1% increase in trunk fat were 1.13 (95% CI 1.06-1.20) in men and 1.08 (95% CI 1.02-1.14) in women, whereas, leg fat had protective effects regarding incidence of DM (men RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.71-0.96, women RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.79-0.95, for 1% increase in leg fat). These significant associations were observed for non-obese subjects. Conclusion(s): Trunk and leg fat were associated with incidence of DM, independently of each other.

4356,"Dual BET/kinase inhibitors as a novel strategy for the treatment of multiple myeloma. The bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family of proteins are important epigenetic regulators of critical oncogenes, including c-Myc. JQ1 is the most potent BRD4 inhibitor, currently used in several clinical trials and effective in preventing multiple myeloma progression in vivo. Currently, clinical data is showing that patients often develop acquired resistance, indicating that single agent therapies targeting BRD4 such as JQ1 may not provide durable therapeutic responses. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a new class of dual inhibitors, capable to simultaneously target BRD4 and a panel of tyrosine kinases highly expressed in cancer including JAK2, FLT3, RET, FGFR1, ULK1 and ULK3. A preliminary in vitro screening identified SG3-014 as the lead compound, showing BRD4 and c-Myc inhibition activity similar to JQ1, but additionally, it is capable of inhibiting kinases that are over-activated in cancer and responsible for cytokine-mediated drug resistance pathways. In vitro assays on MM cell lines reveals higher SG3-014 sensitivity (5TGM1, 0.85muM; U266, 0.99muM) compared to JQ1 (5TGM1, 4.7muM; U266, 16muM). In vivo studies using 1x106 5TGM1-Luc cells demonstrate that SG3-014 treatment (25mg/Kg) significantly contributes to overall survival compared to JQ1 and the vehicle control cohort (n=10/group) (median survival CTRL=40.5; SG3-014=50.5; JQ1=46 days). Post-study analyses demonstrated a significant reduction in myeloma induced bone disease in the SG3-014 treated mice as measured by X-ray/muCT/histomorphometry. Clinical datasets identified ULK3 as the candidate kinase of SG3-014 targeting activity and correlated its expression with MM disease stages. Since ULK3 is involved in cellular senescence and autophagy regulation, a key mechanism by which several cancer cell lines protect themselves against apoptosis and become resistant to standard treatments, we explored the role of SG3-014 inhibition in the autophagy pathway. Preliminary data confirm that SG3-014 is an autophagy inhibitor and, as opposed to JQ1, downregulates ATG proteins level, leading to dysfunctional autophagosome formation. We noted that within 6 h, SG3-014 completely shut down autophagy with decrease levels of ULK1, beclin-1, ATG16L-1, ATG12, ATG3, p62 and increased LC3I/II ratios (additionally confirmed by microscopy and flow cytometry). These effects were not noted with JQ1. Further investigation is clarifying the mechanism by which SG3-014 inhibitory activity on ULK3 is responsible for autophagy mediated cancer cell death. In order to validate this target in the progression of the human disease, our future directions will analyze ex vivo multiple myeloma patient samples and examine the efficacy of the inhibitor in CD138 isolated multiple myeloma cells derived from patient biopsies. We propose dual BRD4/autophagy inhibition as a resilient strategy to prevent multiple myeloma by-pass of single targeted therapies.",Excluded
4357,"Extracorporeal irradiation of tumorous calvaria: a case series. OBJECT When intracranial tumors invade the overlying skull, gross resection typically includes removal of the involved bone. Methods used to repair the resulting structural defect in the cranium include artificial prostheses, allogeneic bone grafts, and autoclaving the autologous graft. The authors have previously reported a case involving high-dose extracorporeal ionizing radiation to treat the tumorous calvaria intraoperatively, followed by reimplantation of the treated bone flap. In this paper the authors report the long-term follow-up of that case, as well as results of using extracorporeal irradiation of tumorous calvaria (EITC) for an additional 20 patients treated similarly. METHODS The decision to undergo EITC was typically anticipated preoperatively, but determined intraoperatively, if upon inspection the bone flap was invaded by tumor. The bone flap was then delivered to the radiation oncology department, where a total dose of 120 Gy was delivered, using a clinical linear accelerator, over a period of approximately 15 minutes. After the intracranial tumor resection was completed, the irradiated craniotomy bone flap was reimplanted and the wound was closed in a standard fashion. A retrospective review of patients who had undergone EITC was performed for evidence of calvarial tumor recurrence or other complications. RESULTS Since the originally reported case, 20 additional patients have received EITC during craniotomy for invasive tumors. Eighteen (86%) of 21 patients were diagnosed with meningioma: 12 (67%) with WHO Grade I, 5 (28%) with WHO Grade II, and 1 with WHO Grade III (6%). The remaining 3 patients presented with dural-based B-cell lymphoma with extensive adjacent bone invasion (n = 2) and metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung (n = 1). Follow-up of the 21 patients ranged from 1 to 132 months, with a mean of 41 months and a median of 23 months. No patients have experienced tumor recurrence, infection associated with the treated calvaria, or evidence of bone flap resorption. CONCLUSIONS Calvaria reconstructions represent an important component in structural and cosmetic outcome following craniectomy for tumorous bone. The authors' long-term experience with EITC has been excellent with no local tumor recurrence or complications. Therefore, EITC represents an excellent and efficient option for cranial reconstruction in such patients.",Excluded
4358,"Tube placement using 'IRIS': A pilot assessment of its utility and safety. INTRODUCTION: Most critically ill patients have a feeding tube placed blindly, but 0.5% result in a major lung complication because misplacement is only detected at the end of procedure. Real-time guided tube placement may pre-empt such complications. This clinical effectiveness study examined the ability to visualise anatomy using KangarooTM feeding tubes with IRIS technology ('IRIS' tube). METHOD(S): In a single centre, gastric or intestinal integrated real-time imaging system (IRIS) tubes were prospectively placed in critically ill patients noting the anatomical visualisation. RESULT(S): Of 15 placements, 13 were successful gastric placements and used for feeding but one gastric and one intestinal placement failed because of signal loss and inability to find the pylorus, respectively; both tubes were removed. Air insufflation and fluid aspiration were possible with all tubes. Respiratory misplacement was clearly differentiated, prior to reaching the main carina, from gastrointestinal (GI) anatomical markers, permitting removal before causing trauma. Furthermore, non-traumatic placement was visualised in high-risk cases including during advancement through a nostril with a base of skull fracture and into a stomach with a recently haemorrhaging gastric polyp. Individually assessed, direct vision may offer greater safety. X-ray or pH of aspirated fluid confirmed the position of GI tube placements. One adverse event occurred during placement, reversible bradycardia, in a patient previously having bradycardia. Vision was intermittently obscured by bile, mucus or impaction with mucosa. CONCLUSION(S): 'IRIS' tubes offer real-time guidance regarding anatomical position. Larger studies are needed to establish the best techniques of deploying this equipment and over-coming the difficulties observed.Crown Copyright © 2021. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

4360,"Comparing different analysis methods for quantifying the MRI amide proton transfer (APT) effect in hyperacute stroke patients. Amide proton transfer (APT) imaging is a pH mapping method based on the chemical exchange saturation transfer phenomenon that has potential for penumbra identification following stroke. The majority of the literature thus far has focused on generating pH-weighted contrast using magnetization transfer ratio asymmetry analysis instead of quantitative pH mapping. In this study, the widely used asymmetry analysis and a model-based analysis were both assessed on APT data collected from healthy subjects (n = 2) and hyperacute stroke patients (n = 6, median imaging time after onset = 2 hours 59 minutes). It was found that the model-based approach was able to quantify the APT effect with the lowest variation in grey and white matter (<= 13.8 %) and the smallest average contrast between these two tissue types (3.48 %) in the healthy volunteers. The model-based approach also performed quantitatively better than the other measures in the hyperacute stroke patient APT data, where the quantified APT effect in the infarct core was consistently lower than in the contralateral normal appearing tissue for all the patients recruited, with the group average of the quantified APT effect being 1.5 +/- 0.3 % (infarct core) and 1.9 +/- 0.4 % (contralateral). Based on the fitted parameters from the model-based analysis and a previously published pH and amide proton exchange rate relationship, quantitative pH maps for hyperacute stroke patients were generated, for the first time, using APT imaging.

Purpose: To evaluate clinical pulmonary and radiographic bronchial toxicity after stereotactic ablative radiation therapy and hypofractionated radiation therapy for central lung tumors, and perform normal tissue complication probability modeling and multivariable analyses to identify predictors for toxicity. Methods and Materials: A pooled analysis was performed of patients with a central lung tumor treated using <=12 fractions at 2 centers between 2006 and 2015. Airways were manually contoured on planning computed tomography scans, and doses were recalculated to an equivalent dose of 2 Gy per fraction with an alpha/beta ratio of 3. Grade >=3 (>=G3) clinical pulmonary toxicity was evaluated by 2 or more physicians. Radiographic toxicity was defined as a stenosis or an occlusion with or without atelectasis using follow-up computed tomography scans. Logistic regression analyses were used for statistical analyses. Result(s): A total of 585 bronchial structures were studied in 195 patients who were mainly treated using 5 or 8 fractions (60%). Median patient survival was 27.9 months (95% confidence interval 22.3-33.6 months). Clinical >=G3 toxicity was observed in 24 patients (12%) and radiographic bronchial toxicity in 55 patients (28%), both mainly manifesting <=12 months after treatment. All analyzed dosimetric parameters correlated with clinical and lobar bronchial radiographic toxicity, with V130Gy,EQD having the highest odds ratio. Normal tissue complication probability modeling showed a volume dependency for the development of both clinical and radiographic toxicity. On multivariate analyses, significant predictors for >=G3 toxicity were a planning target volume overlapping the trachea or main stem bronchus (P =.005), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P =.034), and the total V130Gy,EQD (P =.012). Radiographic bronchial toxicity did not significantly correlate with clinical toxicity (P =.663). Conclusion(s): We identified patient and dosimetric factors associated with clinical and radiographic toxicity after high-dose radiation therapy for central lung tumors. Additional data from prospective studies are needed to validate these findings.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
4364,"Ultra-low-dose computed tomography and its utility in wrist trauma in the emergency department. Background: The use and frequency of computed tomography (CT) are increasing day by day in emergency departments (ED). This increases the amount of radiation exposed. Purpose(s): To evaluate the image quality obtained by ultra-low-dose CT (ULDCT) in patients with suspected wrist fractures in the ED and to investigate whether it is an alternative to standard-dose CT (SDCT). Material(s) and Method(s): This is a study prospectively examining 336 patients who consulted the ED for wrist trauma. After exclusion criteria were applied, the patients were divided into the study and control groups. Then, SDCT (120 kVp and 100 mAs) and ULDCT (80 kVp and 5 mAs) wrist protocols were applied simultaneously. The images obtained were evaluated for image quality and fracture independently by a radiologist and an emergency medical specialist using a 5-point scale. Result(s): The effective radiation dose calculated for the control group scans was 41.1 +/- 2.1 microSv, whereas the effective radiation dose calculated for the study group scans was 0.5 +/- 0.0 microSv. The effective radiation dose of the study group was significantly lower than that of the control group (P < 0.01). The CT images in the study group showed no significant differences in the mean image quality score between observer 1 and observer 2 (3.4 and 4.3, respectively; P = 0.58). Both observers could detect all fractures using the ULDCT images. Conclusion(s): ULDCT provides high-quality images in wrist traumas while reducing the radiation dose by approximately 98% compared to SDCT without any changes in diagnostic accuracy.Copyright © The Foundation Acta Radiologica 2021.",Excluded
4365,"Dosimetric evaluation of deep inspiration breath-hold technique for breast cancer radiotherapy: A single-center experience. OBJECTIVE To retrospectively evaluate the absorbed doses of organs at risk, such as lungs and the heart of the patients who underwent radiotherapy (RT) using the voluntary deep inspiration breath-hold (vDIBH) technique, and to compare the results with the literature. METHODS In this study, 102 patients who underwent adjuvant RT for the treatment of breast cancer in our clinic between November 2018 and December 2019 were included. A breast and/or chest wall, and/or lymph node RT of 50 Gy in 25 fractions was planned for all patients, and an additional boost of 10 Gy in five fractions was planned for patients requiring an RT boost. The treatment plans included 3DCRT, Field in Field (FIF), IMRT and VMAT approaches. RESULTS In the group undergoing supraclavicular fossa RT, the mean V20Gy was found to be 24.8%, compared to 16% in the group not undergoing supraclavicular fossa RT (p<0.01). In the group undergoing mammaria interna RT, the mean heart dose was 3.1 Gy, compared to 2.1 Gy in the group not undergoing mammaria interna RT (p=0.04). CONCLUSION Respiratory motion control techniques can reduce uncertainties in the target related to respiratory motion. The irradiated volume doses of the ipsilateral lung, heart reduce.Copyright © 2020, Istanbul Tip Fakultesi. All rights reserved.",Excluded

4367,"Radiation-induced micro-RNA expression changes in peripheral blood cells of radiotherapy patients. Purpose: MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of noncoding small RNAs that regulate gene expression, are involved in numerous physiologic processes in normal and malignant cells. Our in vivo study measured miRNA and gene expression changes in human blood cells in response to ionizing radiation, to develop miRNA signatures that can be used as biomarkers for radiation exposure. Methods and Materials: Blood from 8 radiotherapy patients in complete remission 1 or 2 was collected immediately before and 4 hours after total body irradiation with 1.25 Gy x-rays. Both miRNA and gene expression changes were measured by means of quantitative polymerase chain reaction and microarray hybridization, respectively. Hierarchic clustering, multidimensional scaling, class prediction, and gene ontology analysis were performed to investigate the potential of miRNAs to serve as radiation biomarkers and to elucidate their likely physiologic roles in the radiation response. Result(s): The expression levels of 45 miRNAs were statistically significantly upregulated 4 hours after irradiation with 1.25 Gy x-rays, 27 of them in every patient. Nonirradiated and irradiated samples form separate clusters in hierarchic clustering and multidimensional scaling. Out of 223 differentially expressed genes, 37 were both downregulated and predicted targets of the upregulated miRNAs. Paired and unpaired miRNA-based classifiers that we developed can predict the class membership of a sample with unknown irradiation status, with accuracies of 100% when all 45 upregulated miRNAs are included. Both miRNA control of and gene involvement in biologic processes such as hemopoiesis and the immune response are increased after irradiation, whereas metabolic processes are underrepresented among all differentially expressed genes and the genes controlled by miRNAs. Conclusion(s): Exposure to ionizing radiation leads to the upregulation of the expression of a considerable proportion of the human miRNAome of peripheral blood cells. These miRNA expression signatures can be used as biomarkers of radiation exposure. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
4368,"Prevention and Management of Radiation-induced Late Gastrointestinal Toxicity. In the UK, about 90,000 cancer survivors will suffer from pelvic radiation disease (PRD) due to their curative treatment including radiotherapy. The National Cancer Survivorship Initiative aims to improve the understanding and management of PRD by the oncology community. This overview covers the prevention, investigation and treatment for late radiation-induced gastrointestinal symptoms in PRD. Multiple pharmacological and nutritional interventions have been studied, as prophylaxis for acute gastrointestinal toxicity (aiming to prevent late consequential effects), although predominantly only small randomised controlled trials have been conducted. These have produced mixed results, although promising signals for some agents have been observed. Evidence for the pharmacological prevention of late gastrointestinal toxicity is scarce. Even fewer randomised controlled trials have investigated the late gastrointestinal toxicity profile of advanced radiotherapy technologies. There are nationally agreed algorithms for the investigation and management of PRD, but a lack of awareness means patients still do not get referred appropriately. This overview outlines the management of radiation proctopathy and diarrhoea, and signposts other accessible resources. Finally, we provide recommendations for the management of late gastrointestinal symptoms in PRD and research in this field, especially the need for high-quality clinical trials.

4369,"Improved local control for early T-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma--a tale of two hospitals. PURPOSE: To study the efficacy of intracavitary brachytherapy (ICT) in early T-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: All early T-stage (T1 and T2 nasal cavity tumour) NPC treated with a curative intent up to 1996 were analyzed (n=743), 163 from the Prince of Wales Hospital (PWH) and 25 from Tuen Mun Hospital (TMH) were given ICT after radical external radiotherapy (ERT; group A). They were compared with 555 patients treated with ERT alone (group B). The radiotherapy techniques were identical between the two hospitals. The ERT delivered the tumoricidal dose (uncorrected biological equivalent dose (BED)-10, > or = 75 Gy) to the primary tumour, and this did not differ in technique or dosage between the two groups. The ICT delivered a dose of 18-24 Gy in three fractions over 15 days to a point 1 cm perpendicular to the midpoint of the plane of the sources., RESULTS: The local failure was significantly less (crude rates, 6.9 vs. 13.0%; 5-year actuarial rates, 5.8 vs. 11.7%) and the disease-specific mortality was significantly lower (crude rates, 13.8 vs. 18.9%; 5-year actuarial rates, 12.2 vs. 15.2%) in group A compared with group B. ICT was the only significant independent prognostic factor predictive of fewer local failures. When ICT was excluded from the Cox regression model, the total physical dose or the total BED-10 uncorrected for tumour repopulation became significant in predicting the ultimate local failure rate. The two groups were comparable in the rate of the chronic radiation complications. A significant dose-tumour-control relationship existed, plotting the local failure as a function of the total physical dose or the total BED., CONCLUSIONS: Supplementing ERT, which delivered the tumoricidal dose (uncorrected BED-10, > or = 75 Gy), with ICT significantly enhanced ultimate local control in early T-stage (T1/T2 nasal infiltration) NPC. A significant dose-tumour-control relationship exists above the conventional tumoricidal dose level.",Excluded
4370,"Why to start the concomitant boost in accelerated radiotherapy for advanced laryngeal cancer in week 3. PURPOSE: We analyzed toxicity and the local control rates for advanced laryngeal cancer, treated with two accelerated fractionation schedules. The main difference between the schedules was the onset of the concomitant boost, in Week 3 or Week 4. Overall treatment time and total dose were equivalent., METHODS AND MATERIALS: In a prospective, nonrandomized study of T3, T4, and advanced T2 laryngeal cancer, concomitant boost schedules were used in 100 patients. Thirty patients received a schedule of twice daily 1.2 Gy in Weeks 1-3, followed by twice daily 1.7 Gy in Weeks 4 and 5; total dose was 70 Gy (the hyperfractionated accelerated schedule [HAS] regimen). Seventy patients were treated with 5 times 2 Gy in Weeks 1 and 2, followed by daily 1.8 Gy and 1.5 Gy (boost) in Weeks 3-5; total dose 69.5 Gy (the accelerated schedule only [ASO] regimen). Distribution of T stage was 47%, 40%, and 12% for T2, T3, and T4, respectively. In 24% of the patients, lymph nodes were positive. Pretreatment tracheotomy or stridor or both occurred in 8 patients. The distribution of prognostic factors was not significantly different between the two fractionation schedules. Acute and late toxicity was assessed. Results were estimated by the use of actuarial methods. For late toxicity and local control univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Tumor control probability analysis was used to model cure rate differences., RESULTS: Overall acute mucositis score was equal for both schedules. Acute mucositis started and decreased significantly earlier in the HAS regimen. In all patients acute mucositis healed completely. The treatment was completed within 38 days in all patients. The regional control rate was 100% for clinical N0, and 75% for the clinical N+ patients. The 3-year local control rate was 59% and 78% for the HAS and ASO regimens, respectively (p = 0.05); the ultimate local control was 80% and 94%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, besides the fractionation schedule (relative risk [RR], 2.6 for HAS vs. ASO), pretreatment tracheotomy/stridor (RR 4.3, yes vs. no), and local tumor response 3-6 weeks after radiotherapy (RR 5.1, no vs. yes) were independent factors for local control. Tumor control probability analysis indicated that the onset of repopulation may be about 4-6 days earlier for the HAS regimen. The onset of repopulation in the HAS regimen is probably at the end of the second week or at the beginning of the third week. Severe late toxicity was observed in the HAS group and ASO group in, respectively, 11% and 16%. In multivariate analysis this toxicity related significantly to the field size and pretreatment tracheotomy/stridor., CONCLUSIONS: In our study the timing of the boost in accelerated radiotherapy for advanced laryngeal cancer was an independent factor for local control, favoring the use of a concomitant boost in Week 3. This finding may indicate that accelerated repopulation of tumor cells starts early in the treatment phase.",Excluded

4372,"Postoperative chemoradiotherapy in rectal cancer. Late results of a pilot study. BACKGROUND/AIMS: It has recently been proven that postoperative radiotherapy combined with fluorouracil showed an increase of survival and local control in patients with rectal cancer. However, hematological and intestinal toxicity also increased. Experimental and clinical studies showed an increased radiation effect with an acceptable toxicity by delivering drug via a continuous intravenous infusion., METHODOLOGY: From 1988 to 1998, 80 patients radically operated on for stages B2-C rectal cancer were irradiated with 3 fractions of 100 cGy per day to a total dose of 5,600 cGy. 34 out of these 80 patients underwent postoperative radiotherapy alone and 46 received radiotherapy combined with concomitant protracted infusion of fluorouracil at doses of 250 mg/m2 per day., RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 54 months, the 5-year overall and disease-free survival were 59% and 54%, respectively, in the combined modality group, as compared to 42% and 34%, respectively, in the radiation alone group. The differences were not significant, but the incidence of local relapse and patients' survival showed a better trend for combined approach., CONCLUSIONS: The data from international literature are in favor of a combined approach, both in preoperative and postoperative treatment of advanced rectal cancer.

4373,"Patterns of Care Study of radiation therapy for esophageal cancer in Japan: Influence of age on parameters of treatment. Background. In Japan, the elderly population is growing rapidly, and therefore, so is the number of cancer patients who are not good candidates for aggressive surgery or chemotherapy. Radiation therapy offers excellent potential for the treatment of such patients, with minimal invasion and functional preservation. A Patterns of Care Study (PCS) examined the parameters of treatments used for patients with esophageal cancer to determine nationwide variations by age. Methods. From July 1996 through February 1997, external nationwide PCS audits were performed for 29 institutions. Medical charts were reviewed for 455 patients with thoracic esophageal cancer treated between 1992 and 1994. The parameters of treatments used for these patients were compared between those aged >=75 years (elderly; n = 113) and those aged <75 years (younger; n = 342). Results. Surgery was used in 49% of the younger group and in 17% of the elderly group (P < 0.0001) while chemotherapy was used in 48% of the younger and 24% of the older group (P < 0.0001). The ratio of non-surgery group with radiation therapy increased significantly from 49% to 82% (P < 0.0001). Approximately 70% of the non- surgery patients received an external radiation dose of more than 60 Gy, even in the elderly (P = 0.3001). Preliminary results showed no significant difference in survival between the two age groups (P = 0.5559). Conclusions. The use of radiation therapy in elderly people with esophageal cancer has increased markedly. The PCS provided important information about variations in radiotherapy parameters in patients with esophageal cancer in relation to age. Such information should be useful for future prospective studies of the elderly.",Excluded
4374,"A decade of atrial fibrillation ablation shifts in patient characteristics and procedural outcomes. Background Over the past decade, radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) of atrial fibrillation (AF) has evolved into a frequently performed procedure. The aim of this study was to monitor changes in patient characteristics, procedural characteristics, outcomes and complications over the past 10 years. Methods All consecutive patients who underwent primary RFCA treatment of AF in the University Medical Center Utrecht from 2005-2015 were included. In all patients, the primary ablation strategy was pulmonary vein (PV) antrum isolation without additional substrate modification. Baseline patient and procedure characteristics, and 1-year follow-up data of 975 patients were prospectively collected. Results In 2005, 73.4% of patients suffered from paroxysmal AF, which decreased to 45.3% in 2014. Mean age increased from 54 +/- 9 to 61 +/- 10 years and CHA2DS2-VASc score >=2 from 18 to 40.6%. History of AF decreased significantly from 7 to 4 years. Mean procedure duration was 237 +/- 53 min in 2005 and 163 +/- 41 min in 2014. Fluoroscopy time significantly decreased from 41 +/- 17 to 19 +/- 8 min and total radiation exposure from 465 (263-687) to 210 (118-376) mGy. One-year success remained similar (2005: 55.6%, 2014: 54.8%), as did the amount of PV reconnection observed during redo procedures. Due to a marked reduction in vascular complications and moderate PV stenosis, the total complication rate decreased significantly. Conclusion Over the past decade, AF ablation has increasingly been performed in older patients with persistent AF and more comorbidity. Moreover, it has been performed earlier after AF diagnosis. Although several performance parameters, such as procedure duration and complication rate, improved, 1-year single procedure success remained unchanged.Copyright © The Author(s) 2017.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: The efforts to reduce radiation from cardiac computed tomography (CT) are essential. Using a prospectively triggered, high-pitch dual-source CT protocol, we aim to determine the radiation dose and image quality in patients undergoing pulmonary vein (PV) imaging., METHODS AND RESULTS: In 94 patients (61+/-9 years; 71% male) who underwent 128-slice dual-source CT (pitch 3.4), radiation dose and image quality were assessed and compared between 69 patients with sinus rhythm and 25 patients with atrial fibrillation. Radiation dose was compared in a subset of 19 patients with prior retrospective or prospectively triggered CT PV scans without high pitch. In a subset of 18 patients with prior magnetic resonance imaging for PV assessment, PV anatomy and scan duration were compared with high-pitch CT. Using the high-pitch protocol, total effective radiation dose was 1.4 (1.3, 1.9) mSv, with no difference between sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation (1.4 versus 1.5 mSv; P=0.22). No high-pitch CT scans were nondiagnostic or had poor image quality. Radiation dose was reduced with high-pitch (1.6 mSv) compared with standard protocols (19.3 mSv; P<0.0001). This radiation dose reduction was seen with sinus rhythm (1.5 versus 16.7 mSv; P<0.0001) but was more profound with atrial fibrillation (1.9 versus 27.7 mSv; P=0.039). There was excellent agreement of PV anatomy (kappa 0.84; P<0.0001) and a shorter CT scan duration (6 minutes) compared with magnetic resonance imaging (41 minutes; P<0.0001)., CONCLUSIONS: Using a high-pitch dual-source CT protocol, PV imaging can be performed with minimal radiation dose, short scan acquisition, and excellent image quality in patients with sinus rhythm or atrial fibrillation. This protocol highlights the success of new cardiac CT technology to minimize radiation exposure, giving clinicians a new low-dose imaging alternative to assess PV anatomy.",Excluded
4376,"Evaluation of S100B in the diagnosis of suspected intracranial hemorrhage after minor head injury in patients who are receiving platelet aggregation inhibitors and in patients 65 years of age and older. OBJECT: Cranial CT (CCT) scans and hospital admission are increasingly performed to rule out intracranial hemorrhage in patients after minor head injury (MHI), particularly in older patients and in those receiving antiplatelet therapy. This leads to high radiation exposure and a growing financial burden. The aim of this study was to determine whether the astroglial-derived protein S100B that is released into blood can be used as a reliable negative predictive tool for intracranial bleeding in patients after MHI, when they are older than 65 years or being treated with antiplatelet drugs (low-dose aspirin, clopidogrel)., METHODS: The authors conducted a prospective observational study in 2 trauma hospitals. A total of 782 patients with MHI (Glasgow Coma Scale Score 13-15) who were on medication with platelet aggregation inhibitors (PAIs) or were age 65 years and older, independent of antiplatelet therapy, were included. Clinical examination, bloodwork, observation, and CCT were performed in the traumatology emergency departments. When necessary, patients were admitted and observation took place on the ward; in these patients, CCT was performed during their hospital stay. Patients with severe trauma, focal neurological deficits, posttraumatic seizures, anticoagulant therapy, alcohol intoxication, coagulation disorder, blood sampling more than 3 hours after trauma, and unknown time of the trauma were excluded from the study. The median age of the patients was 83 years, and 69% were female. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of S100B with reference to CCT findings were calculated. The cutoff of S100B was set at 0.105 mug/L., RESULTS: Of the 782 patients, 50 (6.4%) had intracranial bleeding. One patient with positive results on CCT scan showed an S100B level below 0.105 mug/L. Of all patients, 33.1% were below the cutoff. S100B showed a sensitivity of 98.0% (CI 89.5%-99.7%), a negative predictive value of 99.6% (CI 97.9%-99.9%), a specificity of 35.3% (CI 31.9%- 38.8%), and a positive predictive value of 9.4% (CI 7.2%-12.2%)., CONCLUSIONS: Levels of S100B below 0.105 mug/L can accurately predict normal CCT findings after MHI in older patients and in those treated with PAIs. Combining conventional decision criteria with measurement of S100B can reduce the CCT scan and hospital admission rates by approximately 30%.",Excluded
4377,"Larynx motion considerations in partial larynx volumetric modulated arc therapy for early glottic cancer. Introduction: To assess laryngeal motion in early glottic cancer in order to determine safe margins for partial larynx volumetric modulated arc therapy (PL-VMAT), and to quantify dosimetric advantages of PL-VMAT. Method(s): This prospective study included T1-2N0 glottic cancers treated with whole larynx VMAT (WL-VMAT). Pre- and mid-treatment 4D-computed tomography (4D-CT) and dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allowed for assessment of larynx swallowing and respiratory motion. For 10 patients with lateralized lesions, PL-VMAT plans were calculated using margins derived from 4D-CT analysis. Result(s): Twenty patients were accrued from 2014 to 2016. Mean amplitude of larynx swallowing excursion was 23 mm and 6 mm in the superior and anterior directions, respectively. Mean respiratory motion reached 4 mm and 2 mm in superior-inferior and antero-posterior directions, respectively. Pre-treatment 4D-CT analysis identified one patient with planning CT acquired during swallowing. Mid-treatment 4D-CT revealed larynx shift relative to vertebrae in 30% of cases. PL-VMAT allowed for significant reduction of mean doses to ipsilateral carotid, contralateral carotid, thyroid gland, contralateral arytenoid and larynx. Using 8 mm internal margin for PL-VMAT, swallowing resulted in clinical target volume excursion beyond 95% isodose line during <=1.5% of total treatment time in all patients. Conclusion(s): Although swallowing motion is rare, rapid and easily suppressed by patients, there is a risk of systematic miss-targeting if planning CT is acquired during swallowing. Larynx position shift relative to vertebrae occurs in 1/3 of patients over the course of radiotherapy. With soft-tissue image guidance and margins accounting for respiratory motion, PL-VMAT allows safe reduction of dose to organs at risk.Copyright © 2017 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists",Excluded
4378,"Pembrolizumab with or without radiotherapy for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer: a pooled analysis of two randomised trials. Background: Radiotherapy might augment systemic antitumoral responses to immunotherapy. In the PEMBRO-RT (phase 2) and MDACC (phase 1/2) trials, patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer were randomly allocated immunotherapy (pembrolizumab) with or without radiotherapy. When the trials were analysed individually, a potential benefit was noted in the combination treatment arm. However, owing to the small sample size of each trial, differences in response rates and outcomes were not statistically significant but remained clinically notable. We therefore did a pooled analysis to infer whether radiotherapy improves responses to immunotherapy in patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer. Method(s): Inclusion criteria for the PEMBRO-RT and MDACC trials were patients (aged >=18 years) with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer and at least one unirradiated lesion to monitor for out-of-field response. In the PEMBRO-RT trial, patients had previously received chemotherapy, whereas in the MDACC trial, patients could be either previously treated or newly diagnosed. Patients in both trials were immunotherapy-naive. In the PEMBRO-RT trial, patients were randomly assigned (1:1) and stratified by smoking status (<10 vs >=10 pack-years). In the MDACC trial, patients were entered into one of two cohorts based on radiotherapy schedule feasibility and randomly assigned (1:1). Because of the nature of the intervention in the combination treatment arm, blinding to radiotherapy was not feasible in either trial. Pembrolizumab was administered intravenously (200 mg every 3 weeks) with or without radiotherapy in both trials. In the PEMBRO-RT trial, the first dose of pembrolizumab was given sequentially less than 1 week after the last dose of radiotherapy (24 Gy in three fractions), whereas in the MDACC trial, pembrolizumab was given concurrently with the first dose of radiotherapy (50 Gy in four fractions or 45 Gy in 15 fractions). Only unirradiated lesions were measured for response. The endpoints for this pooled analysis were best out-of-field (abscopal) response rate (ARR), best abscopal disease control rate (ACR), ARR at 12 weeks, ACR at 12 weeks, progression-free survival, and overall survival. The intention-to-treat populations from both trials were included in analyses. The PEMBRO-RT trial (NCT02492568) and the MDACC trial (NCT02444741) are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov. Finding(s): Overall, 148 patients were included in the pooled analysis, 76 of whom had been assigned pembrolizumab and 72 who had been assigned pembrolizumab plus radiotherapy. Median follow-up for all patients was 33 months (IQR 32.4-33.6). 124 (84%) of 148 patients had non-squamous histological features and 111 (75%) had previously received chemotherapy. Baseline variables did not differ between treatment groups, including PD-L1 status and metastatic disease volume. The most frequently irradiated sites were lung metastases (28 of 72 [39%]), intrathoracic lymph nodes (15 of 72 [21%]), and lung primary disease (12 of 72 [17%]). Best ARR was 19.7% (15 of 76) with pembrolizumab versus 41.7% (30 of 72) with pembrolizumab plus radiotherapy (odds ratio [OR] 2.96, 95% CI 1.42-6.20; p=0.0039), and best ACR was 43.4% (33 of 76) with pembrolizumab versus 65.3% (47 of 72) with pembrolizumab plus radiotherapy (2.51, 1.28-4.91; p=0.0071). Median progression-free survival was 4.4 months (IQR 2.9-5.9) with pembrolizumab alone versus 9.0 months (6.8-11.2) with pembrolizumab plus radiotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.67, 95% CI 0.45-0.99; p=0.045), and median overall survival was 8.7 months (6.4-11.0) with pembrolizumab versus 19.2 months (14.6-23.8) with pembrolizumab plus radiotherapy (0.67, 0.54-0.84; p=0.0004). No new safety concerns were noted in the pooled analysis. Interpretation(s): Adding radiotherapy to pembrolizumab immunotherapy significantly increased responses and outcomes in patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer.

4379,"Influence of tumor cell proliferation and sex-hormone receptors on effectiveness of radiation therapy for dogs with incompletely resected meningiomas. OBJECTIVE: To assess the influence of tumor cell proliferation and sex-hormone receptors on the efficacy of megavoltage irradiation for dogs with incompletely resected meningiomas., DESIGN: Longitudinal clinical trial., ANIMALS: 20 dogs with incompletely resected intracranial meningiomas., PROCEDURE: Dogs were treated with 48 Gy of radiation administered 3 times per week on an alternate-day schedule of 4 Gy/fraction for 4 weeks, using bilateral parallel-opposed fields., RESULTS: Tumor proliferative fraction measured by immunohistochemical detection of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PFPCNA index) ranged from 10 to 42% (median, 24%). Progesterone receptor immunoreactivity was detected in 70% of tumors. Estrogen receptor immunoreactivity was not detected. An inverse correlation was found between detection of progesterone receptors and the PFPCNA index. The overall 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 68%. The only prognostic factor that significantly affected PFS rate was the PFPCNA index. The 2-year PFS was 42% for tumors with a high PFPCNA index (value > or = 24%) and 91% for tumors with a low PFPCNA index (value < 24%). Tumors with a high PFPCNA index were 9.1 times as likely to recur as were tumors with a low PFPCNA index., CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study confirms the value of irradiation for dogs with incompletely resected meningiomas. Prognostic value of the PFPCNA index suggests-that duration of treatment and interval from surgery to start of irradiation may affect outcome. Loss of progesterone receptors in some tumors may be responsible for an increase in PFPCNA index and may indirectly affect prognosis after radiation therapy.",Included

Grades 3 and 4 were defined as treatment-induced hearing loss of >= 35 dB at PTA 1-2-4 kHz and >= 70 dB at PTA 1-2-4 kHz, respectively. In high-dose cisplatin CRT incidences by the new criteria, CTCAEv4 and ASHA were comparable (78%-88%). In RT and low-dose cisplatin CRT, incidences were 36% to 39% in the new criteria versus 22% to 53% in CTCAEv4 and ASHA. Conclusion(s): The new criteria show an increased sensitivity to ototoxicity compared to CTCAEv4 and ASHA and provide insight into the effect of hearing loss on certain daily life situations. The new grading system seems feasible for clinic and research purposes.Copyright © 2014 The Author(s).",Excluded
4382,"Spine stereotactic body radiotherapy for renal cell cancer spinal metastases: Analysis of outcomes and risk of vertebral compression fracture. Object. The aim of this study was to evaluate local control (LC) and the risk of vertebral compression fracture (VCF) after stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in patients with renal cell cancer spinal metastases. Methods. Prospectively collected data on 71 spinal segments treated with SBRT in 37 patients were reviewed. The median follow-up was 12.3 months (range 1.2-55.4 months). The LC rate was assessed based on each spinal segment treated and overall survival (OS) according to each patient treated. Sixty of 71 segments (85%) were radiation naive, 11 of 71 (15%) were previously irradiated, and 10 of 71 (14%) were treated with postoperative SBRT. The median SBRT total dose and number of fractions were 24 Gy and 2, respectively. The VCF analysis also included evaluation of the Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score criteria. Results. The 1-year OS and LC rates were 64% and 83%, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified oligometastatic disease (13 of 37 patients) as a positive prognostic factor (p = 0.018) for OS. Of 61 non-postoperative spinal segments treated, 10 (16%) developed VCFs; 3 of 10 were de novo VCFs and 7 of 10 occurred as progression of an existing VCF. The 1-year VCF-free probability rate was 82%. Multivariate analysis identified single-fraction SBRT and baseline VCF as significant predictors of SBRT-induced VCF (p = 0.028 and p = 0.012, respectively). Conclusions. Spine SBRT yields high rates of local tumor control in patients with renal cell cancer. Baseline VCF and 18-24 Gy delivered in a single fraction were predictive of further collapse. Patients with oligometastatic disease may benefit most from such aggressive local therapy, given the prolonged survival observed.Copyright © AANS, 2014.",Excluded
4383,"Reader variability and validation of the Timika X-ray score during treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. SETTING: Chest radiographs (CXRs) are widely used for diagnosing pulmonary TB and assessing response to therapy. The Timika X-ray score has been proposed as a tool for measuring disease severity and predicting treatment outcome., OBJECTIVE: To evaluate inter- and intra-reader agreement of Timika scores and assess the ability of the score to predict microbiologic outcome at 2 months., DESIGN: Analytical validation study. Disease severity was measured by two readers using pretreatment radiographs and follow-up films taken at 2, 6 and 12 months after the start of treatment among 110 human immunodeficiency virus negative adults with pulmonary TB. One fourth of the films were reread to assess intra-reader agreement., RESULTS: The two-component Timika score had high inter- and intra-reader agreement (intraclass correlation (ICC)inter = 75%, ICCintra > 0.81). Baseline Timika score was associated with positive month 2 smear (P = 0.0004) and culture status (P = 0.03). The average Timika score declined significantly over the course of successful treatment., CONCLUSION: The Timika score showed good inter- and intra-reader agreement and a significant association with microbiological outcomes after 2 months of treatment. The results of this study strengthen the evidence supporting the use of the Timika score for measuring disease severity on CXR.",Excluded
4384,"Biological dosimetry using the micronucleus assay for lymphocytes: interindividual differences in dose response. The dose response of the number of micronuclei in cytokinesis-blocked lymphocytes after in-vitro irradiation of whole blood with x rays in the dose range 0-4 Gy was studied for a heterogeneous population of 10 donors. One thousand binucleated cells were systematically scored for micronuclei. A linear-quadratic dose dependency of the micronucleus yields was observed. The data were used to derive the accuracy of the dose assessment with the technique in case of a radiation accident. It was shown that for doses of 2 Gy and higher, the uncertainty of the dose was predominantly due to interindividual differences in the x-ray-induced micronucleus yields. At the 95% confidence level, doses lower than 0.3 Gy could not be unequivocally detected with the cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus assay due to the variability of the baseline micronucleus frequency within the donor population and the poor statistical accuracy when scoring 1,000 cells. The precision and sensitivity of the method in the low-dose range could be improved by the knowledge of individual pre-irradiation baseline values and an increase of the number of cells scored by automation of the technique.",Excluded
4385,"Inter-laboratory comparison of cytogenetic endpoints for the biomonitoring of radiological workers. Purpose: The evaluation of different cytogenetic endpoints of radiation damage for the biomonitoring of contract workers temporarily employed at nuclear power plants. Material(s) and Method(s): Blood samples from six donors were irradiated in vitro with doses ranging from 0.1 to 2 Gy 60Co gamma-rays. Compared were a conventional analysis for dicentrics, the conventional micronucleus (MN) assay, the centromere micronucleus assay using p82H and an alphaAllCen pancentromeric probe, and tricolour FISH with chromosome 2, 4 and 8 DNA probes for the scoring of translocations. Result(s): Agreement in the number of MN between Giemsa-and propidium iodine fluorescence-stained preparations was obtained. The control samples showed higher centromere positivity for the MN after FISH with the p82H probe compared with the alphaAllCen probe. The MN results with both probes showed a slight but systematic increase in the number of centromere-positive MN with dose, indicating that radiation, although principally clastogenic, also has aneuploidogenic properties. The values of the genomic translocation frequency (F(G)) derived from the observed translocation frequencies were systematically higher than the dicentric yields. Comparing the sensitivity of the different methods with restriction of the scoring time to 1 day for biomonitoring purposes, the centromere micronucleus assay had the lowest dose detection limit (0.1 to 0.2 Gy). Conclusion(s): This study shows that at present only the centromere micronucleus assay can combine high sensitivity with a reasonable scoring time for the biomonitoring of relatively large populations.",Excluded
4386,"Long-term outcome of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in patients with acoustic neuromas. Purpose: To evaluate the effectiveness and long-term outcome of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for acoustic neuromas (AN). Patients and Methods: Between 1990 and 2001, we treated 26 patients with 27 AN with SRS. Two patients suffered from neurofibromatosis type 2. Before SRS, a subtotal or total resection had been performed in 3 and in 5 patients, respectively. For SRS, a median single dose of 13 Gy/80% isodose was applied. Result(s): The overall actuarial 5-year and 10-year tumor control probability in all patients was 91%. Two patients developed tumor progression after SRS at 36 and 48 months. Nineteen patients (73%) were at risk of treatment-related facial nerve toxicity; of these, 1 patient developed a complete facial nerve palsy after SRS (5%). A total of 93% of the lesions treated were at risk of radiation-induced trigeminal neuralgia. Two patients (8%) developed mild dysesthesia of the trigeminal nerve after SRS. The hearing preservation rate in patients with useful hearing before SRS was 55% at 9 years. Conclusion(s):: Stereotactic radiosurgery results in good local control rates of AN and the risk of cranial nerve toxicities is acceptable. As toxicity is lower with fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy, SRS should be reserved for smaller lesions. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
4387,"Analysis by alkaline comet assay of cancer patients with severe reactions to radiotherapy: Defective rejoining of radioinduced DNA strand breaks in lymphocytes of breast cancer patients. Therapeutic exposure to ionising radiation reveals inter-individual variations in normal tissue responses. To examine whether a defect in DNA repair capacity might be involved in such hypersensitive phenotypes, we analysed, using the alkaline comet assay, the response as a function of time to in vitro irradiation at 5 Gy of lymphocytes from 17 breast cancer and 9 Hodgkin's disease patients who developed severe reactions to radiotherapy in comparison with 22 patients with 'average' reactions and 24 healthy donors. A difference between breast cancer over-reactors and both patients with normal reactions and healthy donors was observed 30 and 60 min after exposure. A subgroup of breast cancer over-reactors (7/17) reproducibly demonstrated increased levels of residual damage. When the kinetic analyses were prolonged to 120 min, results were in favour of delayed kinetics of rejoining in these patients. Among Hodgkin's disease over-reactors, only one patient showed defective repair. Interestingly, all patients with the most severe complications (grade 4 RTOG/EORTC), i.e., 5 breast cancer and 1 Hodgkin's disease, showed impaired rejoining. Our results suggest that impairment in DNA strand break processing may be associated, in specific subgroups of breast cancer patients, with an individual risk of major toxicity of radiation therapy. Thus, the alkaline comet assay appears to be useful for documenting the DNA repair phenotype in cancer patients.",Included

PURPOSE: To evaluate functional results and corneal changes after femtosecond laser correction of presbyopia (INTRACOR, Technolas Perfect Vision GmbH) in emmetropes using a modified treatment pattern over a 12-month period., METHODS: Twenty eyes from 20 emmetropic patients were treated with a modified intrastromal INTRACOR pattern consisting of 5 central rings and 8 radial cuts in a prospective, nonrandomized, uncontrolled, open, single-center, clinical study. Refraction, visual acuity, endothelial cell density, corneal pachymetry, total corneal power, and stray light were evaluated preoperatively and 1 (except endothelial cell density and stray light), 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Patients filled out a subjective questionnaire at 12 months postoperatively., RESULTS: Comparison of preoperative versus 12-month postoperative median values revealed a significant improvement in uncorrected near visual acuity (UNVA) from 0.60 (20/80) to 0.10 logMAR (20/25) (P<.0001) and a significant decrease in corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) from -0.10 (20/16) to 0.00 logMAR (20/20), which equals a median loss of one line (P=.0005). Fifteen percent of patients lost two lines of CDVA in the treated eye. Subjective spherical equivalent refraction remained unchanged at 0.00 diopters (D) (P=.194). After INTRACOR treatment, significant corneal steepening of 1.40 D and midperipheral flattening of 0.50 D occurred (both P<.0001). Corneal pachymetry at the thinnest point and endothelial cell density did not change significantly (P=.829 and P=.058, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: After 12 months, the modified INTRACOR pattern improved UNVA in emmetropic patients without inducing a myopic shift or significant changes in endothelial cell density or pachymetry.

4389,"Key factors affecting the spring emergence of pea moth (Cydia nigricana). The hypothesis that spring emergence of the pea moth Cydia nigricana is regulated by environmental factors, particularly photoperiod and temperature, was examined in this study. A long-term field study was conducted in two distinct pea-growing areas in Hesse and Saxony, Germany. Strong correlations between the flight phenology of pea moth in spring and air temperature, soil temperature, solar radiation and day length were demonstrated for three consecutive years. In laboratory experiments, we elucidated the interaction of different photoperiod-temperature regimes, verifying cumulative day-degree data in relation to pea moth emergence rates in the field. C. nigricana temperature sensitivity is apparently initiated by long day conditions with a critical day length of about 14 h L:D. The overall results contribute to the theory that photoperiod and temperature interact as regulatory cues for spring emergence of C. nigricana. The findings are discussed in terms of the development of predictive models and decision support systems for pea moth control.",Excluded
4390,"Stereotactic radiosurgery of small intracranial tumors: neuropathological correlation in three patients. The mechanism by which radiosurgery can stop the growth of some tumors is poorly understood, in part because postmortem neuropathological findings in patients have been reported only rarely. To define further the effects of radiosurgery, we present the correlation among clinical, neuroimaging, and neuropathological data in three patients with different intracranial tumors who died between 2 and 39 weeks after radiosurgery. The target volumes in two patients with malignant tumors showed sharply demarcated coagulative necrosis. In the third patient, who had a benign acoustic nerve tumor, neuropathological examination found intratumoral hemorrhage and cyst formation, but no necrosis. Radiosurgery appears to cause acute necrosis of malignant cells, although its effectiveness may be limited by the infiltrative nature of some tumors. In benign tumors, necrosis following radiosurgery is relatively delayed, and may not be required for growth arrest.",Excluded
4391,"The relationship between cumulative lifetime ultraviolet radiation exposure, bone mineral density, falls risk and fractures in older adults. Data linking cumulative lifetime vitamin D status with skeletal outcomes are lacking. We show that increasing cumulative sun exposure was associated with higher bone mineral density in younger males and protective against fractures in females independent of current vitamin D. This supports the concept that cumulative sun exposure is an important contributor to skeletal health., INTRODUCTION: While low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are associated with increased fracture risk, this reflects only recent sun exposure. The Beagley-Gibson (BG) method utilises microtopographical skin changes to quantify cumulative lifetime ultraviolet radiation (sun) exposure. This study aimed to describe the relationship between BG grade, BMD, falls risk and fractures in older adults., METHODS: Eight hundred thirty-five community-dwelling adults aged 53-83 years had silicone casts from the dorsum of both hands graded by the BG method. BMD was measured using DXA and falls risk using the short form of the Physiological Profile Assessment. Vertebral deformities and symptomatic fractures were assessed by DXA and questionnaire, respectively., RESULTS: The relationship between BG grade, spine BMD and vertebral fracture varied depending upon sex. In females, increasing grade was associated with lower vertebral fracture prevalence (OR = 0.44/grade, p = 0.018) and fewer fractures (OR = 0.82/grade, p = 0.021), particularly major fractures (OR = 0.75/grade, p = 0.03). In males, increasing grade was associated with more DXA-detected vertebral deformities (RR = 1.28/grade, p = 0.001), but not symptomatic fractures. These relationships were independent of BMD, falls risk, smoking and current 25-hydroxyvitamin D. BG grade was not associated with falls risk. For BMD, there were interactions between BG grade and both age and sex and a positive trend with hip BMD in younger males., CONCLUSIONS: BG grade demonstrated beneficial associations with fracture outcomes in females and BMD in younger males independent of current 25-hydroxyvitamin D. These data support the concept that cumulative ultraviolet radiation exposure is an important determinant of skeletal health. The association with vertebral deformities in males may reflect outdoor physical trauma in younger life.",Excluded
4392,"Leg alignment does not affect tibial baseplate migration at 10 years following total knee arthroplasty. INTRODUCTION: Adequate fixation of implant components is an important goal for all arthroplasty procedures, and aseptic loosening is one of the leading causes of revision surgery in total knee arthroplasty [1]. Recent findings supporting a natural ""physiologic varus"" alignment in some patients have launched an ongoing debate in total knee arthroplasty with respect to the optimal position of the implant components [2]. The purpose of the present study was to examine the long-term fixation of a cemented titanium fixed bearing polished tibial baseplate, and examine the effect of alignment on implant migration. Method(s): Patients enrolled in a previous two-year prospective trial were recalled at ten years. While 35 patients were enrolled in the original study, 16 were available for follow-up at 10 years after excluding patients that were deceased (n = 9), unable to attend due to poor health (n = 9), or lost to follow-up (n = 1). All patients underwent total knee arthroplasty by one of three surgeons, receiving a posterior-stabilized CoCr-on-polyethylene implant from a single manufacturer. Each patient underwent radiostereometric analysis (RSA) imaging in a supine position using a conventional RSA protocol at 1 week, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 10 years post-operatively. Patients also received a three-foot standing x-ray from which leg alignment was measured at the 10-year follow-up. Migration of the tibial component in all planes, measured from RSA, was compared between the 2 year and 10-year follow-up visits. Comparisons of tibial component migration at 10 years between neutral (0 +/- 3 deg) and varus (>3 deg varus) aligned limbs were performed. Outcome scores including the Knee Society Score, WOMAC, SF-12, Forgotten Joint Score, and UCLA Activity Score were recorded. Result(s): At 10 years, the mean migrations of the tibial component were less than 0.1 mm and 0.1 deg in all planes relative to the post-operative RSA exam. There was no significant difference in tibial component migration between the 2 year and 10 year follow-ups, nor was there a significant difference in migration between the neutral and varus limb-aligned groups at 10 years. Tibial component subsidence at 10 years (Figure 1A) was -0.05 +/- 0.15 mm in the neutral group and -0.11 +/- 0.25 mm in the varus limb-aligned group (p = 0.81). The change of tibial component coronal plane alignment at 10 years (Figure IB) was 0.01 +/- 0.14 deg towards valgus in the neutral group and 0.13 +/- 0.38 deg towards varus in the varus limb-aligned group (p =0 .97). There was no correlation between any changes in the position of the tibial component with femoral alignment, tibial alignment, or overall limb alignment. WOMAC and Knee Society Scores were significantly improved (p < 0.0001) at the latest follow-up versus pre-operative scores. There was no significant correlation between implant migration and UCLA Activity Score (r2 = 0.02 to 0.18) or the Forgotten Joint Score (r = 0.01 to 0.34). Discussion(s): The implant was well fixed at 10 years, with no significant difference in migration from the previous two-year follow-up. The excellent long-term fixation of this implant supports the high survivorship for this implant system reported in the literature [3]. Femoral, tibial, and overall limb alignment had no effect on the migration of the tibial baseplate at 10 years follow-up. Both the neutral and varus aligned groups demonstrated minimal change in position of the tibial baseplate overtime. SIGNIFICANCE: The implant demonstrated excellent long-term fixation with no effect of alignment on migration in any plane. Based on the results of the present study, further assessment of patient-specific, physiologic alignment for total knee arthroplasty could be indicated.",Excluded
4393,"Sun exposure and pterygium of the eye: a dose-response curve. PURPOSE: To present a quantitative analysis of pterygium and ocular sun exposure, a dose-response curve, and a discussion of the health-promotion implications of the findings., METHODS: A hospital-based, case-control study was conducted in Perth, Western Australia. Case subjects had surgical removal of a pterygium; control subjects had an ear, nose, or throat procedure. A lifetime history of residence, sun exposure patterns, and use of hats, spectacles, and sunglasses was obtained at interview. Measures of potential sun exposure included latitude, daily sunshine hours, and daily global solar radiant energy. The most complex estimate of actual sun exposure was the daily ocular solar radiation dose, calculated from climatic data, time spent outdoors not under shade, and the use of hats and spectacles., RESULTS: There were strong positive associations between pterygium and measures of potential and actual sun exposure. Associations were as strong for whole-life measures as for those in any specific age range. Pterygium odds ratios increased with exposure level; the odds ratio was 4.0 (95% confidence interval, 1.6 to 10.9) for the highest quarter of the daily sun exposure. The strongest associations were seen for the estimated daily ocular solar radiation dose, with an odds ratio of 6.8 (95% confidence interval, 2.6 to 19.7) for the highest quarter of exposure., CONCLUSIONS: Pterygium is strongly related to ocular sun exposure, with little evidence that exposure during any particular period of life is more important than in other periods; the implication for prevention of pterygium is that ocular protection is beneficial at all ages.",Excluded

OBJECTIVES:: This multicenter registry followed up patients with early-stage breast cancer treated with breast-conserving surgery and electronic brachytherapy (EBT). This report provides 1- and 2-year updates to the initial publication. METHOD(S):: Patients were of age 50 years or more with invasive carcinoma or ductal carcinoma in situ, tumor size <=3 cm, and negative surgical margins. After lumpectomy, patients received EBT in 10 fractions over 5 days (34 Gy total). RESULT(S):: Of the 69 patients enrolled, 62 were evaluated at 1 year and 20 patients at 2 years after treatment. At 1 year, 28 (45.2%) patients reported adverse events that were possibly, probably, or definitely related to treatment. Most (90%) were grade 1: manageable and typical of radiation therapy. Four events were grade 2: induration/firmness (2), field contracture (1), and seroma (1). One event was grade 3: a draining fistula at the lumpectomy site due to residual effects of a breast infection at 1 month. No recurrences have been reported. Cosmetic ratings were excellent or good in 93.4% of patients at 1 year. Most patients (69%) were energetic most or all of the time. Most patients (69% to 98%) were not affected by individual symptoms of breast disease at 1 year. Generally patients who had an adverse event did not report the corresponding symptom on the quality-of-life questionnaire.

BACKGROUND: Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) is an innovative modality based on high precision planning and delivery. Cancer with bone metastases and oligometastases are associated with an intermediate or good prognosis. We assume that prolonged survival rates would be achieved if both the primary tumor and metastases are controlled by local treatment. Our purpose is to demonstrate, via a multicenter randomized phase III trial, that local treatment of metastatic sites with curative intent with SBRT associated of systemic standard of care treatment would improve the progression-free survival in patients with solid tumor (breast, prostate and non-small cell lung cancer) with up to 3 bone-only metastases compared to patients who received systemic standard of care treatment alone., METHODS: This is an open-labeled randomized superiority multicenter phase III trial. Patients with up to 3 bone-only metastases will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio.between Arm A (Experimental group): Standard care of treatment & SBRT to all bone metastases, and Arm B (Control group): standard care of treatment. For patients receiving SBRT, radiotherapy dose and fractionation depends on the site of the bone metastasis and the proximity to critical normal structures. This study aims to accrue a total of 196 patients within 4 years. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival at 1 year, and secondary endpoints include Bone progression-free survival; Local control; Cancer-specific survival; Overall survival; Toxicity; Quality of life; Pain score analysis, Cost-utility analysis; Cost-effectiveness analysis and Budget impact analysis., DISCUSSION: The expected benefit for the patient in the experimental arm is a longer expectancy of life without skeletal recurrence and the discomfort, pain and drastic reduction of mobility and handicap that the lack of local control of bone metastases eventually inflicts., TRIALS REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03143322 Registered on May 8th 2017.

4396,"EGFR-amplification plus gene expression profiling predicts response to combined radiotherapy with EGFR-inhibition: A preclinical trial in 10 HNSCC-tumour-xenograft models. Background and purpose Improvement of the results of radiotherapy by EGFR inhibitors is modest, suggesting significant intertumoural heterogeneity of response. To identify potential biomarkers, a preclinical trial was performed on ten different human squamous cell carcinoma xenografts of the head and neck (HNSCC) studying in vivo and ex vivo the effect of fractionated irradiation and EGFR inhibition. Local tumour control and tumour growth delay were correlated with potential biomarkers, e.g. EGFR gene amplification and radioresponse-associated gene expression profiles. Material and methods Local tumour control 120 days after end of irradiation was determined for fractionated radiotherapy alone (30 f, 6 weeks) or after simultaneous EGFR-inhibition with cetuximab. The EGFR gene amplification status was determined using FISH. Gene expression analyses were performed using an in-house gene panel. Results Six out of 10 investigated tumour models showed a significant increase in local tumour control for the combined treatment of cetuximab and fractionated radiotherapy compared to irradiation alone. For 3 of the 6 responding tumour models, an amplification of the EGFR gene could be demonstrated. Gene expression profiling of untreated tumours revealed significant differences between amplified and non-amplified tumours as well as between responder and non-responder tumours to combined radiotherapy and cetuximab. Conclusion The EGFR amplification status, in combination with gene expression profiling, may serve as a predictive biomarker for personalized interventional strategies regarding combined treatment of cetuximab and fractionated radiotherapy and should, as a next step, be clinically validated.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
4397,"UVB induces epidermal 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 activity in vivo. Detrimental consequences of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) in skin include photoageing, immunosuppression and photocarcinogenesis, processes also significantly regulated by local glucocorticoid (GC) availability. In man, the enzyme 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta-HSD1) generates the active GC cortisol from cortisone (or corticosterone from 11-dehydrocorticosterone in rodents). 11beta-HSD1 oxo-reductase activity requires the cofactor NADPH, generated by hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. We previously demonstrated increased 11beta-HSD1 levels in skin obtained from photoexposed versus photoprotected anatomical regions. However, the direct effect of UVR on 11beta-HSD1 expression remains to be elucidated. To investigate the cutaneous regulation of 11beta-HSD1 following UVR in vivo, the dorsal skin of female SKH1 mice was irradiated with 50, 100, 200 and 400 mJ/cm2 UVB. Measurement of transepidermal water loss, 11beta-HSD1 activity, mRNA/protein expression and histological studies was taken at 1, 3 and 7 days postexposure. 11beta-HSD1 and hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA expression peaked 1 day postexposure to 400 mJ/cm2 UVB before subsequently declining (days 3 and 7). Corresponding increases in 11beta-HSD1 protein and enzyme activity were observed 3 days postexposure coinciding with reduced GC receptor mRNA expression. Immunofluorescence studies revealed 11beta-HSD1 localization to hyperproliferative epidermal keratinocytes in UVB-exposed skin. 11beta-HSD1 expression and activity were also induced by 200 and 100 (but not 50) mJ/cm2 UVB and correlated with increased transepidermal water loss (indicative of barrier disruption). UVB-induced 11beta-HSD1 activation represents a novel mechanism that may contribute to the regulation of cutaneous responses to UVR exposure.Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

4398,"[X-ray-induced breaks in the X chromosomes in Drosophila lines of various radiosensitivities]. The frequency of X-ray induced X-chromosome breaks has been studied in females of the line rad (2) 201G1 hypersensitive to radiation and in females of the control line selected from the same population. The frequency of X-chromosome breaks was judged based on the frequency of X0 males occurrence. Synergism of the effects of X-rays (at doses 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 kr) and of hyperthermia (+37 degrees C, 5.5 hours) applied after irradiation served as an indirect evidence for the functioning of DNA repair systems. It is demonstrated that radiosensitivity of mature oocytes of the lines compared was equal and that hyperthermia applied after irradiation increased the latter effect in both lines. Young oocytes of the control line were radioresistant, and hyperthermia applied after irradiation enhanced its effect. Opposite to them, young oocytes of the rad line females were radiosensitive. They did not differ from mature oocytes in the frequency of X-chromosome losses. Synergism of the two factors (irradiation and hyperthermia) was not registered in young oocytes. On the basis of the results obtained, it may be concluded that radiosensitivity of young oocytes in the hypersensitive line is conditioned by the failure of DNA repair systems and that the rad (2) 201G1 gene may be considered, in relation to the genes controlling DNA repair, as a suppressor functioning selectively at a certain stage of oogenesis.",Excluded

Purpose: Evaluate the impact of hybrid operating room (HOR) guidance on the long-term clinical outcomes following fenestrated and branched endovascular repair (F-BEVAR) for complex aortic aneurysms. Material(s) and Method(s): Prospectively collected registry data were retrospectively analyzed to compare the procedural, short- and long-term outcomes of consecutive F-BEVAR performed from January 2010 to December 2014 under standard mobile C-arm versus hybrid room guidance in a high-volume aortic center. Result(s): A total of 262 consecutive patients, including 133 patients treated with a mobile C-arm equipped operating room and 129 with a HOR guidance, were enrolled in this study. Patient radiation exposure and contrast media volume were significantly reduced in the HOR group. Short-term clinical outcomes were improved despite higher case complexity in the HOR group, with no statistical significance. At a median follow-up of 63.3 months (Q1 33.4, Q3 75.9) in the C-arm group, and 44.9 months (Q1 25.1, Q3 53.5, p=0.53) in the HOR group, there was no statistically significant difference in terms of target vessel occlusion and limb occlusion. When the endograft involved 3 or more fenestrations and/or branches (complex F-BEVAR), graft instability (36% vs 25%, p=0.035), reintervention on target vessels (20% vs 11%, p=0.019) and total reintervention rates (24% vs 15%, p=0.032) were significantly reduced in the HOR group. The multivariable Cox regression analysis did not show statistically significant differences for long-term death and aortic-related death between the 2 groups.

Result(s): Seven patients with advanced MMST (T4aN0M0-T4bN2cM0) were included and were followed up for 23.8 +/- 10.2 months. Severe lid margin disease, dry eye, and neurotrophic keratopathy were universally observed. Other complications included cicatricial conjunctivitis (71%), corneal perforation (57%), limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD; 43%), glaucoma (29%), and superimposed candida keratitis (14%). Amniotic membrane transplant (AMT; 71%), tarsorrhaphy (43%), tectonic keratoplasty (29%), and evisceration (14%) were warranted. Intact corneal epithelium was observed in all patients and good corrected-distance visual acuity (>=20/60) was observed in 3 (43%) patients at final follow-up. Conclusion(s): High-dose EBRT for inoperable MMST can lead to a wide array of severe ocular/periocular complications. AMT serves as a potentially useful treatment modality to restore the ocular surface integrity after severe radiation keratopathy. We advocate active monitoring for any evolving ophthalmic complications during and after EBRT to enable timely intervention.Copyright © 2020 S. Karger AG, Basel.",Excluded
4402,"What can space radiation protection learn from radiation oncology?. Protection from cosmic radiation of crews of long-term space missions is now becoming an urgent requirement to allow a safe colonization of the moon and Mars. Epidemiology provides little help to quantify the risk, because the astronaut group is small and as yet mostly involved in low-Earth orbit mission, whilst the usual cohorts used for radiation protection on Earth (e.g. atomic bomb survivors) were exposed to a radiation quality substantially different from the energetic charged particle field found in space. However, there are over 260,000 patients treated with accelerated protons or heavier ions for different types of cancer, and this cohort may be useful for quantifying the effects of space-like radiation in humans. Space radiation protection and particle therapy research also share the same tools and devices, such as accelerators and detectors, as well as several research topics, from nuclear fragmentation cross sections to the radiobiology of densely ionizing radiation. The transfer of the information from the cancer radiotherapy field to space is manifestly complicated, yet the two field should strengthen their relationship and exchange methods and data.Copyright © 2021",Excluded
4403,"Different outdoor professions have different risks - a cross-sectional study comparing non-melanoma skin cancer risk among farmers, gardeners and mountain guides. Background: One of the main risk factors for non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), the most common cancer worldwide, is solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR). This has led to the recognition of NMSC as occupational disease for outdoor workers in several countries. However, outdoor professions are a very heterogeneous group with diverse daily activities and associated UVR exposure. Objective(s): To compare the prevalence of NMSC and associated risk behaviour in different outdoor professions. Method(s): Cross-sectional study among outdoor workers (farmers, gardeners, mountain guides) and indoor workers (office employees) as control group using a paper-based questionnaire on UVR exposure and protective behaviour followed by a skin examination by a dermatologist. Result(s): A total of 563 participants (46.9% women, 46.9 +/- 13.8 years) consisting of 348 outdoor workers (38.8% farmer, 35.3% gardener, 25.9% mountain guides) and 215 indoor workers were included in the study between March and September 2017. NMSC incl. actinic keratosis was diagnosed in 33.3% of mountain guides, 27.4% of farmers, 19.5% of gardeners and in 5.6% of indoor workers. Significant differences were seen between the outdoor professions with mountain guides at highest risk compared to farmers (OR = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.2-5.7). Substantial differences between the professions were also seen in skin cancer screening attendance rates (indoor worker 61.4%, mountain guides 57.8%, farmers 31.9%, gardeners 27.6%), daily UVR exposure during work and protective behaviour such as sunscreen use during work. Conclusion(s): Different outdoor professions have significant different risks for NMSC and show different risk behaviour. Tailoring prevention efforts to different professions based on their individual needs could be the key to lower the global burden of (occupational) NMSC.Copyright © 2018 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology",Excluded
4404,"Phase II clinical trial of preoperative combined chemoradiation for T3 and T4 resectable rectal cancer: preliminary results. PURPOSE: Although preoperative chemoradiation for high-risk rectal cancer may improve survival and local recurrence rate, its adverse effects are not well defined. This prospective study evaluated the use of preoperative chemoradiation for T3 and T4 resectable rectal cancer, with special emphasis on treatment morbidity, pathologic remission rate, quality of life, and anorectal function., METHODS: Forty-two patients (30 men, 12 women) were enrolled in the study. Median distance of the distal tumor margin from the anal verge was 6.5 cm. Preoperative staging was based on digital rectal examination, endorectal ultrasound, and computed tomography. None of the patients had distant metastases. All patients had 45 Gy (1.8 Gy/day in 25 fractions) over five weeks, plus 5-fluorouracil (350 mg/m(2)/day) and leucovorin (20 mg/m(2)/day) bolus on days 1 to 5 and 29 to 33. Quality of life was assessed with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 30-item quality-of-life questionnaire (QLQ-C30) and its colorectal cancer-specific module (QLQ-CR38) questionnaires. Objective anorectal function was assessed by anorectal manometry and pudendal nerve terminal motor latency. Surgery was performed 46 (range, 24-63) days after completion of adjuvant therapy., RESULTS: Nineteen patients (45 percent) had Grade 3 or 4 chemoradiation-induced toxic reactions. Four patients developed intercurrent distant metastases or intraperitoneal carcinomatosis at completion of chemoradiation. Thirty-eight patients underwent surgical resection: abdominoperineal resection, anterior resection, and Hartmann's procedure were performed in 55 percent, 39 percent (11 of 15 patients had a diverting stoma), and 5 percent, respectively. Major surgical complications occurred in 7 patients (18 percent) and included anastomotic leak (n = 1), pelvic abscess (n = 1), small-bowel obstruction (n = 3), and wound breakdown (n = 2). Final pathology was Stage 0 (no residual disease), I, II, and III in 6 (16 percent), 7 (18 percent), 9 (24 percent), and 16 (42 percent) patients, respectively. There was a deterioration, after chemoradiation and surgery, in the quality of life on all subscales assessed, with physical, role, and social function being most severely affected. The symptoms most adversely affected were micturition, defecation, and gastrointestinal problems. Body image and sexual enjoyment deteriorated in both men and women. Chemoradiation alone led to prolonged pudendal nerve terminal motor latency in 57 percent of 7 patients assessed., CONCLUSION: Preliminary results have identified defined costs with preoperative chemoradiation, which included treatment-induced toxicity, a high stoma rate, and adverse effects on quality of life and anorectal function.",Excluded
4405,"Evaluation of the effectiveness of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair at the Thong Nhat hospital in Vietnam. We evaluated the results of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Thirty cases of rotator cuff tear were treated by arthroscopic rotator cuff repair at the Thong Nhat hospital from 1/3/2012 to 30/6/2016. All patients were over 18 years old, had positive rotator cuff tear tests, and underwent X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging. The arthroscopic images showed rotator cuff tears, with indication for repair. The functional status of each patient was evaluated using the Constant-Murley Scale and the criteria of the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA). During postoperative rehabilitation, we applied Cohen's protocol. Seventeen patients were female and 13 were male. The median age was 54 years (21-83). Sixteen patients had partial thickness tears and 14 patients had full-thickness tears. Repair technique: Single-row in 13 patients, suture-bridge in 15 patients, transosseous-equivalent in two patients. Four patients with SLAP lesions were treated by debridement labrum for type I, and labral repair for more serious lesions. Five patients with long head biceps tendon rupture were treated with tenodesis. After surgery, 100% of patients were subjected to fluid extravasation through the shoulder joint, but did not have any compartment syndrome; all incisions healed good without infection or neurapraxia. The mean UCLA score was 32.4 (14 patients had excellent results, 14 good, and two fair). The mean Constant score was 38.5; the mean postoperative Constant score was 88.77 (p = 0.001). Among the patients, 90% achieved 80% function compared to a normal shoulder. All patients gave their consent to the study and were prepared for the full course of treatment and arthroscopic surgery. Repair of the rotator cuff was for some participants the only effective treatment and a way to restore the shoulder. Postoperative reconstruction of the rotator cuff of the shoulder resulted in a significant improvement in the indicators of the functional state of the shoulder joint.Copyright © FUNPEC-RP.",Excluded
4406,"Tolerance of half-body irradiation as systemic therapy for patients with locally advanced breast cancer. Background. Locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) is one of the main causes of cancer death among women in Bulgaria. In 1988, when this study started, there was still controversy about the role of chemotherapy in controlling systemic disease. There were encouraging results from the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 82-06 study suggesting that half-body irradiation (HBI) should be used earlier in the disease course to prevent the development of metastases. There were many patients with LABC requiring treatment, but there was a problem with obtaining the drugs needed; they were expensive and not consistently available. Procedure. Taking into account the medical contraindications to chemotherapy treatment, its toxicity, and the possibility of chemoresistance, we initiated this study to look at the effects of HBI given as two fractions of 4 Gy to the upper and then lower parts of the body, after surgery and before local radiotherapy. Results. The acute tolerance of this regimen in 36 patients with LABC was as good as it was in 4 additional LABC patients with M1 disease, and hematologic recovery was satisfactory. Conclusions. We conclude that systemic treatment with HBI is tolerable. It therefore may be a convenient and cost-effective treatment for LABC, although better treatments are still needed.",Excluded
4407,"Central liver toxicity after SBRT: An expanded analysis and predictive nomogram. Purpose To further explore the correlation of central biliary tract (cHBT) radiation doses with hepatobiliary toxicity (HBT) after stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in a larger patient dataset. Methods We reviewed the treatment and outcomes of all patients who received SBRT for primary liver cancer (PLC) and metastatic liver tumors between July 2004 and November 2015 at our institution. The cHBT was defined as isotropic expansions (5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 mm) from the portal vein (PV). Doses were converted to biologically effective doses by using the standard linear quadratic model with alpha/beta of 10 (BED10). HBT was graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.03. Results Median follow-up was 13 months. Out of the 130 patients with complete follow-up records analyzed, 60 (46.1%) had liver metastases, 40 (30.8%) had hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 26 (20%) had cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) and 4 (3.1%) patients other PLC histologies. Thirty-three (25.4%) grade 2+ and 28 (21.5%) grade 3+ HBT were observed. Grade 3+ HBT was seen in 13 patients (50%) with CCA, 7 patients (17.5%) with HCC and 7 (11.7%) patients with liver metastases. SBRT doses to the cHBT were highly associated with HBT, but only for PLC patients when analyzed by histological subtype. The 15 mm expansion from the PV (cHBT15) proved to be an appropriate surrogate for the cHBT. The strongest cHBT15 dose predictors for G3+ HBT for PLC were the VBED1040 37 cc (p < 0.0001) and the VBED1030 45 cc (p < 0.0001). Conclusion SBRT doses to the cHBT are associated with occurrence of HBT only in PLC patients. Limiting the dose to the cHBT to VBED1040 < 37 cc and VBED1030 < 45 cc when treating PLC patients with SBRT may reduce the risk of HBT.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd",Excluded
4408,"Use of magnetic resonance venography for inferior petrosal sinus sampling. BACKGROUND: Inferior petrosal sinus (IPS) sampling (IPSS) is a transvenous interventional procedure performed to diagnose Cushing's disease. The reported IPSS failure rate is approximately 10% because IPS catheter delivery is conducted blindly and is challenging because of IPS anatomical variations. This study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of preprocedural magnetic resonance venography (MRV) for assessing IPS access routes before IPSS., METHODS: Nineteen consecutive patients who underwent IPSS at a single university hospital in Japan were retrospectively studied. A preprocedural MRV protocol optimized to visualize the IPS before IPSS was established and utilized in the eight most recent cases. An IPSS procedure was considered successful when bilateral IPS catheterization was accomplished. Patient demographics, IPSS success rate, and radiation dose required during IPSS were compared between two groups: MRV group (N = 8) and no-MRV group (N = 11) before IPSS., RESULTS: There were no significant differences in age, sex, and IPSS success rates between the groups. The average radiation dose was 663.6 +/- 246.8 (SD) mGy and 981.7 +/- 389.5 (SD) mGy in the MRV group and no-MRV group, respectively. Thus, there was a significant reduction in radiation exposure in the MRV group (p = 0.044). Catheterization of the left IPS was unsuccessful in only one patient in the MRV group owing to IPS hypoplasty, as found on the MRV., CONCLUSIONS: Hypoplastic IPSs occur in patients and can complicate IPSS. Preprocedural MRV assessment is useful for understanding venous anatomy and preventing unnecessary intravenous catheter manipulation during IPSS, which involves blind manipulation around the IPS.",Excluded
4409,"Comparison of safety and effectiveness between the right and left radial artery approach in percutaneous coronary intervention. Introduction and objectives: There is a paucity of data comparing the left radial approach (LRA) and right radial approach (RRA) for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in all-comers populations and performed by operators with different experience levels. Thus, we sought to compare the safety and clinical outcomes of the RRA and LRA during PCI in ""real-world"" patients with either stable angina or acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Method(s): To overcome the possible impact of the nonrandomized design, a propensity score was calculated to compare the 2 radial approaches. The study group comprised 18 716 matched pairs with stable angina and 46 241 with ACS treated with PCI and stent implantation between 2014 and 2017 in 151 tertiary invasive cardiology centers in Poland (the ORPKI Polish National Registry). Result(s): The rates of death and periprocedural complications were similar for the RRA and LRA in stable angina patients. A higher radiation dose was observed with PCI via the LRA in both clinical presentations (stable angina: 1067.0 +/- 947.1 mGy vs 1007.4 +/- 983.5 mGy, P = .001; ACS: 1212.7 +/- 1005.5 mGy vs 1053.5 +/- 1029.7 mGy, P = .001). More contrast was used in LRA procedures but only in ACS patients (174.2 +/- 75.4 mL vs 167.2 +/- 72.1 mL, P = .001). Furthermore, periprocedural complications such as coronary artery dissection (0.16% vs 0.09%, P = .008), no-reflow phenomenon (0.65% vs 0.49%, P = .005), and puncture site bleeding (0.09% vs 0.05%, P = .04) were more frequently observed with the LRA in ACS patients. There was no difference in mortality between the 2 groups (P = .90). Conclusion(s): Our finding of poorer outcomes with the LRA may be related to lower operator experience with this approach. While both the LRA and RRA are safe in the setting of stable angina, the LRA was associated with a higher rate of periprocedural complications during PCI in ACS patients.

UNLABELLED: The role of cross-cultural factors in long-duration international space missions was examined during an isolation study that simulated many of the conditions aboard the International Space Station., METHODS: Interactions involving two heterogeneous crews and one homogeneous crew staying in isolation from 110 to 240 days were studied. Data consisted of post-isolation interviews with crewmembers, ground support personnel and management, observational data, and public statements by crewmembers. Data was analyzed using the techniques of linguistic anthropology and ethnography., RESULTS: Sub-cultural (organizational and professional) differences played a larger role than national differences in causing misunderstandings in this study. Conversely, some misunderstandings and conflicts were escalated by participants falsely assuming cultural differences or similarities. Comparison between the two heterogeneous crews showed the importance of training, personality factors, and commander and language skills in preventing and alleviating cultural misunderstandings., CONCLUSION: The study revealed a number of ways that cultural differences, real as well as assumed, can play a role and interact with other, non-cultural, factors in causing and/or precipitating conflict situations. It is postulated that such difficulties can be avoided by selecting culturally adaptive crewmembers and by cross-cultural and language training. Also the crew composition and role of commander were found to be important in mitigating conflict situations. Copyright c2002 Lister Science.",Excluded

4416,"Stress echocardiography in women. The diagnosis of coronary heart disease in women has been thought to be more difficult than in men, owing to the overall lower prevalence and severity of disease in women, as well as more subtle clinical presentations. Exercise electrocardiography is associated with a high rate of false-positive results. In contrast, exercise and pharmacologic stress echocardiography have been shown to have high sensitivity, specificity, and prognostic value in women, comparable to that obtained in a male population. Although exercise thallium provides high diagnostic accuracy, due to its cost, availability, and radiation exposure, it may not be the ideal initial test in women. Thus, compared with other modalities, the advantages of stress echocardiography include its lower cost, availability, and high diagnostic accuracy. In the evaluation of women with chest pain, the initial step should involve clinical stratification into low, moderate, or high-probability groups based on symptoms, age, and cardiovascular risk factors. In women with atypical chest pain and a low probability of coronary heart disease, further testing should be avoided because any positive result is likely to be falsely positive. In those women with a moderate likelihood of disease, the most efficient and cost-effective strategy includes stress echocardiography as the initial test. This approach avoids the high rate of false-positive results with subsequent unnecessary angiography generated by exercise electrocardiography, as well as minimizing false-negative results, which would lead to delays and potential increase in morbidity and mortality from untreated coronary heart disease. The optimal strategy for women at high clinical risk may be either exercise echocardiography or cardiac catheterization as the initial test. Although the diagnosis of CAD in women is different than in men, it is not necessarily more difficult. Astute clinical evaluation, in conjunction with judicious use of diagnostic testing, yields excellent results.",Excluded

Objective: Thyroid cancer patients treated with I-131 are potential source of radiation exposure to relatives who are knowingly and willingly exposed to ionizing radiation as a result of providing comfort to patients undergoing I-131 therapy. This study aims to determine radiation dose received by relatives who care for non self-supporting I-131 patients at Siriraj Hospital. Material(s) and Method(s): Twenty caregivers of 20 patients underwent I-131 therapy for thyroid cancer with a standard protocol were given specific instructions with regard to radiation safety and provided with electronic digital dosimeter to continuously measure radiation dose received on daily basis, three days in the hospital. On the day patient is released, thyroid uptake estimates were performed to assess internal radiation dose received by caregivers. Result(s): The 3-day accumulative doses to caregivers to patients receiving 150 mCi (n = 11) and 200 mCi (n = 9) of I-131 ranged from 37 to 333 muSv and 176 to 1,920 muSv respectively depending on the level of supports required. Thyroid uptake estimates in all caregivers were undetectable. Dosimeter indicated a maximum whole-body dose of 1.92 mSv was more than the public dose limit of 1 mSv but within the dose constraint of 5 mSv for caregivers. Discussion(s): Radiation dose to caregivers of a non self-supporting hospitalized patient undergoing I-131 therapy were well below the limits recommended by the ICRP. The patients can be comforted with confidence that dose to caregivers will be less than the limit.

The Euratom directive 97/43 recommends the use of patient dose surveys in diagnostic radiology and the establishment of diagnostic reference dose levels (DRLs). The aims of this study are to perform measurements of the entrance surface dose (ESD) during diagnostic digital subtraction angiography (DSA) of the renal and carotid arteries using thermoluminescence dosemeters (TLDs), extraction of local DRLs, and calculation of the effective dose. Dose measurement for the staff was also performed. Dose measurements were performed on 48 participating patients.

The effective dose of the radiologist was calculated to be 0.022 mSv and 0.023 mSv per procedure for renal and carotid DSA respectively, when wearing a protective apron and using a movable ceiling mounted shield. Radiation dose variation depends on the physical characteristics of the patient, on the procedure preferences by radiologists and on the difficulties in conducting the procedures.

A dose-response analysis of chromosomal aberrations was performed in male progeny of gamma-irradiated males in the flour moth, Ephestia kuehniella. For comparison, several female progeny from each dose level were examined. Aberrations were detected on microspread preparations of pachytene nuclei in the electron microscope and classified according to pairing configurations of synaptonemal complexes (SCs). Fragmentation and various translocations were the most numerous aberrations, whereas interstitial deletion and inversion were rare. At 100 Gy, relatively simple multiple translocations were found. Multiple translocations showing complicated configurations occurred at 150 and 200 Gy, and their number increased with the dose. In males, the mean number of chromosomal breaks resulting in aberrations linearly increased with the dose from 8.4 to 16.2 per nucleus. In females, this value achieved a maximum of 11.2 breaks/nucleus at 200 Gy. Three factors were suggested to contribute to the reported higher level of F1 sterility in males than females: (i) survival of males with high numbers of breaks, (ii) crossing-over in spermatogenesis but not in the achiasmatic oogenesis, and (iii) a higher impact of induced changes on the fertility of males than females. It was concluded that translocations are most responsible for the production of unbalanced gametes resulting in sterility of F1 moths. However, F1 sterility predicted according to the observed frequency of aberrations was much higher than the actual sterility reported earlier. This suggests a regulation factor which corrects the predicted unbalanced state towards balanced segregation of translocated chromosomes.",Excluded
4422,"Models to study gravitational biology of Mammalian reproduction. Mammalian reproduction evolved within Earth's 1-g gravitational field. As we move closer to the reality of space habitation, there is growing scientific interest in how different gravitational states influence reproduction in mammals. Habitation of space and extended spaceflight missions require prolonged exposure to decreased gravity (hypogravity, i.e., weightlessness). Lift-off and re-entry of the spacecraft are associated with exposure to increased gravity (hypergravity). Existing data suggest that spaceflight is associated with a constellation of changes in reproductive physiology and function. However, limited spaceflight opportunities and confounding effects of various nongravitational factors associated with spaceflight (i.e., radiation, stress) have led to the development of ground-based models for studying the effects of altered gravity on biological systems. Human bed rest and rodent hindlimb unloading paradigms are used to study exposure to hypogravity. Centrifugation is used to study hypergravity. Here, we review the results of spaceflight and ground-based models of altered gravity on reproductive physiology. Studies utilizing ground-based models that simulate hyper- and hypogravity have produced reproductive results similar to those obtained from spaceflight and are contributing new information on biological responses across the gravity continuum, thereby confirming the appropriateness of these models for studying reproductive responses to altered gravity and the underlying mechanisms of these responses. Together, these unique tools are yielding new insights into the gravitational biology of reproduction in mammals.",Excluded
4423,"Prognostic factors in metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Introduction: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma has the highest metastatic potential of all head and neck cancers. The survival time of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma has improved significantly in the last decades due to the use of combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, as well as advances in radiotherapy techniques. However, appropriately 30% of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma suffer a poor prognosis, mainly due to distant metastasis. Objective(s): The study aimed to identify the survival and prognostic factors in metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Method(s): A retrospective analysis was conducted in patients treated for synchronous metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma or metachronous metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma for 14 years (2003-2016). Overall survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test for the whole population and both groups of patients. Multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox model; p-values < 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance. Result(s): One hundred and twelve patients with metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma were included (51 patients with metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and 61 patients with metachronous metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma). In the whole population, the median overall survival was 10 months (1-156 months). In the multivariate analysis, female gender, poor performance status (WHO > 1) and metachronous metastasis were independent prognostic factors. In the metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients, the median overall survival was 13 months (1-156 months). In multivariate analysis, independent prognostic factors were non-oligometastatic disease, severe (G3-G4) chemotherapy toxicity and the lack of nasopharyngeal and metastatic site irradiation. In the metachronous metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients, the median overall survival was 7 months (1-41 months). In multivariate analysis, the poor performance status (WHO > 1) was an independent metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma prognostic factor. Conclusion(s): Oligometastatic patients with synchronous metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma had better survival. The locoregional treatment of primitive nasopharyngeal carcinoma improved survival in patients with metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma who responded to induction chemotherapy. Local irradiation of metastatic sites improved survival of metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients.

Purpose/Objective(s): Radiation therapy (RT) dose calculations for treating scalp angiosarcoma must consider heterogeneous regions with multilayered complex densities of the bolus, scalp, skull, cerebral fluid, and brain. As a model-based algorithm does not accurately consider these various densities, it may not provide a sufficiently precise dose calculation for scalp angiosarcoma, resulting in the need for a more accurate dose calculation algorithm. We evaluated the advantages of volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) over intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in terms of plan quality, delivery time, and monitor unit (MU) using the x-ray Voxel Monte Carlo (XVMC) algorithm. Materials/Methods: Four patients were selected for this planning study. Clinical target volume (CTV) was defined as gross tumor volume (GTV) and the scalp, plus a margin of 30 mm added to the GTV along the scalp surface. Planning target volume (PTV) was determined by adding a 2-mm isotropic margin to the CTV. The median PTV was 465.9 cm3 (range 215.0-932.8 cm3). Three different coplanar treatment plans were created for each case, comprising a 2-arc VMAT plan as well as 5-field and 9-field step and shoot IMRT plans using a photon energy of 6 MV. Dose calculation was performed using the XVMC algorithm. Total RT dose of 60 Gy was prescribed to the PTV in 30 fractions. The homogeneity index (HI) of the PTV, conformity index (CI) of the PTV, organ at risk (OAR) doses, delivery time, and MU were calculated and compared. Result(s): VMAT, 5-field, and 9-field IMRT plans showed the following features, respectively: median values of HI, 0.14, 0.17, and 0.15; CIs100%, 0.64, 0.61, and 0.64; CIs98%, 0.72, 0.67, and 0.72; and CIs95%, 0.75, 0.68, and 0.72. All plans satisfied the dose constraints of OARs, except for the left lens in 2 cases with the 5-field IMRT plan. The median delivery time for VMAT, 5-field, and 9-field IMRT plans were 192, 659, and 885 s, respectively. Delivery time for VMAT was significantly shorter than that for the other 2 plans (P<0.01). The median MUs of the VMAT, 5-field, and 9-field IMRT plans were 1093, 747, and 912, respectively, with no significant differences. Conclusion(s): The VMAT provided plan quality comparable to 9-field IMRT and was superior to 5-field IMRT in terms of doses to both the PTV and OARs. Additionally, VMAT provided a shorter delivery time than IMRT without a significant increase in MU. Therefore, we recommend VMAT as a sophisticated irradiation technique for the treatment of scalp angiosarcoma.",Excluded
4426,"Preclinical and first-in-man studies of [11C]CB184 for imaging the 18-kDa translocator protein by positron emission tomography. Objective: We performed preclinical and first-in-man clinical positron emission tomography (PET) studies in human brain using N,N-di-n-propyl-2-[2-(4-[11C]methoxyphenyl)-6,8-dichloroimidazol[1,2-a]pyridine-3-yl]acetamide ([11C]CB184) to image the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO), which is overexpressed in activated microglia in neuroinflammatory conditions. Method(s): In vitro selectivity of CB184 was characterized. The radiation absorbed dose by [11C]CB184 in humans was calculated from murine distribution data. Acute toxicity of CB184 hydrochloride in rats at a dose of 5.81 mg/kg body weight, which is >10,000-fold higher than the clinical equivalent dose of [11C]CB184, was evaluated. Acute toxicity of [11C]CB184 injection of a 400-fold dose to administer a postulated dose of 740 MBq [11C]CB184 was also evaluated after the decay-out of 11C. The mutagenicity of CB184 was studied with a reverse mutation test (Ames test). The pharmacological effect of CB184 injection in mice was studied with an open field test. The first PET imaging of TSPO with [11C]CB184 in a normal human volunteer was performed. Result(s): A suitable preparation method for [11C]CB184 injection was established. CB184 showed low activity in a 28-standard receptor binding profile. The radiation absorbed dose by [11C]CB184 in humans was sufficiently low for clinical use, and no acute toxicity of CB184 or [11C]CB184 injection was found. No mutagenicity or apparent effect on locomotor activity or anxiety status was observed for CB184. We safely performed brain imaging with PET following administration of [11C]CB184 in a normal human volunteer. A 90-min dynamic scan showed rapid initial uptake of radioactivity in the brain followed by prompt clearance. [11C]CB184 was homogeneously distributed in the gray matter. The total distribution volume of [11C]CB184 was highest in the thalamus followed by the cerebellar cortex and elsewhere. Although regional differences were small, the observed [11C]CB184 binding pattern was consistent with the TSPO distribution in normal human brain. Peripherally, [11C]CB184 was metabolized in humans: 30 % of the radioactivity in plasma was detected as the unchanged form after 60 min. Conclusion(s): [11C]CB184 is suitable for imaging TSPO in human brain and provides an acceptable radiation dose. Pharmacological safety was noted at the dose required for PET imaging.Copyright © 2016, The Japanese Society of Nuclear Medicine.",Excluded

Aim: to appraise the role of volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in the neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy management of advanced medium and distal oesophageal cancer in terms of toxicity and response to treatment. Patients and Methods: Thirty patients were treated according to the neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery versus surgery-alone trial scheme with VMAT radiation therapy. Patients presented mainly T3-T4 stage (80%) and N1-2 (96.6%) disease. The chemotherapy scheme consisted of 3-5 cycles, while a radiotherapy course of 41.4 Gy in 23 fractions was administered to all patients. Result(s): The median age of patients was 65 years, and there was a predominance of males (80%), smokers or ex-smokers (90%) and modest alcohol habit (80% negative). Primary tumor localisation was in the medium and distal third of the oesophagus in 57% of the cases, the rest being in the gastro-oesophageal junction. Modest toxicity profiles were observed, with limited incidence of grade 2-3 events. Partial or complete response was observed in more than 90% of the cases (radiological/metabolic) and was confirmed after surgical intervention (67% partial or complete and 27% stable response).

The potential advantages of preoperative chemoradiotherapy in rectal cancer include pathological downstaging and reduced toxicity. Capecitabine and fluorouracil showed similar efficacy in preoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer. Capecitabine in combination with oxaliplatin demonstrated efficacy for advanced colorectal cancer treatment. Methods. We conducted a phase 2 study to determine the efficacy and safety of preoperative concurrent CAPOX radiotherapy in Thai patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. Capecitabine 1650mg/m2 per day was taken on days 1-14 and 22-35 of radiotherapy. Oxaliplatin 50mg/m2 was administered on days 1, 8, 22, and 29 of radiotherapy. The radiation dose to the pelvis was 45 Gy/25 fractions with a boost dose of 5.4 Gy/3 fractions. The total dose to the tumour bed was 50.4 Gy/28 fractions. Clinical response was evaluated by MRI prior to surgery. Patients underwent surgery 4-6 weeks after completion of radiotherapy. The endpoints of this study were clinical response, pathological response, and toxicities. Results. Twenty patients have been enrolled. Median age was 59.5 years (range 37-72). Male:female ratio was 1.22:1. All patients had clinical T3 N positive disease except one who hadT4 disease. After receiving concurrent chemoradiotherapy, severe toxicities (diarrhoea, fatigue, anorexia,and neuropathy) were found in four patients (20%). One patient refused surgery after preoperative treatment. Response rate was evaluated in 18 patients. Clinical response rate was 83.4% (cCR 55.6%). Pathological response rate was 70.6% (pCR 5.9%). Eleven patients had microscopic residual disease. Most patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. Two patients developed recurrent disease and finally died. Discussion.

4429,"Exercise in space: human skeletal muscle after 6 months aboard the International Space Station. The aim of this investigation was to document the exercise program used by crewmembers (n = 9; 45 +/- 2 yr) while aboard the International Space Station (ISS) for 6 mo and examine its effectiveness for preserving calf muscle characteristics. Before and after spaceflight, we assessed calf muscle volume (MRI), static and dynamic calf muscle performance, and muscle fiber types (gastrocnemius and soleus). While on the ISS, crewmembers had access to a running treadmill, cycle ergometer, and resistance exercise device. The exercise regimen varied among the crewmembers with aerobic exercise performed approximately 5 h/wk at a moderate intensity and resistance exercise performed 3-6 days/wk incorporating multiple lower leg exercises. Calf muscle volume decreased (P < 0.05) 13 +/- 2% with greater (P < 0.05) atrophy of the soleus (-15 +/- 2%) compared with the gastrocnemius (-10 +/- 2%). Peak power was 32% lower (P < 0.05) after spaceflight. Force-velocity characteristics were reduced (P < 0.05) -20 to -29% across the velocity spectrum. There was a 12-17% shift in myosin heavy chain (MHC) phenotype of the gastrocnemius and soleus with a decrease (P < 0.05) in MHC I fibers and a redistribution among the faster phenotypes. These data show a reduction in calf muscle mass and performance along with a slow-to-fast fiber type transition in the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles, which are all qualities associated with unloading in humans. Future long-duration space missions should modify the current ISS exercise prescription and/or hardware to better preserve human skeletal muscle mass and function, thereby reducing the risk imposed to crewmembers.",Excluded
4430,"Site-specific cancer incidence and mortality after cerebral angiography with radioactive thorotrast. Few opportunities exist to evaluate the carcinogenic effects of long-term internal exposure to alpha-particle-emitting radionuclides. Patients injected with Thorotrast (thorium-232) during radiographic procedures, beginning in the 1930s, provide one such valuable opportunity. We evaluated site-specific cancer incidence and mortality among an international cohort of 3,042 patients injected during cerebral angiography with either Thorotrast (n = 1,650) or a nonradioactive agent (n = 1,392) and who survived 2 or more years. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) for Thorotrast and comparison patients (Denmark and Sweden) were estimated and relative risks (RR), adjusted for population, age and sex, were generated with multivariate statistical modeling. For U.S. patients, comparable procedures were used to estimate standardized mortality ratios (SMR) and RR, representing the first evaluation of long-term, site-specific cancer mortality in this group. Compared with nonexposed patients, significantly increased risks in Thorotrast patients were observed for all incident cancers combined (RR = 3.4, 95% CI 2.9-4.1, n = 480, Denmark and Sweden) and for cancer mortality (RR = 4.0, 95% CI 2.5-6.7, n = 114, U.S.). Approximately 335 incident cancers were above expectation, with large excesses seen for cancers of the liver, bile ducts and gallbladder (55% or 185 excess cancers) and leukemias other than CLL (8% or 26 excess cancers). The RR of all incident cancers increased with time since angiography (P < 0.001) and was threefold at 40 or more years; significant excesses (SIR = 4.0) persisted for 50 years. Increasing cumulative dose of radiation was associated with an increasing risk of all incident cancers taken together and with cancers of the liver, gallbladder, and peritoneum and other digestive sites; similar findings were observed for U.S. cancer mortality. A marginally significant dose response was observed for the incidence of pancreas cancer (P = 0.05) but not for lung cancer. Our study confirms the relationship between Thorotrast and increased cancer incidence at sites of Thorotrast deposition and suggests a possible association with pancreas cancer. After injection with >20 ml Thorotrast, the cumulative excess risk of cancer incidence remained elevated for up to 50 years and approached 97%. Caution is needed in interpreting the excess risks observed for site-specific cancers, however, because of the potential bias associated with the selection of cohort participants, noncomparability with respect to the internal or external comparison groups, and confounding by indication. Nonetheless, the substantial risks associated with liver cancer and leukemia indicate that unique and prolonged exposure to alpha-particle-emitting Thorotrast increased carcinogenic risks.",Excluded

4432,"The influence of radiotherapy techniques on the plan quality and on the risk of secondary tumors in patients with pituitary adenoma. Background: This planning study compares different radiotherapy techniques for patients with pituitary adenoma, including flatness filter free mode (FFF), concerning plan quality and secondary malignancies for potentially young patients. The flatness filter has been described as main source of photon scatter. Material(s) and Method(s): Eleven patients with pituitary adenoma were included. An Elekta SynergyTM linac was used in the treatment planning system Oncentra and for the measurements. 3D plans, IMRT, and VMAT plans and non-coplanar varieties were considered. The plan quality was evaluated regarding homogeneity, conformity, delivery time and dose to the organs at risk. The secondary malignancy risk was calculated from dose volume data and from measured dose to the periphery using different models for carcinoma and sarcoma risk. Result(s): The homogeneity and conformity were nearly unchanged with and without flattening filter, neither was the delivery time found substantively different. VMAT plans were more homogenous, conformal and faster in delivery than IMRT plans. The secondary cancer risk was reduced with FFF both in the treated region and in the periphery. VMAT plans resulted in a higher secondary brain cancer risk than IMRT plans, but the risk for secondary peripheral cancer was reduced. Secondary sarcoma risk plays a minor role. No advantage was found for non-coplanar techniques. The FFF delivery times were not shortened due to additional monitor units needed and technical limitations. The risk for secondary brain cancer seems to depend on the irradiated volume. Secondary sarcoma risk is much smaller than carcinoma risk in accordance to the results of the atomic bomb survivors. The reduction of the peripheral dose and resulting secondary malignancy risk for FFF is statistically significant. However, it is negligible in comparison to the risk in the treated region. Conclusion(s): Treatments with FFF can reduce secondary malignancy risk while retaining similar quality as with flattening filter and should be preferred. VMAT plans show the best plan quality combined with lowest peripheral secondary malignancy risk, but highest level of second brain cancer risk. Taking this into account VMAT FFF seems the most advantageous technique for the treatment of pituitary adenomas with the given equipment.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).",Excluded

PURPOSE: To determine the long-term effects of stereotactic fractionated external beam radiation on eyes treated for neovascular age-related macular degeneration., METHODS: A retrospective review of all eyes treated with stereotactic fractionated external beam radiation (20-40 Gy, 2-Gy fractions) between 1997 and 2000 was performed to identify eyes with >= 2-year follow-up for analysis. A subset was imaged prospectively using a high-resolution Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography., RESULTS: Among 94 eyes treated, 33 eyes (32 subjects) had >= 2-year follow-up information (mean follow-up, 6.2 years; range, 2-10 years). Final visual acuity ranged from 20/50 to no light perception. Final macular findings included central geographic atrophy (49%), disciform scar (30%), and active choroidal neovascular membrane (9%). Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography images of three eyes with geographic atrophy revealed photoreceptor layer loss within areas of geographic atrophy with intact retinal morphology in areas of radiation exposure outside geographic atrophy. Radiation retinopathy was suspected in 18% and confirmed by fluorescein angiography in 15%, ranging from mild to neovascular glaucoma/phthisis bulbi (2 eyes). Mean time from stereotactic fractionated external beam radiation to development of radiation retinopathy was 5.4 years (range, 1-10 years)., CONCLUSION: A moderate rate of delayed radiation retinopathy was noted in eyes with neovascular age-related macular degeneration treated with stereotactic fractionated external beam radiation.

Cumulative long-term exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation promotes premature skin aging characterized by wrinkle formation and reduced skin elasticity. In this study, we assessed whether microfat transfer could improve dermal and subcutaneous tissue thickness loss associated with photoaging. Twenty-one patients affected by facial photoaging (photodamage grade II-IV; age range 35-62 years; 19 females, 2 males; all of Caucasian origin) were treated using minimally invasive autologous dermal white fat transfer harvested with a recently designed microcannula. The results were determined by clinical assessment and patient self-evaluation and quantified by the Antera 3D dermal digital device for noninvasive, objective, reliable, and accurate assessment of facial skin texture, color, and wrinkle characteristics. Compared with the pretreatment condition, the increment in soft tissue volume and improvement in skin quality and texture were assessed by a dermatologist after treatment. In addition, instrumental evaluation by digital skin profilometry of the treated areas revealed a 41% reduction in average wrinkle depth (7.29 +/- 1.04 x 10-2 mm pretreatment vs. 4.31 +/- 1.16 x 10-2 mm at 90 days posttreatment; p < 0.001), improved skin texture, more homogeneous and uniform skin color, and declined facial hemoglobin and melanin concentrations. The majority of patients (above 90%) reported improvements in self-perception. No significant complications were reported throughout the study. In conclusion, by using digital profilometry analysis as an objective and innovative tool to determine the outcome of treatment, we demonstrated that autologous microfat transfer is a safe and well-tolerated procedure with measurable beneficial effects on facial skin aging.Copyright © 2017 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons",Excluded
4435,"Electromagnetic guided confirmation of nasogastric tube insertion: Ehancing patient safety. Introduction: Opinions differ regarding the optimal method of confirmation of nasogastric (NG) or orogastric (OG) tube insertion. Auscultation, pH analysis, character of the NG aspirate, or the radiograph has been suggested to confirm placement with the radiograph remaining as the gold standard. Hypothesis: The purpose of this study is to compare electromagnetic guidance/confirmation of NG or OG tube placement to that of radiographic confirmation. Method(s): Medical surgical intensive care unit patients requiring NG or OG tube insertions were eligible for the study. The NG or OG tubes were inserted in the standard fashion by the bedside nurse. Prior to the insertion, a guide wire with an electromagnetic tip was inserted through the tube and secured. Care was taken to assure the tip did not protrude from the NG tube. A receiver for the electromagnetic signal was placed on the patient in the subxiphoid region. The guide wire was attached to a bedside unit that energized the guide wire tip and tracked the placement on a display. Following the NG or OG insertion, an abdominal radiograph was obtained. Result(s): Twenty-seven patients, 16 male and 11 female, with an average age of 69 +/- 14 years were enrolled. Two patients were excluded due one guide wire not energizing and one patient intolerant to the NG placement. Of the 25 patients receiving an NG or OG tube, the electromagnetic guided placement correlated with the abdominal radiograph 100%. Real time tracking of one of the NG tubes avoided placement of an NG tube into the airway. Conclusion(s): Electromagnetic guided NG or OG tube insertion correctly tracked 100% of the tubes compared to the abdominal radiograph results. These preliminary data suggest that electromagnetic guided placement of NG or OG tubes have the potential to replace the abdominal radiograph for confirmation thus enhancing patient safety by avoiding radiation exposure and inadvertent airway placement.",Excluded

Early (within 6 months) and late radiological injuries were evaluated according to Ikezoe and Koening, respectively. The correlation between CT findings and patient characteristics was evaluated., RESULTS: Radiographic injury in periods 1 and 2 was: (1) diffuse consolidation 3 and 27%, (2) patchy consolidation and ground-glass opacity (GGO) 13.2 and 33%, (3) diffuse GGO 13.2 and 21%, (4) patchy GGO 16.2 and 6%, and (5) no findings 54.4 and 21%, respectively. Late injury in periods 3 and 4 were: (1) modified conventional pattern (consolidation, volume loss, bronchiectasis) 54 and 44%, (2) mass-like 20 and 28%, (3) scar-like 14 and 16% and (4) no findings 20 and 12%, respectively. The proportion of emphysema grades 2-4 was significantly higher in patients who had no radiological findings 6 weeks after treatment (p=0.021).

Potential effects of a 30 min exposure to third generation (3G) Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) mobile phone-like electromagnetic fields (EMFs) were investigated on human brain electrical activity in two experiments. In the first experiment, spontaneous electroencephalography (sEEG) was analyzed (n = 17); in the second experiment, auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) and automatic deviance detection processes reflected by mismatch negativity (MMN) were investigated in a passive oddball paradigm (n = 26). Both sEEG and ERP experiments followed a double-blind protocol where subjects were exposed to either genuine or sham irradiation in two separate sessions. In both experiments, electroencephalograms (EEG) were recorded at midline electrode sites before and after exposure while subjects were watching a silent documentary. Spectral power of sEEG data was analyzed in the delta, theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands. In the ERP experiment, subjects were presented with a random series of standard (90%) and frequency-deviant (10%) tones in a passive binaural oddball paradigm. The amplitude and latency of the P50, N100, P200, MMN, and P3a components were analyzed. We found no measurable effects of a 30 min 3G mobile phone irradiation on the EEG spectral power in any frequency band studied. Also, we found no significant effects of EMF irradiation on the amplitude and latency of any of the ERP components. In summary, the present results do not support the notion that a 30 min unilateral 3G EMF exposure interferes with human sEEG activity, auditory evoked potentials or automatic deviance detection indexed by MMN.

AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as a key proangiogenic factor and determine whether there is any correlation between its expression and clinical symptoms or endoscopic changes in patients with chronic radiation proctitis (ChRP)., METHOD: Fifty patients who had all undergone radiotherapy for prostate, cervical or uterine cancer were included in the study (37 women, 13 men). There was a control group of 20 patients (9 women, 11 men). The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (RTOG/EORTC) scoring system was used for grading the severity of the proctitis. Endoscopic scoring of late rectal mucosal damage was performed using Gilinsky's classification. Serum levels of VEGF were analysed by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method., RESULTS: Most patients presented with Grade 1 symptoms. Endoscopic assessment showed that most patients had Grade 1 late rectal mucosal damage. The predominant endoscopic finding was the presence of telangiectasia. Assessment of VEGF correlation between the control group and the degrees of endoscopic changes showed statistically significant differences for all three degrees (P < 0.0001, P = 0.0251 and P = 0.0005, respectively). Due to the small numbers of patients with Grades 2 and 3 symptoms using the RTOG/EORTC scoring system, they were grouped with Grades 1 and 4 respectively forming two groups for statistical purposes. VEGF expression differed significantly between controls and group I and between controls and group II (P = 0.0001, P = 0.0009, respectively)., CONCLUSION: A significant increase in VEGF expression was found to correlate with clinical symptoms and endoscopic rectal mucosa changes in patients with ChRP, suggesting that it may play an important role in pathological angiogenesis.

4441,"Differential effects of genotoxic stress on both concurrent body growth and gradual senescence in the adult zebrafish. Among vertebrates, fish and mammals show intriguing differences in their growth control properties with age. The potential for unlimited or indeterminate growth in a variety of fish species has prompted many questions regarding the senescent phenomena that appear during the aging process in these animals. Using zebrafish as our model system, we have attempted in our current study to examine the growth phenomena in fish in relation to the onset of senescence-associated symptoms, and to evaluate the effects of genotoxic stress on these processes. We observed in the course of these analyses that the zebrafish undergoes continuous growth, irrespective of age, past the point of sexual maturation with gradually decreasing growth rates at later stages. Animal population density, current body size and chronological age also play predominant roles in regulating zebrafish growth and all inversely influence the growth rate. Interestingly, the induction of genotoxic stress by exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) did not adversely affect this body growth ability in zebrafish. However, IR was found to chronically debilitate the regeneration of amputated caudal fins and thereby induce high levels of abnormal fin regeneration in the adult zebrafish. In addition, by resembling and mimicking the natural course of aging, IR treatments likewise enhanced several other symptoms of senescence, such as a decline in reproductive abilities, increased senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity and a reduction in melatonin secretion. Our current data thus suggest that during the lifespan of zebrafish, the onset of senescence-associated symptoms occurs in parallel with continuous growth throughout mid-adulthood. Moreover, our present findings indicate that genotoxic DNA damage may play a role as a rate-limiting factor during the induction of senescence, but not in the inhibition of continuous, density-dependent growth in adult zebrafish.",Included
4442,"Primary endovascular treatment of post-irradiated carotid pseudoaneurysm at the skull base with the Pipeline embolization device. Background A post-irradiated carotid pseudoaneurysm at the skull base can cause life-threatening blowout syndrome. Conventional treatments include parent vessel occlusion, endovascular coiling or covered stenting. Use of the Pipeline embolization device (PED) for pseudoaneurysm exclusion at the skull base is not well described. Objective To report the clinical and angiographic outcome after using multiple PEDs to treat recently ruptured radiation-induced carotid pseudoaneurysms at the skull base. Methods Retrospective review of the clinical and angiographic records of patients who received PEDs as primary treatment for skull base carotid pseudoaneurysm between April 1, 2011 to March 31, 2013. Results Seven patients (five men, two women) with a mean age of 58 years (range 47-65) were treated in the study period. Primary treatment with the PED alone, with adjunct coil embolization in two patients, achieved immediate hemostasis in all patients, with no pseudoaneurysm rebleeding after a mean follow-up of 15.3 months (range 4-24 months). One patient had periprocedural cerebral infarction. Delayed internal carotid artery occlusion secondary to in-stent thrombosis occurred in three patients, one of whom had lacunar infarct and two remained asymptomatic. Conclusions Endovascular treatment with the PED was effective in excluding skull base post-irradiated carotid pseudoaneurysms and preventing recurrent blowout. However, the risk of ischemic complications in this group of patients was high and our experience did not support the use of flow diverters as a first-line treatment for this condition.",Excluded

Subjects who were exposed to a burst-firing pattern, a complex-sequenced pattern, and a pattern whose electrical equivalents stimulate long-term potential in hippocampus slices also exhibited less psychometric fatigue after the sessions compared to subjects who received the sham field or random-sequenced fields. These results replicate previous studies and indicate that rationally designed complex patterns of magnetic fields may simulate pharmacological treatments.",Excluded
4444,"What are the clinical and technical factors that influence the kerma-area product in percutaneous coronary intervention?. The purpose of the paper is to define predictors of the kerma-area product (KAP) in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Two new digital X-ray interventional cardiology systems recently installed were included. A total of 398 PCI procedures were carried out by 6 board-certified senior interventional cardiologists with more than 15 years' experience and good knowledge of radiation protection measures. Clinical, radiation and procedural data were collected based on a detailed protocol developed by the SENTINEL cardiology subgroup. Correlation with clinical and procedure factors was then investigated. A significant correlation was found between fluoroscopy time and (i) lesion classification, (ii) the level of tortuosity and (iii) the number of vessels treated. No statistically significant differences were observed in the complexity of the case between operators. However, large differences were found in the KAP among operators, which were mostly attributed to the different number of frames taken by each operator. There was no statistically significant correlation between complexity and the total number of frames. The study showed that, in certain circumstances, the clinical need to successfully perform PCI takes precedence over radiation safety concerns.",Excluded

The aim of the current planning study is to evaluate the ability of gadoxetate disodium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (EOB-MRI)-guided stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) planning by using intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) techniques in sparing the functional liver tissues during SBRT for hepatocellular carcinoma. In this study, 20 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were enrolled. Functional liver tissues were defined according to quantitative liver-spleen contrast ratios >=1.5 on a hepatobiliary phase scan. Functional images were fused with the planning computed tomography (CT) images; the following 2 SBRT plans were designed using a ""step-and-shoot"" static IMRT technique for each patient: (1) an anatomical SBRT plan optimization based on the total liver; and (2) a functional SBRT plan based on the functional liver. The total prescribed dose was 48 gray (Gy) in 4 fractions. Dosimetric parameters, including dose to 95% of the planning target volume (PTV D95%), percentages of total and functional liver volumes, which received doses from 5 to 30Gy (V5 to V30 and fV5 to fV30), and mean doses to total and functional liver (MLD and fMLD, respectively) of the 2 plans were compared. Compared with anatomical plans, functional image-guided SBRT plans reduced MLD (mean: plan A, 5.5Gy; and plan F, 5.1Gy; p<0.0001) and fMLD (mean: plan A, 5.4Gy; and plan F, 4.9Gy; p<0.0001), as well as V5 to V30 and fV5 to fV30. No differences were noted in PTV coverage and nonhepatic organs at risk (OARs) doses. In conclusion, EOB-MRI-guided SBRT planning using the IMRT technique may preserve functional liver tissues in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Copyright © 2017 American Association of Medical Dosimetrists",Excluded
4446,"Proton Pump Inhibitor Exposure and Acute Myocardial Infarction Risk: A Nested Cohort Study. Background: Association of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) exposure with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) risk in the Caucasian population remains under debate. Here, we clarified whether PPI exposure might be related to an increased new-onset AMI risk in an Asian population. Method(s): Data of 27,624 patients with PPI exposure followed by new-onset AMI development were extracted from Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database and age- and sex-matched with 27,624 controls with PPIs exposure, but without subsequent AMI and ischemic heart disease development. The amount of PPI exposure was calculated based on the cumulative defined daily dose (cDDD) during the follow-up period. Subsequent AMI risk was measured after adjustments of demographic data and indication of PPI use. Result(s): AMI risk increased with an increase in PPI exposure: with cDDD <= 30 as the reference, the odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for cDDDs of > 365 was 1.56 (1.45-1.69). All five PPI categories, including pantoprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, esomeprazole, and rabeprazole, increased AMI risk. Conclusion(s): Our study demonstrated long-term or high-dose PPI exposure associated with increased new-onset AMI risk in patients without a history of any ischemic heart disease. The underlying mechanisms of PPI-related cardiovascular effects deserve more investigation.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
4447,"Induction of high-frequency oscillations in a junction-coupled network. Rhythmic oscillations of up to 600 Hz in grouped neurons frequently occur in the brains of animals. These high-frequency oscillations can be sustained in calcium-free conditions and may be blocked by gap junction blockers, implying a key role for electrical synapses in oscillation generation. Mathematical theories have been developed to demonstrate oscillations mediated by electrical synapses without chemical modulation; however, these models have not been verified in animals. Here we report that oscillations of up to 686 Hz are induced by paired spikes of short spike intervals (SIs) in a junction-coupled network. To initiate oscillations, it was essential that the second spike was elicited during the relative refractory period. The second spike suffered from slow propagation speed and failure to transmit through a low-conductance junction. Thus, at the spike initiation site, paired spikes of short SIs triggered one transjunctional spike in the postsynaptic neuron. At distant synaptic sites, two transjunctional spikes were produced as the SI increased during spike propagation. Consequently, spike collision of these asymmetrical transjunctional spikes occurred in the interconnected network. The remaining single spike reverberated in a network serving as an oscillator center. Paired-spike-induced oscillations were modeled by computer simulation and verified electrophysiologically in a network that mediates the tail-flip escape response of crayfish.",Excluded
4448,"Radiation exposure associated with dedicated renal mass computed tomography protocol: impact of patient characteristics. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Renal mass protocol CT (RMP-CT) using multiphase abdomen and pelvis CT imaging is the mainstay for diagnosis, characterization, and follow-up for renal masses; however, it is associated with ionizing radiation to the patient. We sought to quantify the effective dose associated with RMP-CT and to determine how patient factors affect radiation exposure., MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 247 patients undergoing management of a small renal mass (cT1a) between 2005 and 2011 at our institution. Body mass index (BMI) was categorized as normal weight, overweight, obese, and morbidly obese (<=25, 25.1-30, 30.1-35 and >35, respectively). Effective dose of RMP-CT was calculated through the dose-length-product multiplied by a factor coefficient (0.015). Effective doses in milliSieverts (mSv) were correlated to patient characteristics., RESULTS: Patients' median age was 61 years, and median BMI was 28.7 kg/m(2); 72% were Caucasian and 56% were male. Median effective dose was 26.1 mSv (interquartile range 20.6-35.3). When stratified by BMI, the median effective doses were 18.9, 25.2, 27.7, and 36.2mSv for normal weight, overweight, obese, and morbidly obese patients, respectively. On multivariable analyses, BMI and male sex were significantly associated with increased radiation dose., CONCLUSIONS: In this series, the median effective dose for RMP-CT was 26.1 mSv. Obesity was independently associated with markedly increased radiation exposure, with morbidly obese patients being exposed to almost twice the amount of radiation compared with normal weight persons. These findings should be considered when devising management strategies in patients with a renal mass and strategies should be developed to reduce medical ionizing radiation exposure.",Excluded
4449,"Post-Fukushima radiation education for Japanese high school students in affected areas and its positive effects on their radiation literacy. In post-Fukushima Japan, radiation education is very important, and the subject is being actively discussed. However, little information is available about the amount of knowledge students initially had about radiation or about how well radiation education improves their understanding. Using the questionnaire results of 717 students completed before and after radiation lectures held in three high schools in Fukushima, we examined the number of answers to the questionnaire aligned with the evidence base, and classified the students into clusters based on radiation-related behavior and attitudes to assess the effectiveness of the lecture. The contents of the lectures consisted of (i) scientific knowledge relating to radiation, (ii) results of radiation examinations conducted locally following the disaster and (iii) measures and precautions for daily radiation protection. Associations between the type of knowledge and radiation-related behavior and attitude were also examined to determine which type of knowledge was more important for deepening students' understanding of radiation. This study revealed that radiation education in high schools was effective for students with respect to acquiring relevant basic and practical knowledge; however, the effects of the radiation lecture differed greatly between schools, presumably due to differences in the delivery and atmosphere of the lecture. The present study also suggested that radiation education may positively transform student attitudes and behaviors related to radiation. To enable such a change in awareness, the acquisition of scientific knowledge is essential, for it enables individuals to make better decisions about important matters in their daily lives.",Excluded
4450,"Late temporal lobe necrosis in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma: evaluation with combined multi-section diffusion weighted and perfusion weighted MR imaging. Late temporal lobe necrosis is a well-known and serious complication in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) following radiotherapy. Owing to the close proximity to the skull base, the medial temporal lobes are inevitably included in the target volume of irradiation. Patients with NPC provide a unique opportunity in study of delay radiation effect in normal human brain. The objective of this study was to evaluate late temporal lobe radiation injury by combined multi-section diffusion weighted and perfusion weighted MR imaging. We prospectively studied 16 patients with typical clinical symptoms of late temporal lobe necrosis or other abnormalities in the temporal lobes incidentally detected by conventional MR imaging. All patients had a previous history of radiotherapy for histologically proven NPC. Conventional T1- and T2-weighted images, fast gradient echo with echo-planar diffusion-weighted and perfusion-weighted MR imaging were performed. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) map were computed via commercially available software. MR diffusion and perfusion images were then analyzed and graded by two independent observers with focusing on the diffusion and perfusion mismatch. The temporal lobe lesions displayed marked high diffusion on the ADC map. The rCBV map also revealed marked hypoperfusion in these temporal lobe lesions in all patients. The areas of abnormality on the rCBV map were significantly larger than the lesions on the ADC map in 14 patients (observer 1) and 13 patients (observer 2). Since late temporal lobe necrosis is probably caused by damage of the endothelium of vessels and ischemia, perfusion and diffusion mismatch might imply injured tissue but potentially salvageable brain tissue. A mismatch may be potentially used to predict the response to treatment in-patients with late temporal lobe necrosis.",Excluded
4451,"Heavy ion radiotherapy in lung cancer. (Introduction) In radiotherapy of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), carbon ion beams offer improved dose distributions as compared to photon beams and thus enable dose escalation within a target while sparing the surrounding normal tissues. Furthermore, carbon ions being heavier than protons provide a higher biological effectiveness, which increases with depth, reaching the maximum at the end of the range. At the National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS), clinical research on carbon ion radiotherapy (C-ion RT) was started in 1994 using carbon-ions generated by Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC). So far, almost 6,000 patients have been treated, where the benefit of C-ion RT over other modalities has been demonstrated in terms of high local control rates and a significant reduction in overall treatment time with acceptable toxicities in most cases. In this paper, the results of treatment for Stage I NSCLC using 9 and 4 fractions are reviewed, as well as preliminary results of single fraction treatment is described. Also, results of other RT reported in the literatures are compared. (Methods and materials) Stage I lung cancer is divided into two types depending on tumor location: peripheral-type and central-type. This classification is made on the assumption that the two types may tolerate radiation differently. Therefore, different fractionation regimens were investigated for each type. The patients eligible for either treatment are those for whom surgery was not indicated due to medical reasons or refusal. From 1999 to 2003, a total of 131 tumors in129 patients received C-ion RT with 9 fractions and 4 fractions, including 94 males and 37 females with an average age of 74.5 years. Out of the 131 foci, there were 72 T1 tumors and 59 T2 tumors. There were 85 adenocarcinomas, 43 epidermoid cancers and 3 other types. Regarding dose fractionations, 51 cases were treated with 72.0GyE/9 fractions, and 80 cases were treated with 52.8GyE/4fr for stage IA and 60.0GyE/4fr for stage IB. Since 2003, a doseescalation study using single fraction treatment has been conducted for peripheral-type NSCLC. The initial dose was 28.0 GyE, which was then escalated at increments of 5%. At each dose level, about 10 to 30 patients were registered for evaluation of toxicity and local control with carbon ions. C-ion RT has also been applied to locally advanced lung cancers and hilar-type cancers, and case studies are being accumulated. The locally advanced lung cancers included Pancoast tumors and mediastinal-type tumors in stages II-IIIA. (Results) All of the patients treated with 9 fractions/3 weeks (50 patients) and 4 fractions/1 week (79 patients) developed no evidence of severe toxicities. The 5-year local control rates were 98.6% for stage-IA cases and 89.7% for stage- IB cases, and the 5-year survival rates were 63.1% for stage-IA cases and 50.0% for stage-IB cases. In single fraction treatment, a total of 218 patients have been registered, in which the total dose has been escalated from 28.0 to 48.0 GyE. So far, no serious adverse events have been observed, and local control appears to be improving with increasing total dose. For skin reactions, six grade 2 toxicity (3.3%) but no grade 3 or higher was observed. For radiation pneumonitis, only one grade 1 was reported, and no toxicities greater than grade 2 occurred. The overall local control rate was 91.8%, and the causespeci fic survival rate at 5-years was 71.8%. The superficial lesions arising at the hilar region have been successfully treated with acceptable toxicities. Similarly, in the preoperative radiotherapy for patients with chest wall invasion, high anti-tumor effect was confirmed in the pathological findings after the lung was surgically removed. (Discussion) Only at NIRS, Japan, NSCLC has been treated with carbon ions. For peripheral tumor, we have been conducting clinical studies to establish a short-course, hypo-fractionated radiotherapy. We first performed a dose-escalation study using 18 fractions/6 weeks. The number of fractions and treatment times were subsequently reduced to 9 fractions over 3 weeks, 4 fractions over one week, and eventually to a single fraction treatment. The preliminary data suggested favorable local control and very few toxic reactions with a median follow up time of about 16 months. Compared with pulmonary damage reported for stereotactic radiotherapy in stage I lung cancer, the incidence and severity in our patients seemed to be remarkably low. The decreased adverse effects on the lung are likely achieved due to the small volume irradiated. When comparing proton vs C-ion RT, local control results are comparable for T1 tumors, but for T2 tumors 2-5 year local control rates are higher in C-ion RT. It is of note that in most reported data for proton therapy, follow-up periods are short relative to the time required for full evaluation of TCP, late NTCP and survival. Considering that the average age of the patients receiving C-ion RT was about 75 years, about 10 years older than that of 65 years in the operated patients, the results of C-ion RT for stage-I lung cancer may be comparable to surgical results. Thus, the single-fraction irradiation method may be described as the ultimate type of treatment using carbon ion, and would be a valid alternative to surgery, especially for elderly and inoperable patients.",Excluded
4452,"Combined analysis of V20, VS5, pulmonary fibrosis score on baseline computed tomography, and patient age improves prediction of severe radiation pneumonitis after concurrent chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. INTRODUCTION: We aimed to develop a more accurate model for predicting severe radiation pneumonitis (RP) after concurrent chemoradiotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer., METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from 122 patients with locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Several dose-volume histogram metrics including absolute lung volume spared from a 5 Gy dose (VS5) were analyzed for an association with RP above NCI-CTC grade 3 (RP >= G3). Clinical factors including pulmonary fibrosis score (PFS) and pulmonary emphysema score on baseline chest computed tomography (CT) were also analyzed., RESULTS: Fourteen patients (11.4%) developed RP greater than or equal to G3. On univariate analysis, all dose-volume histogram metrics, sex, and PFS on baseline CT were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with occurrence of RP greater than or equal to G3. Multivariate analysis revealed that V20 greater than or equal to 26%, VS5 less than 1500 cc, age greater than or equal to 68 years, and PFS on baseline CT greater than or equal to 2 were significant risk factors. Thus, we defined a new predictive risk score (PRS) that combines these factors. The cumulative incidence of RP greater than or equal to G3 at 12 months were 0%, 7.8%, 26.6%, and 71.4% when the PRS was 0, 3-5, 6-8, and 9-14, respectively (p < 0.001). This PRS was superior at predicting RP than both V20 and VS5 combined, or V20 alone by receiver operating characteristic analysis (area under the curve, 0.888 versus 0.779 versus 0.678)., CONCLUSIONS: V20, VS5, age, and PFS on baseline CT are independent and significant risk factors for occurrence of severe RP. Combining these factors may improve the predictability of severe RP.",Excluded

Purpose To compare toxicity and survival after stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) between lung cancer patients with or without idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs), and to investigate the potential value of SBRT for the patients. Methods Among lung cancer patients receiving SBRT between 2005 and 2016, we evaluated those treated with a total dose of 40-60 Gy in five fractions with curative intent who either were staged as cT1-4N0M0 or experienced postoperative isolated local recurrence. We analyzed the incidence of radiation pneumonitis (RP) in all patients and local recurrence and overall survival (OS) in T1a-2a patients. Results A total of 508 patients were eligible, including 42 with IIPs. The median follow-up was 32.3 (6.0-120.9) months. Significantly more patients with IIPs had grade >=3 RP than did those without IIPs (12% vs. 3%, p = 0.009). The 2-year local recurrence rate was low in both groups (3.4% vs. 5.6%, p = 0.38). The 2-year OS rate was significantly lower in the patients with IIPs (42.2% vs. 80.9%, p < 0.001), although death from lung cancer was comparable (p = 0.74).

4458,"Does hyperbaric oxygen administration before or after irradiation decrease side effects of irradiation on implant sites?. One of the main limitations of implant-based breast reconstruction is the high rate of complications such as capsular contracture and poor aesthetic outcome, due to adjuvant radiotherapy. Hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) has been used to assist wound healing in the prevention and treatment of the side effects of irradiation. We aimed to investigate this effect of HBOT on the capsule reaction and skin, applied before and after irradiation, following the placement of an implant under the dorsal skin of the rat. Fifteen Wistar rats were randomly divided into 3 groups. A 18-mL smooth testicular implant was introduced into a subcutaneous pocket located on the dorsum of each rat. A single dose of 17-Gy irradiation was given to the implanted area of each rat at the third week. HBOT which lasted 3 weeks was administered to group I before irradiation, group II after irradiation. The control group did not receive HBOT. All of the rats were killed at the ninth week (6 weeks after irradiation). The dorsal skin with the capsule overlying the implant were excised for histopathological processing. The thickness of the capsule reaction of each group was evaluated statistically. Our histopathological examination revealed changes due to radiation in the control group. Many of these findings were found to be more subtle in group I and nearly absent in the group II. There was not any statistical difference between the thickness of the capsule reactions of the control group and group I, or group I and group II, but the capsular thickness of the control group was statistically higher than group II. It can be predicted that the use of HBOT following irradiation is an effective tool to reduce the capsule reaction of the implanted area and the tissue damage seen in radiodermatitis.",Excluded

In every case, higher levels of aberrations were observed in primary cultures established from the irradiated tissues than in those established from the contralateral tissues. The most common aberrations in the contralateral tissues and those from nonirradiated mice were chromatid and isochromatid breaks and small chromatid fragments. Primary cells from irradiated tissues removed from animals within a month of exposure displayed a variety of unstable chromosome-type aberrations characteristic of recent exposure to ionizing radiation including rings, dicentrics, double minutes, and large acentric fragments.

Although the levels of chromosome-type aberrations found in primary cells from irradiated tissues dropped to near background levels a year or more after exposure, chromatid-type aberrations remained elevated. These results are consistent with long-term persistence of damage in the genomes of ionizing radiation-exposed cells in solid tissues and the induction of genomic instability in vivo.",Included
4464,"Ultrasonic characterization of selected renal tissues. Velocity, attenuation, and backscatter of ultrasound were measured in human renal tissues over a frequency range relevant to clinical imaging (3.5-7 MHz). Normal renal tissues, as well as three types of mass (angiomyolipoma, renal cell carcinoma, and oncocytoma) were studied, and comparisons made of the appearance of the tissues in clinical images to their ultrasonic and pathological properties. The results showed angiomyolipoma had high attenuation and backscatter coefficients due to acoustic impedance differences between fat and smooth muscle components of the tumour. The renal cell carcinomas were indistinguishable from normal kidney tissue, except in one case where infiltration by fatlike macrophages led to high attenuation and backscatter coefficients. This finding also supports the conclusion that fat/nonfat interfaces are a dominant scatter mechanism in renal tissues.",Excluded
4465,"Intracranial Autograft Fat Placement to Separate the Optic Chiasm from Tumor to Improve Stereotactic Radiotherapy Dosimetry. BACKGROUND: Radiation therapy for intracranial lesions is constrained by dose to neurologic organs at risk., CASE DESCRIPTION: We report 2 cases, a newly diagnosed chondrosarcoma and a previously irradiated meningioma, with tumors that abutted the optic chiasm following subtotal resection. Definitive radiotherapy would have required either undercoverage of the tumor or treatment of the chiasm with doses posing an unacceptable risk of blindness. Therefore, the patients underwent open surgery with placement of an abdominal fat autograft to provide space between the tumor and the optic structures at risk. Patients received definitive fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy. For each patient, we retrospectively compared the treated plan (with fat autograft) to a second plan generated using the pre-autograft imaging, maintaining similar tumor coverage. For the chondrosarcoma, the fat autograft reduced the optic chiasm maximum dose by 21% (70.4 Gy to 55.3 Gy). For the reirradiated peri-optic meningioma, the optic chiasm maximum dose was reduced by 10% (50.8 Gy to 45.9 Gy), the left optic nerve by 17% (48.9 Gy to 40.4 Gy), and the right optic nerve by 30% (32.3 Gy to 22.6 Gy)., CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the utility of abdominal fat autograft placement to maximize coverage of tumor while minimizing dose to intracranial organs at risk.

4467,"Induction of micronuclei in human sperm-hamster egg hybrids at the two-cell stage after in vitro gamma-irradiation of human spermatozoa. The efficiency of the micronucleus test to assess radiation-induced chromosomal damage in human spermatozoa has been investigated. Micronuclei were scored in human sperm-hamster egg hybrids at the two-cell stage, after exposure of human spermatozoa to in vitro gamma-rays at doses of 0.00, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 1.00, 2.00, and 4.00 Gy. The relationship between the yield of micronuclei per two-cell stage as well as the percentage of two-cell stages with micronuclei and the different doses of irradiation were fitted to linear equations. To evaluate whether scoring micronuclei is useful for the quantification of chromosomal damage occurring in human spermatozoa, induced micronuclei at the different doses of sperm irradiation were compared to the induction of breaks and fragments in sperm-derived chromosomes. After interspecific fertilization of zona-free hamster oocytes by irradiated spermatozoa, a total of 699 fertilized eggs at the two-cell stage and a total of 387 sperm-derived complements were analyzed. The incidence of fertilized eggs with micronuclei at the two-cell stage coincided well with the incidence of sperm-derived chromosome breaks and fragments (e.g., 8.9% vs. 6.7% in the 0.25 Gy group and 52.8% vs. 58.6% in the 4.00 Gy group). A similar correlation was found between the number of micronuclei per two-cell stage and the number of breaks and fragments per sperm complement (0.09 vs. 0.07 in the 0.25 Gy group and 0.71 vs. 0.81 in the 4.00 Gy group).

4468,"Analysis of 66 patients definitive with transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease and the effect of universal irradiation of blood. Background: Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD) is a potentially fatal adverse reaction to blood transfusion. Although TA-GVHD was formerly considered to be rare and to occur only in immunocompromised patients, it was confirmed to occur even in immunocompetent patients in Japan, based on a definitive diagnostic test for TA-GVHD using highly polymorphic microsatellite repeat sequences. We clarify the clinical picture of TA-GVHD via definitive diagnosed cases and argue the validity of blood irradiation for TA-GVHD prevention. Patients and Methods: Two-hundred and ninety patients who were suspected of having TA-GVHD and referred to us for diagnostic testing from October 1992 to August 1999 were analysed for the associated clinical characteristics and risk factors. Effects of universal irradiation were followed up until 2010. Result(s): Sixty-six of the 290 study patients were diagnosed as having definite TA-GVHD by microsatellite DNA analysis. Regarding the symptoms of patients with definite TA-GVHD, a fever of over 38degreeC, erythema and leucocytopenia were found in virtually all of these patients. Among patients in whom human leucocyte antigen (HLA) typing was carried out, TA-GVHD almost always developed in HLA heterozygous patients following the transfusion of HLA homozygous blood. TA-GVHD was reported significantly more frequently in older patients. In this study, TA-GVHD was caused by the transfusion of HLA one-way match blood stored for 14days. Conclusion(s): No cases of TA-GVHD development have been confirmed since 2000, when the supply of irradiated blood products became widespread. No major problems have been encountered since the start of universal irradiation, more than 10years ago. © 2013 British Blood Transfusion Society.",Excluded
4469,"Myelosuppression after radiation therapy in patients with and without autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation: A retrospective observational study. Background/Aim: Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) after high-dose chemotherapy is used to treat relapsed malignant lymphomas. Radiation therapy (RT) is applied after ASCT. We compared the incidence of myelosuppression after RT with and without autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (auto-PBSCT). Patients and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 20 patients with malignant lymphomas who received RT, six of whom underwent auto-PBSCT. Univariate analysis using Pearson's Chi-squared test and multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards regression model were performed to determine correlations between the development of grade two or more leukopenia and clinical factors. Result(s): Among patients with auto-PBSCT, grade two or more leukopenia occurred in five. The incidence of grade two or more leukopenia was significantly higher in patients with auto-PBSCT than in those without (p=0.014). Conclusion(s): Hematopoietic functions after auto-PBSCT may be more vulnerable to RT than normal hematopoietic functions.Copyright © 2019 International Institute of Anticancer Research.

The objective of this study was to find out the radiation dose relationship with subclinical hypothyroidism in the postoperative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients, who underwent adjuvant neck external beam radiotherapy. It was a prospective cohort study done between June 2018 and January 2020. One hundred patients, who were fulfilling the criteria of histological proven postoperative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of AJCC 2018 stage I to III, were enrolled. Patients were irradiated for 50 Gy to the bilateral lower neck on a linear accelerator. A CT scan face and neck with contrast along with T3, T4, and TSH was done before and after 4 weeks of chemoradiotherapy. All the patients were kept on surveillance for every three months for one year with the above-mentioned CT scan and thyroid function test. Ten patients (10%) had received radiation dose less than 30 Gy to the thyroid gland, while 90 patients (90%) had received radiation dose >30 Gy to thyroid gland. After one year of completion of treatment, 27.8% patients (n = 25) developed subclinical hypothyroidism among those patients (n = 90), who received radiation dose more than 30 Gy to thyroid gland.

Introduction: To investigate the impact of pre-existing radiological interstitial lung disease (ILD) findings on the incidence of radiation pneumonitis (RP) and clinical outcomes after stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for stage I non-small-cell lung cancer. Method(s): We included 157 consecutive patients who underwent SBRT alone for stage I non-small-cell lung cancer and whose pretreatment lung computed tomography images were available for retrospective review. The pretreatment computed tomography images were evaluated retrospectively for the presence of ILD. The incidence of RP, overall survival (OS) rate, and the incidence of disease progression and local progression were evaluated between patients with ILD (ILD[+]) and without ILD (ILD[-]). Result(s): Pre-existing ILD was identified in 20 patients. The median follow-up period was 39.5 months. The incidences of RP worse than grade 2 (>= Gr2 RP) and worse than grade 3 (>= Gr3 RP) were significantly higher in ILD(+) than ILD(-) (1 year >= Gr2 RP rate, 55.0% versus 13.3%; p < 0.001 and 1year >= Gr3 RP rate 10.0% versus 1.5%; p = 0.020). Multivariate analysis also indicated that ILD(+) was a risk factor for >= Gr2 and >= Gr3 RP, and the volume of the irradiated lung. The OS rate tended to be worse in ILD(+) than ILD(-) (3-year OS, 53.8% versus 70.8%; p = 0.28). No difference was observed in the disease progression or local progression rates. Conclusion(s): Pre-existing ILD was a significant risk factor for symptomatic and severe RP. Prescreening for ILD findings is important for determining the radiation pneumonitis risk when planning SBRT.Copyright © 2014 by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.",Excluded

4473,"Nuclear medicine in the acute clinical setting: indications, imaging findings, and potential pitfalls. Nuclear medicine imaging provides valuable functional information that complements information obtained with anatomic imaging techniques in the evaluation of patients with specific acute clinical manifestations. Nuclear medicine studies are most often used in conjunction with other imaging modalities and as a problem-solving tool. Under certain circumstances a nuclear medicine study may be indicated as the first-line imaging modality, as in the case of renal scintigraphy for transplant dysfunction in the early postoperative period. Nuclear imaging may be preferred when a conventional first-line study is contraindicated or when it is important to minimize radiation exposure. The portability of nuclear imaging offers particular advantages for the evaluation of critically ill patients whose clinical condition is unstable and who cannot be safely transported out of the intensive care unit. The ability to visualize physiologic and pathophysiologic processes over relatively long time periods without adding to the patient's radiation exposure contributes to the high diagnostic sensitivity of several types of nuclear medicine studies. Viewing the acquired images in the cine mode adds to the value of these studies for diagnosing and characterizing dynamic abnormalities such as intermittent internal bleeding and bile or urine leakage. In this pictorial review, the spectrum of nuclear medicine studies commonly performed in the acute care setting is reviewed according to body systems and organs, with detailed descriptions of the indications, technical considerations, findings, and potential pitfalls of each type of study.

4474,"Radiation protection by the Ocimum flavonoids orientin and vicenin: Mechanisms of action. In previous studies, flavonoids, orientin and vicenin, that were isolated from the leaf extract of Ocimum sanctum, were found to protect mice against radiation injury. Several flavonoids are known to be good antioxidants. Therefore, the effect of orientin and vicenin on radiation-induced lipid peroxidation in vivo and their antioxidant activity in vitro were studied. Adult mice were injected intraperitoneally with 50 mug/kg of orientin or vicenin and exposed whole-body to 3 Gy of gamma radiation. Lipid peroxidation was measured in the liver 15 min to 8 h postirradiation. The antioxidant activity of orientin/vicenin (10-500 muM) was studied by measuring inhibition of hydroxyl radicals generated by the Fenton reaction (Fe3+-EDTA-ascorbic acid-H2O2) in vitro. The compounds were also tested for possible pro-oxidant and iron chelation activities at the above concentrations in the in vitro system. Orientin and vicenin provided almost equal protection against radiation-induced lipid peroxidation in mouse liver. Both compounds showed a significantly greater free radical-inhibiting activity in vitro than DMSO. Neither orientin nor vicenin showed any pro-oxidant activity at the concentrations tested. Both compounds inhibited free radical formation in the absence of EDTA. Free radical scavenging appears to be a likely mechanism of radiation protection by these flavonoids.

Percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty (PBKP) is generally performed under two-dimensional (2D) radiography guidance (lateral- and anteroposterior (A-P) views) using C-arm fluoroscopy. However, 2D images taken by single-plane or bi-plane fluoroscopy cannot provide information regarding axial views, particularly the Z axis. Lack of information regarding the Z axis prevents the creation of three-dimensional (3D) images. Currently, there has been a progress in interventional X-ray systems, and they are capable of providing 3D radiographic images using a rotational angiography mode which is used to create 3D angiographies. In this report, we described the usefulness of 3D radiography guidance. Patients treated by PBKP was designed to evaluate the efficacy of 3D radiography guidance. These patients experienced osteoporotic vertebral fractures with severe pain. We retrospectively analyzed patients who underwent PBKP from February to December 2016. All patients had a single-level vertebral fracture and underwent surgery by 2D or 3D radiography guidance. We performed 16 patients in 3D radiography guidance, and 10 patients in traditional 2D radiography guidance. This 3D radiography guided PBKP increase the amount of the polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) injection compared with ordinary 2D method. As a result, postoperative vertebral height and alignment were significantly improved. Both groups have no complication.

The objective of this retrospective study was to report initial results of CyberKnife stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) boost for tumors in the head and neck area. Between March 2008 and August 2009, 10 patients were treated with SRT boost using CyberKnife system due mainly to unfavorable condition such as tumors in close proximity to serial organs or former radiotherapy fields. Treatment sites were the external auditory canal in two, the nasopharynx in one, the oropharynx in three, the nasal cavity in one, the maxillary sinus in two, and the oligometastatic cervical lymph node in one. All patients underwent preceding conventional radiotherapy of 40 to 60 Gy. Dose and fractionation scheme of the Cyberknife SRT boost was individualized, and prescribed dose ranged from 9 Gy to 16 Gy in 3 to 4 fractions. Among four patients for whom dose to the optic pathway was concerned, the maximum dose was only about 3 Gy for three patients whereas 9.6 Gy in the remaining one patient. The maximum dose for the mandible in one of three patients with oropharyngeal cancer was 19.7 Gy, whereas majority of the bone can be spared by using non-isocentric conformal beams. For a patient with nasopharyngeal cancer, the highest dose in the brain stem was 15 Gy. However, majority of the brain stem received less than 40% of the maximum dose.

The objective of this study was to investigate the correlation between local recurrence and radiotherapeutic parameters, including dose and RT radiotherapy (RT) field. METHODS. The current study included 35 patients who were diagnosed with immunohistochemically confirmed nasal natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma between 1976 and 2004. There were 21 males and 14 females, and they ranged in age from 18 years to 76 years (median, 51 yrs). The primary tumor originated in the nasal cavity in 28 patients, and 32 patients had Stage I disease. Seventeen patients received treatment solely with RT, and the remaining 18 patients received a combination of chemotherapy and RT. The median tumor dose was 50 grays (Gy) (range, 22-60 Gy). Twenty-seven patients received RT to include all macroscopic lesions, all paranasal sinuses, the palate, and the nasopharynx. Eight patients received RT to all macroscopic lesions with generous margins. RESULTS. A complete remission (CR) or a CR/unconfirmed was achieved in 28 patients (80%). The 5-year overall survival (OAS) rate, disease-free survival (DFS) rate, and local control probability (LCP) were 47.3%, 42.9%, and 65.2%, respectively. Patients who received RT only to macroscopic lesions fared less well in terms of LCP (LCP 5 years, 71.9% vs. 41.7%; P = 0.007). The difference in RT field also affected both the OAS rate and the DFS rate. Patients who received RT doses >= 50 Gy tended to achieve favorable local control. CONCLUSIONS. In the management of nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma, the RT field affected treatment outcomes. RT doses >= 50 Gy resulted in favorable local control. © 2005 American Cancer Society.",Excluded

We have previously shown significant pathology in the heart and kidney of murine hematopoietic-acute radiation syndrome (H-ARS) survivors of 8.7-9.0 Gy total-body irradiation (TBI). The goal of this study was to determine temporal relationships in the development of vasculopathy and the progression of renal and cardiovascular delayed effects of acute radiation exposure (DEARE) at TBI doses less than 9 Gy and to elucidate the potential roles of senescence, inflammation and oxidative stress. Our results show significant loss of endothelial cells in coronary arteries by 4 months post-TBI (8.53 or 8.72 Gy of gamma radiation). This loss precedes renal dysfunction and interstitial fibrosis and progresses to abnormalities in the arterial media and adventitia and loss of coronary arterioles. Major differences in radiation-induced pathobiology exist between the heart and kidney in terms of vasculopathy progression and also in indices of inflammation, senescence and oxidative imbalance. The results of this work suggest a need for different medical countermeasures for multiple targets in different organs and at various times after acute radiation injury to prevent the progression of DEARE.",Included

Treatment of this pain has not yet been successful. Patients with postherpetic neuralgia will therefore benefit from any progress in the treatment strategy. The authors performed gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS) as a noninvasive treatment for postherpetic trigeminal neuralgia (TN) and evaluated the success rate for pain relief. Methods. Between 1995 and February 1999, six men and 10 women were treated for postherpetic TN; conservative treatment failed in all of them. The median follow up was 33 months (range 8-34 months). The radiation was focused on the root of the trigeminal nerve in the vicinity of the brainstem (maximal dose 70-80 Gy in one fraction, 4-mm collimator). The patients were divided into five groups according to degree of pain relief after treatment. A successful result (excellent, very good, and good) was reached in seven (44%) patients and radiosurgery failed in nine (56%). Pain relief occurred after a median interval of 1 month (range 10 days-6 months). No radiation-related side effects have been observed in these patients. Conclusions. These results suggest that GKS for postherpetic TN is a relatively successful and safe method that can be used in patients even if they are in poor condition.

Background: To evaluate the safety of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) of bone metastases in oligometastatic disease and to investigate prognostic factors of local control (LC), progression/disease-free survival (PDFS), and overall survival (OS). Method(s): Eligibility criteria were number of metastates <=5, controlled primary tumor without evidence of progression under systemic therapy, exclusion of surgery, and no previous radiotherapy of the lesion of interest. Oligometastatic status was classified into only bone (BOD) and outside bone disease (OBOD), whereas SBRT was delivered to bone lesions using 2 different schedules: 24 Gy/1 fraction or 27 Gy/3 fractions. A positron emission tomography study of the lesion of interest was performed at baseline and at 3 months after SBRT to evaluate metabolic response according to European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) criteria. A Cox regression model was used for univariate and multivariate analysis. Result(s): Between January 2010 and December 2013, 40 patients were enrolled. Only 1 patient experienced severe late toxicity (radiation-related fracture). Local control was longer among responders' than nonresponders' lesions (94.2% and 91.2% versus 63% and 35% at 1 and 2 years, respectively) (p = 0.004; hazard ratio = 9.958). The multivariate analysis of PDFS showed a significant correlation with planning target volume (PTV) size (p = 0.003) and oligometastatic status (p = 0.002). The multivariate analysis of OS confirmed a statistically significant value of the oligometastatic status (p = 0.002) and a significant trend for PTV size (p = 0.065).

Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 70 patients for whom ultrasound-guided PNL was planned for 20-30-mm single renal pelvic stones were prospectively allocated to group 1 (n:35) with middle calyx entry or group 2 (n:35) with lower calyx entry. Procedure-related parameters such as duration of operation, stone-free rates, complication rates, and radiation exposure time were analyzed in detail. Result(s): The mean age of the patients was 45.67 +/- 1.50 years and the mean stone size was 316.4 +/- 17.95 mm2. There was no significant difference regarding the age, BMI, stone burden, and the grade of hydronephrosis between the groups. Skin to collecting system distance was significantly shorter in the middle calyx entrance (p = 0.021). Total duration of the procedure was again significantly shorter in group 1 cases (74.69 +/- 2.94 min) than in group 2 (84.29 +/- 4.25 min) (p = 0.003). Regarding the success rates, the postoperative stone-free rate was higher in group 1 (91.4% in group 1, 80.0% in group 2, p = 0.305). Last, there was no statistically significant difference in hemoglobin reduction rates, blood transfusion requirements, and complication rates between the 2 groups. Conclusion(s): Getting access to the renal pelvis through the middle calyx during ultrasonic guided PNL procedure is more advantageous to lower the calyceal approach by reducing both the duration of the PNL procedure with significantly higher stone-free and comparable complication rates.© 2020 S.

Result(s): Neck computed tomography scans had a mean effective dose of 2.18 mSv. The mean effective dose for head computed tomography scans was 1.53 mSv. The highest mean equivalent organ dose was for the thyroid with the neck computed tomography scan and the lenses of the eyes with the head computed tomography scan. There was no significant difference between scan lengths in each computed tomography acquisition. There was a noticeable correlation observed between effective radiation dose and tube current. As anticipated, young people had a higher life attributable risk of cancer compared to the elderly. This amount was less than 0.011 per 100 persons for both computed tomography studies. Conclusion(s): Our data showed a significant organ radiation dose in both neck and head computed tomography scans, not only for the thyroid and the lenses of the eyes, but also for the chest.Copyright © 2019, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.

4490,"Optic Nerve Sheath Meningioma: Visual Improvement During Radiation Treatment. Purpose: To describe four patients with optic nerve sheath meningioma in whom visual improvement began to occur even before completion of a standard course of radiation therapy. Design(s): Retrospective case review. Method(s): A review was conducted of 35 patients who received stereotactic three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy for optic nerve sheath meningioma from 1990 to 2005. Result(s): Four patients with radiographic confirmation of optic nerve sheath meningioma were identified who had neuro-ophthalmologic assessment, which included perimetry, either while radiation treatment was underway or immediately afterwards. All of the patients showed improvement in visual acuity and visual fields. Conclusion(s): A rapid response to radiation therapy may occur in some patients with optic nerve sheath meningioma. In such patients, it may be possible to customize the radiation dose by assessing of visual function during the course of therapy. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
4491,"Heliotherapy improves vitamin D balance and atopic dermatitis. BACKGROUND: Vitamin D insufficiency during winter is common in the Nordic countries. Heliotherapy (HT) may heal atopic dermatitis (AD) but its effect on vitamin D balance has not been examined., OBJECTIVES: To study the effect of HT on serum calcidiol (25-hydroxyvitamin D) concentration and on healing of AD., METHODS: Twenty-three adult patients with AD received a 2-week course of HT in the Canary Islands in either January or March 2005. Daily solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation was measured and personal UV exposure calculated as standard erythema doses (SED). Blood samples were taken during HT and during a 1-2 month follow-up. Serum calcidiol concentration was measured by radioimmunoassay. Healing of AD was examined by SCORAD index., RESULTS: Before HT 17 (74%) AD patients had vitamin D insufficiency (calcidiol < 50 nmol L(-1)) and four patients high (> 80 nmol L(-1)) serum calcidiol values. The median personal UV dose during the 2-week HT course was 60 SED in the January group and 109 SED in the March group. Serum calcidiol concentration increased significantly in both groups, by 13.4 and 24.0 nmol/L(-1), respectively, and after HT only four (17%) patients had vitamin D insufficiency. SCORAD improved from 34 to 9 in the January HT group and from 30 to 9 in the March group., CONCLUSIONS: A 2-week course of HT significantly improved vitamin D balance by increasing serum calcidiol concentration, and caused a marked healing of AD. These parallel positive responses should be taken into account when the benefits of HT are considered.",Excluded
4492,"Patient-reported voice and speech outcomes after whole-neck intensity modulated radiation therapy and chemotherapy for oropharyngeal cancer: Prospective longitudinal study. Purpose To describe voice and speech quality changes and their predictors in patients with locally advanced oropharyngeal cancer treated on prospective clinical studies of organ-preserving chemotherapy-intensity modulated radiation therapy (chemo-IMRT). Methods and Materials Ninety-one patients with stage III/IV oropharyngeal cancer were treated on 2 consecutive prospective studies of definitive chemoradiation using whole-field IMRT from 2003 to 2011. Patient-reported voice and speech quality were longitudinally assessed from before treatment through 24 months using the Communication Domain of the Head and Neck Quality of Life (HNQOL-C) instrument and the Speech question of the University of Washington Quality of Life (UWQOL-S) instrument, respectively. Factors associated with patient-reported voice quality worsening from baseline and speech impairment were assessed. Results Voice quality decreased maximally at 1 month, with 68% and 41% of patients reporting worse HNQOL-C and UWQOL-S scores compared with before treatment, and improved thereafter, recovering to baseline by 12-18 months on average. In contrast, observer-rated larynx toxicity was rare (7% at 3 months; 5% at 6 months). Among patients with mean glottic larynx (GL) dose <=20 Gy, >20-30 Gy, >30-40 Gy, >40-50 Gy, and >50 Gy, 10%, 32%, 25%, 30%, and 63%, respectively, reported worse voice quality at 12 months compared with before treatment (P=.011). Results for speech impairment were similar. Glottic larynx dose, N stage, neck dissection, oral cavity dose, and time since chemo-IMRT were univariately associated with either voice worsening or speech impairment. On multivariate analysis, mean GL dose remained independently predictive for both voice quality worsening (8.1%/Gy) and speech impairment (4.3%/Gy). Conclusions Voice quality worsening and speech impairment after chemo-IMRT for locally advanced oropharyngeal cancer were frequently reported by patients, underrecognized by clinicians, and independently associated with GL dose. These findings support reducing mean GL dose to as low as reasonably achievable, aiming at <=20 Gy when the larynx is not a target. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
4493,"Evaluation of endogenous control gene(s) for gene expression studies in human blood exposed to 60Co gamma-rays ex vivo. In gene expression studies, it is critical to normalize data using a stably expressed endogenous control gene in order to obtain accurate and reliable results. However, we currently do not have a universally applied endogenous control gene for normalization of data for gene expression studies, particularly those involving (60)Co gamma-ray-exposed human blood samples. In this study, a comparative assessment of the gene expression of six widely used housekeeping endogenous control genes, namely 18S, ACTB, B2M, GAPDH, MT-ATP6 and CDKN1A, was undertaken for a range of (60)Co gamma-ray doses (0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 Gy) at 8.4 Gy min(-1) at 0 and 24 h post-irradiation time intervals. Using the NormFinder algorithm, real-time PCR data obtained from six individuals (three males and three females) were analyzed with respect to the threshold cycle (Ct) value and abundance, DELTACt pair-wise comparison, intra- and inter-group variability assessments, etc. GAPDH, either alone or in combination with 18S, was found to be the most suitable endogenous control gene and should be used in gene expression studies, especially those involving qPCR of gamma-ray-exposed human blood samples.

4494,"Relative Safety of External Beam Radiation Therapy in Lung Transplant Recipients Who Develop Thoracic Malignancies. We report outcomes for three patients who previously received lung transplants, subsequently developed malignancies, and were given radiation therapy to the chest for treatment of their cancers despite lack of scientific data on radiation tolerance of transplanted lung. None of three patients exhibited early or delayed adverse reactions to radiotherapy. For these three cases, the mean dose to the ipsilateral transplanted lung was 10 Gy, and ipsilateral lung relative volume of lung receiving 20 Gy or more was, on average, 22%. These doses are relatively low and would have been considered safe for patients with native lungs. In our opinion, tolerance of transplanted lung to therapeutic radiotherapy clearly requires additional research. While those data are pending, radiation therapy to the thorax should not be ruled out on the basis of having a lung transplant alone, provided lung dose can be maintained as low as possible using meticulous treatment planning.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

4495,"Brachytherapy and percutaneous stenting in the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma: A prospective randomised study. Purpose: To evaluate the effect of radiation therapy including intraluminal brachyterapy with iridium-192 on survival of patients with malignant biliary strictures (cholangiocarcinoma, histologically improved) treated with metallic stent in a prospective randomised study. Method and materials: In the prospective randomised study, 21 patients with cholangiocarcinoma were treated with implantation of percutaneous stents followed with intraluminal Ir-192 brachytherapy (mean dose 30 Gy) and external radiotherapy (mean dose 50 Gy) and 21 patients were treated only with stents insertion. We did not find any statistically significant differences in age and tumor localization between these two groups of patients. Result(s): All the patients died. In the group of patients treated with brachytherapy and with stent implantation, the mean survival time was 387.9 days. In the group of patients treated only with stent insertion the mean survival was 298 days. In effort to eliminate possible effect of external radiotherapy we treated the control group of eight patients with cholangiocarcinoma by stent insertion and brachyterapy only. Conclusion(s): Our results show that combined radiation therapy could extend the survival in the patients with cholangiocarcinoma obstruction. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

4497,"Acute toxicity in 14 patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma treated with concurrent cetuximab and radiotherapy. PURPOSE: The authors report acute toxicity in 14 patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma treated with radiotherapy and cetuximab., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data collection was performed prospectively on patients treated from September 2007 to March 2009. Treatment consisted of 64.8-70 Gy radiotherapy in conventional fractions and cetuximab., RESULTS: Two out of 14 patients did not complete the planned combined treatment; radiotherapy was temporarily suspended in six other patients. Seven of 12 patients received cetuximab until the end of radiotherapy. Treatment breaks were principally due to severe acute cutaneous or mucous toxicity. Any grade acneiform rash occurred in all patients. In-field G3-4 cutaneous toxicity occurred in five (36%) patients and G3-4 mucous toxicity in seven (50%). One patient died of sepsis., CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, severe acute toxic reactions are common in patients treated with radiotherapy and concurrent cetuximab, resulting in frequent breaks or incomplete treatment with potential reduction in disease control.",Excluded
4498,"Multifraction radiotherapy for palliation of painful bone metastases: 20 Gy versus 30 Gy. Aims and Background: To compare 2 multifraction radiotherapy schedules in the palliation of painful bone metastases. Methods and Study design: We retrospectively analyzed clinical data of 105 patients with a total of 140 painful bone metastases who were treated with 20 Gy in 5 fractions or 30 Gy in 10 fractions. The primary tumors were breast (30%), lung (28%), and prostate (14%). The main sites of irradiation were spine (n = 79) and sacrum or pelvis (n = 39). Pain was graded by patients according to the pain numeric rating scale just before and 1 month after radiotherapy. Pain progression was defined as an increase .2 on pain scale after an initial response. Result(s): The overall response rate at 1 month was 88.6%. Overall response rate was 89.6% in the 20-Gy arm and 87.3% in the 30-Gy arm (p = 0.669). The rate of complete response was statistically better in patients treated with 30 Gy (p = 0.019). The mean reduction in pain was 3.2 in the 20-Gy group and 3.6 in the 30-Gy group. Pain progression was 6.5% and 1.6%, respectively. The incidence of acute toxicity was statistically significantly higher in the 30-Gy arm (23.8%) than in the 20-Gy arm (2.6%) (p = 0.001). One pathologic fracture of the irradiated bone was observed in the 30-Gy arm. Two lesions, one in each group, were re-irradiated for pain recurrence. Pain progression was found in 6.5% of the irradiated lesions in the 20-Gy arm and in 1.6% in the 30-Gy arm. Conclusion(s): In our series, both regimens achieved high rate of pain relief, although the group treated with higher total dose reported better complete response rate. The 30-Gy arm had a significantly higher rate of acute toxicity.Copyright © 2015 INTM, Italy. Published by Wichtig Publishing.",Excluded
4499,"Mature results of a Phase II trial on individualized radiation dose-escalation based on normal tissue constraints in concurrent chemo-radiation for stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Purpose/Objective(s): Concurrent chemo-radiation and dose-escalation are strategies to improve overall survival (OS) in Stage III NSCLC. Previously, we have shown the efficacy of individualized dose escalation based on normal tissue constraints in sequential chemo-radiation (van Baardwijk et al, J Clin Oncol 2010). Here, we report the mature results of a Phase II trial (NCT00572325) on individualized radiation dose-escalation in concurrent chemo-radiation. Materials/Methods: Stage III NSCLC patients fit for concurrent chemo-radiation (PS 0-2; FEV1 and DLCO >30%) were included. An individualized prescribed total tumor dose (TTD) based on normal tissue dose constraints was applied: mean lung dose (MLD) 19 Gy, spinal cord dose 54 Gy and brachial plexus dose 66 Gy. RT planning was 4D-PET-CT based. ATTD between 51 and 69 Gy was delivered in 1.5 Gy fractions twice daily up to 45 Gy, followed by once daily fractions of 2 Gy. Radiotherapy (RT) was started at the second course of chemotherapy. OS and Progression Free Survival (PFS) were calculated from date of diagnosis (Kaplan-Meier). Toxicity was scored according to CTCAE v 3.0. Result(s): One hundred fifty patients (97 men and 53 women, median age 63.2 years) were included from April 2006 until December 2009. Stage: IIB 0.7%, IIIA 34.7%, IIIB 64.6%, including 7 patients (9.7%) with recurrent disease. Median total GTV (+/- SD, range): 73.9 +/- 91.3 cc (3.7-518.9 cc). Median TTD was 65.0 +/- 5.9 Gy (51-69.0 Gy) given in an OTTof 35 days (equals a scheme of 74 Gy in 37 fractions QD in 7.4 weeks). The median MLD was 16.3 +/- 3.7 Gy (4.4-21.0 Gy). Six patients (4.0%) did not complete radiotherapy (3 due to toxicity, 3 patient's wish). Severe acute toxicity (>=Grade 3, n = 51, 34.0%) consisted mainly of Grade 3 dysphagia during RT (24.0%) and 1 month after RT (6.0%). Pulmonary complaints were less frequent: Grade 3 and 4 dyspnea resp. 2.7% and 0.7% and 8.7% Grade 3 cough.With regard to late toxicity: 4% Grade 3 dysphagia (e.g., stenosis/ulcus), 2% thoracic empyema or fistula and 1 patient died of a radiation pneumonitis (0.7%). Five patients (3.3%) died within 3 months after start of RT (pulmonary causes n = 2; sepsis n = 1; cardiomyopathy n = 1; unknown cause n = 1).With a median FU of 29.4 months (95% CI 26.1-32.6 months), the median OS was 24.2 months (95% CI 18.9-29.6 months; 2year OS 51.5%) and the median PFS 16.5 months (95% CI 11.9-21.1 months). Eighty-six patients (57.6%) showed recurrent disease: 13.4% local and/or regional recurrence, 26.7% distant metastasis and 17.3% a combination of both as first event. Conclusion(s): Individualized dose prescription in concurrent chemo-radiation based on normal tissue constraints is feasible with acceptable severe late toxicity (<7%) and promising results with a 2-year OS of 51.5%.",Excluded
4500,"Posterior capsule opacification severity, assessed with straylight measurement, as main indicator of early visual function deterioration. PURPOSE: To study the effect of posterior capsule opacification (PCO) morphology and severity on different aspects of visual function (VF): the small-angle domain (visual acuity [VA], contrast sensitivity [CS]) and large-angle domain (straylight; logarithm of the straylight parameter s [log{s}]). To evaluate whether straylight is a valuable additional indicator for appropriate posterior capsulotomy referral., DESIGN: Prospective, comparative study., PARTICIPANTS AND CONTROLS: For the study population, 240 pseudophakic eyes with PCO and a capsulotomy indication were selected. For the reference population, 99 pseudophakic eyes without PCO were selected., METHODS: The relation between PCO morphology and PCO severity and the precapsulotomy and postcapsulotomy logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR), logarithm of CS (log[CS]), and log(s) values were determined. The PCO severity was assessed with retroillumination using evaluation of posterior capsule opacification (EPCO) software. Precapsulotomy logMAR and log(s) values were used to predict functionally significant logMAR and log(s) improvement after capsulotomy., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The logMAR, log(CS), and log(s) improvements of >=0.20 log units were considered functionally significant (i.e., treatment effect). Precapsulotomy logMAR and log(s) values, above which a treatment effect (improvement>=0.20 log units) can be expected with >=50% probability, were determined and called cutoff values., RESULTS: Postcapsulotomy VF improvement was related to precapsulotomy VF values: Postcapsulotomy improvement was largest in cases with substantially impaired precapsulotomy VF parameters. Visual function deterioration was related to PCO severity rather than PCO morphology. The PCO severity (EPCO score) assessed with retroillumination has a progressive, linear relation with log(s) and a curvilinear relation with logMAR. Reflected light examination is expected to overestimate functional PCO severity. The precapsulotomy cutoff value was >=1.44 for log(s) and >=0.21 for logMAR., CONCLUSIONS: The linear relation between retroillumination PCO severity and log(s) indicates that log(s) is sensitive to low PCO severity, whereas the curvilinear relation between PCO severity and logMAR indicates that logMAR is unaffected by low PCO severity. Straylight is a sensitive, additional indicator for capsulotomy referral, especially in less severe cases of PCO. In ophthalmic practice, the precapsulotomy log(s) cutoff value of 1.44 can be used as an indicator for beneficial capsulotomy referral., FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE(S): The author(s) have no proprietary or commercial interest in any materials discussed in this article.

4501,"Ultraviolet-radiation-induced erythema and suppression of contact hypersensitivity responses in patients with polymorphic light eruption. Ultraviolet-radiation suppresses cell-mediated immunity in healthy humans. It has been postulated that, in the short term, this immunosuppression prevents autoimmune responses to ultraviolet-radiation damaged skin. Patients with polymorphic light eruption (PLE) demonstrate abnormal responses to ultraviolet-radiation suggestive of an immune response to an ultraviolet-radiation-induced antigen. We investigated whether PLE patients (n=22) were resistant to ultraviolet-radiation-induced immunosuppression compared to skin-type, aged-matched controls (n=23). Groups of patients and controls (six subjects per group) received a single dose of solar-simulated ultraviolet-radiation of either 0, 0.6, 1 or 2 minimal erythema doses (MED). Erythema was quantified using a reflectance meter and all volunteers were sensitised on the irradiated site with dinitrochlorobenzene. Contact hypersensitivity responses (CHS) to dinitrochlorobenzene were quantified after challenge using ultrasound. Ultraviolet-radiation-induced erythema was comparable in patients and controls. CHS was comparable in unirradiated patients and controls. UVR-induced a dose-dependent suppression of CHS in all volunteers but patients were more resistant to immunosuppression after 1MED. Exposure to 1MED suppressed CHS by 78% in controls but induced less suppression in patients (44%, p < 0.01).

4502,"Image-guided stereotactic ablative radiotherapy for the liver: a safe and effective treatment. AIMS: Stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) is a non-invasive treatment option for inoperable patients or patients with irresectable liver tumors. Outcome and toxicity were evaluated retrospectively in this single-institution patient cohort., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2010 and 2014, 39 lesions were irradiated in 33 consecutive patients (18 male, 15 female, median age of 68 years). All the lesions were liver metastases (n = 34) or primary hepatocellular carcinomas (n = 5). The patients had undergone four-dimensional respiration-correlated PET-CT for treatment simulation to capture tumor motion. We analyzed local control with a focus on CT-based response at three months, one year and two years after treatment, looking at overall survival and the progression pattern., RESULTS: All patients were treated with hypofractionated image-guided stereotactic radiotherapy. The equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions varied from 62.5 Gy to 150 Gy, delivered in 3-10 fractions (median dose 93.8 Gy, alpha/beta = 10). The CT-based regression pattern three months after radiotherapy revealed partial regression in 72.7% of patients with a complete remission in 27.3% of the cases. The site of first progression was predominantly distant. One- and two-year overall survival rates were 85.4% and 68.8%, respectively. No toxicity of grade 2 or higher according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 was observed., CONCLUSION: SABR is a safe and efficient treatment for selected inoperable patients or irresectable tumors of the liver. Future studies should combine SABR with systemic treatment acting in synergy with radiation, such as immunological interventions or hypoxic cell radiosensitizers to prevent distant relapse.

4503,"Comprehensive toxicity risk profiling in radiation therapy for head and neck cancer: A new concept for individually optimised treatment. Background and purpose: A comprehensive individual toxicity risk profile is needed to improve radiation treatment optimisation, minimising toxicity burden, in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. We aimed to develop and externally validate NTCP models for various toxicities at multiple time points. Material(s) and Method(s): Using logistic regression, we determined the relationship between normal tissue irradiation and the risk of 22 toxicities at ten time points during and after treatment in 750 HNC patients. The toxicities involved swallowing, salivary, mucosal, speech, pain and general complaints. Studied predictors included patient, tumour and treatment characteristics and dose parameters of 28 organs. The resulting NTCP models were externally validated in 395 HNC patients. Result(s): The NTCP models involved 14 organs that were associated with at least one toxicity. The oral cavity was the predominant organ, associated with 12 toxicities. Other important organs included the parotid and submandibular glands, buccal mucosa and swallowing muscles. In addition, baseline toxicity, treatment modality, and tumour site were common predictors of toxicity. The median discrimination performance (AUC) of the models was 0.71 (interquartile range: 0.68-0.75) at internal validation and 0.67 (interquartile range: 0.62-0.71) at external validation. Conclusion(s): We established a comprehensive individual toxicity risk profile that provides essential insight into how radiation exposure of various organs translates into multiple acute and late toxicities. This comprehensive understanding of radiation-induced toxicities enables a new radiation treatment optimisation concept that balances multiple toxicity risks simultaneously and minimises the overall toxicity burden for an individual HNC patient who needs to undergo radiation treatment.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s)",Excluded
4504,"Relation between quantitative coronary CTA and myocardial ischemia by adenosine stress myocardial CT perfusion. Background: Coronary-computed tomography angiography (CTA) has limited accuracy to predict myocardial ischemia. Besides luminal area stenosis, other coronary plaque morphology and composition parameters may help to assess ischemia. With the integration of coronary CTA and adenosine stress CT myocardial perfusion (CTP), reliable information regarding coronary anatomy and function can be derived in one procedure. This analysis aimed to investigate the association between coronary stenosis severity, plaque composition and morphology and the presence of ischemia measured with adenosine stress myocardial CTP. Methods and Results: 84 patients (age, 62 +/- 10 years; 48% men) who underwent sequential coronary CTA and adenosine stress myocardial CT perfusion were analyzed. Automated quantification was performed in all coronary lesions (quantitative CTA). Downstream myocardial ischemia was assessed by visual analysis of the rest and stress CTP images and defined as a summed difference score of >=1. One or more coronary plaques were present in 146 coronary arteries of which 31 (21%) were ischemia-related. Of the lesions with a stenosis percentage <50%, 50%-70%, and >70%, respectively, 9% (6/67), 18% (9/51), and 57% (16/28) demonstrated downstream ischemia. Furthermore, mean plaque burden, plaque volume, lesion length, maximal plaque thickness, and dense calcium volume were significantly higher in ischemia-related lesions, but only stenosis severity (%) (OR 1.06; 95% CI 1.02-1.10; P = .006) and lesion length (mm) (OR 1.26; 95% CI 1.02-1.55; P = .029) were independent correlates. Conclusion(s): Increasing stenosis percentage by quantitative CTA is positively correlated to myocardial ischemia measured with adenosine stress myocardial CTP. However, stenosis percentage remains a moderate determinant. Lumen area stenosis and lesion length were independently associated with ischemia, adjusted for coronary plaque volume, mean plaque burden, maximal lesion thickness, and dense calcium volume.Copyright © 2016, The Author(s).",Excluded

PURPOSE: To assess adding straylight measurements to the indication for cataract surgery., SETTING: Onze Lieve Vrouwe Hospital, Amsterdam, and Zonnestraal Eye Clinic, Hilversum, The Netherlands., DESIGN: Prospective interventional cohort study., METHODS: Before and after cataract extraction, corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) and straylight were recorded in all patients. Subjective complaints were documented by the 39-item National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-39) and a straylight questionnaire., RESULTS: The population comprised 217 patients with a mean age of 72 years +/- 9.12 (SD) (range 29 to 90 years). Preoperatively, the mean straylight was 1.55 +/- 0.29 log(s) and the mean CDVA, 0.28 +/- 0.21 logMAR. Visual acuity and straylight showed little correlation (R(2) = 0.08). The mean postoperative improvement in CDVA was 0.26 +/- 0.20 logMAR (range -0.12 to 1.12 logMAR) and in straylight, 0.31 +/- 0.32 log(s) (range -0.50 to 1.27 log[s]). The preoperative breakeven point (50% chance of postoperative improvement) was 0.06 logMAR for CDVA and 1.29 log(s) for straylight.

Ultrasound data were acquired from 10 open-chested Yorkshire pigs (25-33 kg) at baseline, during regional ischemia and during 30 min of stunning, using a broadband ultrasound transducer (3-7 MHz) sutured directly upon the left ventricular myocardial wall. Cyclic variation of integrated backscatter and myocardial wall thickening were calculated using three definitions obtained from the literature. Independent of the definition, cyclic variation of wall thickness and integrated backscatter were blunted during acute ischemia and returned transiently to or above baseline during the first minute of reperfusion, followed by a gradual decrease to a level under baseline during stunning. An early return of the cyclic variation of the integrated backscatter was not observed in pigs, independent of the data processing used.

4508,"Geometric Image Biomarker Changes of the Parotid Gland Are Associated With Late Xerostomia. Purpose To identify a surrogate marker for late xerostomia 12 months after radiation therapy (Xer12m), according to information obtained shortly after treatment. Methods and Materials Differences in parotid gland (PG) were quantified in image biomarkers (DELTAIBMs) before and 6 weeks after radiation therapy in 107 patients. By performing stepwise forward selection, DELTAIBMs that were associated with Xer12m were selected. Subsequently other variables, such as PG dose and acute xerostomia scores, were added to improve the prediction performance. All models were internally validated. Results Prediction of Xer12m based on PG surface reduction (DELTAPG-surface) was good (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.82). Parotid gland dose was related to DELTAPG-surface (P<.001, R2 = 0.27). The addition of acute xerostomia scores to the DELTAPG-surface improved the prediction of Xer12m significantly, and vice versa. The final model including DELTAPG-surface and acute xerostomia had outstanding performance in predicting Xer12m early after radiation therapy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.90). Conclusions Parotid gland surface reduction was associated with late xerostomia. The early posttreatment model with DELTAPG-surface and acute xerostomia scores can be considered as a surrogate marker for late xerostomia.Copyright © 2017 The Author(s)",Excluded

Conditioning regimen was low-dose total body irradiation (TBI, 2 Grays) only; fludarabine was added in patients without previous autologous stem cell transplantation and patients with matched unrelated donors received antithymocyte globulin in addition to fludarabine and TBI. Result(s): Following NMA overall response increased from 84 to 90%, complete remission rate from 15 to 32%. As part of first-line treatment NMA induced complete remission in 50% of patients vs one patient (4%) treated for relapsed multiple myeloma. Median progression-free survival was 26 months (13 months for the salvage group, 38 months for the 'upfront' patients). Median overall survival has not been reached yet. The achievement of complete remission following NMA as part of first-line treatment was associated with prolonged progression-free and overall survival. Major toxicities were acute and chronic graft-vs-host disease occurring in 64% (23% grade 3-4) and in 54% (49% extensive) patients, respectively. Seven patients (12%) died from nonrelapse mortality, five patients (9%) directly related to toxicity of NMA. Conclusion(s): NMA in multiple myeloma is feasible, is associated with acceptable nonrelapse mortality and may induce prolonged complete remission. In pretreated patients the result of NMA is disappointing which urges new strategies. © 2007 Van Zuiden Communications B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded
4510,"18 Years' experience with high dose rate strontium-90 brachytherapy of small to medium sized posterior uveal melanoma. Aim: To analyse local tumour control, radiation related complications, visual acuity, enucleation rate, and survival after brachytherapy of small to medium sized choroidal melanoma (CM) with a high dose rate (HDR) strontium-90 (Sr-90) applicator. Method(s): From 1983 until 2000, 98 eyes with CM were treated with Sr-90 brachytherapy. The main outcome measures were actuarial rates of the patients' survival, ocular conservation rate, tumour regression, complication rates, and preservation of visual acuity. End point rates were estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Result(s): The median follow up time was 6.7 years (0.5-18.8 years). Actuarial melanoma free patient survival rate was 85% (SE 4.8%) after 18 years. Actuarial rate of ocular conservation and complete tumour regression was 90% (SE 3.8%) after 15 years. In 93% local tumour control was achieved, 88% showed a stable scar. Recurrence of the tumour on the border caused enucleation of six eyes (7%). In three cases (4%) retinal detachment was the end point. No cases of optic atrophy or of sight impairing retinopathy outside the treated area were found. Actuarial rate of preservation of visual acuity of 1/10 was 65% at 5 years and 45% at 15 years of follow up (SE 5.9% and 8.8%). Conclusion(s): Sr-90 brachytherapy is as effective as iodine or ruthenium brachytherapy for small to medium sized CM but causes fewer complications. The preservation of vision is better than with all other described radioisotopes. HDR Sr-90 brachytherapy can therefore safely be recommended for small to medium sized CM.",Excluded
4511,"Cardiac valve calcifications on low-dose unenhanced ungated chest computed tomography: Inter-observer and inter-examination reliability, agreement and variability. Objectives: To determine inter-observer and inter-examination variability for aortic valve calcification (AVC) and mitral valve and annulus calcification (MC) in low-dose unenhanced ungated lung cancer screening chest computed tomography (CT). Method(s): We included 578 lung cancer screening trial participants who were examined by CT twice within 3 months to follow indeterminate pulmonary nodules. On these CTs, AVC and MC were measured in cubic millimetres. One hundred CTs were examined by five observers to determine the inter-observer variability. Reliability was assessed by kappa statistics (kappa) and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs). Variability was expressed as the mean difference +/- standard deviation (SD). Result(s): Inter-examination reliability was excellent for AVC (kappa=0.94, ICC=0.96) and MC (kappa=0.95, ICC=0.90). Inter-examination variability was 12.7+/-118.2 mm3 for AVC and 31.5+/-219.2 mm3 for MC. Inter-observer reliability ranged from kappa=0.68 to kappa=0.92 for AVC and from kappa=0.20 to kappa=0.66 for MC. Inter-observer ICC was 0.94 for AVC and ranged from 0.56 to 0.97 for MC. Inter-observer variability ranged from -30.5+/-252.0 mm3 to 84.0+/-240.5 mm3 for AVC and from -95.2+/-210.0 mm3 to 303.7+/-501.6 mm 3 for MC. Conclusion(s): AVC can be quantified with excellent reliability on ungated unenhanced low-dose chest CT, but manual detection of MC can be subject to substantial inter-observer variability. Lung cancer screening CT may be used for detection and quantification of cardiac valve calcifications. Key points: * Low-dose unenhanced ungated chest computed tomography can detect cardiac valve calcifications. * However, calcified cardiac valves are not reported by most radiologists. * Inter-observer and inter-examination variability of aortic valve calcifications is sufficient for longitudinal studies. * Volumetric measurement variability of mitral valve and annulus calcifications is substantial. © 2014 European Society of Radiology.",Excluded
4512,"Anatomical and functional changes in the upper airways of sleep apnea patients due to mandibular repositioning: A large scale study. The obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is a sleep related breathing disorder. A popular treatment is the use of a mandibular repositioning appliance (MRA) which advances the mandibula during the sleep and decreases the collapsibility of the upper airway. The success rate of such a device is, however, limited and very variable within a population of patients. Previous studies using computational fluid dynamics have shown that there is a decrease in upper airway resistance in patients who improve clinically due to an MRA. In this article, correlations between patient-specific anatomical and functional parameters are studied to examine how MRA induced biomechanical changes will have an impact on the upper airway resistance. Low-dose computed tomography (CT) scans are made from 143 patients suffering from OSAHS. A baseline scan and a scan after mandibular repositioning (MR) are performed in order to study variations in parameters. It is found that MR using a simulation bite is able to induce resistance changes by changing the pharyngeal lumen. The change in minimal cross-sectional area is the best parameter to predict the change in upper airway resistance. Looking at baseline values, the ideal patients for MR induced resistance decrease seem to be women with short airways, high initial resistance and no baseline occlusion. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Excluded
4513,"Intravesical glycosaminoglycan replenishment with chondroitin sulphate in chronic forms of cystitis: A multi-national, multi-centre, prospective observational clinical trial. Effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of instillation therapy with chondroitin sulphate (CAS 9082-07-9, Gepan instill) was investigated in a non-interventional study. 286 patients with clinically diagnosed chronic forms of cystitis, such as bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis, radiation cystitis, overactive bladder syndrome and chronically-recurring cystitis were included. The course of symptoms was documented over 8 instillations at maximum, covering a period of approximately three months. All main symptoms of chronic cystitis declined consistently and statistically significantly (p < 0.0001). Both daytime and nighttime micturition frequencies as well as the score levels of urgency and pain declined significantly during the course of treatment. The functional bladder capacity as indicated by the volume of first morning voiding increased from 157.9 ml +/- 7.5 to 186.7 ml +/- 6.9 (mean +/- SE; p < 0.0001). The level of urgency decreased from 6.8 +/- 0.1 to 3.4 +/- 0.2 (mean +/- SE; numerical rating scale (11-point box scale); p < 0.0001) and nocturia decreased from 4.0 +/- 0.2 to 2.1 +/- 0.1 times (mean +/- SE; p < 0.0001). Chondroitin sulphate instillation was effective and well tolerated in the therapy of chronic forms of cystitis associated with a possible GAG layer deficit (GAG layer: mainly composed of the glycosaminoglycans chondroitin sulphate, dermatan sulphate and heparan sulphate), but the results need to be confirmed in a controlled study. © ECV .

4514,"Preoperative Prediction of Pathologic Response to Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy in Patients With Esophageal Cancer Using 18F-FDG PET/CT and DW-MRI: A Prospective Multicenter Study. Purpose: Accurate preoperative prediction of pathologic response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) in patients with esophageal cancer could enable omission of esophagectomy in patients with a pathologic complete response (pCR). This study aimed to evaluate the individual and combined value of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography with integrated computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) during and after nCRT to predict pathologic response in patients with esophageal cancer. Methods and Materials: In this multicenter prospective study, patients scheduled to receive nCRT followed by esophagectomy for esophageal cancer underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT and DW-MRI scanning before the start of nCRT, during nCRT, and before esophagectomy. Response to nCRT was based on histopathologic evaluation of the resection specimen. Relative changes in 18F-FDG PET/CT and DW-MRI parameters were compared between patients with pCR and non-pCR groups. Multivariable ridge regression analyses with bootstrapped c-indices were performed to evaluate the individual and combined value of 18F-FDG PET/CT and DW-MRI. Result(s): pCR was found in 26.1% of 69 patients. Relative changes in 18F-FDG PET/CT parameters after nCRT (DELTA standardized uptake value [SUV]mean,post P = .016, and DELTA total lesion glycolysis post P = .024), as well as changes in DW-MRI parameters during nCRT (DELTA apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC]during P = .008) were significantly different between pCR and non-pCR. A c-statistic of 0.84 was obtained for a model with DELTAADCduring, DELTASUVmean,post, and histology in classifying patients as pCR (versus 0.82 for DELTAADCduring and 0.79 for DELTASUVmean,post alone). Conclusion(s): Changes on 18F-FDG PET/CT after nCRT and early changes on DW-MRI during nCRT can help identify pCR to nCRT in esophageal cancer. Moreover, 18F-FDG PET/CT and DW-MRI might be of complementary value in the assessment of pCR.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
4515,"Clinical outcomes of definitive chemoradiotherapy using carboplatin and paclitaxel in esophageal cancer. Patients with nonmetastatic esophageal cancer not suitable for surgery can be treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy with curative intent. The purpose of this retrospective study is to evaluate the clinical outcomes of definitive chemoradiotherapy using carboplatin and paclitaxel. Medical records were reviewed of patients treated for nonmetastatic squamous cell or adenocarcinoma of the esophagus between January 2009 and December 2013 in two collaborating institutes. Treatment consisted of external beam radiotherapy (28 fractions of 1.8 Gy) and 6 weekly courses of carboplatin (AUC = 2) and paclitaxel (50 mg/m2). Data on survival, progression, toxicity, and effect on dysphagia were recorded. Sixty-six patients were included. Median overall survival (OS) was 13.1 months (95% CI 4.7-21.5 months) and a 2-year OS was 30% (95% CI 18%-42%). At 2 years, 26% of patients developed local progression (95% CI 15%-37%) and 49% developed distant metastases (95% CI 36%-64%). Acute toxicity grade >=3 was observed in 47% of patients. Late adverse events grade >=3 were seen in 20%, mostly esophageal stenoses. Of patients with available data 3 months after treatment, 70% had relief of dysphagia. Definitive chemoradiotherapy led to a median OS of 13 months. Toxicity was common, mostly due to hematological toxicity. Given the relatively short median survival, an adequate selection of patients for this intensive treatment is required.Copyright © The Authors 2017.

4516,"Incidence of pseudoprogression in low-grade gliomas treated with radiotherapy. Background: As the incidence of pseudo-progressive disease (psPD), or pseudoprogression, in low-grade glioma (LGG) is unknown, we retrospectively investigated this phenomenon in a cohort of LGG patients given radiotherapy (RT)., Methods: All MRI scans and clinical data from patients with histologically proven LGG treated with radiation between 2000 and 2011 were reviewed. PsPD was scored when a new enhancing lesion occurred after RT and subsequently disappeared or remained stable for at least a year without therapy, including dexamethasone., Results: Sixty-three out of 71 patients who received RT for LGG were deemed eligible for evaluation of psPD. The median follow-up was 5 years (range 1-10 y). PsPD was seen in 13 patients (20.6%). PsPD occurred after a median of 12 months with a range of 3-78 months. The median duration of psPD was 6 months, with a range of 2-26 months and always occurred within the RT high dose fields of at least 45 Gy. The area of the enhancement at the time of psPD was significantly smaller compared with the area of enhancement during ""true"" progression (median size 54mm2 [range 12-340mm2] vs 270mm2 [range 30-3420mm2], respectively; P = .009)., Conclusions: PsPD occurs frequently in LGG patients receiving RT. This supports the policy to postpone a new line of treatment until progression is evident, especially when patients have small contrast enhancing lesions within the RT field.

4517,"Polarization Variability in Age-related Macular Degeneration. SIGNIFICANCE: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of irreversible vision loss. Complementary imaging techniques can be used to better characterize and quantify pathological changes associated with AMD. By assessing specific light-tissue interactions, polarization-sensitive imaging can be used to detect tissue disruption early in the disease process., PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare variability in central macular polarization properties in patients with nonexudative AMD and age-matched control subjects., METHODS: A scanning laser polarimeter (GDx, LDT/CZM) was used to acquire 15 x 15-degree macular images in 10 subjects diagnosed with nonexudative AMD and 10 age-matched control subjects. The coefficient of variation (COV, SD/mean) was used to quantify variability in pixel intensity in the central 3.3degree of the macula for custom images emphasizing multiply scattered light (the depolarized light image) and polarization-retaining light (the maximum of the parallel detector image). The intensity COV was compared across subject categories using paired t tests for each image type., RESULTS: The COV in the central macula was significantly higher in the AMD subject group (average, 0.221; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.157 to 0.265) when compared with matched control subjects (average 0.120; 95% CI, 0.107 to 0.133) in the depolarized light image (P = .01). The COV in the maximum of the parallel detector image was not statistically different between the two subject groups (AMD average, 0.162 [95% CI, 0.138 to 0.185]; control average, 0.137 [95% CI, 0.115 to 0.158]; P = .21)., CONCLUSIONS: Variability in multiply scattered light is higher than that of light that is more polarization preserving in patients with nonexudative AMD. Multiple scattering may act as an early indicator representing disruption to the macula in early AMD.",Excluded
4518,"Radiation doses and estimated risk from angiographic projections during coronary angiography performed using novel flat detector. Coronary angiography (CA) procedure uses various angiographic projections to elicit detailed information of the coronary arteries with some steep projections involving high radiation dose to patients. This study intends to evaluate radiation doses and estimated risk from angiographic projections during CA procedure performed using novel flat detector (FD) system with improved image processing and noise reduction techniques. Real-time monitoring of radiation doses using kerma-area product (KAP) meter was performed for 140 patients using Philips Clarity FD system. The CA procedure involved seven standard projections, of which five were extensively selected by interventionalists. Mean fluoroscopic time (FT), KAP, and reference air kerma (Ka,r) for CA procedure were 3.24 min (0.5-10.51), 13.99Gycm2 (4.02-37.6), and 231.43 mGy (73.8-622.15), respectively. Effective dose calculated using Monte Carlo-based PCXMC software was found to be 4.9mSv. Left anterior oblique (LAO) 45degree projection contributed the highest radiation dose (28%) of the overall KAP. Radiation-induced risk was found to be higher in females compared to males with increased risk of lung cancer. An increase of 10%-15% in radiation dose was observed when one or more additional projections were adopted along with the seven standard projections. A 14% reduction of radiation dose was achieved from novel FD system when low-dose protocol during fluoroscopy and medium-dose protocol during cine acquisitions were adopted, compared to medium-dose protocol.",Excluded
4519,"Early clinical outcomes for 3 radiation techniques for brain metastases: Focal versus whole-brain. Purpose: To present our novel technique for brain metastases (low-dose whole brain radiation therapy [WBRT] with simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) and focal, frameless stereotactic intensity modulated radiotherapy [IMRT]) in the context of patterns of failure, dosimetry, acute toxicity, and overall survival for 3 different radiation techniques. Methods and Materials: We retrospectively reviewed 92 patients undergoing radiation for brain metastases via the following: (1) ""prophylactic"" WBRT to a low dose (median 30 Gy) with an SIB to the gross tumor volume plus 2-3 mm margin (median dose 45 Gy) in 10-15 fractions; (2) focal, frameless image-guided stereotactic IMRT (S-IMRT) in 5 fractions to tumor only (median 30 Gy); or (3) conventional (c)WBRT using 2 lateral opposed beams in 10-15 fractions (30-37.5 Gy). The primary endpoints were local (LBC), distant (DBC), and total brain control (TBC) for each of the 3 types of brain radiation. Survival, toxicity, and dosimetry were reported as secondary endpoints. Result(s): LBC was achieved in 72%, 78%, and 56% for SIB, S-IMRT, and cWBRT, respectively. DBC (ie, no new brain metastases) was observed in 92%, 67%, and 81% for SIB, S-IMRT, and cWBRT, respectively. TBC (LBC + DBC) was 72%, 67%, and 56% for SIB, S-IMRT, and cWBRT, respectively. No statistical difference in overall survival was observed (P = .067), and only 1 patient experienced biopsy proven radionecrosis. Conclusion(s): TBC after low-dose WBRT with SIB was acceptable and at least comparable to S-IMRT and cWBRT. SIB seems to be a safe and effective treatment strategy for patients with brain metastases and may efficiently combine the benefits of cWBRT and stereotactic radiosurgery. © 2011 American Society for Radiation Oncology.",Excluded
4520,"[Characteristics of the humoral immune system and lipid peroxidation processes in people living in territories contaminated with radionuclides]. Among 33 patients with Stage II hypertension, 25 persons were inhabitants of the Russian radionuclide-contaminated areas and 8 patients had no prior contacts with ionizing radiation (control). All the patients examined were maintained within 4 weeks on a diet, radioprotective effect of which was realized due to the elevated content of sulfur containing amino acids, antioxidants and complexes. In the patients who lived in the radionuclide-contaminated areas, a moderate activation of lipid peroxidation was detected simultaneously with marked alterations in the humoral component of the immunity system, which involved a considerable increase in the levels of IgG and complements C3 and C4. A decrease in content of malonic dialdehyde and diene conjugates as well as normalization of IgG and decrease in content of IgA, IgM and C3 were observed in blood plasma of the patients on diet. Supplementation of omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega 3-PUFA), 5 g/day and alpha-tocopherol, 12.5 mg/day, to the diet elevated the serum concentrations of all lg classes, which suggests the presence of an immunomodulating effect of omega 3-PUFA. Moreover, the content of malonic dialdehyde was not increased in blood plasma if 3-PUFA was used. Hence, increased alpha-tocopherol levels should be used in the treatment of these patients with omega 3-PUFA (up to 5-7 mg per g PUFA) in order to stabilize lipid peroxidation.",Excluded
4521,"Mayak worker dosimetry study: an overview. The Mayak Production Association (MPA) was the first plutonium production plant in the former Soviet Union. Workers at the MPA were exposed to relatively large internal radiation intakes and external radiation exposures, particularly in the early years of plant operations. This paper describes the updated dosimetry database, ""Doses-2005."" Doses-2005 represents a significant improvement in the determination of absorbed organ dose from external radiation and plutonium intake for the original cohort of 18,831 Mayak workers. The methods of dose reconstruction of absorbed organ doses from external radiation uses: 1) archive records of measured dose and worker exposure history, 2) measured energy and directional response characteristics of historical Mayak film dosimeters, and 3) calculated dose conversion factors for Mayak Study-defined exposure scenarios using Monte Carlo techniques. The methods of dose reconstruction for plutonium intake uses two revised models developed from empirical data derived from bioassay and autopsy cases and/or updates from prevailing or emerging International Commission on Radiological Protection models. Other sources of potential significant exposure to workers such as medical diagnostic x-rays, ambient onsite external radiation, neutron radiation, intake of airborne effluent, and intake of nuclides other than plutonium were evaluated to determine their impact on the dose estimates.",Excluded
4522,"Effects of gamma irradiation on mechanical properties of defatted trabecular bone allografts assessed by speed-of-sound measurement. New sterilization methods for human bone allografts may lead to alterations in bone mechanical properties, which strongly influence short- and medium-term outcomes. In many sterilization procedures, bone allografts are subjected to gamma irradiation, usually with 25 KGy, after treatment and packaging. We used speed-of-sound (SOS) measurements to evaluate the effects of gamma irradiation on bone. All bone specimens were subjected to the same microbial inactivation procedure. They were then separated into three groups, of which one was treated and not irradiated and two were exposed to 10 and 25 KGy of gamma radiation, respectively. SOS was measured using high- and low-frequency ultrasound beams in each orthogonal direction. SOS and Young modulus were altered significantly in the three groups, compared to native untreated bone. Exposure to 10 or 25 KGy had no noticeable effect on the study variables. The impact of irradiation was small compared to the effects of physical or chemical defatting. Reducing the radiation dose used in everyday practice failed to improve graft mechanical properties in this study. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.",Included
4523,"Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) of lesions occupying renal space. Indications, limits, personal experience. In focal kidney disease, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) using 2 nd generation contrast enhancement allows continuous dynamic assessment of the arterial, venous and late perfusion phases of the renal parenchyma, as well as of focal lesions. CEUS is particularly useful in cases of an uncertain diagnosis after the performance of unenhanced ultrasound (US) and echocolorDoppler (ECD) (e.g. dromedary humps, hypertrophic column of Bertin, outcomes of pyelonephritis), and for differential diagnosis of simple cysts with a suspicious appearance (e.g. cysts with a dense content, calcified cysts) and complex cysts of Bosniak types 2, 3 and 4. Instead, lesions shown to be solid at unenhanced US must be directly evaluated by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), both to gain a panoramic view and because CEUS is often unable to reveal the precise nature of such lesions. In agreement with the literature, this experience (18 cases) confirms the utility of CEUS in the diagnosis of renal pseudolesions and complex cystic formations, reducing both the risk of radiation exposure and the use of the more costly CT and MRI methodologies.",Excluded

In the Ames test for mutagenicity, 2-F-A-85380 was without effect in five bacterial strains. No evidence of gross pathology or histopathological changes occurred in either 2-day acute (0.4-4000 nmol/kg i.v.) or 14-day expanded acute (40-4000 nmol/kg i.v.) toxicity studies in mice. Similarly, hematology and serum chemistry values in rhesus monkeys administered 60 nmol/kg i.v. were not affected over 14 days. Like nicotine, 2-F-A-85380 produced convulsions in mice at very high doses. The ED(50) value of 2-F-A-85380 for eliciting tonic-clonic convulsions (5.0 micromol/kg i.v.) was nearly 4 times greater than that of nicotine (ED(50) = 1.4 micromol/kg i.v.). Lower doses of 2-F-A-85380 (30-300 nmol/kg i.v.) and nicotine (20-400 nmol/kg i.v.) increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac contractility in rats. Notably, the PR, QRS, or QTc intervals of the rat electrocardiogram were unaffected by either drug. Dosimetry studies indicated that the urinary bladder wall was the critical organ and total radiation exposure was within acceptable limits.

Purpose: To compare treatment response between glass and resin yttrium-90 (90Y) microsphere radioembolization of hepatic metastasis from colorectal and other systemic malignancies. Material(s) and Method(s): A retrospective analysis was performed on 70 patients with hepatic metastasis treated with glass or resin 90Y radioembolization from 2008 to 2014 at an academic medical center. Up to 2 treated lesions per lobe were measured using cross-sectional imaging in the X, Y, and Z planes at baseline and at 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month intervals. Response was evaluated using the World Health Organization (WHO) and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria. Result(s): A total of 70 patients were evaluated with 39 (56%) receiving resin and 31 (44%) receiving glass particles. Of those, 34 (49%) patients had metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with a mean MELD score of 8.5 (SD 2.1), and 36 (51%) had other primary malignancies with a mean MELD score of 7.7 (SD 1.7). Thirty-seven (53%) patients were female with a mean age of 59.7 years (SD 12.3) at treatment 1. Patients received an average radiation dose of 1.12 gigabecquerel (GBq) (SD 0.33) with resin treatments, compared to 3.08 GBq (SD 1.09) with glass treatments. Evaluation of (Table presented) tumor response using WHO criteria found 1 (2.6%) patient had a complete response (CR), 13 (33.3%) had partial responses (PR), 19 (48.7%) had stable disease (SD), and 6 (15.4%) had progressive disease (PD) when treated with resin particles, and 0 (0.0%) had CR, 5 (16.1%) had PR, 21 (67.7%) had SD, and 5 (16.1%) had PD when treated with glass particles. RECIST 1.1 response criteria demonstrated 1 (2.6%) patient had CR, 13 (33.3%) had PR, 18 (46.2%) had SD, and 7 (17.9%) had PD when treated with resin, and 0 (0.0%) had CR, 7 (22.6%) had PR, 19 (61.3%) had SD, and 5 (16.1%) had PD when treated with glass (Table 1). Due to small sample sizes, we were unable to perform formal significance testing on the distribution of response by treatment type. Conclusion(s): Although both glass and resin 90Y microspheres are efficacious treatments for nonresectable metastatic hepatic disease, there is limited data on direct comparison of imaging response between the 2 treatment types. Our study demonstrates that resin-based 90Y therapy offers a comparable response when compared to glassbased 90Y therapy at nearly one-third the dose of radiation.",Excluded
4526,"Effect of topical morphine (mouthwash) on oral pain due to chemotherapy- and/or radiotherapy-induced mucositis: a randomized double-blinded study. PURPOSE: The objective of the study was to determine if mouthwashes with a morphine-containing solution decrease oral pain associated with radiotherapy- and/or chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis (OM). METHOD(S): Randomized double-blinded crossover study to evaluate the effect of topical oral application of 2 per thousand morphine solution in patients suffering from radiotherapy- and/or chemotherapy-induced OM. Participants assigned to either the morphine solution or a placebo mouthwash received one of the solutions days 1-3 and were then switched over to the other treatment for days 4-6. RESULT(S): Nine patients were randomized in both groups. All patients (mean age, 55.1 +/- 3.0) except one had head and neck cancers. Mean intensity of pain associated with mucosal injury (World Health Organization [WHO] mucositis > or =2) was on a 10-point visual analogue scale: 6.0 +/- 2.7). The analysis of variance (ANOVA) model that included morphine or placebo, day and time of mouthwash, and mouthwash effect shows that pain alleviation 1 hour after mouthwash was significantly influenced by the gesture of the mouthwash (p < 0.001 with either morphine or placebo) and almost by the efficiency of morphine (p = 0.020). Duration of pain relief was 123.7 (standard deviation [SD] +/- 98.2) minutes for morphine. Most other reported symptoms were present at the baseline and were probably associated with the main disease and not secondary to the morphine mouthwash. CONCLUSION(S): Our results suggest a possible analgesic effect of topical morphine in line with previous studies. However, more efforts must be made for the adjustment of systemic analgesics and the development of new alternatives to treat locally OM-associated pain.",Excluded

IVUS/VH-derived parameters were compared in 60 patients with an intermediate coronary lesion (40-70 %) between lesions that did or did not result in MACE over 12 months. IVUS/VH measurements were done at the site of the minimal lumen area (MLA) and on a per-plaque basis, defined by 40 % plaque burden. Pre-specified, adjudicated MACE events occurred in 5 of 60 patients (8.3 %). MACE lesions had larger plaque burden (65 % vs. 53 %, p = 0.004), less dense calcium (6.6 % vs. 14.7 %, p = 0.05), and more non-calcified plaque, mostly fibrofatty kind (17.6 % vs. 10 %, p = 0.02). Intermediate coronary lesions associated with MACE at 12 months have more plaque, less dense calcium, and more non-calcified plaque, particularly fibrofatty tissue by IVUS/VH.",Excluded
4528,"Effect of Amifostine to prevent radiotherapy-induced acute and late toxicity in head and neck cancer patients who had normal or mild impaired salivary gland function. BACKGROUND: Amifostine has a potential role for salivary gland protection in head and neck cancer patients who had radiotherapy., MATERIAL AND METHOD: Sixty-seven head and neck cancer patients were randomized to receive radiotherapy or radiotherapy plus Amifostine. The efficacy of the treatment was determined by a questionnaire evaluating dryness of mouth and the oral comfort, the RTOG/EORTC acute/late radiation morbidity scoring criteria, collection of the whole saliva and the 99mTc-pertecnetate scintigraphy of the salivary glands., RESULTS: Amifostine significantly reduced the mean questionnaire scores from 6.49 to 3.73, the incidence of grade > or = 2 mucositis from 75% to 36% and acute xerostomia from 82% to 39%. The salivary gland function returned to normal at a rate of 36.3% in the Amifostine group versus 9.1% in the control group., CONCLUSION: Amifostine is effective in reducing the incidence and severity of acute mucositis, acute and late xerostomia in head and neck cancer patients.",Excluded

Radiation exposure of radiologists' left and right hands during 44 percutaneous drainages involving fluoroscopy was measured with thermoluminescent dosimeters. Finger doses of 3.4-1,300 microGy (mean 180, median 110) were recorded. Finger exposure seemed to show a significant, positive correlation with the screening time, but not with the patients' body mass indexes or ages. The mean personal doses of the radiologists were different and, in one case, the difference between the individual radiologists' doses was statistically significant. The personal working technique may therefore partly explain the amount of radiation exposure to the fingers.",Excluded

Doses to the radiologists and assistants were generally modest, and the yearly dose limits of ICRP will not be exceeded in practice. The doses to the radiologist's fingers were found to be the most restrictive in this study. Regarding the mean dose to the radiologist's fingers (190 muGy), the yearly dose limit of 500 mSv would be exceeded after about 2600 PNs provided that his fingers are not otherwise exposed.

4533,"Adjuvant radiotherapy for margin-positive high-grade soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity. Purpose: Adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) has been shown to improve local control in patients with soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities (STS). The specific impact of adjuvant radiation on patients with positive margins, however, has not been clearly defined. The purpose of this study was to determine if adjuvant RT improves local control in patients with high-grade STS who had positive margins of resection. Methods and Materials: Between 8/82 and 2/97, 110 adult patients with primary high-grade STS of an extremity underwent limb sparing surgery and were found to have a histologically positive microscopic surgical margin. Ninety-one (83%) received RT and 19 (17%) had no RT. The two groups were balanced with regard to size, site, location, and tumor depth. Adjuvant RT was delivered with brachytherapy (BRT) alone in 34 patients, external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) alone in 33 patients, or BRT+EBRT in 24 patients. The BRT dose was 45 Gy when used alone and 15-20 Gy when used as a boost. The EBRT dose was 60-70 Gy when used alone and 45-50 Gy when given with BRT. The median follow-up time was 41 months (range, 3-186 months). Result(s): The overall 5 year local control rate was 71%. This rate was significantly higher in the RT group compared to the no RT group (74% vs. 56%, respectively) (p = 0.01). On univariate analysis, lower extremity site and proximal location were also found to be predictors of improved local control (p = 0.03 and 0.03, respectively). However, only proximal location and the use of RT retained their significance as predictors of improved local control on multivariate analysis (p = 0.003 and 0.01, respectively). The overall 5-year distant relapse-free survival, disease-free survival, and overall survival rates were 54%, 44%, and 53%, respectively. No statistical differences were found in these survival rates between RT and no RT groups. Conclusion(s): Based on this study, adjuvant radiotherapy seems to improve local control in patients with high-grade STS of the extremity with positive margins. However, local recurrence still occurs in a substantial proportion of patients, mandating further need for improvement. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.",Excluded

4536,"Radioadaptive response in human lymphocytes in vitro. Exposure to low doses of radiation and/or chemicals can prime an organism to withstand the stress of a subsequent exposure to higher doses of the same agent. In the case of radiation, this phenomenon has been called radioadaptive response. Cytogenetic studies have been undertaken in human lymphocytes to investigate adaptive response (AR) to ionizing radiation, in particular to seek the role of variables such as priming dose, cell cycle stage, and age and gender of the donor. We demonstrated that pre-exposure of lymphocytes in whole blood cultures to very low doses in the range of about 1 cGy (priming or adaptive dose [AD]) reduced the frequency of micronuclei in binucleated cells induced by 100 cGy - that is, produced an AR in these cells in vitro. However, pre-exposure of cells to 10.0 cGy did not reduce the chromosomal damage (micronuclei) induced by the challenging dose (CD) of 100 cGy under the same protocol, thus exhibiting an inverse dose-response relationship. There was marked variability in the AR among the individuals investigated in the study. The extent of AR also depended on the stage of cell cycle exposed to the CD of radiation. Maximum AR was observed when CD of 100 cGy was given 4 hours after AD, 30 hours following the mitogenic stimulation of lymphocytes. The least AR was observed when CD was given 48 hours after stimulation. Interestingly, AR was also found to be dependent on the age of the donor, a decrease in AR being observed with an increasing age. No significant difference in AR was observed between male and female donors. To understand the molecular events underlying AR, protein synthesis patterns were studied in human lymphocytes subjected to mitogen, heat, or radiation stress. Heat shock (45 degreeC, for 15 min) induced 7 proteins with molecular weights ranging from 40 to 80 kDa, while treatment with phytohemagglutinin (40 mug/ mL) showed induction of 2 proteins of molecular weights 38 and 48 kDa, respectively. However, exposure of human lymphocyte cultures to gamma radiation did not significantly induce synthesis of any protein, up to 800 cGy dose. Lack of induction of proteins by gamma radiation in human lymphocytes contrasts with the previous reports showing X-ray radiation-enhanced gene expression in melanoma cells and/or human tumor fibroblasts.",Included
4537,"Estimation of dose in cancer patients treated with fractionated radiotherapy using translocation, dicentrics and micronuclei frequency in peripheral blood lymphocytes. The frequency of translocation, dicentrics (DC) and micronuclei (MN) was studied in blood samples exposed in vitro to 60Co gamma radiation and cervical cancer patients undergoing fractionated radiotherapy. The samples exposed under in vitro condition showed that the frequency of translocation and dicentric followed Poisson distribution ('u' varied between -0.04 and +1.41 for translocation and between -0.09 and +1.81 for DC) and that obtained with MN follow over dispersion ('u' varied between +2.04 and +9.28). However, the cervical cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy showed over dispersion for all these three aberrations (DC, MN and translocation). The frequencies of aberrations obtained in cancer patients were found to be lower than those obtained for in vitro exposure for doses more than 2 Gy equivalent whole body dose (EWBD). The dose-response curves were constructed using the frequencies of DC, MN and translocation as a function of EWBD. Doses as measured from the dose response curves were compared with the estimated dose in order to check whether the measured and estimated doses agree. The percent variation between the doses measured from aberration frequencies and that of the estimated dose was lower with translocation (10.8+/-7.41%) compared to those obtained with DC (38.08+/-31.85%) and MN (47.19+/-31.80%).

Information obtained included patient characteristics, treatments received, highest recorded grade of OM during radiation therapy (none, mild, moderate, or severe), and outcomes potentially associated with mucosal injury., RESULTS: The mean age (+/- standard deviation [SD]) of the study subjects was 61.3 years (12.3 yrs); the majority of patients (80%) were men. Primary tumor locations included the oropharynx (26.4%), larynx (26.4%), oral cavity including the lip (24.4%), hypopharynx (13.6%), and nasopharynx (9.1%). The majority of tumors were new and were classified as AJCC Stages III or IV. The majority of patients (83%) received standard radiation therapy; the mean (+/- SD) cumulative dose was 6285 centigrays (cGy) (+/- 1158 cGy). Approximately 33% of the patients received concomitant chemotherapy. The majority of patients (83%) developed OM; 29% developed severe OM. Patients with severe OM were more likely to have nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal tumors (adjusted odds ratio [OR] of 10.1 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 2.1-49.9] and 6.9 [95% CI, 2.4-19.7], respectively), and to have received cumulative radiation doses > 5000 cGy (OR of 10.4; 95% CI, 2.9-37.1) and concomitant chemotherapy (OR of 3.3; 95% CI, 1.4-8.0).

4540,"Transition to radial approach for neurovascular procedures is safe and convenient: Characterization of a learning experience. BACKGROUND: The transradial access for endovascular procedures has become a popular access point of preference for both patients and for many neuro-endovascular practitioners. OBJECTIVE(S): To describe a single-center experience on the transition to a radial-first approach for neurovascular procedures, focused on diagnostic angiographies, and to compare the differences in terms of length of procedure within the first 5 mo of its execution. METHOD(S): We performed a retrospective review of a prospective maintained cerebrovascular registry at an academic institution within the United States, to identify the expected adoption curve required to transition to a transradial route first approach focused mainly on diagnostic procedures. The 5 mo of experience were divided into 4 quartiles evenly distributed in time. The primary outcome was the total length of procedure. Secondary outcomes were access failure, radiation dose, the usefulness of ultrasound assistance and complications. RESULT(S): A total of 121 transradial procedures were performed: 113 diagnostic angiographies (93%) and 8 therapeutic interventions (7%). We identified 6 access failures (5%) and 1 complication (1%). The mean length for diagnostic angiographies was 24 +/- 10 min, and for therapeutic procedures was 58 +/- 19 min. A multivariate regression analysis demonstrated a significant decrease in the total length of procedures after the first quartile. CONCLUSION(S): The transradial route shows to be a safe and convenient approach. The total length of procedure starts decreasing as providers gain experience and become more confident with this route, as seen in our 5-mo experience.Copyright © 2020 by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons",Excluded

PURPOSE Preoperative chemoradiotherapy may improve the radical resection rate for resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer, but the overall benefit is unproven. PATIENTS AND METHODS In this randomized phase III trial in 16 centers, patients with resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer were randomly assigned to receive preoperative chemoradiotherapy, which consisted of 3 courses of gemcitabine, the second combined with 15 3 2.4 Gy radiotherapy, followed by surgery and 4 courses of adjuvant gemcitabine or to immediate surgery and 6 courses of adjuvant gemcitabine. The primary end point was overall survival by intention to treat. RESULTS Between April 2013 and July 2017, 246 eligible patients were randomly assigned; 119 were assigned to preoperative chemoradiotherapy and 127 to immediate surgery. Median overall survival by intention to treat was 16.0 months with preoperative chemoradiotherapy and 14.3 months with immediate surgery (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.05; P = .096). The resection rate was 61% and 72% (P = .058). The R0 resection rate was 71% (51 of 72) in patients who received preoperative chemoradiotherapy and 40% (37 of 92) in patients assigned to immediate surgery (P, .001). Preoperative chemoradiotherapy was associated with significantly better disease-free survival and locoregional failure-free interval as well as with significantly lower rates of pathologic lymph nodes, perineural invasion, and venous invasion. Survival analysis of patients who underwent tumor resection and started adjuvant chemotherapy showed improved survival with preoperative chemoradiotherapy (35.2 v 19.8 months; P = .029). The proportion of patients who suffered serious adverse events was 52% versus 41% (P = .096). CONCLUSION Preoperative chemoradiotherapy for resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer did not show a significant overall survival benefit. Although the outcomes of the secondary end points and predefined subgroup analyses suggest an advantage of the neoadjuvant approach, additional evidence is required.Copyright © 2020 by American Society of Clinical Oncology",Excluded
4543,"18F-Fluorothymidine radiation dosimetry in human PET imaging studies. UNLABELLED: 3'-Deoxy-3'-(18)F-fluorothymidine ((18)F-FLT) is a PET imaging agent that shows promise for studying cellular proliferation in human cancers. FLT is a nucleoside analog that enters cells and is phosphorylated by human thymidine kinase 1, but the 3' substitution prevents further incorporation into DNA. We estimated the radiation dosimetry for this tracer from data gathered in patient studies., METHODS: Time-dependent tissue concentrations of radioactivity were determined from blood samples and PET images of 18 patients after intravenous injection of (18)F-FLT. Radiation-absorbed doses were calculated using the MIRD Committee methods, taking into account variations that were based on the distribution of activities observed in the individual patients. Effective dose equivalent (EDE) was calculated using International Commission on Radiological Protection Publication 60 tissue weighting factors for the standard man and woman., RESULTS: For a single bladder voiding at 6 h after (18)F-FLT injection, the (18)F-FLT EDE (mean +/- SD) was 0.028 +/- 0.012 mSv/MBq (103 +/- 43 mrem/mCi) for a standard male patient and 0.033 +/- 0.012 mSv/MBq (121 +/- 43 mrem/mCi) for a standard female patient. The organ that received the highest dose was the bladder (male, 0.179 mGy/MBq [662 mrad/mCi]; female, 0.174 mGy/MBq [646 mrad/mCi]), followed by the liver (male, 0.045 mGy/MBq [167 mrad/mCi]; female, 0.064 mGy/MBq [238 mrad/mCi]), the kidneys (male, 0.035 mGy/MBq [131 mrad/mCi]; female, 0.042 mGy/MBq [155 mrad/mCi]), and the bone marrow (male, 0.024 mGy/MBq [89 mrad/mCi]; female, 0.033 mGy/MBq [122 mrad/mCi])., CONCLUSION: Organ dose estimates for (18)F-FLT are comparable to those associated with other commonly performed nuclear medicine tests, and the potential radiation risks associated with (18)F-FLT PET imaging are within accepted limits.",Excluded

Background: Resent studies indicate that biological treatment (anti TNF alpha treatment) reduces surgery rates. We aim in this seven-year follow-up study of unselected, incident patients diagnosed with Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis to assess surgery rates in the era of biological treatment. Method(s): From Jan. 1st 2003 to Dec. 31st 2004 all incident cases of patients diagnosed with CD (n = 208), UC (n = 328) or indeterminate colitis (IC, n = 27) were registered in a well defined Copenhagen area. All medical journals applicable for follow-up were reviewed and data on disease localization and behaviour according to the Montreal classifications, medications, endoscopies, X-ray-/CT-/MR-procedures, admissions, surgical events, cancers and deaths were registered. Result(s): The present follow-up study cohort consists of 186 CD and 265 UC. Of the 563 patients originally included in the study, 42 patients were excluded at follow-up. Twenty-eight patients did not have inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), 14 were not incident and 5 had IC. Eighteen (10 UC, 8 CD) were lost to follow-up and 47 (28 UC, 19 CD) deceased and were also excluded. The mean age in the present study was 38.7 years (median 35.0 range 1-93) and included 265 females and 251 males. All patients were followed for 7 years from diagnosis. For UC, 32 patients (12.1%) had a colectomy during the 7 years follow-up. Incidence of colectomy at 5 years was 9.8% (26 patients) and 8.7% (23) at 2 years. Fifty-two CD patients (28%) had their first intestinal resection (excluding fistula- and/or abscess's surgery) within 7 years follow-up.

BACKGROUND: Acute radiation enteritis is a common adverse effect related to radiotherapy (RT). Glutamine is an immune modulator and antioxidant amino acid that can exert a protective role in patients receiving abdominal or pelvic radiation. The aim of this study was to test if glutamine prevents radiation enteritis during RT., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Double-blind, randomized, controlled trial including 69 patients who needed RT because of pelvic or abdominal malignancies and received glutamine (30 g/d) or placebo (casein, 30 g/d). Enteritis was evaluated according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group scale, intestinal inflammation using fecal calprotectin, and gut integrity with citrulline. The incidence of enteritis was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier curves, and the hazard ratio (HR) was calculated using Cox regression., RESULTS: Patients were predominantly male (65.2%), with an average (SD) age of 66.6 (9.9) years, with urologic (44.9%), rectal (24.6%), or gynecological cancer (23.1%). More patients developed enteritis with glutamine than with the placebo (55.9% vs 22.0%; P = .002), with an HR OF 1.59 (95% confidence interval, 0.624.05).

In this context, salivary and serum proteomics seem promising diagnostic and predictive tools for head and neck diseases. In the present study, we performed a proteomic analysis of saliva and serum from patients presenting head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and compared the results before and after therapy. In saliva of cancer patients, we observed an altered protein profile, including over-expression of PLUNC and zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein. Both proteins may contribute to control tumor growth and, therefore, represent targets for new analysis. We also detected serotransferrin and a modified transthyretin form with altered levels in serum from patients. Comparing preoperative and postreatment samples, the results showed that the protein profile after treatment reverted to a pattern closer to those observed for controls. These results add information on the role of secreted proteins in the cancer process and emphasize the potential of saliva and serum analysis for diagnosis and monitoring of HNSCC. © 2010/2011 - IOS Press and the authors.

Dose homogeneity within the target volume is much more difficult to achieve during brachytherapy than during external beam irradiation, and implants are rarely geometrically perfect. To not underdose some parts of the target volume, therefore, it may be necessary to accept hot spots in other parts of the target volumes, but it is not at all clear from the literature how much dose heterogeneity should be considered excessive. We undertook this study in an effort to determine just how high a dose to a hot spot is associated with clinically significant complications. Methods and Materials: We studied 40 patients treated by high- dose rate brachytherapy with or without external irradiation. For each patient, we calculated the minimum dose to the 'hottest' 1 cubic centimeter (cc) volume (Dmax1) and, for 18 patients, the minimum dose to the hottest 10 cc volume (Dmax10) as well. Result(s): Considerable dose heterogeneity existed within the target volume. The Dmax1 ranged from 150-2000% (median 320%) of the minimum target dose (MTD). The median MTD/fraction was 2.50 Gy (range 1.50-25.00), and the median Dmax1/fraction was 10.00 Gy (range 3.75-150.00). The median Dmax1 from the entire course of brachytherapy was 75.00 Gy (range 25.00-550.00). Adding the doses from planned external irradiation, plus any prior irradiation to the same area, the median total Dmax1 was 112.50 Gy (range 30.00-580.00), yet the incidence of complications, even among those in the highest quartile of this dose range, was not greater than the lowest quartile. The total median Dmax10 was 85.00 Gy (range 32.00-130.00), but the incidence of complications was, again, similar whether the dose was in the lower or the upper half of this range (32.00-85.00 Gy, or 86.00-130.00 Gy, respectively). Conclusion(s): We had expected to find that the patients with the highest Dmax1 and/or Dmax10 would be the ones most likely to suffer complications, but the results did not support this hypothesis. Thus, dose heterogeneity, within the scope of our study, turned out to be rather unimportant with regard to complications. This finding contradicts the conventional wisdom and suggests that concerns about hot spots need not preclude optimization to ensure adequate dosage to all parts of the target volume.",Excluded
4549,"Commercial sunscreen formulations: UVB irradiation stability and effect on UVB irradiation-induced skin oxidative stress and inflammation. Evidence shows that sunscreens undergo degradation processes induced by UV irradiation forming free radicals, which reduces skin protection. In this regard, the biological effects of three commercial sunscreen formulations upon UVB irradiation in the skin were investigated. The three formulations had in common the presence of benzophenone-3 added with octyl methoxycinnamate or octyl salycilate or both, which are regular UV filters in sunscreens. The results show that formulations F1 and F2 presented partial degradation upon UVB irradiation. Formulations F1 and F2 presented higher skin penetration profiles than F3. None of the formulations avoided UVB irradiation-induced GSH depletion, but inhibited reduction of SOD activity, suggesting the tested formulations did not present as a major mechanism inhibiting all UVB irradiation-triggered oxidative stress pathways. The formulations avoided the increase of myeloperoxidase activity and cytokine production (IL-1beta and TNF-alpha), but with different levels of protection in relation to the IL-1beta release. Concluding, UVB irradiation can reduce the stability of sunscreens, which in turn, present the undesirable properties of reaching viable skin. Additionally, the same SPF does not mean that different sunscreens will present the same biological effects as SPF is solely based on a skin erythema response. This found opens up perspectives to consider additional studies to reach highly safe sunscreens. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded
4550,"Weekly 70 Gy thoracic radiotheraphy concurrent with docetaxel or paclitaxel after induction chemotherapy of patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer: Prospective study of tolerance and efficacy. Introduction: Chemotherapy (CT) and thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) constitute the standard care of patients with inoperable/unresectable locally advanced NSCLC. However, the optimal schedule of treatment remains to be determined. Method(s): A prospective study was conducted in patients with locally advanced stage IIIA or IIIB NSCLC, to determine the tolerability and local control obtained with 7 weekly courses of concurrent chemo-radiotherapy using Docetaxel (D: 20 mg/m2) or Paclitaxel (P: 60 mg/m2) and TRT (2 Gy daily Monday through Friday, totalizing 70 Gy in the seven weeks), after 3 cycles of cisplatinum-based induction chemotherapy (cisplatinum + gemcitabine +/- vinorelbine). Result(s): From December 1999 to December 2004, fifty two out of 129 patients treated with induction chemotherapy and at least with stable disease were considered eligible for analysis. Twenty seven were treated with docetaxel (D) and twenty five with paclitaxel (P). The average of weeks of treatment was 5 for D (range 7-3) and 6 for P (7-1), and 40% and 58% of patients respectively in each group completed 7 weeks and received the programmed doses. Significant toxicity during concurrent therapy included (D/P %): esophagitis (grade I, 22/18; grade II, 25/29; grade III, 30/8), pneumonitis (grades I-II, 14/5), diarrhea (grades I-II, 14/0). The percentage of local progression and median time elapsed were 41% and 180 days in the D group of patients, and 46% and 240 days in the P group. Conclusion(s): No definitive conclusions can be made, considering the small size of the sample in this study, but the observed trends suggest that concurrent chemo-radiotherapy employing TRT and Docetaxel or Paclitaxel administered weekly offer similar local efficacy, Paclitaxel showing a lower toxicity.",Excluded
4551,"A U.S. Multicenter Study of Recorded Occupational Radiation Badge Doses in Nuclear Medicine. Purpose To summarize occupational badge doses recorded for a sample of U.S. nuclear medicine technologists. Materials and Methods Nine large U.S. medical institutions identified 208 former and current nuclear medicine technologists certified after 1979 and linked these individuals to historic badge dose records maintained by a commercial dosimetry company (Landauer), yielding a total of 2618 annual dose records. The distributions of annual and cumulative occupational doses were described by using summary statistics. Results Between 1992 and 2015, the median annual personal dose equivalent per nuclear medicine technologist was 2.18 mSv (interquartile range [IQR], 1.25-3.47 mSv; mean, 2.69 mSv). Median annual personal dose equivalents remained relatively constant over this period (range, 1.40-3.30 mSv), while maximum values generally increased over time (from 8.00 mSv in 1992 to 13.9 mSv in 2015). The median cumulative personal dose equivalent was 32.9 mSv (IQR, 18.1-65.5 mSv; mean, 51.4 mSv) for 45 technologists who had complete information and remained employed through 2015. Conclusion Occupational radiation doses were well below the established occupational limits and were consistent with those observed for nuclear medicine technologists worldwide and were greater than those observed for nuclear and general medical workers in the United States These results should be informative for radiation monitoring and safety efforts in nuclear medicine departments. © RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",Excluded
4552,"Ocular toxicity after 3D-conformal radiotherapy for non-hodgkin orbital lymphoma. Purpose: The orbital Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a rare malignancy, usually localized and low aggressive, which management requires the irradiation of whole orbital cavity. This involves structures, as lens, particularly sensible to radiation effects. This single institution study wants to evaluate the acute and late siDe effects of conformal 3D irradiation for primary NHL. Materials: We retrospectively evaluated 59 consecutive patients (20 women and 39 men, mean age 59 +/- 16 yrs) with stage IEA NHL from 1986 to 2010. The disease was localized in the left eye in 34 (58%) patients, in the right in 21 (35%), bilateral in 4 (7%), and involved the orbit in 30 (51%), the conjunctiva in 18 (31%) and other orbital structures in 11 (18%). All patients underwent 3D-conformal radiotherapy after diagnosis (by pathological or cytological examination), staging (haematological tests, total body CT, bone marrow biopsy, orbital CT or MR) and in 4 cases after chemotherapy. The median dose was 30.6 Gy (range 30-40 Gy) with a standard fractioning (1.8 Gy per day) and the PTV consisted of whole orbital cavity. The bolus (thickness 0.5-1 cm) was used only in case of superficial localizations (25%). We described acute and late toxicity incidence and calculated the risk factors for cataract, using chi-square or Fisher test as appropriate. Result(s): The mean follow up was 68.3 +/- 55 months. It was performed by clinical and radiological examinations (total body CT, lymphatic stations US) and by ophthalmic visits, every 46 months during the first 5 years and then once a year. The local control was obtained in 58 (98.3%) patients. According to the RTOG scale, the graDe (G) 1 and 2 acute effects were 37% and 24% respectively, no G3-4 were observed in 39%. Thirty-six (61%) patients had no late toxicity, 22(37%) presented low effects (G1-2) and only 1 (2%) had retinopathy and bilateral cataract (G3). The table 1 reports the adverse effects. The cataract developed in 20 (34%) patients 2-7 yrs after radiotherapy was the more common late effect. It was easily treated by surgery. We considered as possible risk factors for cataract: age >60 yrs, Karnofsky performance status < 90%, total dose > 30.6 Gy, use of bolus and chemotherapy association. Total dose > 30.6 Gy resulted significantly associated (p<0.005). Cataract was developed in 13 of 24 patients (54%) treated with dose >30.6 (median 36 Gy), in 7 of 35 (20%) with dose <= 30.6. (Table presented) Conclusion(s): 3D conformal radiotherapy was effective and well tolerated, with low-graDe acute and late toxicity, for patients with orbital lymphoma. Cataract was the more frequent siDe effect, it was associated with a total dose > 30.6 Gy and easily treated with surgery. Eyesight was well preserved.",Excluded
4553,"Clustered Ca2+ Channels Are Blocked by Synaptic Vesicle Proton Release at Mammalian Auditory Ribbon Synapses. A Ca2+ current transient block (ICaTB) by protons occurs at some ribbon-type synapses after exocytosis, but this has not been observed at mammalian hair cells. Here we show that a robust ICaTB occurs at post-hearing mouse and gerbil inner hair cell (IHC) synapses, but not in immature IHC synapses, which contain non-compact active zones, where Ca2+ channels are loosely coupled to the release sites. Unlike ICaTB at other ribbon synapses, ICaTB in mammalian IHCs displays a surprising multi-peak structure that mirrors the EPSCs seen in paired recordings. Desynchronizing vesicular release with intracellular BAPTA or by deleting otoferlin, the Ca2+ sensor for exocytosis, greatly reduces ICaTB, whereas enhancing release synchronization by raising Ca2+ influx or temperature increases ICaTB. This suggests that ICaTB is produced by fast multivesicular proton-release events. We propose that ICaTB may function as a submillisecond feedback mechanism contributing to the auditory nerve's fast spike adaptation during sound stimulation., Mature inner hair cells in the cochlea contain compact active zones where clustered Ca2+ channels are tightly coupled to the sites of vesicle fusion. Vincent et al. show that vesicle exocytosis leads to the release of protons into the synaptic cleft, which transiently blocks a subset of Ca2+ channels.Copyright © 2018",Excluded
4554,"Dosimetric implications of the addition of 18 fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography in CT-based radiotherapy planning for non-small-cell lung cancer. Summary The aim of this study was to assess the impact of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) CT on radiotherapy planning parameters for patients treated curatively with radiotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Five patients with stages I-III NSCLC underwent a diagnostic FDG-PET CT (dPET CT), planning FDG-PET CT (pPET CT) and a simulation CT (RTP CT). For each patient, three radiation oncologists delineated a gross tumour volume based on RTP CT alone, and fused with dPET CT and pPET CT. Standard expansions were used to generate PTVs, and a 3D conformal plan was created. Normal tissue doses were compared between plans. Coverage of pPET CT PTV by the plans based on RTP CT and dPET CT was assessed, and tumour control probabilities were calculated. Mean PTV was similar between RTP CT, dPET CT and pPET CT, although there were significant inter-observer differences in four patients. The plans, however, showed no significant differences in doses to lung, oesophagus, heart or spinal cord. The RTP CT plan and dPET CT plan significantly underdosed the pPET PTV in two patients with minimum doses ranging from 12 to 63% of prescribed dose. Coverage by the 95% isodose was suboptimal in these patients, but this did not translate into poorer tumour control probability. The effect of fused FDG-PET varied between observers. The addition of dPET and pPET did not significantly change the radiotherapy planning parameters. Although FDG-PET is of benefit in tumour delineation, its effect on normal tissue complication probability and tumour control probability cannot be predicted.",Excluded
4555,"Factors determining fluoroscopy time during ureteroscopy. Purpose: The aim of this study was to prospectively identify predictors of radiation exposure during ureteroscopy. Patients and Methods: Eighty-five consecutive patients who presented for ureteroscopies and laser lithotripsy were considered. Fluoroscopy time (FT) was obtained from radiology reports for each patient, and clinical data were obtained from chart review. Nine patients were excluded (three unconfirmed FTs, four staghorn calculi, one ectopic kidney, and one multiple ureteral strictures). Seventy-six patients were included in the study. Univariate and multivariate linear regression were used to identify factors that determined FT. Result(s): The patient cohort was 65.8% male with a mean age of 52.7 years. Mean FT was 183s, and mean surgical time was 68.4+/-29 minutes. Mean stone size was 10+/-5mm in the greatest dimension. A large proportion of patients (50%) had renal stones, multiple stones were present in 31.6% of cases, and 22.3% of stones were radiolucent. Cases were equally distributed between surgeons A and B, and 46% of patients had preoperative stents. On multivariate analysis, increased FT was independently associated with surgeon A (104 additional seconds per case, P<0.001), longer duration of surgery (14s per 10 minutes, P<0.001), and male patients (54s per procedure, P=0.02). Age, stone characteristics, presence of ureteral stent, and stone-free status did not correlate with FT. Conclusion(s): Surgeon behavior, longer duration of surgery, and male gender were significant predictors of FT and, hence, radiation exposure during ureteroscopy. In the present study, stone characteristics were not found to be predictors of FT. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Excluded

This study investigated the effects of 2 different swallowing exercise regimens performed during radiation therapy with/without chemotherapy on swallowing function. Methods. Fifty patients were recruited prospectively to 2 groups (the exercise group, n = 26 and the repetitive swallow group, n = 24). Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) scores and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placements were compared at posttreatment and at 3 months. Results. The exercise group eliminated significantly more PEG tubes at 3 months posttreatment compared to the swallow group (16% vs 50%). Among patients who received both radiation and chemotherapy, the exercise group had significantly less PEG tubes immediately posttreat-ment as well as 3 months posttreatment (35% and 10%), compared to the swallow group (69% and 50%). Conclusion. Findings indicate significant benefits of the exercise group's exercise regimen in reducing PEG dependence and oral intake difficulties.Copyright © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
4557,"Determination of crystallinity and crystal structure of Hylamer polyethylene after in vivo wear. Hylamer polyethylene is a crystalline form of polyethylene of 70% crystallinity whereas conventional polyethylene (PE) has 50% crystallinity. Crystallinity is the percentage by weight of the crystalline phase present in the whole polymer, which comprises both amorphous and crystalline phases.Clinical experience has shown that Hylamer components used in joint prostheses, if sterilized by gamma rays in the presence of oxygen, are easily affected by wear, which leads to osteolysis. The authors have analyzed the crystallinity of polyethylene liners removed from seven patients who had received Hylamer polyethylene implants sterilized by gamma rays in air and had suffered prosthetic loosening, using Raman spectroscopy coupled with partial least squares (PLS) analysis. The results have been compared to those of two controls who had received Hylamer polyethylene implants sterilized by gamma irradiation in a nitrogen atmosphere. The crystal structure of wear particles released into the tissues from the Hylamer liners sterilized by gamma rays in air is also studied. The materials undergoing two different types of sterilization methods show different crystallinity values (71.50 vs. 69.43), but the crystallinity do not change according to wear (worn and unworn liner region). Both monoclinic and orthorhombic phases are present in the liner, while in wear debris prevalently monoclinic crystals are found in both types of sterilized liners. Different crystallinity rates can explain different wear rates observed in vivo.",Excluded

This study aims to analyze the long-term oncologic and functional outcomes of a large cohort of patients and to determine prognostic factors. Study Design: Retrospective cohort study. Method(s): The records of all patients diagnosed with hypopharyngeal SCC and treated with curative intent at our tertiary referral center were reviewed. Patient and initial disease characteristics, features, and complications of primary treatment, recurrence patterns, and corresponding treatments and the oncologic and functional long-term outcome were determined. Result(s): For a total of 179 patients, primary radiotherapy (RT) was the predominant treatment modality (78%), whereas 22% underwent primary surgery.

4560,"An approach to the assessment of risk from chronic radiation to populations of European lobster, Homarus gammarus (L.). The basic principles underlying a four-discrete age group, logistic, growth model for the European lobster Homarus gammarus are presented and discussed at proof-of-concept level. The model considers reproduction, removal by predation, natural death, fishing, radiation and migration. Non-stochastic effects of chronic low linear energy transfer (LET) radiation are modelled with emphasis on (99)Tc, using three endpoints: repairable radiation damage, impairment of reproductive ability and, at higher dose rates, mortality. An allometric approach for the calculation of LD(50/30) as a function of the mass of each life stage is used in model calibration. The model predicts that at a dose rate of 1 Gy day(-1), lobster population reproduction and survival become severely compromised, leading eventually to population extinction. At 0.01 Gy day(-1), the survival rate of an isolated population is reduced by 10%, mainly through loss of fecundity, comparable to natural migration losses. Fishing is the main ecological stress and only dose rates in the range 0.03-0.1 Gy day(-1) can achieve discernible effects above it. On the balance of radiation and other ecological stresses, a benchmark value of 0.01 Gy day(-1) is proposed for the protection of lobster populations. This value appears consistent with available information on radiation effects in wildlife.",Excluded

Background and purpose: Radiation dose escalation to improve poor outcomes with chemoradiation in locally advanced esophageal carcinoma is limited in part by increased toxicity. This Phase I study investigates the use of IMRT to improve tolerability of dose escalation. Material(s) and Method(s): A single-institution, prospective study was conducted between 2007 and 2013 for individuals with inoperable esophageal carcinoma. Gross disease received 60 Gy in 30 fractions and at-risk sites received 54 Gy with simultaneous integrated boost. Concurrent chemotherapy primarily consisted of cisplatin/5-FU. The primary objective was to assess feasibility (<15% rate of grade 4-5 toxicity). Secondary objectives included assessment of overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), and locoregional (LRR) and distant recurrence. Result(s): Twenty-six patients were enrolled with median follow up of 17.6 months (range 0.1 to 152.0). The majority were AJCC 7th edition Stage III (54%), distal esophagus primary (81%), and adenocarcinoma histology (85%). Twenty-one patients (81%) completed their course of radiation therapy, while only 55% received 2 cycles of concurrent cisplatin/5-FU. One grade 5 and one grade 4 cardiac event occurred, both during chemoradiation and before receiving 50 Gy. The 3-year OS was 48.6% (95% CI: 32.5 to 72.2%) and PFS was 28.5% (95% CI: 14.6 to 55.5%).

Female hairless mice (strain mutant hr/hr) have been irradiated with increasing doses of UV-B over a period of 4 weeks. They were compared with untreated controls Additional groups of 30 mice were treated with milk base or cream base or milk SPF6 or cream SPF6 or cream SPF8 daily before irradiation. No changes of body weight indicating systemic effects were found. Skin thickness was increased significantly after irradiation. These changes were partially antagonized by cream or milk bases and completely prevented by the corresponding formulations containing sunscreen agents. Under the chosen conditions ultimate load of excised skin samples was increased by irradiation. This effect was not reversed by the bases but by the sunscreen products. Ultimate strain of excised skin samples proved to be the most sensitive indicator. The decrease of ultimate strain after irradiation was partially antagonized by the bases. The sunscreen products had more powerful effect. Due to the effects on skin thickness and ultimate load tensile strength and modulus of elasticity did not show significant changes under the chosen conditions. Likewise, collagen and elastin content per gram wet weight did not show significant changes. Considering the increase of thickness of skin which is prevented by sunscreen products one may conclude also a prevention of formation of additional intercellular material.

With a radiation dose reduction by 2.36 mGy compared to standard of care CT with ASIR 50% (radiation dose, 7.54 mGy), MBIR can provide diagnostically acceptable CT scans without compromising image quality. Two radiologists independently assessed randomized images in a blinded manner. Imaging sets were compared for lesion detection, lesion conspicuity, overall image quality, and signal-to-noise ratio with a paired sample t test. Inter- and intraobserver agreement was assessed with the Cohen kappa., RESULTS: The mean volume CT dose index was 5.18 mGy +/- 0.76, mean dose-length product 374 mGy . cm +/- 63.47, mean effective diameter 29.38 cm +/- 3.46, and mean size-specific dose estimate 6.52 mGy +/- 0.73.

OBJECTIVE: New clinical guidelines endorse the use of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) for lung cancer screening among selected heavy smokers while recommending patients be counseled about the potential benefits and harms. We developed and field tested a brief, video-based patient decision aid about lung cancer screening., METHODS: Smokers in a cancer center tobacco treatment program aged 45 to 75 years viewed the video online between November 2011 and September 2012. Acceptability, knowledge, and clarity of values related to the decision were assessed., RESULTS: Fifty-two patients completed the study (mean age=58.5 years; mean duration smoking=34.8 years). Acceptability of the aid was high. Most patients (78.8%) indicated greater interest in screening after viewing the aid. Knowledge about lung cancer screening increased significantly as a result of viewing the aid (25.5% of questions answered correctly before the aid, and 74.8% after; P<.01) although understanding of screening eligibility remained poor.

4568,"Neoadjuvant radiotherapy combined with capecitabine and sorafenib in patients with advanced KRAS-mutated rectal cancer: A phase I/II trial (SAKK 41/08). Background KRAS mutation occurs in ~40% of locally advanced rectal cancers (LARCs). The multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib has radiosensitising effects and might improve outcomes for standard preoperative chemoradiotherapy in patients with KRAS-mutated LARC. Methods Adult patients with KRAS-mutated T3/4 and/or N1/2M0 LARC were included in this phase I/II study. The phase I dose-escalation study of capecitabine plus sorafenib and radiotherapy was followed by a phase II study assessing efficacy and safety. Primary end-points were to: establish the maximum tolerated dose of the regimen in phase I; determine the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate in phase II defined as Dworak regression grade 3 and 4. Results Fifty-four patients were treated at 18 centres in Switzerland and Hungary; 40 patients were included in the single-arm phase II study. Recommended doses from phase I comprised radiotherapy (45 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks) with capecitabine 825 mg/m2 twice daily x 33 plus sorafenib 400 mg/d. Median daily dose intensity in phase II was radiotherapy 100%, capecitabine 98.6%, and sorafenib 100%. The pCR rate (Dworak 3/4) was 60% (95% CI, 43.3-75.1%) by central independent pathologic review. Sphincter preservation was achieved in 89.5%, R0 resection in 94.7%, and downstaging in 81.6%. The most common grade 3 toxicities during phase II included diarrhoea (15.0%), skin toxicity outside radiotherapy field (12.5%), pain (7.5%), skin toxicity in radiotherapy field, proctitis, fatigue and cardiac ischaemia (each 5%). Conclusions Combining sorafenib and standard chemoradiotherapy with capecitabine is highly active in patients with KRAS-mutated LARC with acceptable toxicity and deserves further investigation. www.clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00869570.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
4569,"Chemoradiation for High-grade Neuroendocrine Carcinoma of the Rectum and Anal Canal. Objectives: We evaluated outcomes in patients with high-grade neuroendocrine (HGNE) carcinoma of the anorectum treated with pelvic chemoradiation. Material(s) and Method(s): Between January 1, 2000 and February 17, 2013, 10 patients were confirmed to have HGNE carcinoma of the rectum or anal canal and treated with pelvic chemoradiation (radiation dose >=45 Gy). Overall survival (OS), locoregional control (LRC), progression-free survival (PFS), and patterns of failure were evaluated. Result(s): Eight had pure HGNE carcinoma and 2 had HGNE carcinoma with minor component of adenocarcinoma. Median age was 62 years. Median follow-up was 15 months (range, 3 to 128 mo). Tumor stages included TxN0M0 (1), II (1), III (4), and IV (4) including 2 with only inguinal involvement. Median tumor size was 5.5 cm (range, 3 to 7 cm). Patients received postoperative chemoradiation (1), preoperative chemoradiation (2), and chemoradiation without surgery (7). Median dose was 50.4 Gy (range, 45 to 60 Gy). All patients received chemotherapy before or after chemoradiation. Seven had pelvic LRC; 2 had possible and 1 had confirmed local progression. Both patients who had preoperative chemoradiation only had microscopic focus of residual carcinoma at surgery. Seven had disease progression; of which all developed distant progression, with distant progression occurring as the first event in 6 (liver, lung, bone, and abdominal nodes). Actuarial 2-year PFS and OS were 30% and 46%, respectively. One patient received prophylactic cranial irradiation; only one of the other 9 patient developed brain metastasis. Conclusion(s): Pelvic chemoradiation provided LRC for the majority of the patients' lifetime. Most patients had distant failure, but patterns of distant failure do not support routine prophylactic cranial irradiation.© Copyright 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

4573,"The Price of Tumor Control: An Analysis of Rare Side Effects of Anti-CTLA-4 Therapy in Metastatic Melanoma from the Ipilimumab Network. Background: Ipilimumab, a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) blocking antibody, has been approved for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and induces adverse events (AE) in up to 64% of patients. Treatment algorithms for the management of common ipilimumab-induced AEs have lead to a reduction of morbidity, e.g. due to bowel perforations. However, the spectrum of less common AEs is expanding as ipilimumab is increasingly applied. Stringent recognition and management of AEs will reduce drug-induced morbidity and costs, and thus, positively impact the cost-benefit ratio of the drug. To facilitate timely identification and adequate management data on rare AEs were analyzed at 19 skin cancer centers. Methods and Findings: Patient files (n = 752) were screened for rare ipilimumab-associated AEs. A total of 120 AEs, some of which were life-threatening or even fatal, were reported and summarized by organ system describing the most instructive cases in detail. Previously unreported AEs like drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), granulomatous inflammation of the central nervous system, and aseptic meningitis, were documented. Obstacles included patients delay in reporting symptoms and the differentiation of steroid-induced from ipilimumab-induced AEs under steroid treatment. Importantly, response rate was high in this patient population with tumor regression in 30.9% and a tumor control rate of 61.8% in stage IV melanoma patients despite the fact that some patients received only two of four recommended ipilimumab infusions. This suggests that ipilimumab-induced antitumor responses can have an early onset and that severe autoimmune reactions may reflect overtreatment. Conclusion(s): The wide spectrum of ipilimumab-induced AEs demands doctor and patient awareness to reduce morbidity and treatment costs and true ipilimumab success is dictated by both objective tumor responses and controlling severe side effects. © 2013 Voskens et al.",Excluded

UNLABELLED: Radiosynoviorthesis (RSO) with the ss-particle-emitting nuclide yttrium-90 is an established concept for the treatment of persistent synovitis of the knee joint. The AIM of this study was to investigate the biological radiation effect on the basis of a characteristic radiation parameter., PATIENTS, METHODS: After RSO procedures with yttrium-90 citrate colloid and subsequent immobilisation of the knee, blood specimens of 10 patients were collected immediately before RSO and 11 to 13 days after the intervention. The yield of dicentric chromosomes in the lymphocytes was determined exclusively in metaphases of the first cell cycle in vitro. In addition, activity leakage was measured by wholebody bremsstrahlung-scintigraphy., RESULTS: No statistically significant increase in the number of dicentric chromosomes (26 before treatment and 34 after treatment) in 20 192 cells analyzed from the 20 blood samples could be found as a result of RSO. However, the analysis of at least 1000 cells per blood sample demonstrates a tendency for a biological radiation effect in the blood of patients on the basis of this characteristic radiation parameter. Two of the 10 RSO patients had undergone a second RSO using yttrium-90 citrate, whereby one patient displayed activity transport out of the knee joint, amounting to 6 MBq. Only for him a radiation effect (about 130 mGy per single RSO) could be calculated by biological dosimetry., CONCLUSION: Since in general, based on the analysis of dicentric chromosomes in at least 1000 lymphocytes per individual, detection limits for groups of persons after long-term exposures to low-LET radiation of 50-100 mGy are possible, we assume that RSO with yttrium-90 should be associated with a low whole-body radiation exposure.",Excluded

Purpose: Low-field MRI, allowing imaging in supine and weight-bearing position, may be utilized as a non-invasive and affordable tool to differentiate between causes of dissatisfaction after TKA ('problematic TKA'). However, it remains unclear whether low-field MRI results in sufficient image quality with limited metal artefacts. Therefore, this feasibility study explored the diagnostic value of low-field MRI concerning pathologies associated with problematic TKA's' by comparing low-field MRI findings with CT and surgical findings. Secondly, differences in patellofemoral parameters between supine and weight-bearing low-field MRI were evaluated. Method(s): Eight patients with a problematic TKA were scanned using low-field MRI in weight-bearing and supine conditions. Six of these patients underwent revision surgery. Scans were analysed by a radiologist for pathologies associated with a problematic TKA. Additional patellofemoral and alignment parameters were measured by an imaging expert. MRI observations were compared to those obtained with CT, the diagnosis based on the clinical work-up, and findings during revision surgery. Result(s): MRI observations of rotational malalignment, component loosening and patellofemoral arthrosis were comparable with the clinical diagnosis (six out of eight) and were confirmed during surgery (four out of six). All MRI observations were in line with CT findings (seven out of seven). Clinical diagnosis and surgical findings of collateral excessive laxity could not be confirmed with MRI (two out of eight). Conclusion(s): Low-field MRI shows comparable diagnostic value as CT and might be a future low cost and ionizing radiation free alternative.

The effect of preoperative radio chemotherapy on lymphatic drainage and intraoperative gamma probe-guided sentinel lymph node detection has yet not been investigated. In this study, we study 13 patients with SCC. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) imaging of the patients was performed using SPECT-CT. Special care was taken to use identical injection sites for both studies. Imaging comprised planar and SPECT, iterative reconstruction and were viewed with the co-registered CT image. The results were validated by comparison with the histological results of intraoperative gamma probe detection and histology of the completed neck dissection. Identical SLNs were found in 6/13 patients. In 2/13 cases SLN biopsies were false-negative. In 4/13 patients preoperative SLN imaging identified more/additional nodes than the initial imaging, whereas fewer nodes were seen in 3/13 patients. Neither the primary tumor site nor the TNM stage was predictive for changes in the lymphatic drainage pattern. No constant effect of irradiation could be demonstrated. Preoperative radio chemotherapy has an unpredictable influence on the lymphatic drainage pattern in HNSCC. Consequently, the intraoperative gamma probe-guided sentinel lymph node detection after radio chemotherapy does not reveal the SLN of carcinogenesis. Thus, we advise fused functional/anatomical imaging (SPECT-CT) before and after radiochemotherapy if the SLN concept is utilized in HNSCC.",Excluded
4579,"Radiosurgery of vestibular schwannoma: prognostic factors for hearing outcome using 3D-constructive interference in steady state (3D-CISS). Purpose: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is an effective treatment for vestibular schwannoma (VS). Three-dimensional (3D) constructive interference in steady state (CISS) is the preferred magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence for evaluating signal changes in the inner ear endolymph. Previous studies demonstrated a correlation between pretreatment cochlear signal intensity in 3D-CISS and posttherapeutic hearing outcomes. The purpose of our study was to compare 3D-CISS sequences before and after primary SRS of unilateral VSs to evaluate the effect of radiosurgery on the 3D-CISS signal intensities of cochlea and sacculus/utriculus. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed 47 patients with unilateral VS treated with SRS. The neuroradiological MRI datasets were analysed to evaluate the signal intensity of the inner ear structure, tumour size, Koos grade, tumour volume, and infiltration of the cochlear aperture before therapy and at follow-up. The differences in these signal intensities before SRS and at follow-up were correlated with clinical symptoms, cochlear radiation dose, tumour volume and infiltration of the cochlear aperture. Result(s): No differences were found between signal intensities in cochlea and utriculus/sacculus before and after SRS and no correlation with clinical symptoms, cochlear radiation dose, tumour volume, Koos grade or infiltration of the cochlear aperture (all p> 0.05). Conclusion(s): Our study supports the theory of a complex interaction causing alteration of the endolymph protein concentration and not a direct dependency on the SRS.

Method(s): Fifty-one patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx were included in this prospective study. The patients were treated with 3 courses of cisplatin (100 mg at 1 treatment, intra-arterial) and sodium thiosulfate (28 g at 1 treatment, intravenous) once every 2 weeks during concurrent radiotherapy (66 to 70 Gy, 2 Gy per fraction, daily for 5 days over 7 weeks). Nodal metastases larger than 3 cm in diameter were treated with an additional 50 mg of cisplatin. The patients with less than 50% tumor reduction after 40 Gy and 2 courses of chemotherapy were treated with surgery. Result(s): The protocol was completed for 49 patients.

4583,"Humanized mouse model: Hematopoietic stemcell transplantation and tracking using short tandem repeat technology. Introduction: Models of mice carrying a human immune system, so-called humanized mice, are used increasingly as preclinical models to bridge the gap between model organisms and human beings. Challenges of the humanized mouse model include finding suitable sources for human hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and reaching sufficient engraftment of these cells in immunocompromised mice. Method(s): In this study, we compared the use of CD34+ HSC from cord blood (CB) vs HSC from adult mobilized peripheral blood. Furthermore, we developed a simple and highly specific test for donor identification in humanized mice by applying the detection method of short tandem repeats (STR). Result(s): It was found that, in vitro, CB-derived and adult HSC show comparable purity, viability, and differentiation potential in colony-forming unit assays. However, in vivo, CB-derived HSC engrafted to a significantly higher extent in NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIL2rgammatm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice than adult HSC. Increasing the cell dose of adult HSC or using fresh cells without cryopreservation did not improve the engraftment rate. Interestingly, when using adult HSC, the percentage of human cells in the bone marrow was significantly higher than that in the peripheral blood. Using the STR-based test, we were able to identify and distinguish human cells from different donors in humanized mice and in a humanized allogeneic transplantation model. Conclusion(s): From these findings, we conclude that adult mobilized HSC are less suitable for generating a humanized immune system in mice than CB-derived cells.Copyright © The Authors.

We prospectively evaluated 38 adult patients with chronic constipation with and without defecatory difficulties using a newly described scintigraphic test to measure rectal emptying and compared them to 20 healthy controls. All patients underwent anorectal manometry, and 30 who complained of infrequent defecation underwent a colonic transit study using radiopaque markers. Control subjects promptly evacuated both 100 ml and 200 ml artificial stool in a characteristic fashion, but three evacuated none of the 100-ml volume and two had no evacuation of the 200-ml stool (inhibited controls). Constipated patients exhibited three patterns of emptying: (1) normal emptying of both volumes (47%); (2) poor emptying of both volumes or inhibited defecation (29%); and (3) normal emptying of the 200-ml but abnormal evacuation of the 100-ml volume (24%). An abnormal expulsion pattern during manometry occurred in 21% of patients and was strongly associated with the inhibited defecation pattern. However, defecation patterns could not be predicted on the basis of age, gender, symptoms, duration of complaints, colonic transit, or other rectal manometric parameters. Although rectal scintigraphy has potential advantages as a diagnostic test in terms of quantitation and decreased radiation exposure, the inability of the test to distinguish patients with slow transit constipation and defecatory complaints makes the potential utility of this test of uncertain value in clinical and investigative settings.",Excluded
4585,"The role of vitamin D in the carcinogenesis of breast and ovarian cancer. The review evaluates the role of vitamin D in carcinogenesis. Based on ecological studies, the incidence of many cancers has been shown to be higher in northern countries, suggesting an association with latitude and solar radiation. Vitamin D produced in skinunder the influence of sun exposure may play a protective role in the process leading to cancer. Vitamin D deficiency is now recognized as a pandemic, mainly due to lack of knowledge that sun exposure in moderation is the major source of vitamin D for most human. After vitamin D was discovered to be the necessary element of nourishment to prevent rickets at the beginning of the twentieth century, the theory concerning its role has evolved. It is now recognized that vitamin D, and particularly its active form 1.25 (OH)2D, is an important hormone playing a crucial role in human homeostasis. 1.25(OH)2D3 has been shown to inhibit cancer cell growth, inducecancer cell maturation, induce apoptosis, and decrease angiogenesis. Several studies suggested that living at higher geographical latitudes increased the risk of developing and dying of colon, prostate, breast and other cancers. People exposed to sunlight were noted to less likely develop cancer. Several studies evaluated circulating levels of 25(OH)D and its possible association with cancer. Case-control studies and laboratory tests have consistently demonstrated that vitamin D plays an important role in the prevention ofbreast cancer. Vitamin D supplementation is a much needed, low cost, effective, and safe intervention strategy for breast cancer prevention that should be implemented. It has been shown that vitamin D levels are lower in ovarian cancer patients. Low 25(OH) D concentration associated with lower overall survival rate might suggest for the important role of severe deficiency in more aggressive course of ovarian cancer. Testing for 25(OH)D in the standard procedure could help to find ovarian cancer patients with worse prognosis, who would benefit from special attention and supplementation. Vitamin D3 supplementation in moderate doses achieving 25(OH)D concentrations of 30-80ng/ml, can be recommended as many benefits may be expected, including decreased risk of developing cancer.",Excluded
4586,"Impact of radiotherapy dose on dentition breakdown in head and neck cancer patients. Purpose: To evaluate the severity of post-radiation dental lesions and possible correlation with radiation dose to the teeth in patients treated for head and neck cancers. Methods and Materials: Data from 93 head and neck radiotherapy patients treated between 1997 and 2008 were analyzed retrospectively. The main effect, radiation dose to the individual teeth, was evaluated with covariates of elapsed time after radiation, xerostomia, topical fluoride use, and oral hygiene status included. Patients' radiotherapy plans were used to calculate cumulative exposure for each tooth. Patients' teeth were evaluated using a validated index and then categorized as having none-slight or moderate-severe post-radiation damage. Result(s): Patients (31 females, 62 males) ranged in age from 18-82 years (mean 57). The number of teeth-patient ranged from 3-30 (mean 20) with a total of 1873 teeth evaluated. Overall, 51% of teeth had moderate-severe damage, with the remaining having little or none. Using odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals, the odds for moderate-severe damage were 2-3 times greater for teeth exposed to between 30 and 60 Gy as compared to no radiation. However, for teeth exposed to >= 60 Gy as compared to no radiation the odds of moderate-severe tooth damage was greater by a magnitude of 10 times. Conclusion(s): The results indicate that there is minimal tooth damage below 30 Gy (salivary gland threshold), a greater than 1:1 increased dose-response between 30 and 60 Gy likely related to salivary gland damage, and a critical threshold of >= 60 Gy, which may be linked to direct effects of radiation on tooth structure. These findings suggest that care should be taken during the treatment planning process to limit tooth dose, and when clinically possible to limit tooth dose to less than 60 Gy. © 2011 American Society for Radiation Oncology.",Excluded
4587,"An action spectrum (290-320 nm) for TNFalpha protein in human skin in vivo suggests that basal-layer epidermal DNA is the chromophore. Terrestrial solar UVB radiation (=295-320 nm) readily induces cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) in human skin DNA that result in characteristic mutations associated with nonmelanoma skin cancer. The proinflammatory cytokine TNFalpha is important in mouse skin chemical carcinogenesis and is thought to also play a role in UVR-induced skin cancer by its immunomodulatory properties. There is some in vitro evidence that CPDs initiate the production of TNFalpha, and we tested this hypothesis by comparing the wavelength dependence (action spectrum) for TNFalpha protein induction in human skin in vivo with our earlier in vivo action spectra for CPD induction in four different epidermal layers of human skin. Normal volunteers (n = 35) were irradiated with physiologically relevant doses of monochromatic UVB (290-320 nm), and TNFalpha concentration was assessed, by high-sensitivity ELISA, in exudates from skin suction blisters raised 8 h after irradiation. An action spectrum, constructed from the slopes of the dose-response curves at the different wavelengths, showed maximal efficacy at 300 nm. An excellent match was observed for TNFalpha and the CPD action spectrum for cells in the lower basal epidermis. These data strongly suggest that UVB-induced photodamage to DNA in the epidermal basal layer is a major trigger for TNFalpha production. The TNFalpha may originate directly from the keratinocytes in this layer or inflammatory cells that are rapidly recruited into the upper dermis (e.g., neutrophils) as a consequence of DNA photodamage to basal-layer keratinocytes. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.",Excluded
4588,"Geographical clustering of mortality from systemic lupus erythematosus in the United States: contributions of poverty, Hispanic ethnicity and solar radiation. The objective was to investigate whether spatial variation in poverty, Hispanic ethnicity, and solar radiation explains the strong pattern of geographical clustering of mortality from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in the United States. SLE mortality counts for women and men of black and white race in US counties, 1979-1998, were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics. County-level poverty rates and proportions of Hispanic residents were drawn from the 1990 national census. The annual cumulative level of ambient ultraviolet 'B' radiation (UVB) was estimated for each county according to latitude, longitude, and elevation. Maps for the full study population and for sex - and race-specific subpopulations showed that the national pattern of geographical variation in SLE mortality primarily reflected the experience of white women. Formal spatial analysis of the data for white women identified 10 statistically significant, multi-county clusters--four with elevated and six with reduced SLE mortality rates. Multivariate regression modeling established that higher levels of poverty, Hispanic ethnicity, and UVB were each associated with elevated local rates of SLE mortality among white women. Statistical adjustment via the regression model was used to remove effects of these factors on local rates. In a re-application of spatial analysis to the adjusted rates, four clusters 'disappeared'. In those clusters, poverty, Hispanic ethnicity and UVB had explained an average of 58.2% of the deviations between local and national SLE mortality rates. In six clusters (including three that disappeared with adjustment), Hispanic ethnicity explained a larger percentage of the deviations between local and national rates than either poverty or UVB. In multivariate models based on data for black women and for men of both races, poverty and UVB had similar effects on SLE mortality rates to those observed among white women. However, Hispanic ethnicity was not a significant predictor of SLE mortality in any of these other groups. The contributions of poverty, Hispanic ethnicity and solar radiation to geographical variation of SLE mortality in the United States are substantial, but these factors do not fully account for the clustering phenomenon.",Excluded

This study delineated the incidence of metastatic involvement of neural stem cell (NSC) regions and further aimed to explore the feasibility of selectively sparing the NSC compartments during whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). A total of 2270 intracranial metastases in 488 patients were identified. Lesions were classified according to locations, including lesions in the NSC compartments (subventricular zone, SVZ, or hippocampus) and those in the rest of the brain/brainstem. The incidence of involvement of NSC regions was compared between oligometastatic patients (those with 14 lesions) and non-oligometastatic patients (those with 5 or more lesions) using a chi-square test. The volume of the NSC regions accounted for 2.23% of the whole brain, and the overall rate of metastatic lesions in NSC regions was 1.1% in 2270 metastases (25/2270), and 4.7% in 488 patients (23/488). Of the NSC region metastases, 7 (0.3%) involved the hippocampus and 18 (0.8%) occurred in the SVZ. Among the 7 hippocampal metastases identified in this study, 1/7 (14.3%) were found in oligometastatic patients, while 6/7 (85.7%) metastases were in non-oligometastatic patients. For metastases in the SVZ, all lesions occurred in non-oligometastatic patients with none in oligometastatic patients. Metastatic involvement of the NSC compartments was significantly lower in oligometastatic patients (0.15%, 1/670) than in non-oligometastatic patients (1.5%, 24/1600) (P < 0.001). Our retrospective review of 2270 metastases in 488 patients is that the volume of the compartments of NSC regions was 2.23% relative to the whole brain, but the incidence of involvement of the NSC compartments was 1.1%, and the vast majority of NSC lesions were found in nonoligometastatic patients. We believe our data supports selective reduction of doses for these aforementioned structures, when treating oligometastatic patients with WBRT and locally advanced-stage small-cell lung cancer patients with PCI. © The Author 2012.

Effects of beta radiation from four kinds of organically bound tritium compounds were investigated on cultured mouse embryonic mid brain cells, isolated from 11-d-old mouse embryos. The MBC showed a critical time when they were more radiosensitive. Although dose-dependent inhibition was found for both cellular proliferation and differentiation, the differentiation was more sensitive to radiation than proliferation when compared at ID50, the inhibitory dose that reduced assessment value by 50% of the control. Dose-dependent decrease of DNA and protein contents were also observed. The relative biological effectiveness values, ranging from 4.6 to 8.7, of beta ray from organically bound tritium compounds were obtained when compared with x irradiation at their ID50s on the inhibition of cell proliferation and differentiation, and on the decrease of DNA and protein contents of the cultures. The mixed exposure to x ray and one kind of organically bound tritium compound or to any two kinds of organically bound tritium compound resulted in a more efficiently inhibitory effect on differentiation than the exposure to x ray or to any one kind of organically bound tritium compound alone, especially when methyl-3H-thymidine was used.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The differential diagnosis of radionecrosis and tumor recurrence in brain metastases is challenging. We investigated the diagnostic efficiency of postcontrast T1 mapping in solving this problem., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 2016 and June 2017, fifty-six patients with brain metastases who underwent contrast-enhanced cerebral T1 mapping were recruited for this prospective study. The findings revealed new enhancement after gamma knife radiosurgery. The subjects were assigned to radionecrosis and recurrence groups based on follow-up (median, 11.5 months) and histopathologic results. T1 values of lesions 5 (T15min) and 60 (T160min) minutes after administration of contrast agent and their difference (T1differ) were compared between the 2 groups with the 2-tailed Mann-Whitney U test. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to determine the optimum cutoff values for differential diagnosis., RESULTS: There were significant differences between the 2 groups in T15min, T160min, and T1differ values (P = .012, P = .004, and P < .001, respectively). Relative to T15min and T160min, T1differ exhibited greater sensitivity and specificity (P < .001, respectively) in identifying radionecrosis. The optimum T1differ value for differential diagnosis was 71.1 ms (area under the curve = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.93-1.00), with sensitivity and specificity of 81.5% and 96.5%, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Postcontrast T1 mapping is optimal for the differential diagnosis of radionecrosis and tumor recurrence. Among T1 parameters, T1differ is the most powerful parameter for differential diagnosis. Advantages in terms of quantitative analysis and high resolution portend the wide use of postcontrast T1 mapping in the future. Copyright © 2018 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.",Excluded
4594,"Functional dosimetric metrics for predicting radiation-induced lung injury in non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with chemoradiotherapy. Background: Radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) is an important dose-limiting toxicity during thoracic radiotherapy. The purpose of this study is to investigate single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) perfusion-weighted functional dose-volume histogram (FDVH) for predicting RILI in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy. Method(s): Fifty-seven locally advanced NSCLC patients receiving chemoradiotherapy were enrolled prospectively. Patients had treatment scans and dose calculations to provide a standard dose-volume histogram (DVH). Fusion of SPECT and computed tomography scans provided perfusion-weighted FDVH and associated functional dosimetric parameters (relative volumes of functional lung receiving more than a threshold dose of 5 - 60 Gy at increments of 5 Gy [FV5 - FV60]). The predictive abilities of FDVH and DVH were calculated and compared based on the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Result(s): The accumulative incidence of >= 2 grade RILI was 19.3% with a median follow-up of 12 months. Univariate analysis showed that the functional (FV5 - FV60) and standard (V5 - V40) parameters were associated with RILI (all value of p < 0.05). Close correlations between a variety of functional and standard parameters were found. By ROC curve analysis, functional metrics (AUCs were 0.784 - 0.869) provided similarly (p value 0.233 - 1.000) predictive outcome to standard metrics (AUCs were 0.695 - 0.902) in lower - median dose level parameters (FV5 - FV40). However, FDVH seemed to add some predictive value in higher dose level, the best statistical significance for comparing FV60 with V60 was 0.693 vs. 0.511 (p = 0.055). Conclusion(s): Functional metrics are identified as reliable predictors for RILI, however, this observation still needs to be further verified using a larger sample size. © 2012 Wang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
4595,"Neoadjuvant therapy reduces the incidence of nodal micrometastases in esophageal adenocarcinoma. Background We evaluated the impact of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) on nodal micrometastases (NMMs) in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) patients with histologically negative nodes ([y]pN0). Methods Of 48 consecutively treated patients with neoadjuvant CRT, we selected 20 EAC ypN0 patients (group 1). These patients were matched with 20 pN0 EAC patients who had surgery alone (group 2). Harvested (y)pN0 lymph nodes were examined immunohistochemically (anti-CK8/18 [CAM 5.2]) according to a validated sentinel node protocol. A 3rd group (n = 11) staged as ypN1 after neoadjuvant CRT was used as the control group. Results Upstaging to NMM+ occurred in 2 patients (10%) in group 1 and in 8 patients (40%) in group 2 (P =.028). Disease-free and overall survival rates in NMM+ patients in group 1 were worse compared with NMM- patients (P =.014 and P =.003, respectively) but comparable with ypN1 patients (n = 11). Conclusions A 30% reduction of NMM+ was obtained after neoadjuvant treatment in (y)pN0 patients. NMM+ after CRT had a negative impact on survival in ypN1 patients. These data warrant further investigation in larger prospective datasets. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
4596,"Association Between Radiation Dose and Outcomes With Postoperative Radiotherapy for N0-N1 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. PURPOSE: To review trends in the use of postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) in the modern era for N0-N1 margin-negative non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) following surgical resection and evaluate the association between PORT dose and overall survival., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of nonmetastatic stage II and III N0-N1 margin-negative NSCLC surgically treated patients within the National Cancer Data Base from 2003 to 2011. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed for multivariable analyses of overall survival and PORT dose. Radiation modalities included nonconformal beam radiation, 3-dimensional conformal radiation (3D-CRT), and intensity-modulated radiation therapy., RESULTS: We identified 2167 (6.7%) and 30,269 (93.3%) patients with surgically resected stage II or III N0-N1 margin-negative NSCLC who were treated with and without PORT, respectively. The proportion of patients treated with PORT (dose range, 45 to 74 Gy) decreased from 8.9% in 2003 to 2006 to 4.1% in 2010 to 2011. Among patients receiving PORT, the use of high-dose (60 to 74 Gy) PORT rose throughout the study period, starting at 34.8% in 2003 to 2006 and rising to 49.3% in 2010 to 2011.Overall, patients who received PORT had worse survival (hazards ratio=1.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-1.40) compared with those not receiving PORT. This association was unchanged when limited to patients receiving modern treatment with 3-CRT or intensity-modulated radiation therapy (hazards ratio=1.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.65)., CONCLUSIONS: The use of PORT for N0-N1 margin-negative NSCLC decreased from 2003 to 2011. We found no evidence of benefit from PORT for resected N0-N1 margin-negative NSCLC, regardless of dose or technique. PORT should be approached with caution in this group of patients, regardless of radiotherapy technique.",Included
4597,"Hormonal suppression restores fertility in irradiated mice from both endogenous and donor-derived stem spermatogonia. Irradiation interrupts spermatogenesis and causes prolonged sterility in male mammals. Hormonal suppression treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues has restored spermatogenesis in irradiated rats, but similar attempts were unsuccessful in irradiated mice, monkeys, and humans. In this study, we tested a stronger hormonal suppression regimen (the GnRH antagonist, acyline, and plus flutamide) for efficacy both in restoring endogenous spermatogenesis and in enhancing colonization of transplanted stem spermatogonia in mouse testes irradiated with a total doses between 10.5 and 13.5 Gy. A 4-week hormonal suppression treatment, given immediately after irradiation, increased endogenous spermatogenic recovery 1.5-fold, and 11-week hormonal suppression produced twofold increases compared with sham-treated irradiated controls. Furthermore, 10-week hormonal suppression restored fertility from endogenous surviving spermatogonial stem cells in 90% of 10.5-Gy irradiated mice, whereas only 10% were fertile without hormonal suppression. Four-and 11-week hormonal suppression also enhanced spermatogenic development from transplanted stem spermatogonia in irradiated recipient mice, by 3.1-and 4.8-fold, respectively, compared with those not given hormonal treatment. Moreover, the 10-week hormonal suppression regimen, but not a sham treatment, restored fertility of some 13.5-Gy irradiated recipient mice from donor-derived spermatogonial stem cells. This is the first report of hormonal suppression inducing recovery of endogenous spermatogenesis and fertility in a mouse model treated with anticancer agents. The combination of spermatogonial transplantation with hormonal suppression should be investigated as a treatment to restore fertility in young men after cytotoxic cancer therapy. © The Author 2010.

4598,"Prospective study of topical 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy for the treatment of moderate to severe acne vulgaris in Chinese patients. Background: Topical photodynamic therapy (PDT) mediated with 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) offers an alternative option for the treatment of acne vulgaris. Objective(s): To study the effects of ALA dose, incubation time, and lesion type on protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) production and treatment outcomes. Method(s): To examine the time course of PpIX production, 10% ALA was applied to inflammatory papules for 1 to 5 hours and followed by in situ fluorescence examination. To determine the effects of ALA dose and lesion type, 3, 5, and 10% ALA was applied to acne lesions in split-face fashion for 3 hours followed by whole-face light irradiation at 633 nm and 30 to 70 J/cm2. Treatment was repeated twice at 2-week intervals. Result(s): PpIX reached a stable level after 3 hours of incubation. Similar PpIX levels were seen in areas receiving 3, 5, and 10% ALA. Poisson regression analyses indicated that lesion counts decreased by 0.791 times for a one-unit increase in treatment times (95% CI 0.782-0.799, p < .0001) but only by 0.999 times for a one-unit increase in ALA dose (95% CI 0.998-1.000, p = .22).

4599,"Promising clinical outcomes of sequential and ""Sandwich"" chemotherapy and extended involved-field intensity-modulated radiotherapy in patients with stage IE/IIE extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma. Background: The optimal treatment for the rare subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL), nasal-type, has not been clearly defined. The purpose of the study was to investigate the efficacy of sequential and ""Sandwich"" chemotherapy and extended involved-field intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in patients with stage IE/IIE extranodal ENKTL, nasal-type. Method(s): One hundred and fifty-five patients with stage IE/IIE nasal-type ENKTL were enrolled in the study, including 99 patients treated with sequential chemotherapy and extended involved-field IMRT (SCRT) and 56 patients with ""Sandwich"" chemotherapy and extended involved-field IMRT and chemotherapy (SCRCT). All patients were treated with extended involved-field IMRT with median dose of 54.6 Gy to the primary tumor and positive lymph nodes. Ninety-four patients had Ann Arbor stage IE disease, and 61 patients had stage IIE disease. Result(s): The 5-year rates of loco-regional recurrence (LRR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were 17.0%, 78.5%, and 84.7%, respectively. Univariate analysis revealed that EBV DNA copy after treatment (normal vs elevated level) was significant prognostic factor for LRR, PFS, and OS (P < 0.001); therapeutic method (SCRT vs SCRCT) was significant prognostic factor for PFS (71.0% vs 91.8%, P = 0.011), but there was no significant effect on 5-year LRR and OS (22.2% vs 8.2%, P = 0.051 for LRR; 80.9% vs 91.8%, P = 0.199 for OS). Conclusion(s): Compared with SCRT, SCRCT was significantly associated with higher PFS rates and showed a trend toward improved loco-regional control.

4600,"Gamma Knife radiosurgery combined with stereotactic aspiration as an effective treatment method for large cystic brain metastases. In the present study, the efficacy and clinical outcomes of stereotactic aspiration combined with the Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) method were evaluated retrospectively for patients with large cystic brain metastases. This combined method aims to decrease the tumor weight (volume) and increase the possible radiation dose. The present study involved 48 patients who were diagnosed with cystic metastatic brain tumors between January 2008 and December 2012 in the Department of Neurosurgery of Nanfang Hospital Southern Medical University (Guangzhou, China). Every patient underwent Leksell stereotactic frame, 1.5T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided stereotactic cyst aspiration and Leksell GKRS. Subsequent to the therapy, MRI was performed every 3 months. The results indicated that 48 cases were followed up for 24-72 months, with a mean follow-up duration of 36.2 months. Following treatment, 44 patients (91.7%) exhibited tumor control and 4 patients (8.3%) experienced progression of the local tumor. During this period, 35 patients (72.9%) succumbed, but only 2 (4.2%) of these succumbed to the brain metastases. The total local control rate was 91.7% and the median overall survival time of all patients was 19.5 months. The 1-year overall survival rate was 70.8% and the 2-year overall survival rate was 26.2%. In conclusion, these results indicated that the method of stereotactic cyst aspiration combined with GKRS was safe and effective for patients with large cystic brain metastases. This method is effective for patients whose condition is too weak for general anesthesia and in whom the tumors are positioned at eloquent areas. This method enables patients to avoid a craniotomy, and provides a good tumor control rate, survival time and quality of life.Copyright © 2016, Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.",Excluded
4601,"Single-balloon versus double-balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. Twenty-eight patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCF) were treated with single-balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty (Group A), and 40 patients were treated with double-balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty (Group B). Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score, vertebral height, and kyphotic angle (KA) were evaluated pre-operatively, post-operatively (3 days after surgery) and at final follow-up. Operative time, X-ray exposure frequency and costs were recorded. The mean operative time and X-ray exposure frequency in Group A were greater than in Group B (p < 0.05). Significant improvement of the VAS score was noted in each group, and remained unchanged at final follow-up. Mean increases of anterior and middle height of the fractured vertebral body were 5.14 mm and 4.14 mm in Group A, respectively, and 6.22 mm and 5.06 mm in Group B, respectively, and the differences between the groups were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Mean reduction of KA was 6.9degree in Group A and 8.8degree in Group B, which was statistically significant (p < 0.05). No statistically significant difference was observed in terms of cement leakage between groups. The mean cost of Group A (US$4202) was significantly less than that of Group B (US$6220) (p < 0.001). Single-balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty is a safe and cost-effective surgical method for the treatment of OVCF. It can achieve pain relief comparable with double-balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty. However, double-balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty is more efficacious in terms of the restoration of vertebral height and reduction of KA, and the operative time and X-ray exposure frequency are lower.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

4602,"Utilization of stem cells in alginate for nucleus pulposus tissue engineering. In a general view of anatomy, intervertebral disc is composed of three parts: annulus fibrosus (AF), nucleus pulposus (NP), and cartilage endplate (CEP). Recently, several types of stem cells were successfully isolated from these corresponding regions, but up to now, no research was performed about which kind of stem cells is the most efficient candidate for NP tissue engineering or for stem cell-based disc regeneration therapy. In this study, we compared the regenerative potentials of the above-mentioned three kinds of disc-derived stem cells with that of the classic bone marrow (BM)-mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in a rabbit disc degeneration model. By magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), X-ray, histology, etc. evaluations, we found that cartilage endplate-derived stem cells (CESCs) showed superior capacity compared with the annulus fibrosus-derived stem cells (AFSCs), nucleus pulposus-derived stem cells (NPSCs), and BM-MSCs (p<0.05); additionally, when comparing the CESC group with the normal control group, there existed no statistical difference in X-ray (p>0.05). Those results demonstrated that the CESC-seeded alginate construct performed the most powerful ability for NP regeneration, while AFSCs showed the most inferior potency, NPSCs and BM-MSCs had similar regenerative capacity and located in the middle. All in all, our study showed that CESCs might act as an efficient seed cell source for NP tissue engineering, which paved a new way for the biological solution of disc degeneration diseases. © Copyright 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2014.",Excluded
4603,"Minimally invasive or open transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion as revision surgery for patients previously treated by open discectomy and decompression of the lumbar spine. Minimally invasive lumbar fusion techniques have been developed in recent 20 years. The goals of these procedures are to reduce approach-related soft tissue injury, postoperative pain, and disability while allowing the surgery to be conducted in an effective manner. There have been no prospective clinical reports published on the comparison of minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion as revision surgery for patients previously treated by open discectomy and decompression or a traditional open approach. A prospective clinical study was performed by evaluating the clinical and radiographic results of minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion as an alternative new technique in the revision surgery for patients previously treated by open procedure. 52 patients (28 M, 24 F) with an average age of 55.7 (31-76) were prospectively evaluated. All patients who had previous discectomy (n = 13), hemilaminectomy (n = 16), laminectomy (n = 12) and facetectomy (n = 11) underwent monosegmental and bisegmental minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (MiTLIF) (n = 25) or open transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (OTLIF) (n = 27) by two experienced surgeons at one hospital, from March 2006 to October 2008 (minimum 12-month follow-up). The following data were compared between the two groups: the clinical and radiographic results, operative time, blood loss, X-ray exposure time, postoperative back pain, and complications. Clinical outcome was assessed using the visual analogue scale and the Oswestry disability index (ODI). The operative time and clinical and radiographic results were basically identical in both groups. Comparing with the OTLIF group, the MiTLIF group had significantly less blood loss and less postoperative back pain at the second day postoperatively. The radiation time was significantly longer in the MiTLIF group. Complications included three cases of small dural tear in the MiTLIF group. There were five cases of dural tear and two cases of superficial wound infection in the OTLIF group. One case of nonunion was observed from each group. Minimally invasive TLIF is a safe and effective procedure for treatment of selected revision patients previously treated by open surgery with some potential advantages. However, this technique needs longer X-ray exposure time. © Springer-Verlag 2010.",Excluded

To analyze the tritium internal exposure dose of workers in the Third Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant over the past 15 years. Urine samples provided by workers are tested directly to analyze the tritium concentrations and estimate internal exposure dose. Since 2004, an average of approximately 1600 workers have been monitored annually, with an average annual monitoring frequency of approximately 11 000. Since 2004, the average annual collective dose of tritium internal exposure was 149.62 person.mSv, accounting for 19.07% of the total annual collective dose. A total of 18 workers' annual individual internal tritium radiation doses exceeded 2 mSv, of which 5 workers' internal tritium radiation doses in a single intake exceeded 2 mSv. The occupational population with the largest total internal tritium radiation doses consists of maintenance personnel, fuel operators, and radiation protection personnel, whose collective doses of internal exposure account for 75.51% of the total collective doses within the plant.

Radiation exposure with use of intraoperative fluoroscopy is a potential orthopedic occupational risk factor. The purpose of this study was to perform a prospective comparison of hand versus eye radiation exposure associated with mini-C-arm utilization and to test the hypothesis that routine mini-C-arm does not yield hand or eye dosages exceeding current recommended levels. Over a 12-month period, hand and eye radiation exposure was prospectively measured in a single board-certified hand surgeon using mini-C-arm fluoroscopy. Twenty-five cases were performed utilizing mini-C-arm fluoroscopy. Average monthly hand radiation dosage (45.81+/-14.49 mrem) was significantly higher (p = .01) than eye radiation dosage (<30 mrem). Both recorded values were below their respective critical exposure limits, as reported by the International Commission on Radiological Protection.

4606,"The development and biological characteristics of a novel potentially radioresistant inbred mouse strain. The growth of biomedical research over the previous decades has been accompanied by an increase in the number, complexity and diversity of experimental animals developed as research tools, and inbred mice are some of the most widely used. However, thus far, no inbred mice have exhibited strong radioresistance for use in radiation-damage research. To develop a radioresistant mouse model, a female Japanese outbreeding strain ICR/JCL mouse was mated with a male Chinese inbred strain 615 mouse. From the F1 generation, the mouse line was maintained by brother-to-sister mating. A novel mouse strain was established over >20 continuous generations and designated the Institute of Radiation Medicine-2 (IRM-2) mouse. The biological characteristics, genetic characteristics and susceptibility to radiation of these mice were determined. The IRM-2 mice inherited traits from the parents, including strong reproductive capacity, stable physiological and biochemical indices and few differences among individuals. According to the genetic results, the IRM-2 mice exhibited homozygosity, isogenicity and consistency, in agreement with international standards for inbred strains. Radiosensitivity studies have previously suggested that the lethal dose (LD)50 values for IRM-2 mice were 7.17 Gy (male) and 7.5 Gy (female), resulting in a dose reduction factor value of 1.39 (male) and 1.37 (female). The mortality of IRM-2 mice irradiated with 8 Gy total body irradiation was 15% at day 9 and 90% at day 15 after radiation. The number of nucleated cells in bone marrow, DNA content and colony-forming unit-spleen counts in IRM-2 mice after exposure to gamma-ray irradiation were markedly higher than the corresponding values for the parental strains, suggesting that the IRM-2 mice exhibit high resistance to ionizing radiation. Thus, it is suggested that this novel inbred mouse strain may be developed as an animal model of radioresistance for future use in radiation research.",Excluded

METHOD(S): From 1994 to 2000, 3 patients (1 with clavicle osteosynthesis, 1 with chronic clavicle osteomyelitis, and 1 with radioactive ulcer in clavicular region accompanied by chronic osteomyelitis of clavicle) were reconstructed with turnover adipofascial flap, myocutaneous flap of pectoris, and myocutaneous flap of latissimus dorsal respectively. The outcome was observed. The operation principles of tissue flaps transferring for wound repair of the clavicle were summarized. RESULT(S): Follow-ups were done for 2 months to 7 years. All tissue flaps survived well and the wounds in clavicular region were healed well. There was no recurrence of chronic clavicle osteomyelitis. CONCLUSION(S): Turnover adipofascial flap, myocutaneous flap of pectoris and latissimus dorsal are often used for wound repair of the clavicle. Most of the wounds of the clavicle can be repaired by turnover adipofascial flap. Myocutaneous flap of pectoris and latissimus dorsal are more suitable for wound repair with chronic clavicle osteomyelitis. In the case of radioactive ulcer of the clavicular region, myocutaneous flap of latissimus dorsal transposition is a better alternative for wound repair.",Excluded

The aim of the present study was to estimate the biodistribution and clinical radiation dosimetry of18F-P3BZA in healthy volunteers and perform a preliminary clinical application for PET/CT imaging in melanoma patients. Method(s):18F-P3BZA was produced efficiently with a radiosynthesizer. Six healthy volunteers were injected with18F-P3BZA (211.7 +/- 15.4 MBq) followed by serial whole-body PET/CT scans and blood tests to assess biodistribution, pharmacokinetic, and radiation dosimetry at 10 min, 1 h, 2 h, and 4 h after injection. The vital signs of volunteers were recorded in regular intervals during the imaging sessions. The effective dose for each subject after the medical internal radiation dosimetry schema was calculated with OLINDA/EXM software. For the preliminary clinical application, 5 patients with suspected melanomas underwent18F-P3BZA PET/CT imaging at 10 min and 1 h after injection. All patients also underwent18F-FDG PET/CT scans on the third day to compare the potential diagnostic ability of18F-P3BZA with18F-FDG. Result(s): The radiochem-istry yield of18F-P3BZA labeling was 12.3% +/- 3.9%, and the purity of18F-P3BZA after purification and formulation was higher than 99.5%. The highest uptake of18F-P3BZA was in the liver with an SUVmean of 8.3 +/- 1.0 at 10 min after injection. The resultant whole-body effective dose was 0.0193 mSv/MBq.18F-P3BZA showed high uptake and suggested an ability for specific imaging of melanoma and its metastasis in patients.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine whether recurrence of meningiomas could be reduced by combining somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) of Tc-HYNIC-octreotide SPECT/CT and radio guidance with a hand-held gamma-probe during surgery., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients with meningiomas diagnosed by MRI and considered as the study group were treated with Tc-HYNIC-octreotide SPECT/CT preoperatively and pathologically examined postoperatively. Another 60 patients considered as the control group underwent only an MRI preoperatively and a pathological examination postoperatively. For the patients in the study group, meningiomas were removed by a hand-held gamma-probe 4-12 h after SRS; these patients were followed up by MRI examination each year for 5 years to monitor the recurrence rate of the meningiomas. For the control group, routine operations without radio guidance were performed and followed up with MRI examination simultaneously., RESULTS: All patients in the study group, comprising 20 with grade I and 10 with grade II meningiomas, showed high Tc-HYNIC-octreotide accumulation with a sensitivity of 100% for SRS; four patients (13.3%) relapsed after a 5-year follow-up, including one (5%) patient with a grade I and three (30%) patients with a grade II meningioma. However, among the 60 control patients, 30 were of grade I and 30 were of grade II; 18 patients (30%) experienced recurrence, including five (16.7%) grade I patients and 13 (43.3%) grade II patients. There were significant differences in recurrence between the study group and the control group when considering all the patients and those in grade I and grade II (all P values were below 0.001)., CONCLUSION: Tc-HYNIC-octreotide SPECT/CT SRS is a sensitive technique for detecting meningiomas, and radio guidance using a hand-held gamma-probe with Tc-HYNIC-octreotide during surgery can significantly reduce the recurrence of meningiomas.",Excluded

Method(s): From July 1996 to April 2011, 47 HNC patients treated with fractionated re-RT developed locoregional failure. Recurrence sites were oropharynx (n = 12), neck (n = 11), oral cavity (n = 9), larynx (n = 5), paranasal sinuses (n = 5), parotid (n = 4), and hypopharynx (n = 1). Median initial radiation therapy (RT) dose was 65 Gy and median time between radiations was 32.2 months. Salvage surgery was performed in 21 patients (45 %), and 37 patients (79 %) received concurrent chemotherapy. Median re-RT dose was 60 Gy, and all patients received intensity-modulated RT. Patterns of failure were assessed by reviewing target volume delineation and compared slice-by-slice visually alongside axial imaging documenting locoregional recurrence. There was no intention to encompass prophylactic subclinical regions at risk. Coding of failures was either in-field (InF) or out-of-field (OutF). All others were marginal failures (margF). Result(s): With a median follow-up of 24.5 months, the median time to locoregional progression-free survival (LRPFS) was 5.3 months and median overall survival (OS) was 12.5 months. Failures were documented as InF in 42 patients (89 %), OutF in three patients (6 %), and margF in two patients (4 %). Five patients died while undergoing re-RT. Patients who developed OutF occurred at sites beyond 2 cm from the tumor volume. Conclusion(s): In our series of recurrent HNC patients who underwent salvage re-RT, the vast majority of locoregional failures were InF. We feel that confining re-RT targets to the gross tumor volume or postoperative clinical target volume without treating the subclinical regions at risk for failure is sufficient. With current image guidance capabilities, reducing the planning target volume margin may further minimize toxicities. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
4612,"Misdiagnosed male breast cancer with an unknown primary tumor: A case report. Compared with female breast cancer, male breast cancer (MBC) has an extremely low morbidity, later staging and fewer breast tissues. The lumps are easier to invade in the center and the majority of the cases are positive for metastatic lymph node, with the typical clinical manifestation as a painless mass in partial breast. MBC with an unknown primary tumor is rare and is often prone to misdiagnosis, resulting in a delay in correct treatment. Such a case is extremely significant for clinical reference. The current study presents a 58-year-old male who developed a painless mass in the left armpit and received armpit mass biopsy and pathological examination which showed glandular cancer, with a high possibility of mammary primary tumor. The patient was administered four cycles of paclitaxel plus oxaliplatin chemotherapy. However, three months later, the patient identified novel disseminated lymph nodes in the left armpit. The initial pathological section and paraffin blocks were re-examined and the patient was finally diagnosed with breast invasive ductal carcinoma based on the metastases pathology and immunohistochemical examination. No breast mass was found on physical examination of the patient and the tumor markers, including cancer antigen 125 and carcinoembryonic antigen, were normal. No primary tumors were observed in the mammography and PET-CT and the primary tumor was not found following the left breast modified radical mastectomy.",Excluded
4613,"Clinical and Sialographic Imaging Features of 131I Radiation-induced Submandibular Gland Sialadenitis. Purpose: 131I radiation-induced sialadenitis is the most frequent complication of 131I treatment for papillary thyroid carcinoma, but little is known about 131I radiation-induced submandibular gland sialadenitis. The purpose of this study was to compare and contrast the clinical and sialographic imaging features of 131I radiation-induced submandibular gland sialadenitis to 131I radiation-induced parotitis. Patients and Methods: This retrospective cross-sectional study included patients with 131I radiation-induced submandibular gland sialadenitis and parotitis. Clinical records and sialographic image features were evaluated. The predictor variables included age at the time of diagnosis, gender, course of the disease, site of symptoms, and sialographic image grades. The outcome variable was the location of sialadenitis. A student t-test was conducted to analyze the associations between predictor variables and the outcome. Result(s): The sample was composed of 4 patients with submandibular gland sialadenitis (100% female), 28 with parotitis (85.7% female), and 1 with submandibular gland sialadenitis and parotitis (P <.05). The occurrence of bilateral glands dysfunction was less often in submandibular glands (SMG: 1/4; PG: 19/28). The age and course of disease were not different between submandibular gland sialadenitis and parotitis (Age, SMG: 46.00 +/- 13.59 years; PG: 50.04 +/- 10.71 years, P >.05; Course of the disease, SMG: 11.00 +/- 16.69 months; PG: 6.96 +/- 11.18 months, P >.05). Radiographically, 7 of 16 patients with parotitis were identified as grade 2 and 9 patients as grade 3. In 3 patients with submandibular gland sialadenitis, 1 patient was identified as grade 2 and 2 patients as grade 3. The postoperative pathological results showed that the proliferation of glandular tissue from the hilum of the submandibular gland caused duct stenosis. Conclusion(s): The results suggest 131I radiation-induced submandibular gland sialadenitis has a lower incidence compared with parotitis and 131I radiation-induced submandibular gland sialadenitis might be related to duct stenosis caused by proliferative glandular tissue after 131I radiation treatment.Copyright © 2020 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons",Excluded
4614,"Safety and effectiveness of de-escalated radiation dose in T1-3 nasopharyngeal carcinoma: A propensity matched analysis. Backgrounds: With the excellent local control in T1 to T3 nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treated with intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), the importance of toxicities is increasingly being recognised. This retrospective propensity score analysis sought to assess whether moderate dose reduction compromised long-term outcome compared with standard dose in T1-3 NPCs. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 266 patients (67 female, 199 male) with a median age of 50 years between June 2011 and June 2015 were analysed. All were treated with IMRT, with or without systemic chemotherapy. The prescription radiation dose to gross tumor is 70Gy/2.12Gy/33F in our institution. Result(s): With a median follow-up time of 50 months, the 5-year loco-regional failure-free survival (LRFS) and overall survival (OS) were 93.5% and 81.8%, respectively. 32 patients received radiation dose less than prescription dose, with a median dose of 63.6Gy (53-67Gy). Another 234 patients received exactly the prescription dose of 70Gy. Propensity scores were computed (32 patients treated with de-escalated dose and 64 patients with standard dose), there was no significant difference in 5-year LRFS and 5-year OS between the two groups (92.5% and 91.7% with standard dose; 82.1% and 85.7% with de-escalation dose; p=0.863 for LRFS and 0.869 for OS). No independent prognostic factor was associated with loco-regional failure in univariate analysis. Conclusion(s): T1-3 nasopharyngeal carcinoma presenting with superior locoregional control, a moderately reduced dose (about 10%) delivered with IMRT resulted in comparable prognosis to those with prescription dose of 70Gy.Copyright © The author(s).",Excluded
4615,"A matched-pair analysis of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for oligometastatic lung tumors from colorectal cancer versus early stage non-small cell lung cancer. Background: The use of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for early-stage primary non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) reported excellent local control rates. But the optimal SBRT dose for oligometastatic lung tumors (OLTs) from colorectal cancer (CRC) has not yet been determined. This study aimed to evaluate whether SBRT to a dose of 48-60 Gy in 4-5 fractions could result in similar local outcomes for OLTs from CRC as compared to early-stage NSCLC, and to examine potential dose-response relationships for OLTs from CRC. Method(s): OLTs from CRC and primary NSCLCs treated with SBRT to 48-60 Gy in 4-5 fractions at a single institution were evaluated, and a matched-pair analysis was performed. Local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate Cox regression was performed to identify significant predictors. Result(s): There were 72 lung lesions in 61 patients (24 OLTs from CRC in 15 patients and 48 NSCLCs in 46 patients) were analyzed with a median follow-up of 30 months. LRFS for OLTs from CRC was significantly worse than that of NSCLC when treated with 48-60 Gy/4-5 fx (p = 0.006). The 1, 3 and 5-year LRFS of OLTs from CRC vs NSCLC were 80.6% vs. 100%, 68.6% vs. 97.2%, and 68.6% vs. 81.0%, respectively. On univariate analysis, OLTs from CRC treated with higher dose (BED10 = 132 Gy) exhibited significantly better local recurrence-free survival than those treated to lower doses (BED10 <= 105.6 Gy) (p = 0.0022). The 1 and 3-year LRFS rates for OLTs treated to a higher dose (BED10 = 132 Gy) were 88.9% and 81.5%, vs 33.3%, and not achieved for lower doses (BED10 <= 105.6 Gy). Conclusion(s): The LRFS of OLTs from CRC after SBRT of 48-60 Gy/4-5 fx was significantly worse than that of primary NSCLC. Lower dose SBRT appeared to have inferior control for OLTs of CRC in this cohort. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).",Excluded

4617,"Effects of Far-Infrared Therapy on Foot Circulation Among Hemodialysis Patients With Diabetes Mellitus. BACKGROUND: Far-infrared radiation (FIR) therapy improves vessel dilation, circulation, vessel endothelial function, and angiogenesis and reduces atherosclerosis. However, evidence of FIR therapy's effects on foot circulation among diabetic patients undergoing hemodialysis is scarce., AIM: To determine whether FIR therapy improves foot circulation in diabetic patients undergoing hemodialysis., DESIGN: Quasi-experimental., METHODS: In June to November 2017, diabetic patients undergoing hemodialysis (N = 58) at a hemodialysis center in northern Taiwan were divided into two groups: the experimental group (n = 31) received FIR therapy to the bilateral dorsalis pedis artery (40 min/session, 3 times/week for 6 months) and the control group (n = 27) received conventional dialysis care. Paired t test, independent samples t test, two-proportion Z test, and repeated-measures analysis of covariance were performed to compare changes from baseline to the end of the 6-month intervention between the groups., RESULTS: Significant positive effects of FIR therapy on temperature, pulse, and blood flow of the dorsalis pedis artery were observed. Sensitivity to pain, tactility, and pressure also improved significantly in the experimental group. The Edinburgh Claudication Questionnaire revealed that the experimental group had reductions in subjective experiences of soreness, tingling, and coldness in the feet., CONCLUSION: The findings of significant improvements to objective and subjective measures of blood flow and neural function in the experimental group indicate that FIR therapy improves blood circulation to the feet. This therapy thus has great potential to be an effective adjuvant treatment for patients with diabetes mellitus undergoing hemodialysis.",Excluded
4618,"Survival prediction in high-grade gliomas using CT perfusion imaging. Patients with high-grade gliomas usually have heterogeneous response to surgery and chemoirradiation. The objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate serial changes in tumor volume and perfusion imaging parameters and (2) to determine the value of these data in predicting overall survival (OS). Twenty-nine patients with World Health Organization grades III and IV gliomas underwent magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) perfusion examinations before surgery, and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after radiotherapy. Serial measurements of tumor volumes and perfusion parameters were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic analysis, Cox proportional hazards regression, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to determine their values in predicting OS. Higher trends in blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV), and permeability-surface area product in the contrast-enhancing lesions (CEL) and the non-enhancing lesions (NEL) were found in patients with OS < 18 months compared to those with OS >= 18 months, and these values were significant at selected time points (P < 0.05). Only CT perfusion parameters yielded sensitivities and specificities of >=70 % in predicting 18 and 24 months OS. Pre-surgery BF in the NEL and BV in the CEL and NEL 3 months after radiotherapy had sensitivities and specificities >80 % in predicting 24 months OS in patients with grade IV gliomas. Our study indicated that CT perfusion parameters were predictive of survival and could be useful in assessing early response and in selecting adjuvant treatment to prolong survival if verified in a larger cohort of patients.Copyright © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Excluded
4619,"Regression models for near-infrared measurement of subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness. Obesity is often associated with the risks of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and there is a need to measure subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) thickness for acquiring the distribution of body fat. The present study aimed to develop and evaluate different model-based methods for SAT thickness measurement using an SATmeter developed in our laboratory. Near-infrared signals backscattered from the body surfaces from 40 subjects at 20 body sites each were recorded. Linear regression (LR) and support vector regression (SVR) models were established to predict SAT thickness on different body sites. The measurement accuracy was evaluated by ultrasound, and compared with results from a mechanical skinfold caliper (MSC) and a body composition balance monitor (BCBM). The results showed that both LR- and SVR-based measurement produced better accuracy than MSC and BCBM. It was also concluded that by using regression models specifically designed for certain parts of human body, higher measurement accuracy could be achieved than using a general model for the whole body. Our results demonstrated that the SATmeter is a feasible method, which can be applied at home and in the community due to its portability and convenience.",Excluded
4620,"Relationship of Th17/treg cells and radiation pneumonia in locally advanced esophageal carcinoma. Background/Aim: Radiation pneumonia is a main side-effect that has limited the clinical usage of radiotherapy in locally advanced esophageal carcinoma. T helper cells 17 (Th 17) and T regulatory cells (Tregs) play an important role in inflammatory diseases. The balance between Treg and Th17 cells is a key factor in the progression of many inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Whether Tregs and Th17 cells are predictive factors of radiation pneumonia has not yet been reported. In this study, we investigated the relationships of Treg/Th17 cells and radiation pneumonia in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer who received radiotherapy. Patients and Methods: One hundred and forty-eight patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer who received radical and palliative radiotherapy were enrolled. The levels of Th17 and Treg cells in the blood of patients were detected using flow cytometry at the time point of pre-radiotherapy, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th week from the start of radiation and 4 weeks after completion of radiotherapy. Radiation pneumonia was evaluated according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group's acute radiation pneumonia standards, with the endpoint being grade 2 or above radiation pneumonia. Result(s): There were 24 cases of radiation pneumonia in 148 cases of locally advanced esophageal cancer patients who underwent radiotherapy. Th17 cells increased and, in contrast, Treg cells decreased in the radiation pneumonia group. The change in the ratio of Th17/Treg was more pronounced and the difference was statistically significant from the 5th week after irradiation compared to patients with no radiation pneumonia (p<0.05). There was no significant difference in dosimetric parameters, including V5, V20, V30 and mean lung dose (MLD) and clinical factors, such as gender, age, smoking history, history of surgery and chemotherapy. Conclusion(s): The ratio of Th17/Treg cells may be an effective predictive factor of radiation pneumonia.",Excluded
4621,"Ultraviolet-B induces ERCC6 repression in lens epithelium cells of age-related nuclear cataract through coordinated DNA hypermethylation and histone deacetylation. Background: Ultraviolet-B (UVB) exposure attributes to the formation of age-related nuclear cataract (ARNC), which is mediated with DNA damage. DNA damage, an important factor for pathogenesis of ARNC, is induced by UVB, and is generally resolved by the nucleotide excision repair (NER) repair mechanism. Cockayne syndrome complementation group B (CSB) protein coded by ERCC6 is a vital component for NER. However, we found no association between selected ERCC6 polymorphisms and ARNC. In this study, we investigated whether UVB exposure could alter ERCC6 expression and the process could involve epigenetic changes of DNA methylation and/or histone acetylation of ERCC6 in the lens epithelial cells (LECs). We also assessed the involvement of those coordinated changes in lens tissue from ARNC patients. Result(s): mRNA and protein expression of ERCC6 in lens tissue (LECs) were lower in ARNCs than those in the controls. This reduction corresponded to methylation of a CpG site at the ERCC6 promoter and histone modifications (methylation and acetylation) nearby this site. UVB-treated human lens epithelium B3 (HLE-B3) and 239T cell presented (1) increased apoptosis, suggesting reduced UV-damage repair, (2) hypermethylation of the CpG site located at position -441 (relative to transcription start site) within the binding region for transcriptional factor Sp1 in the ERCC6 promoter, (3) the enhancement of histone H3K9 deacetylation, (4) induction in DNA methyltransferases 3b (DNMT3b) and histone deacetylase1 (HDAC1) associated to the CpG site of ERCC6 by CHIP assay. Conclusion(s): These findings suggest an orchestrated mechanism triggered by UVB radiation where the concurrent association of specific hypermethylation CpG site, H3K9 deacetylation of ERCC6, and repression of ERCC6 gene expression. Taken together, with the similar changes in the lens tissue from ARNC patients, our data unveiled a possible mechanism of epigenetic modification of DNA repair gene in the pathogenesis of ARNC.Copyright © 2016, The Author(s).",Excluded
4622,"Swallowing functional outcomes and nutritional status in head and neck cancer radiotherapy: longitudinal study. OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationships between swallowing functional outcomes and nutritional status in patients with head and neck cancer undergoing radiotherapy (RT). METHOD(S): This longitudinal study included 122 patients. Data were collected at three time points: baseline (T1), the third week of RT (T2) and the completion of RT (T3). The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events was used to assess the symptom of dysphagia and other toxicities; the MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI) was used to assess the patient-perceived swallowing functional outcomes; the nutritional status was evaluated by the weight ratio and the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA). The generalised estimating equation (GEE) was used to measure the correlation of MDADI with the weight ratio or PG-SGA and also to analyse the influential factors of swallowing functional outcomes. RESULT(S): The participants' acute dysphagia rates were 5.7% at T1, 69.7% at T2 and 77.9% at T3. The swallowing functional outcomes worsen over RT (p<0.001) and were associated with weight ratio (beta=0.032, p=0.008) and PG-SGA (beta=-0.115, p<0.001). GEE models showed that patients with cancer of the pharynx region, advanced stage, chemoradiotherapy and high RT dose perceived worse swallowing functional outcomes. Oral mucositis, pharynx mucositis and salivary gland inflammation were positively correlated with swallowing functional outcomes, and the pharynx mucositis presented the highest absolute value of beta. CONCLUSION(S): The swallowing functional outcomes were negatively correlated with nutritional status. Healthcare professionals should identify early on the population at higher risk and focus on multiple toxicities, especially the management of pharynx mucositis, to improve nutritional status.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

4623,"Value of lung perfusion in stage III non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with three dimensional conformal radiotherapy. Objective: To investigate the value of lung perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scans in patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with three dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT). Method(s): Eight patients with stage III NSCLC who were candidated for 3DCRT were enrolled. All the patients had PET-CT scans and SPECT scans. The imagings were accurately co-registered in the planning system. The PET-CT images were used to define the gross tumor volume, and the SPECT images were used to define a volume of perfused ""functioning"" lung (FL). The planning objective was to minimize the dose to FL. Statistical analysis was made for the difference between the two sets of 3DCRT plans. Result(s): After 3DCRT was optimized, both the percentage of whole lung volume received dose >=xGy (WLVx) and the percentage of functional lung volume received dose >=xGy (FLVx) were decreased. However, the FLVx was decreased significantly. There were significant differences in WLV10, WLV15, WLV20, WLV25, WLV30 and FLV10, FLV15, FLV20, FLV25, FLV30 between before and after the 3DCRT was optimized (P=0.001, 0.002, 0.014, 0.046, 0.017 and 0.000, 0.000, 0.004, 0.027, 0.023).

4624,"T95 nucleophosmin phosphorylation as a novel mediator and marker of regulated cell death in acute kidney injury. The function of site-specific phosphorylation of nucleophosmin (NPM), an essential Bax chaperone, in stress-induced cell death is unknown. We hypothesized that NPM threonine 95 (T95) phosphorylation both signals and promotes cell death. In resting cells, NPM exclusively resides in the nucleus and T95 is nonphosphorylated. In contrast, phosphorylated T95 NPM (pNPM T95) accumulates in the cytosol after metabolic stress, in multiple human cancer cell lines following gamma-radiation, and in postischemic human kidney tissue. Based on the T95 phosphorylation consensus sequence, we hypothesized that glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) regulates cytosolic NPM translocation by phosphorylating T95 NPM. In a cell-free system, GSK-3beta phosphorylated a synthetic NPM peptide containing T95. In vitro, bidirectional manipulation of GSK-3beta activity substantially altered T95 phosphorylation, cytosolic NPM translocation, and cell survival during stress, mechanistically linking these lethal events. Furthermore, GSK-3beta inhibition in vivo decreased cytosolic pNPM T95 accumulation in kidney tissue after experimental ischemia. In patients with acute kidney injury, both cytosolic NPM accumulation in proximal tubule cells and NPM-rich intratubular casts were detected in frozen renal biopsy tissue. These observations show, for the first time, that GSK-3beta promotes cell death partly by phosphorylating NPM at T95, to promote cytosolic NPM accumulation. T95 NPM is also a rational therapeutic target to ameliorate ischemic renal cell injury and may be a universal injury marker in mammalian cells.Copyright © 2020 the American Physiological Society",Excluded
4625,"Primary Tumour Resection Could Improve the Survival of Unresectable Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Patients Receiving Bevacizumab-Containing Chemotherapy. BACKGROUND: The effect of primary tumour resection (PTR) among metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients remains controversial. Combination chemotherapy with bevacizumab could improve the clinical outcomes of these patients, which might change the importance of PTR in the multi-disciplinary treatment pattern., METHODS: We performed a non-randomized prospective controlled study of mCRC pts whose performance status (PS) scored <=2 and who received bevacizumab combination chemotherapy (FOLFOX/XELOX/FOLFIRI) as a first-line therapy. These patients were classified into the PTR group and the IPT (intact primary tumour) group according to whether they underwent PTR before receiving the systemic therapy. The progression free survival (PFS) time and overall survival (OS) time, which were recorded from the start of the primary diagnosis until disease progression and death or last follow-up, were analysed. We also compared severe clinical events (such as emergency surgery, radiation therapy, and stent plantation) between the two groups., RESULTS: One hundred and nighty-one mCRC pts (108 male patients and 93 female patients) were entered in this prospective observational study. The median age was 57.5 years old. The clinical characteristics (age, gender, performance status, primary tumour site, RAS status, and the number of metastatic organs) did not significantly differ between the two groups. The median PFS and OS times of the PTR group were superior than those of the IPT group (10.0 vs 7.8 months, p < 0.01 and 22.5 vs 17.8 months, p < 0.01, respectively). The incidences of adverse events associated with systemic therapy were similar between the two groups. Specifically, sixteen patients (21.9%, 16/73) with IPT developed significant primary tumour-related complications, such as bleeding, obstruction or even perforation. Among these patients, five underwent emergency surgery, three patients received a stent, and eight patients underwent radiation therapy., CONCLUSIONS: The mCRC patients who received PTR and bevacizumab combination chemotherapy had better clinical outcomes than patients who did not receive PTR. PTR also decreased the incidence of severe clinical events and improved quality of life. Copyright © 2016 The Author(s) Published by S. Karger AG, Basel.",Excluded
4626,"Gut microbial dysbiosis is associated with development and progression of radiation enteritis during pelvic radiotherapy. Radiation enteritis (RE) is the most common complication of radiotherapy for pelvic irradiation receivers. Herein we investigated the alterations in gut microbial profiles and their association with enteritis in patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy. Faecal samples were collected from 18 cervical cancer patients during radiotherapy. Microbiota profiles were characterized based on 16S rRNA sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq platform. Epithelial inflammatory response was evaluated using bacterial-epithelial co-cultures. Dysbiosis was observed among patients with RE, which was characterized by significantly reduced alpha-diversity but increased beta-diversity, relative higher abundance of Proteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria and lower abundance of Bacteroides. Coprococcus was clearly enriched prior to radiotherapy in patients who later developed RE. Metastat analysis further revealed unique grade-related microbial features, such as more abundant Virgibacillus and Alcanivorax in patients with mild enteritis. Additionally, using bacterial-epithelial co-cultures, RE patient-derived microbiota induced epithelial inflammation and barrier dysfunction, enhanced TNF-alpha and IL-1beta expression compared with control microbiota. Taken together, we define the overall picture of gut microbiota in patients with RE. Our results suggest that dysbiosis of gut microbiota may contribute to development and progression of RE. Gut microbiota can offer a set of biomarkers for prediction, disease activity evaluation and treatment selection in RE. Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

4627,"Long-term quality of life and tumour control following gamma knife radiosurgery for vestibular schwannoma. Introduction: Gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) has for the last decades been an established treatment option for patients with small- or medium-sized vestibular schwannomas (VS), although little data is reported on long-term outcome regarding quality of life (QOL) and tumour control in this patient category. The objective of this study was to investigate long-term QOL and tumour control in GKRS-treated VS patients at our institution. Method(s): Data was reviewed from a consecutive cohort of 128 patients, 62 men and 66 women, diagnosed with VS and treated with GKRS at Karolinska University Hospital between 1997 and 2003. Patients previously treated for VS, patients from abroad, and patients with neurofibromatosis were excluded from the study. Median age at the time of treatment was 66 years (range 23-89), with a median follow-up time of 104 months (range 11-165) and radiological median follow-up of 86 months (range 5-170). Five patients were lost to follow-up. Result(s): Data on QOL (EQ-5D score) was obtained in 90 % (98/109) of all cases at the end of follow-up, showing low morbidity and a high QOL with median index of 0.91 (max. score 1.0) in these patients. Tumour control was achieved in 92 % (118/128) of patients after a single GKRS treatment. Ten patients had loss of tumour control, either radiologically seen as growth progression, or due to the need for salvage treatment. Neither pre-treatment growth of the vestibular schwannoma, or a large tumour size (Koos grade 3 & 4) was correlated with a higher degree of treatment failure (p = 0.695 and p = 0.647, respectively). There was no difference in tumour control in young (<60 y/o) vs. elderly (>=60 y/o) patients (p = 0.167). Conclusion(s): We report a high QOL and low morbidity at long-term follow-up after GKRS treatment in VS patients. Furthermore, a high tumour control rate was achieved independent of tumour size, patient age or pre-treatment evidence of tumour growth. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Wien.",Excluded
4628,"Climatic proteoglycan stromal keratopathy, a new corneal degeneration. PURPOSE: To characterize a previously undescribed corneal disorder, climatic proteoglycan stromal keratopathy., METHODS: We prospectively characterized the disorder in 58 eyes of 29 patients (ages 41 to 84 years) at the El Maghraby Eye Hospital, Jeddah Saudi Arabia. Light and transmission electron microscopy were performed on six corneal specimens., RESULTS: Clinical criteria for the diagnosis included a central, horizontally oval, corneal stromal haze with a ground glass appearance, a uniform or lamellar pattern, greater extent anteriorly and involvement of 50% to 100% of stromal thickness. It occurred bilaterally but sometimes asymmetrically. Density varied from mild to moderate and seldom decreased visual acuity. Sixteen (28%) of 58 corneas had additional degenerative lesions (spheroidal degeneration, mild calcific band keratopathy, and Salzmann's nodular degeneration). Refractile stromal lines or posterior white dots were present in six (10%) of 58 eyes. Videokeratography in 11 (29%) of 38 eyes demonstrated flat areas that overlay the stromal haze. Pathologic analysis demonstrated focal intracellular and extracellular deposits of excess proteoglycans. One specimen showed amyloid. We postulate that climatic factors play a pathogenic role because the disorder occurs in individuals who were exposed to the sunny, dry, dusty environment of the Middle East and because other corneal degenerative disorders were present concomitantly., CONCLUSIONS: Climatic proteoglycan stromal keratopathy is a corneal degeneration that appears as an oval, central, gray, ground-glass haze associated with central corneal flattening on videokeratography and as excess proteoglycans on histologic examination.

4629,"The role of autophagy regulator LC3B in thyroid cancer cells response to metabolic stress and radiation. Decreased expression of the microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B (LC3B), a well-characterized regulator of autophagy, has been shown to be associated with metastatic progression in patients with thyroid cancer. We hypothesized that LC3B could play a role in the regulation of thyroid cancer cells response to radiation. Expression of LC3B was examined by real-time PCR and Western blot in FTC133, FTC236 and FTC238 cells. Stable LC3B-deficient cells were created by transfection with lentiviral particles containing LC3B specific shRNA. Thyroid cancer cell viability, proliferation, migration and apoptosis were analyzed in LC3B-expressing and LC3B-deficient cells after exposure to gamma-radiation (6 Gy). Immunostaining with anti-LC3B was performed on tissue samples from 10 patients with anaplastic (ATCs) and 10 patients with papillary thyroid cancers (PTCs). LC3B expression was decreased in cell lines that derived from metastatic lesions (by 70% in FTC236 and by 90% in FTC238) as compared to FTC133 cells. Transfection with lentiviral particles inhibited LC3B mRNA level by 80% in FTC133 cells. LC3B silencing had no effect on cell cycle, did not inhibit thyroid cancer cells migration, and did not induce apoptosis. Glucose deprivation led to phosphorylation of AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK) in LC3B-expressing and LC3B-deficient cells. Induction of LC3BII and loss of p62 protein were detected in LC3B-expressing but not in LC3B-deficient cells. gamma-radiation induced gH2AX and caspase 3 cleavage in LC3B-expressing and LC3B-deficient cells. However, recovery of thyroid cancer cells after irradiation was more efficient in LC3B-deficient cells. Colony forming assay showed that survival fraction after gamma-radiation was higher in LC3B-deficient cells compared to LC3B-expressing cells (p = 0.01). Granular cytoplasmic staining with anti-LC3B was detected in 5/10 (50%) differentiated PTCs, but in 0/10 (0%) ATCs. LC3B is involved in thyroid cancer cell resistance to metabolic and oxidative stressors. Decreased LC3B expression in undifferentiated thyroid cancer suggests that defective autophagy can contribute to thyroid cancer cell resistance to therapy.",Excluded
4630,"Radiation therapy in cancer patients 80 years of age and older. There is a paucity of clinical data regarding radiation therapy in elderly patients. This is a retrospective study of all patients aged 80 years and older who underwent treatment with external beam irradiation at a single site. There were a total of 183 patients treated with 226 courses of therapy. The mean age was 84 years (range: 80-98 years). Fifty-eight percent of the patients were male. The treatment was deemed palliative in 51% and curative in 49%. The primary cancer diagnoses were: prostate 36, lung 28, breast 25, head and neck 23, gastrointestinal 21, hematologic 12, gynecologic 11, skin 11, genitourinary 9, unknown primary 6, central nervous system 1. The patients were able to complete the prescribed therapy in 173 of 226 courses (77%). Treatment breaks during the radiation courses were required in 81 (36%) of the courses. Radiation therapy can be safely administered to an elderly population with both curative and palliative intent with the expectation of completion in more than 80% of patients. The reasons for inability to complete therapy as prescribed are multifactorial, but careful patient selection and attention to comorbidity may optimize outcome. Further research is needed to better define these parameters.",Excluded
4631,"High validity of measuring the width and volume of medial meniscal extrusion three-dimensionally using an MRI-derived tibial model. Background: Medial meniscal extrusion (MME) is an important marker of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) progression. The purposes of this study were: 1) to determine whether there are morphological differences between CT- and MRI-derived tibial plateau models; and 2) to determine whether measurement of MME volume and width using an MRI-derived tibial model is as accurate as measurements on a CT-derived tibial model. Method(s): This was a cross-sectional study that enrolled ten participants with medial KOA (Kellgren-Lawrence grade 1 to 3). Primary outcome was surface difference of the medial tibial plateau between CT- and MRI-derived models. Furthermore, volume and cross-sectional area of the medial tibial plateau were compared between CT- and MRI-derived models. Measurements of MME volume and width were compared between CT- and MRI-derived tibial models. Result(s): Minimal and maximal surface differences of the medial tibial plateau between the CT- and MRI-derived models were - 0.15 [- 0.44, 0.14] mm (mean [95% confidence interval]) and 0.24 [- 0.09, 0.57] mm, respectively. There were no significant differences in volume and cross-sectional area of the medial tibial plateau between CT- and MRI-derived tibial models. The MME volumes measured on CT- and MRI-derived models were 942.6 [597.7, 1287.6] mm3 and 916.2 [557.9, 1274.6] mm3, respectively (p = 0.938). The MME widths measured on CT- and MRI-derived models were 4.2 [1.9, 6.5] mm and 4.5 [2.2, 6.9] mm, respectively (p = 0.967). Conclusion(s): CT- and MRI-derived models of the medial tibial plateau did not show significant morphological differences. Both CT- and MRI-derived tibia can be used as a reference to measure MME in early-to-moderate medial KOA.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded

4633,"Lung stereotactic body radiation therapy for elderly patients aged >= 80 years with pathologically proven early-stage non-small cell lung cancer: a retrospective cohort study. Background: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is an established therapy for medically inoperable early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Many elderly patients are medically inoperable owing to comorbidities. Therefore, SBRT may be a useful therapy for elderly patients. However, the application of SBRT for patients aged >= 80 years has not been completely elucidated. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the clinical utility of SBRT for elderly patients aged >= 80 years with pathologically proven early-stage NSCLC. Method(s): We retrospectively evaluated the data of patients aged >= 80 years with pathologically proven primary NSCLC who underwent SBRT at our institution between January 2009 and March 2020. Treatment outcomes and toxicities were analyzed. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate survival curves and the log-rank test to compare the survival curves. We performed univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. p-values < 0.05 were regarded significant. Result(s): Sixty-four patients (65 lesions) were included, and the median follow-up period was 38.7 (range 3.5-95.7) months. The median age was 82.9 (range 80.0-94.8) years. Sixteen patients were medically operable, and 48 patients were medically inoperable. The prescribed dose of SBRT was either 48 Gy in four fractions or 60 Gy in 10 fractions. The median survival time was 60.0 months (95% confidence interval, 43.5-71.1). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year local control, cancer-specific survival, progression-free survival, and overall survival rates were 98.4%, 98.4%, 81.0%, and 88.9%; 90.1%, 93.7%, 58.9%, and 68.3%; and 87.4%, 83.5%, 38.2%, and 47.5%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that inoperability and solid nodules were the predictors of poor overall survival after SBRT in elderly patients. Two patients (3.1%) had grade 3 radiation pneumonitis, and one patient (1.6%) had grade 5 radiation pneumonitis. Conclusion(s): SBRT was feasible in patients aged >= 80 years with NSCLC. It achieved good local control with minimal toxicity. SBRT may be beneficial in elderly patients with early-stage NSCLC.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).",Excluded
4634,"Radioiodine-Associated Exacerbation of Graves' Orbitopathy in the Japanese Population: Randomized Prospective Study. CONTEXT: Exacerbation of Graves' orbitopathy (GO) after radioiodine (RAI) therapy has been examined in some populations but has not been fully described in Japanese populations., OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to clarify the characteristics of GO exacerbation after RAI therapy and the effectiveness of low-dose prophylactic corticosteroid (PCS)., DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a prospective randomized study in Tokyo, Japan., PATIENTS: Between June 2011 and June 2012, 295 patients with Graves' disease with either inactive GO or no GO received RAI therapy. Of these, 147 received no PCS (PCS-Off group), whereas 148 received low-dose PCS (starting dose, 15 mg/day of prednisolone) for 6 weeks (PCS-On group). We used magnetic resonance imaging to thoroughly evaluate GO before and 1 year after RAI therapy., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes of GO 1 year after RAI therapy were determined., RESULTS: GO exacerbation occurred in 29 patients (9.8%), and only 7 patients (2.4%) required ophthalmic treatment. No significant difference in the frequency of GO exacerbation was seen between the groups (PCS-On group: n = 18 [12.1%]; PCS-Off group: n = 11 [7.5%]; P = .17). Significant prognostic factors were identified as thyroid-stimulating antibody (by 100% linear increase: risk ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-1.24; P = .0003) and clinical activity score (>=1 vs 0: risk ratio, 6.40; 95% confidence interval, 2.17-19.7; P = .0009)., CONCLUSION: Exacerbation of GO after RAI therapy in the Japanese population appears less common than in other populations. Low-dose PCS did not produce a significant preventive effect and appeared insufficient. Patients presenting with risk factors would thus be recommended to receive higher-dose PCS.",Excluded
4635,"X-ray enhancement of splenic rosette-forming cells in nonimmune mice. The formation of rosettes between spleen cells from nonimmune mice and sheep red blood cells (SRBC) has been investigated. The number of splenic rosette-forming cells (RFC) in the intact spleen was very low but greatly increased after sublethal whole body x-irradiation. These cells were inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with AKR anti-C3H- antigen antiserum, in the presence of fresh guinea pig serum, but not with rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin antiserum. The splenic RFC also increased after cortisone acetate administration into mice. These results suggest that the RFC are a T cell sub-population having x-ray resistant and cortisone-insensitive characteristics. The x-irradiation of mice in vivo selectively increased the number of splenic RFC in consequence of reduction in the number of cells having non-T cell characteristics. These RFC are presumably antigen-specific sheep red blood cell rosettes, a quite different situation as in the case of human T lymphocyte rosette formation.",Included

Aim: To summarize the effects of laparoscopic ethanol injection and radiofrequency ablation (L-EI-RFA), thoracoscopic (T-EI-RFA) and open-surgery assisted EI-RFA (O-EI-RFA) under general anesthesia for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Method(s): Time-lag performance of RFA after ethanol injection (Time-lag PEI-RFA) was performed in all cases. The volume of coagulated necrosis and the applied energy for total and per unit volume coagulated necrosis were examined in the groups treated under general (group G) or local anesthesia (group L). Result(s): The results showed that the total applied energy and the applied energy per unit volume of whole and marginal, coagulated necrosis were significantly larger in group G than those in the group L, resulting in a larger volume of coagulated necrosis in the group G. The rate of local tumor recurrence within one year was extremely low in group G. Conclusion(s): These results suggest that EI-RFA, under general anesthesia, may be effective for the treatment of HCC because a larger quantity of ethanol and energy could be applied during treatment under pain-free condition for the patients. © 2008 WJG.

Introduction: Established risk factors for hematologic cancers include exposure to ionizing radiation, organic solvents, and genetic mutation; however, the potential roles of environmental and sociological factors are not well explored. As North Dakota engages in significant agricultural activity, the present investigation seeks to determine whether an association exists between the incidence of hematologic cancers and either population density or agricultural occupation for residents of south central North Dakota. Method(s): The present study is a retrospective analysis. Cases of hematologic malignancies and associated pre-malignant conditions were collected from the regional Central North Dakota Cancer Registry, and analysis of study-specific demographic factors was performed. Result(s): Significantly higher incidence of hematologic cancers and pre-malignant disorders was associated with residence in an ""urban"" county and rural city/town. Within the latter designation, there was a higher rate of self-reported agricultural occupation (40% vs 10%, P < 0.0001). Conclusion(s): The increased incidence of hematologic cancer in low population density areas of south central North Dakota supports the need for more detailed prospective research centered on agricultural exposures.",Excluded

4640,"A statewide teleradiology system reduces radiation exposure and charges in transferred trauma patients. BACKGROUND: Trauma transfer patients routinely undergo repeat imaging because of inefficiencies within the radiology system. In 2009, the virtual private network (VPN) telemedicine system was adopted throughout Oregon allowing virtual image transfer between hospitals. The startup cost was a nominal $3,000 per hospital., METHODS: A retrospective review from 2007 to 2012 included 400 randomly selected adult trauma transfer patients based on a power analysis (200 pre/200 post). The primary outcome evaluated was reduction in repeat computed tomography (CT) scans. Secondary outcomes included cost savings, emergency department (ED) length of stay (LOS), and spared radiation. All data were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U and chi-square tests. P less than .05 indicated significance. Spared radiation was calculated as a weighted average per body region, and savings was calculated using charges obtained from Oregon Health and Science University radiology current procedural terminology codes., RESULTS: Four-hundred patients were included. Injury Severity Score, age, ED and overall LOS, mortality, trauma type, and gender were not statistically different between groups. The percentage of patients with repeat CT scans decreased after VPN implementation: CT abdomen (13.2% vs 2.8%, P < .01) and cervical spine (34.4% vs 18.2%, P < .01). Post-VPN, the total charges saved in 2012 for trauma transfer patients was $333,500, whereas the average radiation dose spared per person was 1.8 mSV. Length of stay in the ED for patients with Injury Severity Score less than 15 transferring to the ICU was decreased (P < .05)., CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a statewide teleradiology network resulted in fewer total repeat CT scans, significant savings, decrease in radiation exposure, and decreased LOS in the ED for patients with less complex injuries. The potential for health care savings by widespread adoption of a VPN is significant. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

4643,"Keratinocyte apoptosis in epidermal remodeling and clearance of psoriasis induced by UV radiation. Psoriasis is a common chronic skin disorder, but the mechanisms involved in the resolution and clearance of plaques remain poorly defined. We investigated the mechanism of action of UVB, which is highly effective in clearing psoriasis and inducing remission, and tested the hypothesis that apoptosis is a key mechanism. To distinguish bystander effects, equal erythemal doses of two UVB wavelengths were compared following in vivo irradiation of psoriatic plaques; one is clinically effective (311 nm) and one has no therapeutic effect on psoriasis (290 nm). Only 311 nm UVB induced significant apoptosis in lesional epidermis, and most apoptotic cells were keratinocytes. To determine clinical relevance, we created a computational model of psoriatic epidermis. Modeling predicted apoptosis would occur in both stem and transit-amplifying cells to account for plaque clearance; this was confirmed and quantified experimentally. The median rate of keratinocyte apoptosis from onset to cell death was 20 minutes. These data were fed back into the model and demonstrated that the observed level of keratinocyte apoptosis was sufficient to explain UVB-induced plaque resolution. Our human studies combined with a systems biology approach demonstrate that keratinocyte apoptosis is a key mechanism in psoriatic plaques clearance, providing the basis for future molecular investigation and therapeutic development.",Excluded

Background: Ecological studies showing an inverse association between pancreatic cancer incidence and mortality and levels of ultraviolet radiation (UVR), suggest that higher levels of sun exposure may reduce risks of pancreatic cancer but there has been only one individual-level study that examined this issue. We aimed to examine the association between pancreatic cancer and markers of exposure to solar UVR, namely skin type, treatment of skin lesions, ambient UVR and time outdoors on work days. Method(s): We used data from an Australian case-control study. Location at birth, residential location during adulthood, outdoors work, history of skin lesion treatment and sensitivity of the skin to the sun were obtained by questionnaire. We limited the analyses to Caucasians who answered the questionnaire about UVR (controls = 589/711 recruited; cases = 496/705 recruited). We used NASA's Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer to estimate ambient UVR. Result(s): Being born in or living in areas of higher ambient UVR (compared to lower ambient UVR) was associated with about 30-40% lower risk of pancreatic cancer. People with fair skin colour had 47% lower risk of pancreatic cancer than those with dark skin colour (95% CI 0.37-0.75). There was some suggestion of increased risk with increased average number of hours spent outside at work. Conclusion(s): This study suggests that people with light skin colour or those born or living in areas of high ambient UVR have lower risk of pancreatic cancer. Our analysis supports an association between UVR and pancreatic cancer, possibly mediated through production of vitamin D. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Excluded
4645,"Shifts in broadband power and alpha peak frequency observed during long-term isolation. Prolonged periods of social isolation and spatial confinement do not only represent an issue that needs to be faced by a few astronauts during space missions, but can affect all of us as recently shown during pandemic situations. The fundamental question, how the brain adapts to periods of sensory deprivation and re-adapts to normality, has only received little attention. Here, we use eyes closed and eyes open resting-state electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings to investigate how neural activity is altered during 120 days of isolation in a spatially confined, space-analogue environment. After disentangling oscillatory patterns from 1/f activity, we show that isolation leads to a reduction in broadband power and a flattening of the 1/f spectral slope. Beyond that, we observed a reduction in alpha peak frequency during isolation, but did not find strong evidence for isolation-induced changes that are of oscillatory nature. Critically, all effects reversed upon release from isolation. These findings suggest that isolation and concomitant sensory deprivation lead to an enhanced cortical deactivation which might be explained by a reduction in the mean neuronal population firing rate.",Excluded
4646,"Predicting late effects of pelvic radiotherapy: is there a better approach?. PURPOSE: Significant chronic symptoms following pelvic radiotherapy occur more frequently than commonly realized. Predictive factors for the development of late symptoms are poorly defined. Moderate sustained acute (cumulative) toxicity might predict severe late effects better than peak reaction., METHODS AND MATERIALS: To determine prospectively whether peak or cumulative gastrointestinal (GI) acute symptoms better predict late symptoms in patients receiving pelvic radiotherapy. Symptom scores were measured weekly from the start of radiotherapy, and at 1 year using the Modified Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire-Bowel subset. The possible prognostic impact of patient-related factors was explored., RESULTS: Three hundred and eight patients were recruited. 100 were excluded due to lack of follow-up data at one year resulting from death, too ill, stoma, relapsed, non-response or withdrawal. A further 15 were excluded for incomplete data, leaving 193 patients with evaluable data. Of these, 28 had GI, 101 urological, and 64 gynecological cancers. Patients' median age was 65 years (range, 23-82), and they were treated with median 60 Gy dose for a median of 6 weeks. Univariate analysis revealed a significant association between cumulative acute symptom scores and scores at 1 year (p < 0.001), which was dose-independent (p < 0.001). Acute peak and 1-year scores were not associated (p = 0.431). The correlation coefficient between cumulative acute symptoms and symptoms at 1 year was 0.367 and for peak acute symptoms was weaker at 0.057. Patients with an abnormal body mass index and current smokers were more likely to experience worse symptoms at 1 year., CONCLUSION: Cumulative acute symptoms are more predictive of late symptoms than peak acute changes in score. This association is independent of the radiotherapy dose delivered and is suggestive of a consequential late effect. Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
4647,"Randomized controlled trial of dietary fiber for the prevention of radiation-induced gastrointestinal toxicity during pelvic radiotherapy. Background: Therapeutic radiotherapy is an important treatment of pelvic cancers. Historically, low-fiber diets have been recommended despite a lack of evidence and potentially beneficial mechanisms of fiber. Objective(s): This randomized controlled trial compared low-, habitual-, and high-fiber diets for the prevention of gastrointestinal toxicity in patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy. Design(s): Patients were randomly assigned to low-fiber [<=10 g nonstarch polysaccharide (NSP)/d], habitual-fiber (control), or high-fiber (>=18 g NSP/d) diets and received individualized counseling at the start of radiotherapy to achieve these targets. The primary endpoint was the difference between groups in the change in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire- Bowel Subset (IBDQ-B) score between the starting and nadir (worst) score during treatment. Other measures included macronutrient intake, stool diaries, and fecal short-chain fatty acid concentrations. Result(s): Patients were randomly assigned to low-fiber (n = 55), habitual-fiber (n = 55), or high-fiber (n = 56) dietary advice. Fiber intakes were significantly different between groups (P < 0.001). The difference between groups in the change in IBDQ-B scores between the start and nadir was not significant (P = 0.093). However, the change in score between the start and end of radiotherapy was smaller in the high-fiber group (mean +/- SD: -3.7 +/- 12.8) than in the habitual-fiber group (-10.8 +/- 13.5; P = 0.011). At 1-y postradiotherapy (n = 126) the difference in IBDQ-B scores between the high-fiber (+0.1 +/- 14.5) and the habitualfiber (-8.4 +/- 13.3) groups was significant (P = 0.004). No significant differences were observed in stool frequency or form or in short-chain fatty acid concentrations. Significant reductions in energy, protein, and fat intake occurred in the low- and habitualfiber groups only. Conclusion(s): Dietary advice to follow a high-fiber diet during pelvic radiotherapy resulted in reduced gastrointestinal toxicity both acutely and at 1 y compared with habitual-fiber intake. Restrictive, non-evidence-based advice to reduce fiber intake in this setting should be abandoned.Copyright © 2017 American Society for Nutrition.",Excluded

Background: Episil is a bioadhesive barrier-forming oral liquid gel that can relieve oral mucositis (OM) caused by radiotherapy (RT) and hence relieves pain effectively. In this study, we observed the effects of Episil on the OM and nutritional status of patients with head and neck cancers (HNCs) undergoing RT. Method(s): A total of 50 HNC patients were divided into the Episil (25 patients) and control (25 patients) groups. Patients in the Episil group were sprayed with Episil. In the control group, the kangfuxin solution or KangsuTM oral gargle was used. Medical staff assessed the OM extent and timing as well as the nutritional status during treatment and recorded adverse reactions other than OM. The nutritional status assessment included the following indicators: Patient Generated-Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) score, body mass index (BMI), body weight, albumin levels, and other hematological indicators. Result(s): The incidence of high-level OM (III-IV) after RT was lower in the Episil group than in the control group (P < 0.05). Nutritional status assessments showed that the Episil group had a lower percentage of weight loss than the control group at weeks 4 and 7 after RT. Similar results were also obtained for BMI and albumin levels (P < 0.05). Moreover, according to PG-SGA scores, fewer patients in the Episil group were malnourished and more patients were well-nourished (P < 0.05) compared with the control group. Conclusion(s): Episil effectively improved OM and malnutrition in HNC patients who received RT and has a good clinical application value.© Copyright © 2021 Wei, Wu, Wang, Wang, Zhao, Meng, Dong and Jiang.",Excluded

Background and Objective: X-ray stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) is one of the effective treatments for brain metastases (BM). This study was to evaluate the efficacy of SRT on BM, and investigate prognostic factors. Method(s): Between July 1999 and December 2004, a total of 122 Intracranial lesions In 78 patients with BM were treated using SRT in our Center. Forty-nine patients had a solitary lesion and 29 had multiple (2-6) lesions. The median SRT dose was 15 Gy (11-24 Gy) in single fraction for 38 lesions, and 24 Gy (11-40 Gy) in 2-6 fractions for 84 lesions. SRT was combined with whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) of 30-40 Gy for 39 patients. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated by Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed by the log-rank test and Cox model, respectively. Result(s): The median survival time was 12.9 months (1.7-77.4 months). The 1-year intracranial PFS rate was 87.4%. The 1- and 2-year OS rates were 53.9% and 25.8%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that the 1-year OS rates were higher In the patients with pretreatment KPS of s= 70, extracranial lesions controlled, or SRT combined with WBRT than in those with KPS of < 70 (60.7% vs. 29.4%, P = 0.002), extracranial lesions uncontrolled (69% vs. 44.9%, P = 0.005), or SRT alone (64.1% vs. 43.4%, P = 0.03). The benefit of treating with WBRT in combination was mainly achieved in the patients with extracranial lesions controlled or with more than one Intracranial lesion. Multivariate analysis showed that KPS score and status of extracranial lesions were independent prognostic factors for OS. Conclusion(s): SRT is an effective and safe modality for BM. SRT combined with WBRT may prolong the survival time of the patients with extracranial lesions controlled or multiple Intracranial lesions. Independent prognostic factors for OS are KPS score and status of extracranial lesions.",Excluded

The 120 kV-like, virtual monoenergetic images (VMI) (70, 90, 110 keV), VMI (70, 90, 110 keV)+MMAR images were reconstructed at venous phase by energy spectrum scanning. A total of 7 image sequences were obtained for each patient. The CT value and noise value of the lesion and the longus capitis muscle on the same plane were measured, and the artifact index (AI) of lesion was calculated.Friedman test and Wilcoxon test were used to evaluate image quality objectively and subjectively. Result(s): There were significant differences in SD and AI among the 7 groups (chi2=133.800,P<0.001;chi2=92.147,P<0.001). The SD[10 (8, 12)] and AI [6 (5, 9)]of VMI 110 keV+M images were the lowest, but there were no significant differences in AI between VMI 110 keV+M and VMI 90 keV+M image (P= 0.271). The SD and AI of VMI+M group were lower than those in VMI group (all P<0.05). There was significant difference in image score among the 7 groups (chi 2 = 151.199, P<0.001).

Radiation-induced sarcoma in the head and neck (RISHN) is a rare condition whose clinical presentation and management remain difficult because of its low incidence. In this retrospective study, we analyzed the symptoms, diagnosis, and the treatment of 16,634 patients with head and neck disease, who received radiotherapy between 1960 and 2010 at the Affiliated Tumor Hospital and its predecessor, Guangxi Medical University, China. Among these patients, 16 with a first tumor of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and 1 with squamous carcinoma of the tongue met the criteria of RISHN in the head and neck. Our epidemiological data showed that the incidence of RISHN rose from 0.06 to 0.17% from 1960 to 2010; the 3-year overall survival rate was 19.1%, and 3-year diseasefree survival rate was 11.1%. The mean latency (SD) period was 93.2 (33) months. Based on the experiences at our institution, we suggest that RISHN is a rare complication after radiotherapy for head and neck tumors, especially NPC. Owing to its low incidence, it should not be a major factor affecting decisions about radiotherapy. Nevertheless, there may be a possibility of increasing incidence of RISHN after radiotherapy of NPC, as shown in our epidemiological results. Given the poor prognosis of RISHN, this possibility should be taken into serious consideration before determination of high-dose radiotherapy for patients with NPC and other head and neck tumors. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.",Excluded
4652,"Host and tumor immunity: Local and systemic opportunities to enhance tumor curability by radiotherapy. Success of radiation treatment depends on intrinsic properties of tumor cells, involvement of the host immune system and the crosstalk between tumor and host cells in primary and secondary (metastatic) sites. During the last decade our laboratory has investigated the role of these interactions in the ability of radiotherapy to eradicate primary tumors and metastatic disease. In the current presentation we will focus on host factors which interact with ionizing radiation (IR). The results of our studies using genetic models and specific immunological probes have identified CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, professional antigen presenting cells (CD11c+ dendritic cells), local production of TNFalpha by tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and host Type I Interferons (IFNs) as required for successful treatment by radiation 1,2. Transformation of the tumor microenvironment into an ""immunological hub"" to suppress local and distant disease is a tantalizing goal for which radiotherapy might be well suited, especially in combination with immunotherapy. , Our group has recently demonstrated that the combination of radiotherapy and anti-PD-L1 antibodies decrease accumulation and function of myeloid derived suppressor cells(CD11b,Gr1+) through enhanced local production of TNFalpha by tumor infiltrating lymphocytes ( TILs). in experimental systems3,4 The capacity of local radiotherapy to augment the activation TILs and drive cytokine production is, in part, due to the ability to increase tumor antigen cross-presentation by professional antigen presenting cells in the tumor stroma. Our group demonstrated host type I IFNs are essential for enhanced tumor antigen cross-presentation following radiotherapy. The critical role of type I IFNs in the host immune response to radiotherapy positions them as central components in the crosstalk between tumor cells and the host that can exert positive or negative influences depending on the context. In particular, the interaction of tumor cells with the host leads to the selection of clones resistant to the cytotoxic effects of IFNs and radiotherapy. Using transcriptomic approaches we identified a set of Interferon Stimulated Genes (ISGs) associated with tumor radioresistance.5 This gene set was identified in different types of primary tumors (lung, prostate, breast and glioblastoma) and termed the Interferon Related DNA Damage Signature (IRDS). Statistical training of this gene set detected a 7 gene signature which predicted response to adjuvant radio/chemotherapy for some woman with breast cancer 6. The IRDS is prognostic for patients with subsets of glioma and prostate cancer. We propose that these data indicate the presence of pro-survival genes in the IFN/Jak/Stat axis, which has been confirmed recently through a genomics approach The Jak-Stat pathway is currently under investigation as a potential therapeutic target for radio-chemosensitization in different tumor types. Our current approaches are directed towards identification of tumor ISGs with pro-survival/radioprotective functions. These results demonstrate the requirement to investigate both tumor and the host to improve the therapeutic ratio in radiotherapy.",Excluded
4653,"Long-term cost of combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Complications after treatment of Hodgkin's disease are a good model to evaluate the long-term cost of combined chemo- and radiotherapy. Secondary malignancies and mainly acute myelocytic leukemias are the main complications. The 35 of 1,889 cases reported represent increased risk by factor 129. Often preceded by a leukemic phase, they are of poor prognosis. Solid tumors are increased by factor 2.8. They may occur in patients treated by prolonged chemotherapy with alkylating agent without radiotherapy. In seven of 31 patients, solid tumors appeared in the irradiated area. Sterility in young males was present during the first year, though some recuperation was observed thereafter. Better adjustment of treatment to individual risk, to drug sensitivity, and active combinations devoid of alkylating agents are required to reduce the rate of these complications.",Excluded
4654,"Developing a cancer-specific trigger tool to identify treatment-related adverse events using administrative data. BACKGROUND: As there are few validated tools to identify treatment-related adverse events across cancer care settings, we sought to develop oncology-specific ""triggers"" to flag potential adverse events among cancer patients using claims data., METHODS: 322 887 adult patients undergoing an initial course of cancer-directed therapy for breast, colorectal, lung, or prostate cancer from 2008 to 2014 were drawn from a large commercial claims database. We defined 16 oncology-specific triggers using diagnosis and procedure codes. To distinguish treatment-related complications from comorbidities, we required a logical and temporal relationship between a treatment and the associated trigger. We tabulated the prevalence of triggers by cancer type and metastatic status during 1-year of follow-up, and examined cancer trigger risk factors., RESULTS: Cancer-specific trigger events affected 19% of patients over the initial treatment year. The trigger burden varied by disease and metastatic status, from 6% of patients with nonmetastatic prostate cancer to 41% and 50% of those with metastatic colorectal and lung cancers, respectively. The most prevalent triggers were abnormal serum bicarbonate, blood transfusion, non-contrast chest CT scan following radiation therapy, and hypoxemia. Among patients with metastatic disease, 10% had one trigger event and 29% had two or more. Triggers were more common among older patients, women, non-whites, patients with low family incomes, and those without a college education., CONCLUSIONS: Oncology-specific triggers offer a promising method for identifying potential patient safety events among patients across cancer care settings.

BACKGROUND: There are case reports in the literature that patients occasionally develop immunogenic hyperthyroidism 2 to 14 months following iodine-131-therapy of focal, non-immunogenic, autonomous thyroid nodules with a prevalence between 0.05 and 2.5%. Purpose of this multicenter evaluation was to assess the appearance of this phenomenon in a larger patient population., PATIENTS AND METHODS: So far 2867 patients out of 4 university hospitals are included in our study focusing on the appearance of pathologically elevated levels of thyrotropin-receptor-antibodies (TRAb) combined with hyperthyroidism following iodine-therapy. Records of the patients were screened for pre- and post-therapeutic biochemical tests, scintigraphic uptake patterns and ultrasound findings of the thyroid., RESULTS: Nineteen of 2867 patients with pretherapeutically scintigraphic ""hot nodules"" developed recurrent hyperthyroidism suggestive for immunogenic genesis 2 to 12 months following iodine-131-therapy (elevated TRAb-levels, homogeneous uptake in Tc-99m-pertechnetate scans). Pretherapeutically, 9 of these patients presented with a strictly focal scintigraphic uptake-pattern, 10 cases with a mixed disseminated-focal pattern. Because of missing pretherapeutic TRAb-tests in 8/9 patients presenting with a strictly focal scintigraphic uptake pattern, postradiogenic immunogenic hyperthyroidism could be reliably assessed in 1 case only., CONCLUSION: One could speculate that iodine-131-therapy may stimulate immunogenic mechanisms finally leading to immunogenic hyperthyroidism. Posttherapeutically observed hyperthyroidism following iodine-treatment might be based on an exacerbation of a preexisting--clinically not relevant/detectable--immunothyropathia. Also pretherapeutic TRAb-negative immunogenic hyperthyroidism could not be definitely excluded. Our multicenter data collected in a large patient population show similar results to the case reports of immunogenic hyperthyroidism following iodine-131-treatment in smaller populations. Therfore, the occurrence of this phenomenon plays a minor role regarding to its prevalence. Therapeutical consequences in treatment of functional thyroid autonomy are not recommended.",Excluded
4658,"Safety and feasibility of robotic percutaneous coronary intervention: PRECISE (percutaneous robotically-enhanced coronary intervention) study. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety as well as the clinical and technical effectiveness of robotic-assisted percutaneous coronary intervention. Background(s): Robotic systems have been suggested to enhance the performance of cardiovascular procedures, as well as to provide protection from the occupational hazards that are associated with interventional practice. Method(s): Patients with coronary artery disease and clinical indications for percutaneous intervention were enrolled. The coronary intervention was performed with the CorPath 200 robotic system, which consists of a remote interventional cockpit and a bedside disposable cassette that enables the operator to advance, retract, and rotate guidewires and catheters. The primary endpoints were clinical procedural success, defined as <30% residual stenosis at the completion of the robotic-assisted procedure without major adverse cardiovascular events within 30 days, and device technical success, defined as the successful manipulation of the intracoronary devices using the robotic system only. Result(s): A total of 164 patients were enrolled at 9 sites. Percutaneous coronary intervention was completed successfully without conversion to manual operation, and device technical success was achieved in 162 of 164 patients (98.8%). There were no device-related complications. Clinical procedural success was achieved in 160 of 164 patients (97.6%), whereas 4 (2.4%) had periprocedural non-Q-wave myocardial infarctions. No deaths, strokes, Q-wave myocardial infarctions, or revascularization occurred in the 30 days after the procedures. Radiation exposure for the primary operator was 95.2% lower than the levels found at the traditional table position. Conclusion(s): This pivotal multicenter study with a robotic-enhanced coronary intervention system demonstrated the safety and feasibility of the system. The robotic remote-control procedure met the expected technical and clinical performance, with significantly lower radiation exposure to the operator.

PPIs have been suggested to affect the gut microbiome, and increase risks of Clostridium difficile infection and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). However, existing data are based on stool analyses and PPIs act on the foregut. Aim(s): To compare the duodenal and stool microbiomes in PPI and non-PPI users. Method(s): Consecutive subjects presenting for upper endoscopy without colonoscopy were recruited. Current antibiotic users were excluded. Subjects taking PPI were age- and gender-matched 1:2 to non-PPI controls. Subjects completed medical history questionnaires, and duodenal aspirates were collected using a validated protected catheter. A subset also provided stool samples. Duodenal and stool microbiomes were analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Result(s): The duodenal microbiome exhibited no phylum-level differences between PPI (N = 59) and non-PPI subjects (N = 118), but demonstrated significantly higher relative abundances of families Campylobacteraceae (3.13-fold, FDR P value < 0.01) and Bifidobacteriaceae (2.9-fold, FDR P value < 0.01), and lower relative abundance of Clostridiaceae (88.24-fold, FDR P value < 0.0001), in PPI subjects. SIBO rates were not significantly different between groups, whether defined by culture (> 103 CFU/ml) or 16S sequencing, nor between subjects taking different PPIs. The stool microbiome exhibited significantly higher abundance of family Streptococcaceae (2.14-fold, P = 0.003), and lower Clostridiaceae (2.60-fold, FDR P value = 8.61E-13), in PPI (N = 22) versus non-PPI (N = 47) subjects. Conclusion(s): These findings suggest that PPI use is not associated with higher rates of SIBO. Relative abundance of Clostridiaceae was reduced in both the duodenal and stool microbiomes, and Streptococcaceae was increased in stool. The clinical implications of these findings are unknown.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
4660,"Cell Salvage During Liver Transplantation for Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Retrospective Analysis of Tumor Recurrence Following Irradiation of the Salvaged Blood. BACKGROUND: Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is the treatment option for early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). OLT is often associated with high blood loss, requiring blood transfusion. Retransfusion of autologous blood is a key part of blood conservation. There are, however, concerns that the retransfusion of salvaged blood might cause the spread of cancer cells and induce metastasis. Irradiation of salvaged blood before retransfusion eliminates viable cancer cells. Here, we analyzed the incidence of tumor recurrence in patients with HCC undergoing OLT who received irradiated cell-salvaged blood during transplant surgery., METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients undergoing OLT for HCC between 2002 and 2018 at our center. We compared the tumour recurrence in patients who received no retransfusion of autologous blood with patients who received autologous blood with or without preceding irradiation of the blood., RESULTS: Fifty-one (40 male, 11 female) patients were included in the analysis; 10 patients developed tumor recurrence within a time period of 2.45 +/- 2.0 years. Statistical analysis revealed that there was no significant difference in tumor recurrence between patients who received autologous blood with or without irradiation., CONCLUSION: Intraoperative transfusion of cell-salvaged blood did not increase tumor recurrence rates. Cell salvage should be used in liver transplantation of HCC patients as part of a blood conservation strategy. The effect of blood irradiation on tumor recurrence could not be definitively evaluated.

4661,"Neoadjuvant stereotactic body radiation therapy, capecitabine, and liver transplantation for unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Hilar cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a difficult malignancy to treat surgically because of its anatomical location and its frequent association with primary sclerosing cholangitis. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by liver transplantation in lymph node-negative patients has been advanced by select liver transplant centers for the treatment of patients with unresectable disease. This approach has most commonly used external-beam radiotherapy in combination with biliary brachytherapy and 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy. Our center recently embarked on a protocol using stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) followed by capecitabine in lymph node-negative patients until liver transplantation. We, therefore, retrospectively determined the tolerability and pathological response in this pilot study. During a 3-year period, 17 patients with unresectable hilar CCA were evaluated for treatment under this protocol. In all, 12 patients qualified for neoadjuvant therapy and were treated with SBRT (50-60 Gy in 3-5 fractions over the course of 2 weeks). After 1 week of rest, capecitabine was initiated at 1330 mg/m2/day, and it was continued until liver transplantation. During neoadjuvant therapy, there were 35 adverse events in all, with cholangitis and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia being the most common. Capecitabine dose reductions were required on 5 occasions. Ultimately, 9 patients were listed for transplantation, and 6 patients received a liver transplant. The explant pathology of hilar tumors showed at least a partial treatment response in 5 patients, with extensive tumor necrosis and fibrosis noted. Additionally, high apoptotic indices and low proliferative indices were measured during histological examinations. Eleven transplant-related complications occurred, and the 1-year survival rate after transplantation was 83%. In this pilot study, neoadjuvant therapy with SBRT, capecitabine, and liver transplantation for unresectable CCA demonstrated acceptable tolerability.

The alternate system was used for a repeated TACE (treatment interval, 0.5-6 months). Fluoroscopy time, number of digital subtraction angiography (DSA), air kerma (AK), and dose area product (DAP) were compared between the two systems and between the two repetitive TACE. Three interventional radiologists independently rated the image quality in blinded offline readings., RESULTS: Fluoroscopy time (8.7 +/- 5.9 minutes vs. 8.7 +/- 7.9 minutes, P = .981), numbers of DSA runs (6 +/- 4 vs. 6 +/- 4, P = .735), and exposure images (173 +/- 86 vs. 168 +/- 91, P = .916) were equivalent between the two systems. No statistical difference in X-ray usage was found between repeated treatments. Compared to the reference system, the technology significantly reduced AK and DAP by 48.6% (0.17 +/- 0.13 Gy vs. 0.41 +/- 0.36 Gy, P < .0001) and 50.3% (77.3 +/- 55.2 Gy cm(2) vs. 195.0 +/- 155.5 Gy cm(2), P < .0001), respectively.

Axial und frontal slices with a thickness of 5 mm were calculated. If no pneumonia was found, standard antibiotics were given and a repeated examination was performed if fever continued. In case of pneumonia, antimycotic therapy was added and a follow-up CT was performed within one week. Regression or progression of pneumonia at follow-up served as evidence of pneumonia; lowering of fever within 48 h or inconspicuous follow-up CT was regarded as absence of pneumonia., RESULTS: Ten of 35 patients had pneumonic infiltration, which decreased or increased on follow-up CT in 3 and 6 patients, respectively. One patient revealed leucemic infiltration by bronchoalveolar lavage. Twenty-five of 35 patients had no evidence of pneumonia. Twenty of these patients were free of fever within 48 h under antibiotics; one patient died due to his basic illness.

4669,"Pre-apoptotic response to therapeutic DNA damage involves protein modulation of Mcl-1, Hdm2 and Flt3 in acute myeloid leukemia cells. BACKGROUND: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells are characterized by non-mutated TP53, high levels of Hdm2, and frequent mutation of the Flt3 receptor tyrosine kinase. The juxtamembrane mutation of FLT3 is the strongest independent marker for disease relapse and is associated with elevated Bcl-2 protein and p53 hyper-phosphorylation in AML. DNA damage forms the basic mechanism of cancer cell eradication in current therapy of AML. Hdm2 and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 members are among the most intensely induced genes immediately after chemotherapy and Hdm2 is proposed a role in receptor tyrosine kinase regulation. Thus we examined the DNA damage related modulation of these proteins in relation to FLT3 mutational status and induction of apoptosis., RESULTS: Within one hour after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR), the AML cells (NB4, MV4-11, HL-60, primary AML cells) showed an increase in Flt3 protein independent of mRNA levels, while the Hdm2 protein decreased. The FLT3 mutant MV4-11 cells were resistant to IR accompanied by presence of both Mcl-1 and Hdm2 protein three hours after IR. In contrast, the FLT3 wild type NB4 cells responded to IR with apoptosis and pre-apoptotic Mcl-1 down regulation. Daunorubicin (DNR) induced continuing down regulation of Hdm2 and Mcl-1 in both cell lines followed by apoptosis., CONCLUSION: Both IR and DNR treatment resulted in concerted protein modulations of Mcl-1, Hdm2 and Flt3. Cell death induction was associated with persistent attenuation of Mcl-1 and Hdm2. These observations suggest that defining the pathway(s) modulating Flt3, Hdm2 and Mcl-1 may propose new strategies to optimize therapy for the relapse prone FLT3 mutated AML patients.",Excluded

Purpose: This single-institution prospective study was designed to investigate the feasibility and safety of dose escalation with GliaSite (Proxima Therapeutics Inc., Alpharetta, GA) brachytherapy for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed and recurrent central nervous system (CNS) tumors after neurosurgical resection. We now report mature results of this trial, its outcomes, and a toxicity profile. Methods and Materials: Ten adult consecutive patients with recurrent and newly diagnosed CNS malignancies underwent GliaSite brachytherapy after maximally safe neurosurgical resection between 2004 and 2007. GliaSite balloon was placed intraoperatively, and the size was selected so as to conform to the surgical cavity. Low-dose-rate radiation was delivered with an aqueous solution of organically bound 125I (Iotrex: sodium 3-(125I)-iodo-4-hydroxybenzenesulfonate; Proxima Therapeutics Inc.), introduced into the balloon portion of the device via a subcutaneous port. Two to 3 weeks later, the device was filled with Iotrex for a median dwell time of 94.3 hours (range, 68.0-120.5 hours), after which the balloon was explanted. A commercial 3-D planning system was used for a detailed analysis of dosimetry. Median dose of 52.0 Gy (range, 45.0-60.0 Gy) was prescribed 0.5-1.0 cm from the balloon surface. Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) criteria were used to assess acute and long-term toxicities associated with this technique.

Mean size of GliaSite balloon was 3.4 cm (range, 2.0-4.0 cm). Mean volume of filling was 19.0 cc (range, 4.0-35.0 cc). Median activity of Iotrex was 301.6 mCi (range, 95.0-515.4 mCi). Median survival was 14.0 months for the entire cohort after the treatment with the GliaSite device. Of our cohort, 6/10 (60%) patients sustained recurrence (20% local and 40% distant). Median time to recurrence after treatment with GliaSite was 8.0 months, and median time to death after recurrence was 7.5 months. There were no RTOG Grade 3 or 4 acute or late toxicities. Followup MRI imaging did not identify any evidence of radiation necrosis. Conclusion(s): Our data indicate that treatment with GliaSite balloon brachytherapy is feasible and safe, while rendering acceptable local control and minimal acute and long-term toxicities for newly diagnosed and recurrent CNS malignancies. These encouraging results compel us to embark on testing larger numbers of patients with this treatment modality. © 2010 American Brachytherapy Society.",Excluded
4671,"A randomized trial comparing levothyroxine with radioactive iodine in the treatment of sporadic nontoxic goiter. A randomized clinical trial was performed in consecutive patients with sporadic nontoxic nodular goiter to compare efficacy and side effects of iodine-131 (131I) therapy with suppressive levothyroxine (L-thyroxine) treatment. Sixty-four patients were randomized after stratification for sex and menopausal age to receive 131I (4.44 MBq/g thyroid; group A) or suppressive L-thyroxine treatment aiming at TSH values between 0.01 and 0.1 mU/L (group B). The main outcome measurements after 2 yr were goiter size by ultrasound, serum thyroid function tests, markers of bone turnover, and bone mineral density (BMD). Fifty-seven patients completed the trial. Goiter size was reduced after 2 yr by 44% in group A and by 1% in group B (P < 0.001). Nonresponders (goiter reduction < 13%)were 1 of 29 patients in group A and 16 of 28 patients in group B (P = 0.00001). In responders, goiter reduction in group A (46%) was greater than in group B (22%; P < 0.005). In group A, 45% of patients developed hypothyroidism. In group B, 10 patients experienced thyrotoxic symptoms, requiring discontinuation of treatment in 2 (in 1 because of atrial fibrillation). Markers of bone formation and bone resorption increased significantly in group B, related to a mean decrease of 3.6% of BMD at the lumbar spine after 2 yr (from 1.09 +/- 0.22 to 1.05 +/- 0.23 g/cm2; P < 0.001), both in pre- and postmenopausal women. No changes in BMD were observed in group A. In conclusion, 131I therapy is more effective and better tolerated than L-thyroxine treatment in patients with sporadic nontoxic goiter. Suppressive L-thyroxine treatment results in significant bone loss.",Excluded
4672,"Effects of Q-switched Nd:YAG laser irradiation on neural impulse propagation: I. Spinal cord. We studied the effect of irradiation with Q-switched Nd:YAG laser light (1064 nm) on spinal cord dorsal column and dorsolateral white matter in anesthetized rats. To evoke a synchronous sensory input, the sciatic nerve was stimulated electrically and the resulting evoked spinal cord potential (SCP) recorded from the dorsal columns of the ipsilateral side. The waveshape of the SCP showed three components: an early positive peak (P1), representing the responses of the most rapidly conducting fibers, followed by two negative peaks (N1 and N2), which are mainly due to synaptic effects of the volley on dorsal horn cells located in dorsal grey matter. Laser irradiation at 50 mJ/pulse and above resulted in severe reduction in the amplitudes of N1 and N2. In contrast, there was either no reduction at all or only a slight decrease in the amplitude of P1. The selective loss of the synaptic field might be mediated by impairment of synaptic transmission or by loss of high threshold fiber input to dorsal horn neurones. In either event it is likely that the mechanism of the differential effects of laser irradiation on the components of the electrically evoked SCP is at least in part photothermally mediated, since intracord temperatures during laser application greatly exceeded the physiological range.",Excluded

This study was designed to investigate the influence of localizedd irradiation (1000 R) on the time of development and intensity of an immunologically mediated inflammatory lesion. An experimental autoallergic sialadenitis (EAS) of the rat submandibular gland was developed to serve as the standard lesion. Consistently mild or severe lesions of EAS were induced in male Lewis rats when they were immunized with allogeneic submandibular glands from sexually immature or mature female donors, respectively. Neck irradiation alone 7-56 days prior to sacrifice induced only occasional inflammatory lesions in the submandibular glands. The weights of the submandibular glands were seen to decrease progressively while the body weights continued to rise. Neck irradiation 7-56 days prior to sacrifice of animals immunized 7-21 days prior to sacrifice to induce mild or severe EAS did not significantly accelerate development of the lesion nor w,as the intensity of inflammatory lesions significantly modified. In nanimals with mild or severe EAS which were neck irradiated, the weights of the submandibular glands were found to decrease while the body weight remained relatively unchanged. Thus, the influences of neck irradiation (1000 R) (primarily a progressive submandibular weight decrease) neither significantly altered nor was altered by the development of the experimental autoallergic lesion of the submandibular gland.",Excluded
4675,"Frequency and etiology of ventilator-associated events in the medical intensive care unit. Background: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed new criteria based on a significant deterioration in oxygenation to identify ventilator-associated events (conditions). The aim of this study was to determine how frequently this happened and what caused these conditions. Method(s): Electronic medical records and x-rays from 281 ventilator episodes in the medical intensive care unit were reviewed to determine the characteristics of patients requiring ventilation and the number of patients meeting the criteria for ventilatorassociated conditions (VACs). Result(s): This cohort included 257 patients (55.4% men) who required 281 episodes of mechanical ventilation. The mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Healthy Evaluation II score was 13.5 +/- 5.9. The initial mean PaO2/FiO2 was 210 +/- 110. The median number of ventilator days was 4 (interquartile range: 3-9). The overall mortality was 32.3%. Nineteen patients (11.7% of eligible episodes) met the CDC criteria for a VAC; 6 met FiO2 criteria (31.6%) and 13 met positive end expiratory pressure criteria (68.4%). Twelve patients (63.2%) had an increased white blood cell count (>12k/muL) during the event. Eleven patients had an increase in temperature (.38degreeC) during this period. The etiology of these conditions included pneumonia (n = 4), atelectasis (n = 4), congestive heart failure (n = 5), acute respiratory distress syndrome (n = 2), and miscellaneous reasons (n = 4). Conclusion(s): VACs occurred in 11.7% of patients in our medical intensive care unit. The etiology of these events was diverse and did not usually reflect complications. These new CDC criteria for institutional reporting of complications during mechanical ventilation do not necessarily identify complications or provide a good method for comparing outcomes in hospitals.© Copyright by the Southern Society for Clinical Investigation.",Excluded
4676,"Volumetric bone mineral density estimation using a 3d reconstruction method from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Volumetric BMD (vBMD) has been shown to be strongly related to bone strength and osteoporotic hip fracture. This can estimated for the femoral neck from Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) by using the projected area as: vBMD=BMC/A2 where BMC is the bone mineral content and A the projected area on the DXA image. However, such approximation cannot be used for other critical locations, such as the trochanteric and adjacent shaft region. An accurate quantification of the vBMD can be obtain from Quantitative Computed Tomoghaphy (QCT), however, this modality subjects the patient to a high radiation dose and is not as widely available as DXA central devices. In this work an estimation of the vBMD from a DXA image is presented by using a 3D reconstruction method. The reconstruction method uses a 3D statistical model, constructed from a dataset of QCT scans which describes the statistical variations in shape and BMD distribution. The 3D statistical model is registered onto the 2D DXA image of the patient so that the projection of the model matches the DXA image. The result of this reconstruction process is a patient specific volumetric reconstruction of the BMD distribution onto which the vBMD can then be extracted for specific regions. Reconstructions were subsequently obtained from the DXA images of 30 patients (15 male and 15 females with an average age of 50+/-13 years). The vBMD of the femoral neck and the trochanteric region was extracted from the reconstructions and the vBMD in the corresponding regions of the QCT scans of the same subjects were considered the ground truth. The linear correlation with the ground truth vBMD then indicates the vBMD estimation accuracy. For the trochanteric and shaft region, our method achieved a strong correlation with a correlation coefficient of 0.94 and 0.93 and a Mean Average Error (MAE) of 15.3 and 21.8mg/cm3 respectively. In addition, the proposed method resulted in a MAE of 17.2mg/cm3 and a correlation coefficient of 0.92 for the femoral neck region whereas the vBMD, estimated using the projected area, resulted in a correlation coefficient of 0.91. These results indicates that our proposed method accurately estimates the vBMD of the trochanteric, shaft and femoral neck region from DXA. This potentially allows for an improved fracture risk estimation while maintaining DXA as the current standard modality.",Excluded
4677,"Late effects in ankylosing spondylitis patients treated with 224Ra. This study is comprised of 1577 ankylosing spondylitis patients from 9 German hospitals who have been treated with multiple injections of 224Ra. The majority of the patients, most of them treated in the years 1948-1975, received one series of 10 weekly intravenous injections of about 1 MBq of 224Ra each. This dose leads to a mean absorbed dose due to alpha-particle radiation of 0.56 Gy to the marrow-free skeleton of a 70-kg man (mean bone surface dose of about 5 Gy). To provide comparative information on causes of death and on health effects possibly related to the basic disease itself, a control group of 1462 ankylosing spondylitis patients with roughly the same age distribution has been established. By the end of 1998, 649 patients in the exposed group and 762 control patients had died. Among other observations, it is of particular interest that 13 cases of leukemia in the exposed group have been observed. This is a highly significant excess (P < 0.001) compared to a standard population, but only a marginally significant excess in comparison to the seven cases observed in the control group. Subclassification of the leukemias shows a clear preponderance of the myeloid leukemias in the exposed group (8 cases observed compared to 1.7 cases expected, P < 0.001), whereas in the control group the observed cases are within the expected range for myeloid leukemia (3 cases observed compared to 2.2 cases expected, P = 0.3). The 224Ra cohort of the earlier study (higher-dose group) has provided a risk coefficient that predicts about 8 excess malignant bone tumors for the irradiated cohort in this study. In actuality, 4 cases of malignant tumors in the skeleton have been observed so far. However, excess of breast cancer has not been observed in either the irradiated or the control group, which is in contrast to the findings in the earlier 224Ra cohort of Study I.",Included
4678,"Mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy in laboratory mice experimentally enclosed in the radioactive Chernobyl environment. Mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy using the protein-coding cytochrome b (Mtcyb) gene was assessed in laboratory mice (C57BL/6 and BALB/c) exposed to the Chernobyl environment. Subacute to subchronic (30-40 days) exposure resulted in a cumulative radiation dose of 1.2-1.6 Gy ( approximately 0.04 Gy/day). Mice were sampled prior to introduction into the enclosures and again after removal from the enclosures. Nucleotide variation (site heteroplasmy) in 306 pre-exposure Mtcyb gene copies (122400 base pairs) was compared to variation in 354 postexposure gene copies (141600 base pairs). Five mutant copies, each characterized by a single nucleotide substitution, were observed (four in the pre-exposure samples, one in a postexposure sample). The frequencies of mutant gene copies and nucleotide substitutions in pre-exposure and postexposure samples were not significantly different. This suggests that this type of exposure (i.e. low dose rate) does not pose a significant mutation risk to the Mtcyb gene in digit tissue. Furthermore, no significant radiation risk to analogous human tissues may exist when occupational exposures involve low dose rates such as these. Finally, linear, cumulative models of genetic risk currently used to estimate radiation-induced effects are likely to be inappropriate for low-dose-rate exposures and need to be re-evaluated critically.",Included

Cardioxane in doses 20 mg/kg was applied ip 1 h before and 20 h after farmorubicin treatment or 30 min before and 20 h after irradiation. The early markers of peroxidative damage were thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBA-RS) in serum and heart homogenate, and the cytoplasmic enzyme creatine kinase CK (CPK) activity in serum. Results indicate that Cardioxane in clinically relevant doses did not exert a protective effect against oxidative reactions and did not significantly influence the changes of serum enzyme level observed after both cardiotoxic agents. Furthermore, Cardioxane alone induced a small but significant increase of TBA-RS in serum and heart tissue, providing additional toxicity.",Excluded
4680,"Individualized dosimetry of kidney and bone marrow in patients undergoing 177Lu-DOTA-octreotate treatment. The organs at risk in radionuclide therapy with 177Lu-octreotate are the bone marrow and the kidneys. The primary aim of this study was to develop an individualized dosimetry protocol for the bone marrow. The secondary aim was to identify those patients, undergoing fractionated therapy with 7.4 GBq/cycle, who first reached an accumulated dose of either 2 Gy to the bone marrow or 23 Gy to the kidneys. Method(s): Two hundred patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors with high somatostatin receptor expression were included. After the administration of 7.4 GBq of 177Lu-octreotate, blood samples were drawn 6 times within the first 24 h. In 50 patients, additional blood samples were obtained at 96 and 168 h. Moreover, urine was collected from 30 patients during the first 24 h. Planar whole-body and SPECT/CT images over the abdomen were acquired at 24, 96, and 168 h after the infusion. Calculation of the absorbed radiation dose to the bone marrow was based on blood and urinary activity curves combined with organ-based analysis of the whole-body images. The absorbed dose to the kidney was calculated from the pharmacokinetic data obtained from SPECT/CT. Result(s): For a single cycle of 7.4 GBq, the absorbed dose to the bone marrow and the kidney ranged from 0.05 to 0.4 Gy and from 2 to 10 Gy, respectively. In 197 of 200 patients, the kidneys accumulated an absorbed dose of 23 Gy before the bone marrow reached 2 Gy. Between 2 and 10 cycles of 177Lu-octreotate could be administered before the upper dose limit for the individual patient was reached. Conclusion(s): A method based on repeated whole-body imaging in combination with blood and urinary activity data over time was developed to determine the absorbed dose to the bone marrow. The dose-limiting organ was the kidney in 197 of 200 patients. In 50% of the patients, more than 4 cycles of 7.4 GBq of 177Lu-octreotate could be administered, whereas 20% of the subjects were treated with fewer than 4 cycles.

4681,"SAR values of mobile phones. Safety evaluation and risk perception. The specific absorption rate (SAR) is a prominent topic in the discussion about precautionary health protection. An experimental study investigated the effect of information about various SAR values (below the existing partial body limit value of 2 W/kg) on safety judgments of potential mobile phones users. It turns out that about 94% of the participants do not know the SAR value of their own mobile phone. SAR values below existing limits are not perceived as equally safe. Rather, the lower the SAR value, the higher the perceived safety. However, a majority of the participants does not consider these SAR values to be 100% safe, even if they are clearly below the existing limits. Explicitly indicating a precautionary limit value (referring to the Federal Office for Radiation Protection or to consumer organizations) does not change this safety evaluation. As expected, safety evaluation of the SAR values is also related to the perception of mobile phone risks. Those who are concerned about mobile phone communication give lower safety judgments than the unconcerned-independent of the level of the SAR values. Irrespective of that, our results suggest that establishing the SAR value as a criterion for mobile phones depends first of all on making it known to the public.",Excluded
4682,"Development of gravity-sensing organs in altered gravity. Experiments are described in which the development of the gravity-sensing organs was studied in newt larvae reared in microgravity on the IML-2 mission and in Aplysia embryos and larvae reared on a centrifuge at 1 to 5 g. In Aplysia embryos, the statolith (single dense mass on which gravity and linear acceleration act) was reduced in size in a graded fashion at increasing g. In early post-metamorphic Aplysia or even in isolated statocysts from such animals, the number of statoconia produced is reduced at high g. Newt larvae launched before any of the otoconia were formed and reared for 15 days in microgravity had nearly adult labyrinths at the end of the IML-2 mission. The otoliths of the saccule and utricle were the same size in flight and ground-reared larvae. However, the system of aragonitic otoconia produced in the endolymphatic sac in amphibians was much larger and developed earlier in the flight-reared larvae. At later developmental stages, the aragonitic otoconia enter and fill the saccule. One flight-reared larva was maintained for nine months post-flight and the size of the saccular otolith, as well as the volume of otoconia within the endolymphatic sac, were considerably larger than in age-matched, ground-reared newts. This suggests that rearing in microgravity initiates a process that continues for several months after introduction to 1-g, which greatly increases the volume of otoconia. The flight-reared animal had abnormal posture, pointing its head upward, whereas normal ground-reared newts always keep their head horizontal. This suggests that rearing for even a short period in microgravity can have lasting functional consequences in an animal subsequently reared in 1-g conditions on Earth.",Excluded
4683,"Multi-phase rotational angiography of the left ventricle to assist ablations: feasibility and accuracy of novel imaging. AIMS: Interventional left ventricular (LV) procedures integrating static 3D anatomy visualization are subject to mismatch with dynamic catheter movements due to prominent LV motion. We aimed to evaluate the accuracy of a recently developed acquisition and post-processing protocol for low radiation dose LV multi-phase rotational angiography (4DRA) in patients., METHODS AND RESULTS: 4DRA image acquisition of the LV was performed as investigational acquisition in patients undergoing left-sided ablation (11 men; BMI = 24.7 +/- 2.5 kg/m2). Iodine contrast was injected in the LA, while pacing from the RA at a cycle length of 700 ms. 4DRA acquisition and reconstruction were possible in all 11 studies. Reconstructed images were post-processed using streak artefact reduction algorithms and an interphase registration-based filtering method, increasing contrast-to-noise ratio by a factor 8.2 +/- 2.1. This enabled semi-automatic segmentation, yielding LV models of five equidistant phases per cardiac cycle. For evaluation, off-line 4DRA fluoroscopy registration was performed, and the 4DRA LV contours of the different phases were compared with the contours of five corresponding phases of biplane LV angiography, acquired in identical circumstances. Of the distances between these contours, 95% were <4 mm in both incidences. Effective radiation dose for 4DRA, calculated by patient-specific Monte-Carlo simulation, was 5.1 +/- 1.1 mSv., CONCLUSION: Creation of 4DRA LV models in man is feasible at near-physiological heart rate and with clinically acceptable radiation dose. They showed high accuracy with respect to LV angiography in RAO and LAO. The presented technology not only opens perspectives for full cardiac cycle dynamic anatomical guidance during interventional procedures, but also for 3DRA without need for very rapid pacing.

A coded analysis of X-ray-induced chromatid aberrations in lymphocyte cultures from 45 control individuals and 19 ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) heterozygotes was performed. The distribution of chromatid breaks induced in the late G2 portion of the cell cycle by 60 cGy of X-rays appeared bimodal in the study population. In six controls (13 percent) and in 12 of 19 (63 percent) A-T heterozygotes, the yields of X-ray-induced breaks observed were within the higher mode of the distribution. However, lymphocytes from A-T heterozygotes sensitive to the induction of chromatid breaks by 60 cGy did not contain increased numbers of aberrations following exposure to 20 cGy. The radio-resistant inhibition of DNA synthesis that occurs in A-T homozygotes was not observed in heterozygotes. Co-cultivation experiments showed an increased G2 delay in lymphocytes from an A-T heterozygote whose lymphocytes contained increased X-ray-induced chromatid breaks. The results show a significant association of A-T heterozygosity with G2 chromosomal sensitivity (P less than 0.001; Wilcoxon rank sum test). The measurement of X-ray-induced breaks, however, failed to identify 37 percent of A-T heterozygotes tested. The predicted prevalence of increased sensitivity to X-rays in controls is approximately three- to 30-fold greater than the estimated frequency of A-T heterozygotes in the general population. Therefore, although the increased sensitivity to X-ray-induced chromatid breaks appears to be associated with the A-T-gene, it is not a reliable indicator of A-T heterozygosity. Genetic or environmental factors other than the A-T gene also must be involved in the increased clastogenic response.",Included

MRI of the carotid arteries was performed within a prospective cohort of 42 HNC patients on average 7 years after RT. Two independent radiologists assessed maximal vessel wall thickness of common and internal carotid arteries. In case of wall thickening (>= 2 mm) the MRI signals as well as length of the thickened segment were assessed.Results. Mean (SD) age of the 42 patients at baseline was 53 (13) years and mean (SD) follow-up time after RT was 6.8 (1.3) years. In total 62% were men and 60% had one or more cerebrovascular risk factors. Mean (SD) dose of RT on the common carotid arteries and internal carotid arteries was 57 Gy (11) and 61 Gy (10), respectively. Wall thickening was observed in 58% of irradiated versus 27% of non-irradiated common carotid arteries and 24% of irradiated versus 6% of non-irradiated internal carotid arteries (p < 0.05). Mean (SD) thickness of the irradiated and non-irradiated common carotid arteries was 2.5 (0.9) and 2 (0.7) mm (p = 0.02). Mean thickness of the irradiated and non-irradiated internal carotid arteries was 1.8 (0.8) and 1.5 mm (0.3) (n.s.).

No significant differences were observed for signal intensities of the vessel walls.Conclusions. Our study showed significantly more vessel wall thickening in irradiated versus non-irradiated carotid arteries years after RT for HNC, while no differences in signal intensities were observed.Copyright © 2015 Informa Healthcare.",Excluded
4687,"Individually adapted examination protocols for reduction of radiation exposure in chest CT. RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To develop a simple directive for the reduction of radiation exposure without loss of diagnostic information in routine chest CT examinations., METHODS: Two hundred fifty adult patients (164 male, 86 female) were entered into a prospective trial. All examinations were performed with a multislice CT technique (Somatom Volume Zoom, Siemens). Four groups of 50 patients each were scanned with patient-related specific parameters: individual mA-s values were derived from the estimated body weight: kilograms + 10, +/- 0, - 10, and - 20 mAs. The results were compared with those of 50 patients who were examined by a standard chest protocol by using the parameters 120 mAs and 140 kV. All other parameters including the tube voltage were kept constant. Subjective image quality was rated on a three-point scale: 1 = excellent, 2 = fair, 3 = nondiagnostic. In addition, objective criteria based on signal-to-noise measurements were assessed by using a region-of-interest methodology., RESULTS: Image quality was sufficient in all cases. Mean subjective gradings of image quality, based on soft-tissue window settings, were 1.1 for the 120-mAs protocol, 1.1 for the (body weight [kg] + 10) mAs protocol, 1.1 for the (body weight [kg] +/- 0) mAs protocol, 1.3 for the (body weight [kg] - 10) mAs protocol, and 1.2 for the (body weight [kg] - 20) mAs protocol. Objective criteria based on noise measurements showed mean +/- standard deviation values of 5.7 +/- 0.8 Hounsfield units (HU) for the 120-mAs protocol. For the reduced-dose protocols, values were calculated as 7.6 +/- 1.2 HU (group + 10), 7.9 +/- 1.3 HU (group +/- 0), 8.7 +/- 1.2 HU (group - 10), and finally 9.1 +/- 1.3 HU (group - 20). The best correlation for an entire subgroup was achieved with the - 10 protocol (body weight [kg] - 10) mAs, with nearly constant noise related to body weight in all patients., CONCLUSIONS: By deriving mAs values from body weight estimation, an individually adapted protocol for chest CT can be recommended and easily employed in a clinical setting. With an adaptation of the tube current-time product based on the estimated body weight of the patient - 10 (body weight [kg] - 10 mAs), a well-balanced examination without significant loss of information, even in soft-tissue window settings, can be performed with this particular scanner. For this adapted mAs protocol, a mean reduction of radiation exposure of 45% was achievable, compared with the standard protocol. A maximum decrease per case down to 31 mAs was obtained, without relevant loss of image quality. Therefore, for other types of CT scanners, analogous protocols may be adapted.",Excluded
4688,"Influence of Needle Position on Lumbar Segmental Nerve Root Block Selectivity. Background and Objectives: In patients with chronic low back pain radiating to the leg, segmental nerve root blocks (SNRBs) are performed to predict surgical outcome and identify the putative symptomatic spinal nerve. Epidural spread may lead to false interpretation, affecting clinical decision making. Systematic fluoroscopic analysis of epidural local anesthetic spread and its relationship to needle tip location has not been published to date. Study aims include assessment of epidural local anesthetic spread and its relationship to needle position during fluoroscopy-assisted blocks. Method(s): Patients scheduled for L4, L5, and S1 blocks were included in this prospective observational study. Under fluoroscopy and electrostimulation, they received 0.5 mL of a mixture containing lidocaine 5 mg and iohexol 75 mg. X-rays with needle tip and contrast were scored for no epidural spread (grade 0), local spread epidurally (grade 1), or to adjacent nerve roots (grade 2). Result(s): Sixty-five patients were analyzed for epidural spread, 62 for needle position. Grade 1 epidural spread occurred in 47% of L4 and 28% of L5 blocks and grade 2 spread in 3 blocks (5%; L5 n = 1, S1 n = 2). For lumbar blocks, the needle was most frequently found in the lateral upper half of the intervertebral foramen. Epidural spread occurred more frequently with medial needle positions (P = .06). Conclusion(s): The findings suggest (P = .06) that the risk of grade 1 and 2 lumbar epidural spread, which results in decreased SNRB selectivity, is greater with medial needle positions in the intervertebral foramen. The variability in anatomic position of the dorsal root ganglion necessitates electrostimulation to guide SNRB in addition to fluoroscopy. © 2006 American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine.",Excluded

We sought, therefore, to investigate implant stability and survival in such patients. Patients were identified retrospectively from our electronic BAHA database. Hospital records were reviewed for demographics; operative technique; complications; and details regarding previous irradiation. Implant stability was assessed by resonance frequency analysis (RFA), generating a numerical value-implant stability quotient (ISQ). Extrapolating from dental studies, successfully loaded implants typically have ISQs of >=60. Readings were, therefore, interpreted with respect to this. Seven patients were identified for inclusion. Mean time between irradiation and implant insertion was 33 months (range 16-72 months), and mean time from implant insertion to RFA measurement was 41 months (range 3-96 months). Operatively, all patients underwent single-stage procedures under local anaesthesia. One patient suffered a Holger's grade 2 skin reaction, while two suffered significant skin flap failure, requiring revision procedures. The implant survival rate was 100 %. All ISQ values were >60, with a mean of 66.9 (95 % confidence interval 63.1-70.6). Our data support sufficient osseointegration of BAHA implant systems in post-irradiated patients, but highlight issues with wound healing. Contemporary soft tissue preservation operative techniques will likely overcome this, facilitating safe and efficacious BAHA insertion in this ever-increasing group of patients.Copyright © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
4690,"Gamma Knife surgery for parasellar meningiomas: long-term results including complications, predictive factors, and progression-free survival. OBJECT: Stereotactic radiosurgery serves as an important primary and adjuvant treatment option for patients with many types of intracranial meningiomas. This is particularly true for patients with parasellar meningiomas. In this study, the authors evaluated the outcomes of Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) used to treat parasellar meningiomas., METHODS: The study is a retrospective review of the outcomes in 138 patients with meningiomas treated at the University of Virginia from 1989 to 2006; all patients had a minimum follow-up of 24 months. There were 31 men and 107 women whose mean age was 54 years (range 19-85 years). Eighty-four patients had previously undergone resection. The mean pre-GKS tumor volume was 7.5 ml (range 0.2-54.8 ml). Clinical and radiographic evaluations were performed, and factors related to favorable outcomes in each case were assessed., RESULTS: The mean follow-up duration was 84 months (median 75.5 months, range 24-216 months). In 118 patients (86%), the tumor volume was unchanged or had decreased at last follow-up. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated radiographic progression-free survival at 5 and 10 years to be 95.4% and 69%, respectively. Fourteen patients (10%) developed new cranial nerve palsies following GKS. Factors associated with tumor control included younger age, a higher isodose, and smaller tumor volume. A longer follow-up duration was associated with either a decrease or increase in tumor volume. Fourteen patients (10%) experienced new or worsening cranial nerve deficits after treatment. Factors associated with this occurrence were larger pretreatment tumor volume, lower peripheral radiation dose, lower maximum dose, tumor progression, and longer follow-up., CONCLUSIONS: Gamma Knife surgery offers an acceptable rate of tumor control for parasellar meningiomas and accomplishes this with a low incidence of neurological deficits. Radiological control after radiosurgery is more likely in those patients with a smaller tumor volume and a higher prescription dose.",Excluded
4691,"Phase II trial of induction gemcitabine and carboplatin followed by conformal thoracic radiation to 74 Gy with weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin in unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer. Introduction: The survival for patients with locally advanced, unresectable non-small cell lung cancer receiving standard of care concomitant chemoradiation remains disappointingly low. A reduction in both local and distant recurrence is needed to improve patients' outcome. Performing molecular studies on serially collected tumor specimens may result in a better selection of therapeutic options. Method(s): We conducted a phase II single-institution trial of two cycles of induction chemotherapy with gemcitabine and carboplatin followed by high-dose conformal radiation concomitant with weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin in 39 patients. The trial required a dedicated tumor biopsy before treatment initiation. In addition, tumor biopsies were requested, if safely feasible, before initiation of chemoradiation and 2 months after completion all therapy. Result(s): Induction chemotherapy was well tolerated, and 38 patients proceeded with chemoradiation. The mean delivered radiation dose was 70.2 Gy, 23 patients received the full dose of 74 Gy, and 19 patients completed all treatment on schedule without dose reductions or delays. Median overall and progression-free survivals were 22.7 and 14.3 months, respectively. A total of 82 procedures, including 46 transthoracic core needle biopsies, were performed. Thirteen patients had all three serial tumor biopsies. Three of these procedures resulted in complications that required an intervention; all for the treatment of a biopsy-induced pneumothorax. Conclusion(s): We conclude that induction gemcitabine/carboplatin followed by concurrent paclitaxel/carboplatin with conformal radiation to 74 Gy is safe and tolerable with promising efficacy. We demonstrated that dedicated and serial tumor collections are safe, feasible, and acceptable for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

4692,"Iterative reconstruction and individualized automatic tube current selection reduce radiation dose while maintaining image quality in 320-multidetector computed tomography coronary angiography. Aim To assess the effect of two iterative reconstruction algorithms (AIDR and AIDR3D) and individualized automatic tube current selection on radiation dose and image quality in computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA). Materials and methods In a single-centre cohort study, 942 patients underwent electrocardiogram-gated CTCA using a 320-multidetector CT system. Images from group 1 (n = 228) were reconstructed with a filtered back projection algorithm (Quantum Denoising Software, QDS+). Iterative reconstruction was used for group 2 (AIDR, n = 379) and group 3 (AIDR3D, n = 335). Tube current was selected based on body mass index (BMI) for groups 1 and 2, and selected automatically based on scout image attenuation for group 3. Subjective image quality was graded on a four-point scale (1 = excellent, 4 = non-diagnostic). Results There were no differences in age (p = 0.975), body mass index (p = 0.435), or heart rate (p = 0.746) between the groups. Image quality improved with iterative reconstruction and automatic tube current selection [1.3 (95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.2-1.4), 1.2 (1.1-1.2) and 1.1 (1-1.2) respectively; p < 0.001] and radiation dose decreased [274 (260-290), 242 (230-253) and 168 (156-180) mGy cm, respectively; p < 0.001]. Conclusion The application of the latest iterative reconstruction algorithm and individualized automatic tube current selection can substantially reduce radiation dose whilst improving image quality in CTCA. © 2013 The Royal College of Radiologists.

4693,"UVR2 ensures transgenerational genome stability under simulated natural UV-B in Arabidopsis thaliana. Ground levels of solar UV-B radiation induce DNA damage. Sessile phototrophic organisms such as vascular plants are recurrently exposed to sunlight and require UV-B photoreception, flavonols shielding, direct reversal of pyrimidine dimers and nucleotide excision repair for resistance against UV-B radiation. However, the frequency of UV-B-induced mutations is unknown in plants. Here we quantify the amount and types of mutations in the offspring of Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type and UV-B-hypersensitive mutants exposed to simulated natural UV-B over their entire life cycle. We show that reversal of pyrimidine dimers by UVR2 photolyase is the major mechanism required for sustaining plant genome stability across generations under UV-B. In addition to widespread somatic expression, germline-specific UVR2 activity occurs during late flower development, and is important for ensuring low mutation rates in male and female cell lineages. This allows plants to maintain genome integrity in the germline despite exposure to UV-B.",Excluded
4694,"Management of oropharyngeal cancer: a cross-sectional review of institutional practice at a large Canadian referral centre. BACKGROUND: Over the years, the treatment of oropharyngeal cancer has changed; in the past, first-line treatment consisted of surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy, today however, primary treatment typically involves concomitant chemoradiation, and reserves surgery for salvage. While chemoradiation is the modality of choice for primary management of oropharyngeal cancer, disease characteristics, institutional bias, and patient preferences influence treatment choice. This has lead to variation in the treatment of OPC, and has generated some uncertainly regarding the ideal therapeutic approach. The objective of this study was to describe the treatment of OPC a large Canadian referral center, highlighting trends in treatment choice and outcome., METHODS: This is a cross-sectional retrospective review of clinical practice at Sunnybrook Health Science Centre (Toronto, ON). This investigation documents type of first-line treatment, rates of treatment failure, rates of surgical salvage, and 5-year disease-free survival. This study also asses the therapeutic impact of free-flap reconstruction on the use of a postoperative tracheostomy and/or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube., RESULTS: The majority of oropharyngeal cancer patients presented with regionally metastatic disease (stage III-IV) and underwent concomitant chemoradiation as first-line treatment. Just over half of patients who failed chemoradiation were eligible for salvage surgery. Forty-six percent of salvage patients recurred at approximately 6 months, and died approximately 12 months following the first sign of disease recurrence. Five-year survival for salvage patients stage II, III, IVA, and IVB was 100%, 54.5%, 53.8%, and 50%, respectively. The incidence of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tubes and tracheostomies was comparable between patients who underwent free-flap reconstruction and patients who did not., CONCLUSION: The modality of choice for first-line treatment of oropharyngeal cancer is concomitant chemoradiation. The moderate failure rate following chemoradiation and the modest survival rate following salvage surgery could indicate that selected patients may benefit from undergoing surgery as first-line treatment. While this study did not show that functional outcomes were better for free-flap patients, it is highly likely that those who received a free-flap did better then they would have had they not undergone reconstructive surgery. More research regarding the therapeutic effects of free-flaps in OPC survivors is needed.",Excluded

4696,"Automated attenuation-based tube voltage selection for body CTA: Performance evaluation of 192-slice dual-source CT. Objective: To assess radiation dose and image quality in body CT-angiography (CTA) with automated attenuation-based tube voltage selection (ATVS) on a 192-slice dual-source CT (DSCT). Method(s): Forty patients (69.5 +/- 9.6 years) who had undergone body CTA with ATVS (ref.kVp 100, ref.mAs 90) using a 2x192-slice CT in single-source mode were retrospectively included. All patients had undergone prior CTA with a 2x128-slice CT and ATVS with identical imaging and contrast media protocols, serving for comparison. Images were reconstructed with iterative reconstruction at similar strength levels. Radiation dose was determined. Image quality was assessed semi-quantitatively (1:excellent, 5:non-diagnostic), aortic attenuation, noise and CNR were determined. Result(s): As compared to 128-slice DSCT, 192-slice DSCT selected tube voltages were lower in 30 patients (75 %), higher in 3 (7.5 %), and similar in 7 patients (17.5 %). CTDIvol was lower with 192-slice DSCT (4.7 +/- 1.9 mGy vs. 5.8 +/- 2.1 mGy; p < 0.001). Subjective image quality, mean aortic attenuation (342 +/- 67HU vs. 268 +/- 67HU) and CNR (9.8 +/- 2.5 vs. 8.2 +/- 2.9) were higher with 192-slice DSCT (all p < 0.01), all datasets being diagnostic. Conclusion(s): Our study suggests that ATVS of 192-slice DSCT for body CTA is associated with an improved image quality and further radiation dose reduction of 19 % compared to 128-slice DSCT. Key Points: * 192-slice DSCT allows imaging from 70 kVp to 150 kVp at 10 kVp increments. * 192-slice DSCT allows for radiation-dose reduction in body-CTA with ATVS. * Subjective and objective image quality increase compared to 128-slice DSCT.Copyright © 2015, European Society of Radiology.",Excluded
4697,"Raw data-based iterative reconstruction in body CTA: evaluation of radiation dose saving potential. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate prospectively, in patients undergoing body CTA, the radiation dose saving potential of raw data-based iterative reconstruction as compared to filtered back projection (FBP)., METHODS: Twenty-five patients underwent thoraco-abdominal CTA with 128-slice dual-source CT, operating both tubes at 120 kV. Full-dose (FD) images were reconstructed with FBP and were compared to half-dose (HD) images with FBP and HD-images with sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction (SAFIRE), both reconstructed using data from only one tube-detector-system. Image quality and sharpness of the aortic contour were assessed. Vessel attenuation and noise were measured, contrast-to-noise-ratio was calculated., RESULTS: Noise as image quality deteriorating artefact occurred in 24/25 (96%) HD-FBP but not in FD-FBP and HD-raw data-based iterative reconstruction datasets (p < 0.001). Other artefacts occurred with similar prevalence among the datasets. Sharpness of the aortic contour was higher for FD-FBP and HD-raw data-based iterative reconstruction as compared to HD-FBP (p < 0.001). Aortoiliac attenuation was similar among all datasets (p > 0.05). Lowest noise was found for HD-raw data-based iterative reconstruction (7.23HU), being 9.4% lower than that in FD-FBP (7.98HU, p < 0.05) and 30.8% lower than in HD-FBP images (10.44HU, p < 0.001). Contrast-to-noise-ratio was lower in HD-FBP (p < 0.001) and higher in HD-raw data-based iterative reconstruction (p < 0.001) as compared to FD-FBP., CONCLUSION: Intra-individual comparisons of image quality of body CTA suggest that raw data-based iterative reconstruction allows for dose reduction >50% while maintaining image quality. Key Points * Raw data-based iterative reconstruction reduces image noise and improves image quality as compared to filtered back projection * At a similar radiation dose, raw data-based iterative reconstruction improves the sharpness of vessel contours * In body CTA a dose reduction of >50% might be possible when using raw data-based iterative reconstructions, while image quality can be maintained.",Excluded
4698,"Computed tomography indicators of cerebral microperfusion improve long term after carotid stenting in symptomatic patients. OBJECTIVES: We tested the hypothesis that computed tomography (CT) perfusion markers of cerebral microcirculation would improve 36 months after internal carotid artery stenting for symptomatic carotid stenosis while results obtained 6-8 weeks after the stenting procedure would yield a predictive value. METHOD(S): We recruited consecutive eligible patients with >70% symptomatic carotid stenosis with a complete circle of Willis and normal vertebral arteries to the observational cohort study. We detected changes in the cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), mean transit time (MTT), time to peak (TTP) and permeability surface area-product (PS) before and after carotid stenting. We have also compared the absolute differences in the ipsilateral and contralateral CT perfusion markers before and after stenting. The search for regression models of ""36 months after stenting"" results was based on a stepwise analysis with bidirectional elimination method. RESULT(S): A total of 34 patients completed the 36 months follow-up (15 females, mean age of 69.68+/-S.D. 7.61 years). At 36 months after stenting, the absolute values for CT perfusion markers had improved: CBF (ipsilateral: +7.76%, contralateral: +0.95%); CBV (ipsilateral: +5.13%, contralateral: +3.00%); MTT (ipsilateral: -12.90%; contralateral: -5.63%); TTP (ipsilateral: -2.10%, contralateral: -4.73%) and PS (ipsilateral: -35.21%, contralateral: -35.45%). MTT assessed 6-8 weeks after stenting predicted the MTT value 36 months after stenting (ipsilateral: R2=0.867, contralateral R2=0.688). CONCLUSION(S): We have demonstrated improvements in CT perfusion markers of cerebral microcirculation health that persist for at least 3 years after carotid artery stenting in symptomatic patients.

4699,"Radiation. Exposure to solar and ionizing radiation increases the risk for cancer in humans. Some 5% of solar radiation is within the ultraviolet spectrum and may cause both malignant melanoma and non-melanocytic skin cancer; the latter is regarded as a benign disease and is accordingly not included in our estimation of avoidable cancers. Under the assumption that the rate of occurrence of malignant melanoma of the buttocks of both men and women and of the scalp of women would apply to all parts of the body in people completely unexposed to solar radiation, it was estimated that approximately 95% of all malignant melanomas arising in the Nordic populations around the year 2000 will be due to exposure to natural ultraviolet radiation, equivalent to an annual number of about 4700 cases, with 2100 in men and 2600 in women, or some 4% of all cancers notified. Exposure to ionizing radiation in the Nordic countries occurs at an average effective dose per capita per year of about 3 mSv (Iceland, 1.1 mSv) from natural sources, and about 1 mSv from man-made sources. While the natural sources are primarily radon in indoor air, natural radionuclides in food, cosmic radiation and gamma radiation from soil and building materials, the man-made sources are dominated by the diagnostic and therapeutic use of ionizing radiation. On the basis of measured levels of radon in Nordic dwellings and associated risk estimates for lung cancer derived from well-conducted epidemiological studies, we estimated that about 180 cases of lung cancer (1% of all lung cancer cases) per year could be avoided in the Nordic countries around the year 2000 if indoor exposure to radon were eliminated, and that an additional 720 cases (6%) could be avoided annually if either radon or tobacco smoking were eliminated. Similarly, it was estimated that the exposure of the Nordic populations to natural sources of ionizing radiation other than radon and to medical sources will each give rise to an annual total of 2120 cancers at various sites. For all types of ionizing radiation, the annual total will be 4420 cancer cases, or 3.9% of all cancers arising in the Nordic populations, with 3.4% in men and 4.4% in women.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To report our experience in long-term follow-up of ocular melanoma patients treated with custom OSU-Nag eye plaques using (125)I sources., METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted for 113 consecutive ocular melanoma patients with follow-up visual acuity data who were treated with OSU-Nag plaque episcleral brachytherapy at The Ohio State University Medical Center from 1994 to 2009. Visual acuity, complication data, and recurrence rates were recorded up to 120 months after brachytherapy., RESULTS: Median age at presentation was 63.0 years (range, 22-93). Median follow-up was 65.5 months (range, 2-180). Median radiation dose at the prescription point was 85.8 Gy (range, 51.8-103.7). Preservation of useful visual acuity, defined as better than 20/200, was noted in 43 of 74 (58%) of patients in the present study at 36 months compared with 50.1% of Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study participants. By 120 months, 17 of 30 (57%; 95% confidence interval, 45-69%) progressed to visual acuity worse than 20/200, whereas 9 of 30 (30%) retained visual acuity of 20/40 or better, and 4 of 30 (13%) were 20/50-20/200. The rate of retinopathy after radiation was approximately 40% of all those observed by 60 months. Baseline visual acuity, apical tumor height, American Joint Committee on Cancer tumor category, and distance between the tumor and the fovea were all significantly associated with loss of visual acuity. The local tumor control rate by 60 months of follow-up was 93% (95% confidence interval, 85-97%)., CONCLUSIONS: The OSU-Nag custom (125)I plaque is an effective treatment for uveal melanoma, with preservation of useful visual acuity in 58% of eyes 3 years after treatment and 43% of eyes 10 years after treatment.

4701,"TRAIL enhances efficacy of radiotherapy in a p53 mutant, Bcl-2 overexpressing lymphoid malignancy. Background and purpose: Resistance to apoptosis is a contributing factor in the response to radiotherapy. Aim of this study was to evaluate whether TRAIL - in a soluble isoleucine zippered form - enhances the cytotoxic effect of irradiation on tumour cells with a blockade in the mitochondrial apoptosis route and/or a dysfunctional p53 pathway. Material(s) and Method(s): The p53 mutant human T acute lymphoblastic leukemia line Jurkat transduced with the Bcl-2 gene was used as model system in vitro and in a subcutaneous transplant setting in immunodeficient mice. Sensitivity to single and combined treatment was read out by apoptosis hallmarks and clonogenic survival in vitro, and by bioluminescence and palpation in vivo. Result(s): Jurkat cells overexpressing Bcl-2 did not undergo apoptosis after irradiation, but the combination with TRAIL synergistically induced apoptosis without breaking mitochondrial resistance. TRAIL also reduced clonogenic survival after irradiation. In vivo, radiotherapy or TRAIL alone delayed tumour outgrowth, but combination treatment had the most profound effect. Conclusion(s): Isoleucine zippered TRAIL can strongly enhance the efficacy of tumour therapy with ionising radiation in an unfavourable setting of p53 mutation and Bcl-2 overexpression. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

UNLABELLED: It is unknown whether model of renarrowing after beta-radiation for in-stent restenosis (ISR) is influenced by the type of geographic miss (GM)., METHODS: In 166 ISR treated with Galileo, serial quantitative coronary angiographic analysis was done. Minimal lumen diameters and lengths were measured for (1) stent, (2) peri-stent subsegments subjected to angioplasty with/without irradiation, and (3) irradiation margins. GM was defined as: (Type 1) edge injury within the 32P source dose fall-off: 2.0 mm inside and outside the source end marker or (Type 2) overt, nonirradiated injury: beyond the outer 2.0-mm long dose fall-off zone., RESULTS: Restenosis rate was 28.3% at 8.9+/-4.5 months with 60% located exclusively outside the stent. Type 1 GM was present in 24.7% of proximal edges, whereas Type 2 in 18.1%. Respective percentages for distal edges were 23.5% and 15.7%. Regardless of presence and type of GM, significant late lumen loss occurred only outside the stent. However, the biggest late lumen loss at the proximal edge was induced by the Type 1 GM (0.65+/-0.79, p<0.001), while proximal Type 2 GM was not associated with edge renarrowing (-0.04+/-0.48, p=NS).

Background: We describe the clinical history, outcome, and toxicity of five patients with high-grade retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma (RSTS) who were treated with neoadjuvant low-dose radiotherapy (RT) followed by resection with or without intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT), followed by adjuvant RT. We aim to provide additional evidence for the various treatment options that exist for this rare tumor entity. Method(s): Most patients presented with mild abdominal symptoms. Diagnosis was confirmed by biopsy. Additional imaging was done by sonography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and/or positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT). All patients were treated with neoadjuvant RT of 19.8Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions followed by resection and postoperative RT up to 45Gy with a median interval between resection and start of postoperative RT of 5 weeks. Two patients received additional IORT. Median follow-up was 61 months. Result(s): One patient developed a local recurrence that was diagnosed 30 months after the start of the first therapy. He was treated with a salvage resection and had no evidence of disease at the last follow-up. Another patient developed a right-sided RSTS on the contralateral side from the primary radiation field with pelvic bone infiltration 56 months after the start of RT. He was treated again by RT and resection and was without evidence of disease at last follow-up. Radiotherapy was well tolerated without major toxicity. Conclusion(s): The treatment of RSTS by low-dose neoadjuvant RT, resection with IORT and adjuvant RT seems to be a feasible and effective treatment approach.

4704,"Case report: Asymptomatic ventricular fibrillation and ineffective high energy therapy in a patient with left ventricular non compaction cardiomyopathy and left ventricular assist device. BACKGROUND We present a case of asymptomatic ventricular fibrillation and ineffective defibrillation in a patient with left ventricular non compaction cardiomyopathy after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) Heart Mate III. Non compaction cardiomyopathy is a rare, congenital cardiomyopathy resulting from abnormal embryogenesis of myocardium with characteristic multiple trabeculations in ventricular apex. Its lethal character comes from frequent ventricular arrhythmias, often also with atrio ventricular conduction block. The main role of treatment is to improve cardiac efficiency, reduce the risk of arrhythmias, implant of an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator for prevention of sudden cardiac death, ventricular assist device and heart transplant in cases of serious heart failure. CASE REPORT 61 year old patient with severe heart failure (LVEF 16%), diagnosed in 2012. In the course of non compaction cardiomyopathy after cardiac resynchronization therapy with defibrillation function in February 2018 and implantation left ventricular mechanical cardiac assistant LVAD with Heart Mate III system on 27.06.2019. The patient had 5 discharges of the device in a church without loss of consciousness and symptoms of apparent circulatory failure on 27.10.2019. The patient was admitted to the Emergency Department in fair general condition, with basal crepitations over the lungs audible, slight dyspnea at rest, with ongoing Torsade de pointes in electrocardiographic examination, with ventricular rate 300/min, and blood pressure 100/60 Hg mm. Ventricular fibrillation was interrupted by external defibrillator, achieving sinus rhythm return. Basic examination results showed elevated proBNP values (4362 ng/l), features of pulmonary stasis on X ray. CRT D device memory showed 5 unsuccessful discharges of the device, followed by external effective defibrillation after exhausting all available high energy therapies, which restored sinus rhythm and synchronous biventricular stimulation. The patient was discharged home in good condition. CONCLUSIONS Ineffective high energy therapy in many cases ends in death. In this case, despite the abnormal electrical heart rate, LVAD was working correctly and ensured proper cardiovascular function.",Excluded
4705,"New type of hip arthroplasty failure related to modular femoral components: Breakage at the neck-stem junction. Total hip replacements (THR) with modular femoral components (stem-neck interface) make it possible to adapt to extramedullary femoral parameters (anteversion, offset, and length) theoretically improving muscle function and stability. Nevertheless, adding a new interface has its disadvantages: reduced mechanical resistance, fretting corrosion and material fatigue fracture. We report the case of a femoral stem fracture of the female part of the component where the modular morse taper of the neck is inserted. An extended trochanteric osteotomy was necessary during revision surgery because the femoral stump could not be grasped for extraction, so that a long stem had to be used. In this case, the patient had the usual risk factors for modular neck failure: he was an active overweight male patient with a long varus neck. This report shows that the female part of the stem of a small femoral component may also be at increased failure risk and should be added to the list of risk factors.

Purpose: We have previously demonstrated the efficacy of intracoronary beta-brachytherapy using a liquid 188Re-filled balloon in a randomised trial including de novo lesions. Percutaneous coronary interventions in restenotic lesions and in stenoses of venous bypass grafts are characterised by a high recurrence rate for restenosis and re-interventions. Against this background, we wanted to assess the impact of intracoronary beta-brachytherapy using a liquid 188Re-filled balloon in restenotic lesions in native coronary arteries and venous bypass grafts. Method(s): In 243 patients, beta-brachytherapy with 22.5 Gy was applied at a tissue depth of 0.5 mm. Patients were followed up angiographically after 6 months and clinically for 12 months. The primary clinical endpoint was the incidence of MACE (death, myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularisation). Secondary angiographic endpoints were late loss and binary restenosis rate in the total segment. Result(s): All irradiation procedures were successfully performed. A total of 222 lesions were in native coronary arteries; 21 were bypass lesions. Mean irradiation length was 41.6+/-17.3 mm (range 20-150 mm) in native coronary arteries and 48.1+/-33.9 mm (range 30-180 mm) in bypass lesions; the reference diameter was 2.57+/-0.52 mm and 2.83+/-0.76 mm, respectively. There was no vessel thrombosis during antiplatelet therapy. Angiographic/clinical follow-up rate was 84%/100%. MACE rate was 17.6% in the native coronary artery group and 38.1% in the CABG group (p<0.03). Binary restenosis rate was 22.5% and 55.6% (p<0.01), and late loss was 0.38+/-0.72 mm and 1.33+/-1.11 mm (p<0.001), respectively. Conclusion(s): We conclude that intracoronary beta-brachytherapy with a liquid 188Re-filled balloon using 22.5 Gy at a tissue depth of 0.5 mm in restenotic lesions is safe. It is associated with a low binary restenosis rate, resulting in a low occurrence rate of MACE within 12 months in restenotic lesions in native coronary arteries but not in vein grafts. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.",Excluded
4707,"Dissecting the hematopoietic microenvironment. V: limitations of repair following damage to the hematopoietic support stroma. Damage and repair of the hematopoietic microenvironment of the spleen was studied using X-irradiation, anoxic necrosis induced by splenic ligation, or a combination of the two, as the destructive agents. Spleen colony number, size and type, 59Fe uptake, and microscopic study of splenic structure were used as means of assessment. The most severe or least repaired damage was induced by high dose irradiation (4000 r), by 1000 r followed immediately by splenic ligation, and by two successive splenic ligations separated by a 30 day recovery period. It was seen that reduction of CFUs lodgment, as measured by f factor, played a very major role in the lesser number of spleen colonies formed after either kind of damage. Following the several treatments, the numbers of spleen colonies formed, their size and their typing as erythrocytic or granulocytic varied independently of each other, suggesting that these functions of the microenvironment, and the cell types responsible for them, are independent of each other. The exhaustion of regenerative capacity displayed by repeatedly ligated spleens suggested a maximal limit for stromal cell replications commensurate with Hayflick's hypothesis.",Excluded
4708,"Comparison of the micronucleus and chromosome aberration techniques for the documentation of cytogenetic damage in radiochemotherapy-treated patients with rectal cancer. PURPOSE: The goal of the interdisciplinary Clinical Research Unit KFO179 (Biological Basis of Individual Tumor Response in Patients with Rectal Cancer) is to develop an individual Response and Toxicity Score for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer treated with neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy. The aim of the present study was to find a reliable and sensitive method with easy scoring criteria and high numbers of cell counts in a short period of time in order to analyze DNA damage in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Thus, the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay and the chromosome aberration technique (CAT) were tested., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained from 22 patients with rectal cancer before (0 Gy), during (21.6 Gy), and after (50.4 Gy) radiochemotherapy were stimulated in vitro by phytohemagglutinin (PHA); the cultures were then processed for the CBMN assay and the CAT to compare the two methods., RESULTS: A significant increase of chromosomal damage was observed in the course of radiochemotherapy parallel to increasing radiation doses, but independent of the chemotherapy applied. The equivalence of both methods was shown by Westlake's equivalence test., CONCLUSION: The results show that the CBMN assay and the CAT are equivalent. For further investigations, we prefer the CBMN assay, because it is simpler through easy scoring criteria, allows high numbers of cell counts in less time, is reliable, sensitive, and has higher statistical power. In the future, we plan to integrate cytogenetic damage during radiochemotherapy into the planned Response and Toxicity Score within our interdisciplinary Clinical Research Unit.",Excluded
4709,"Radioiodine therapy induces dose-dependent in vivo oxidation injury: evidence by increased isoprostane 8-epi-PGF(2 alpha). UNLABELLED: 131I is the treatment of choice for differentiated thyroid cancer and hyperthyroidism. A relationship between low-density lipoprotein oxidation and radioiodine therapy-related side effects, consequently inducing increased formation of 8-epi-prostaglandin F(2 alpha) (PGF(2 alpha)) in situ, has recently been reported by several investigators. Isoprostanes, among them 8-epi-PGF(2 alpha), have been associated with increased oxidation injury due to various pathologic conditions in vivo. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible induction of oxidative stress as a consequence of (131)I therapy., METHODS: 8-epi-PGF(2 alpha) was examined in plasma, serum, and urine in 42 patients undergoing radioiodine treatment of hyperthyroidism or thyroid cancer. The 8-epi-PGF(2 alpha) levels were analyzed daily for 1 wk and thereafter at different points up to 12 wk after treatment., RESULTS: The isoprostane levels showed an increase after application of radioiodine in all investigated compartments. The effect was significantly higher and longer lasting after higher-activity therapy (2,960 or 7,400 MBq) than after lower-activity therapy (185 or 740 MBq)., CONCLUSION: These findings document a significant, dose-dependent in vivo oxidation injury as a consequence of therapeutic radioiodine application to the salivary gland.",Excluded
4710,"Solar urticaria. Introduction. Solar urticaria (SU) is a rare photodermatosis induced by a broad spectrum of electromagnetic radiation. Theoretically it should not present a diagnostic problem, but in everyday practice it is quite frequently misdiagnosed. Objective. To characterize SU cases diagnosed in the photobiology unit of the Dermatological Department of WUM, with particular analysis of conformity of initial diagnosis with that established in the photobiology unit. Material and methods. Investigation was performed in 87 patients directed to the photobiology unit with diagnosis of solar urticaria (out of 12 041 patients with different forms of light hypersensitivity tested). In all patients in order to determine sensitivity to UVB and UVA phototests were performed. They included evaluation of minimal urticarial dose. As the light source fluorescent bulbs emitting a continuous spectrum of UVB or UVA were used. In 5 patients to evaluate sensitivity to visible light a slide projector was used. In 30 patients additionally photopatch tests were done. Results. Our results confirmed rare occurrence of solar urticaria. Diagnosis of US was confirmed only in 15 out of 87 patients with such initial diagnosis (17.2%); they represented 0.12% of all patients with photodermatoses tested. In this group there were 8 women and 7 men of mean age 26.2 years (M), 25.7 years (W). In the majority (9) of cases the disease lasted one year before testing. The US action spectrum in our patients was UVA + UVB in 9 cases, mainly UVA in 2, mainly UVB in 2, and in two patients urticarial wheals were provoked by UVA, UVB and visible light. We did not notice either delayed onset or prolonged duration of urticaria. Photopatch testing and longer (up to 2 weeks after UV exposure) observation of irradiated sites enabled us to make a proper diagnosis in further 52 patients. In 35 we disclosed polymorphic light eruptions, in 12 contact dermatitis to chromium, in 2 photocontact dermatitis to chlorpromazine and fragrance substances. In 3 patients we diagnosed chronic actinic dermatitis. In 20 cases it was not possible to establish a definite diagnosis. Wrong initial diagnosis was observed mainly in patients hypersensitive to UVA. Conclusions. In patients with oedemato-erythematous lesions after sun exposure lasting longer than 24 h, particularly in the elderly, diagnostic procedures should include additionally to phototesting patch and photopatch tests.",Excluded
4711,"Do persons living near a uranium processing site have evidence of increased somatic cell gene mutations? A first study. The objective of this study was to examine if individuals living near a uranium processing site have greater mutagenic damage, as measured by three mutagenicity assays, compared with subjects unexposed to any nuclear facilities. The design was a cross-sectional exploratory analysis of 112 subjects; 56 volunteer residents were from within a 5-mile radius of the Fernald Uranium Processing site and 56 'control' subjects were from a geographically separate area unexposed to any known uranium emissions. The groups were constrained to be similar in age and sex composition. The main outcome measures were three human somatic gene mutation assays consisting of the HPRT T-lymphocyte cloning assay to measure 6-thioguanine resistant lymphocytes; the glycophorin A assay to detect the loss of expression of the M or N allele; and the micronucleus assay as a marker of chromosomal damage. The results showed no statistically significant or quantitatively important differences between groups for all three mutagenicity assays; only the unselected cloning efficiency was statistically significantly different between groups (0.42 +/- 0.16 for the Fernald versus 0.35 +/- 0.12 for the comparison groups). In both groups, age was significantly related to HPRT mutant frequency, with a 1.25% rate of increase in mutant frequencies for each 1-year gain of age in the Fernald group and a 1.12% rate of increase in mutant frequencies for each 1-year gain of age in the comparison group. For the micronucleus data, females had a greater mean micronucleus frequency than males. In addition, smokers had an increased mean ln (natural logarithm) HPRT mutant frequency (3.06 +/- 0.14 for current smokers compared with a mean of 2.72 +/- 0.05 for non-current (i.e. never plus former) smokers). Our results are consistent with the previously reported association between sex type and micronucleus frequency, the known relationship between age and T-lymphocyte cloning efficiency and age and HPRT mutant frequency, and verify the wide inter-subject variability for the latter. Finally, we conclude that at a population level, the relationships between current cigarette use and HPRT mutant frequency, and sex type and micronucleus frequency, are stronger than is the association between geographic proximity to a uranium processing site and mutagenic abnormalities.",Included
4712,"Radiation dose considerations in the palliative treatment of locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer with high-dose radiotherapy has not been curative, and can be difficult to tolerate. We decided to compare retrospectively the outcomes of patients treated concurrently with 5-fluorouracil and either 30 Gy or more than 30 Gy of radiation. From December 1993 through May 2001, 107 patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas had been treated with palliative chemoradiation. Eighty-six patients had received a prescribed dose of 30 Gy and 50.4 Gy had been prescribed in 18 patients. Two of these patients were unable to complete the full dose of radiotherapy due to toxicity, and 3 received intraoperative radiotherapy boost (20 Gy). Three additional patients received a prescribed dose of 33 Gy, 36 Gy, and 52.2 Gy, respectively. These patients were grouped together (n = 21, median 50.4 Gy). All patients had received concurrent protracted venous infusions of 5-fluorouracil (300 mg/m Monday through Friday). The median survival time was not affected significantly by a higher radiotherapy dose (8 months for the 30 Gy group versus 9 months for the group receiving higher doses; P = 0.64). The 6-month actuarial progression rates were 45% versus 50% (P = 0.90) for local disease progression, and 54% versus 50% (P = 0.94) for distant metastasis for the 30 Gy and the higher dose groups, respectively. Ten of the 86 patients (12%) who had received 30 Gy were hospitalized for treatment-related gastrointestinal toxicity (grade 3) versus 6 of the 21 (29%) patients given higher doses (P = 0.05). Compared with higher doses given over 5 to 6 weeks, chemoradiation (30 Gy in 10 fractions in 2 weeks with concurrent infusional 5-FU) results in a similar median survival, and local disease progression rates in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer apparently do not substantially improve local disease control or median survival time. Because higher doses of radiotherapy can lead to increased acute treatment-related morbidity, we recommend using 30 Gy in 10 fractions unless the patient is part of a prospective study evaluating novel biologic or cytotoxic radiosensitizers.",Excluded
4713,"Noncancer disease incidence in the atomic bomb survivors: 1958-1986. Using the longitudinal data of the Adult Health Study (AHS) cohort collected during 1958-1986, we examined for the first time the relationship between exposure to ionizing radiation and the incidence of 19 nonmalignant disorders in the A-bomb survivors. Affected individuals were ascertained through the three-digit codes of the International Classification of Diseases which are encoded in the AHS database subsequent to diagnoses made on the basis of general laboratory tests, physical examinations, and history-taking conducted during biennial AHS examinations. The disease onset time was estimated using the mid-point between the AHS examination data when the disease was initially reported and the previously attended disease-free examination date. Dosimetry System 86 organ doses judged to be most appropriate were used. Tests of dose effects were performed assuming a linear relative risk model with stratified background incidence. For the entire study period, significant excess risk was detected for uterine myoma (P < 0.001), chronic liver disease and cirrhosis (P = 0.006), and thyroid disease (P < 0.0001), defined broadly as the presence of one or more of certain noncancerous thyroid conditions. The incidence of myocardial infarction was shown to be increased (P = 0.03) in later years (1968-1986) among the younger heavily exposed AHS subjects, confirming the results of the recent Life Span Study (LSS) noncancer mortality report on coronary heart disease. The findings for uterine myoma may serve as additional evidence indicating benign tumor growth as a possible consequence of radiation exposure. Our results indicating the involvement of radiation in the development of liver diseases are consistent with the report of increased mortality from liver cirrhosis with radiation dose in the LSS cohort. An effect of age at exposure was detected for nonmalignant thyroid disease (P = 0.02), with an increased risk for those exposed who were under 20 years of age, but not for older survivors. Thus the AHS data suggest that thyroid glands in the young are more radiosensitive not only to the development of malignancies, but also to the development of nonmalignant disorders as well. The findings hold independently of the dose effects observed for thyroid cancer. This study also shows that for the period 1958-1986 new occurrences of lens opacity are not increased with radiation dose (P = 0.39) in the AHS subjects.",Included
4714,"The effect of pre-phototest sun exposure on minimal erythema dose and minimal melanogenic dose among skin phototypes III, IV and V. Background: Ethnicity, skin phototype and colour influenced minimal erythema dose (MED). Sun exposure has been postulated to increase MED. We determined immediate pigment darkening dose to UVA (IPDDA), MED and minimal melanogenic dose (MMD) for UVB and UVA, and investigated factors affecting these doses. Method(s): Skin phototype was determined using Fitzpatrick phototype quiz, DSMII ColorMeter measured skin colours, sun exposure quantified using an index (SEI) and phototest performed with MEDlight-Multitester. Result(s): A total of 167 healthy volunteers participated. There were 110 (66%) females and 56 (34%) males; 124 (74.7%) were Malay, 27 (16.3%) Chinese and 14 (8.4%) Indians. One hundred and nine (65.7%) skin phototype IV, 30 (18.1%) phototype III and 27 (16.3%) phototype V. IPDDA ranges from 6 +/- 1.5-5.7 +/- 1.4 J/cm2. MED-UVB were 96.9 +/- 17.6, 124 +/- 29.3 and 118.6 +/- 27.4 mJ/cm2 for phototype III, IV and V, respectively. All MED-UVA were outside the tested dose range of 3.6-11 J/cm2. MMD-UVB were 106 +/- 18.2, 134 +/- 25.6 and 136 +/- 31.1 mJ/cm2 while MMD-UVA were 4.1 +/- 4.1, 4.9 +/- 3.8 and 5.7 +/- 3.7 J/cm2 respectively for phototypes III, IV and V. MED-UVB, MMD-UVB and MMD-UVA did not depend on skin phototype. Facultative skin whiteness (L*), erythema (E) and melanin content (M) correlated significantly with MED-UVB while constitutive skin colours were significant for L*, yellowness (b*), E and M. Sun exposure did not significantly correlate with MED-UVB and MMDs, however, an inverse relationship with MED-UVB was demonstrated. Conclusion(s): Minimal erythema doses in our cohort were slightly different from other regional countries. Constitutive and facultative skin whiteness, erythema and melanin content correlated with MED. There was no association between skin phototype and sun exposure with MED or MMD.Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Excluded
4715,"Survival Impact of Cardiac Dose Following Lung Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy. Heart dose has been emerging as a strong predictor of outcomes in radiation therapy treatment for lung cancer. It is necessary to determine the impact of dose to substructures of the heart on overall survival. Heart substructures were contoured retrospectively on 189 patients treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy. Clinical variables and the dose to these structures were correlated with non-cancer-related deaths. Higher bilateral ventricles max dose is associated with poorer survival. Heart dose parameters should be considered when planning patients for stereotactic body radiotherapy. Introduction: The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of radiation dose to substructures of the heart in lung stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) patients on non-cancer-related deaths. Method(s): Patients treated with lung SBRT at a single institution from 2005 to 2013 were included. The heart and its substructures were contoured, and dose was calculated including mean, max, and max 10 cc dose. Clinical variables including stage, histology, age, gender, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), preexisting cardiac disease, pulmonary function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second, diffusion capacity), and smoking status were explored for association with non-cancer-related deaths in univariable (UVA) and multivariable (MVA) analyses. Heart dosimetric parameters were correlated with the risk of radiation pneumonitis (RP) using UVA and MVA. Result(s): A total of 189 patients were included with median age of 76 years (range, 48-93 years). Of these patients, 45.5% were female, 27.5% were T2, 16.9% were current smokers, 64% had preexisting cardiac risk factors, and 34.5% had CCI score of >= 3. Mean lung dose +/- SD was 456 +/- 231 cGy. Heart max, mean, and 10 cc doses were 1867 +/- 1712 cGy, 265 +/- 269 cGy, and 1150 +/- 1075 cGy, respectively. There were 14 (7.4%) >= Grade 2 RP and 3 (1.6%) were >= Grade 3. The median overall survival was 37.3 months (95% confidence interval, 29.8-45.3 months). On UVA, female gender (P <.01), higher Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (P =.01), cardiac risk (P <.01), CCI (P <.01), and bilateral ventricles max dose (P =.02) were associated with non-cancer-related deaths; on MVA, bilateral ventricles max dose was significant (P =.05). No heart parameters were associated with RP. Conclusion(s): Higher bilateral ventricles max dose is associated with poorer survival. Heart dose parameters should be considered when planning patients for SBRT.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
4716,"Assessing Sensorimotor Function Following ISS with Computerized Dynamic Posturography. INTRODUCTION: Postflight postural ataxia reflects both the control strategies adopted for movement in microgravity and the direct effects of deconditioning. Computerized dynamic posturography (CDP) has been used during the first decade of the International Space Station (ISS) expeditions to quantify the initial postflight decrements and recovery of postural stability., METHODS: The CDP data were obtained on 37 crewmembers as part of their pre- and postflight medical examinations. Sensory organization tests evaluated the ability to make effective use of (or suppress inappropriate) visual, vestibular, and somatosensory information for balance control. This report focuses on eyes closed conditions with either a fixed or sway-referenced base of support, with the head erect or during pitch-head tilts (+/- 20degree at 0.33 Hz). Equilibrium scores were derived from peak-to-peak anterior-posterior sway. Motor-control tests were also used to evaluate a crewmember's ability to automatically recover from unexpected support-surface perturbations., RESULTS: The standard Romberg condition was the least sensitive. Dynamic head tilts led to increased incidence of falls and revealed significantly longer recovery than head-erect conditions. Improvements in postflight postural performance during the later expeditions may be attributable to higher preflight baselines and/or advanced exercise capabilities aboard the ISS., CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic assessment of postural instability is more pronounced during unstable-support conditions requiring active head movements. In addition to supporting return-to-duty decisions by flight surgeons, the CDP provides a standardized sensorimotor measure that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of countermeasures designed to either minimize deconditioning on orbit or promote reconditioning upon return to Earth.",Excluded

4718,"Radioiodide (131I) therapy for the treatment of canine thyroid carcinoma. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of radioactive iodine treatment (131I) for canine thyroid carcinoma, as both the sole therapeutic modality and as an adjunct to surgery. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of case records from the Gladesville Veterinary Hospital Nuclear Medicine Service, Sydney, between August 1988 and December 2001. CASE DETAILS: The records of 65 dogs with thyroid carcinoma were analysed according to therapy and outcome. Forty-three dogs received radioiodide therapy, either as the sole therapeutic modality (32) or as an adjunct to surgery (11). Radioisotope therapy consisted of one to three doses of 131I with a dose range of 555 to 1850 MBq. For analysis, dogs were divided into groups according to therapy: no treatment, surgery alone, surgery with radioiodide therapy or radioiodide therapy alone. Mode of therapy, dosage of 131I, clinical staging and age were all independently analysed according to survival to compare efficacy or predictive value respectively. RESULT(S): When radioiodide therapy was used as an adjunct to surgery, median survival was 34 months. Censored median survival time for dogs that received radioiodide alone was 30 months. Dogs that did not receive treatment had a median survival of only 3 months. Log rank statistical analysis indicated that mode of therapy was significantly correlated with survival but that clinical stage of disease was not. CONCLUSION(S): The authors conclude that 131I therapy is effective at extending survival time, both as a sole therapeutic modality and as an adjunct to surgery, in dogs with invasive canine thyroid carcinoma. Incomplete surgical resection may not prolong survival in dogs also receiving 131I therapy, however surgical resection with curative intent should be recommended as the first line of therapy for mobile thyroid carcinomas. Radioisotope therapy can be recommended for cases where surgery alone is considered unlikely to be curative because of metastatic disease or local invasion, or for cases where surgery has been attempted but complete surgical removal has not been achieved.",Excluded

Background The aim of this trial was to determine feasibility of incorporating bevacizumab (B) into concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients and Methods Patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC, performance status of 0 to 1, and adequate organ function were accrued in 2 strata, low- and high-risk (squamous histology, hemoptysis, tumor with cavitation and/or adjacent to a major vessel). Cohort 1 patients received cisplatin 50 mg/m2 days (d) 1 and 8, etoposide 50 mg/m2 (d 1-5) for 2 cycles concurrent with radiotherapy (64.8 Gy) followed by docetaxel (D) 75 mg/m2 and B 15 mg/kg for 3 cycles. If safety was established, then accrual would continue to cohort 2 (B, d 15, 36, 57) and then subsequently to cohort 3 (B, d 1, 22, 43). Results Twenty-nine patients (17 low- and 12 high-risk) registered to cohort 1. Twenty-six patients (including 4 squamous, 1 adenosquamous) were assessable. Twenty-five completed CRT. Grade 3/4 toxicities during CRT included acceptable rates of hematologic toxicity, esophagitis, and pneumonitis. Of 21 assessable for safety with D/B consolidation, major adverse events were pneumonitis (2 Grade 3) and 2 episodes of fatal hemoptysis in the high-risk group, resulting in closure of this stratum. The low-risk stratum subsequently closed because of slow accrual. Median overall survival was 46 months for low-risk and 17 months for high-risk strata. Conclusion Bevacizumab was not safely integrated into CRT for stage III NSCLC in patients considered at high risk for hemoptysis. In lower risk patients, data are insufficient to determine safety or efficacy.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

The analysis of radiotherapy effectiveness as a treatment modality for periarthritis humeroscapularis (PHS) Material and method. 30 patients irradiated because of PHS (1 Gy per fraction up to 6 Gy). Follow-up ranged from 1 to 216 months. The arm mobility and pain relief were assessed at the completion of radiotherapy and during follow-up examinations. Correlation between some biological factors evaluated before radiotherapy and the aforementioned endpoints was assessed using Spearman's test. Results. The mean degree of pain relief ranged from 42% to 93%. Mean improvement of arm abduction, flexion and reflexion angles ranged from 24degree to 83degree, from 47degree to 91degree and from 4degree to 13degree, respectively. The sole prognostic factor found in this study was the degree of orthopedic disability before the treatment. Small impairment at the onset correlated with significant improvement after radiotherapy. No radiation toxicity or secondary malignancies were observed. Conclusion. Radiotherapy of PHS is an effective, safe and economical treatment modality, which could form an alternative for standard orthopedic and pharmacological treatment in recurrent or persistent disease.",Excluded

Intraerythrocytic forms of B. bovis were exposed to 350 Grays (Gy) gamma irradiation and were then injected intravenously into intact two and three year old Hereford steers. One of 15 steers died on initial infection and subsequently six steers were given a virulent heterologous challenge three weeks after recovery; all six animals were highly immune. The remaining eight animals were kept under quarantine conditions for 10 months and were then challenged with a different virulent heterologous strain of B. bovis.

All showed only mild transient clinical signs. After 12 months quarantine in a tick-free area these animals were then challenged with a virulent heterologous strain and all 12 were shown to be highly immune. Irradiation reduced the infective dose from 1 X 10(8) to 2.5 X 10(3) parasites. These parasites multiplied at the same rate, and achieved the same maximum parasitaemia as the parent non-irradiated strain, but the disease produced by them was not severe.

Objectives: To investigate the safety and efficacy of a stent combined with a linear strand of 125I seeds to treat malignant cancer-associated venous obstruction. Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed the data of 57 patients with malignant cancer-associated venous obstruction. Nineteen patients underwent the placement of a stent combined with a linear strand of 125I seeds (group A), and 38 patients underwent the placement of a bare stent (group B). The following parameters were compared between the 2 groups of patients: symptom relief rate, duration of venous patency, survival time, quality of life, and adverse events. Result(s): A total of 34 stents and 527 seeds were implanted in group A, while a total of 57 stents were implanted in group B. The surgery success rate was 96.5%, and no serious complication related to the surgery was reported. Symptoms of venous obstruction improved significantly after surgery. The score of group A decreased from 14.74 +/- 0.562 points before surgery to 2.79 +/- 1.357 points after surgery(P <.001), and the score of group B decreased from 13.79 +/- 1.398 points before surgery to 5.55 +/- 3.674 points after surgery (P <.001). The patency rate of group A was significantly higher than that of group B at 1 to 6 months after surgery (100%, 84.2%, 68.4%, 63.2%, 36.8%, 21.1% vs 68.4%, 23.7%, 18.4%, 7.9%, 5.3%, 2.6%, respectively; P <.05). Before treatment, there was no statistically significant difference in the Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score between the groups (P =.791). After 1 to 6 months of treatment, the KPS score was significantly higher in group A than in group B (P =.013). The median patency duration in groups A and B was 125 days (95% CI: 80.018-169.982) and 35 days (95% CI: 20.501-49.499), respectively (P <.001). The median survival time of group A was 155 days (95% CI: 110.406-199.594), and that of group B was 98 days (95% CI: 55.712-140.288; P =.325). Multivariate analysis showed that the implantation of a stent combined with a linear strand of 125I seeds and the KPS score (>=80 points) were independent factors of long-term patency after stent placement. Conclusion(s): The placement of a stent combined with a linear strand of 125I seeds is a safe and effective treatment for venous obstruction caused by malignant tumors. This treatment provides prolonged patency compared with the placement of bare stent, and while it does not significantly improve the survival time of patients, it can improve their quality of life.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: To explore the corridor for atlas pedicle screw placement perpendicular to the coronal plane and to develop patient-specific navigation templates for pedicle screw placement., METHODS: This study is a retrospective analysis. A total of 71 patients (41 males and 30 females) were involved in this study from June 2016 to June 2018, and they were divided into a template group (39 patients) and a conventional group (32 patients). The CT-based 3D reconstruction models were analyzed in the template group. From the perspective of the 3D atlas in a coronal view, the pedicle corridor was obtained. Taking the center of the tangential circle of the pedicle as the entry point, we simulated screw placement perpendicular to the coronal plane. Then, the individual navigation template was designed and used in surgery. In the conventional group, free-hand pedicle screw placement was performed perpendicular to the coronal plane. The diameter of the maximum tangential circle and screw length of the pedicle corridor were measured in the template group. The surgical time, radiation exposure time, screw grading criteria and so on were evaluated and compared between the two groups after surgery., RESULTS: ;The diameter of the maximum tangential circle and the distance between the entry point and posterior tubercle were significantly greater in males than in females. The operation was successfully completed in all patients, without aggravation of nerve injury, and the follow-up was 12-20 months, with an average of 15.6 months. A total of 78 screws were inserted in the template group, and 64 screws were inserted in the conventional group. The surgical times in the template group and conventional group were 76.47+/-24.44 min and 125.63+/-36.41 min, respectively. The radiation exposure times in the template group and conventional group were 3.51+/-1.77 and 10.15+/-4.95, respectively, and there was a significant difference between the two groups. In the template group, the deviation in the screw entry point and screw angle were 1.92+/-1.67 mm and 2.08+/-1.98degree, respectively. The medial angle deviation between the left and right sides was 2.71+/-1.88degree in the template group, which was significantly less than the deviation of 3.76+/-2.22degree in the conventional group., CONCLUSION: A pedicle screw trajectory perpendicular to the coronal plane can be quickly obtained based on the perspective of 3D models. The technique of screw placement perpendicular to the coronal plane assisted by navigation templates has a shorter operative time, lessintraoperative fluoroscopy and a higher safety of screw placement than traditional surgery.",Excluded

Patients and Methods: Patients with stage II/III rectal cancer were enrolled on a phase I study with 33 study design, with an expansion cohort of 9 patients at the MTD. Following a 5-day trametinib lead-in, with pre- and posttreatment tumor biopsies, patients received trametinib and CRT, surgery, and adjuvant chemotherapy. Trametinib was given orally daily at 3 dose levels: 0.5 mg, 1 mg, and 2 mg. CRT consisted of infusional 5-FU 225 mg/m2/day and radiation dose of 28 daily fractions of 1.8 Gy (total 50.4 Gy). The primary endpoint was to identify the MTD and recommended phase II dose. IHC staining for phosphorylated ERK (pERK) and genomic profiling was performed on the tumor samples. Result(s): Patients were enrolled to all dose levels, and 18 patients were evaluable for toxicities and responses. Treatment was well tolerated, and there was one dose-limiting toxicity of diarrhea, which was attributed to CRT rather than trametinib. At the 2 mg dose level, 25% had pathologic complete response. IHC staining confirmed dose-dependent decrease in pERK with increasing trametinib doses. Conclusion(s): The combination of trametinib with 5-FU CRT is safe and well tolerated, and may warrant additional study in a phase II trial, perhaps in a RAS/RAF-mutant selected population.Copyright © 2020 American Association for Cancer Research.",Excluded
4726,"An optimized test bolus for computed tomography pulmonary angiography and its application at 80kV with 10ml contrast agent. Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is usually used for pulmonary embolism (PE) detection. However, the determination of scan timing remains a challenge due to the short scan duration of CTPA. We aimed to develop an optimized test bolus to determine scan delay in CTPA. The time-enhancement curves were obtained by measuring the enhancement within a region of interest in the main pulmonary artery and vein. A total of 70 patients were randomly divided into two groups (n=35 each): the control group underwent CTPA using the test bolus approach and the test group underwent CTPA using the biphasic time-enhancement curves approach. Tube voltages of 100 kVp and 80 kVp and 20ml and 10ml contrast agent were adopted in the control and test groups, respectively. The CT numbers, image quality, PE detection was evaluated. There was a point of intersection between the pulmonary artery and vein test bolus enhancement curves. The scan delay time (TDELAY) was obtained based on the time at intersection (TCROSS) and the scan duration (TSD): TDELAY=TCROSS - TSD. The mean CT numbers for pulmonary vein in the control were higher than those in the test group (all p<0.001). The image quality for the pulmonary arteries in the test group was better than that in the control group (p<0.01), with artifact reduction in the superior vena cava. Segmental PE could be detected using the optimized protocol. The radiation dose and iodine load in the test group were all lower than those in the control (p<0.01). We established an approach to calculate the scan delay of CTPA, and this approach could be used for CTPA at 80 kVp with 10ml contrast agent.",Excluded
4727,"Design of a motion simulation system to assist respiratory gating for radiation therapy. Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) aims to deliver high doses of radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors in less than or equal to 6 fractions. However, organ motion during treatment is a challenging issue for this kind of technique. We develop a control system via Bluetooth technology to simulate and correct body motion during SABR. Method(s): Radiation doses were analyzed, and the radiation damage protection capability was checked by external beam therapy 3 (EBT3) films irradiated by a linear accelerator. A wireless signal test was also performed. A validation was performed with 8 previously treated patient respiratory pattern records and 8 healthy volunteers. Result(s): The homemade simulation system consisted of 2 linear actuators, one movable stage with a maximal moving distance of 6.5 cm x 12.5 cm x 5 cm to simulate the respiratory pattern of 8 patients precisely with a median error of 0.36 mm and a maximal motion difference of 1.17 mm, and 3.17 and chipset transited signals to display them as a waveform. From the test with 8 volunteers, the chip could detect deep respiratory movement up to 3 cm. The effect of the chip on a radiation dose of 400 monitor units (MUs) by 6 MV photons and 200 MUs by 10 MV photons showed high penetration rates of 98.8% and 98.6%, respectively. Conclusion(s): We invented a tubeless and wireless respiratory gating detection chip. The chip has minimal interference with the treatment angles, good noise immunity and the capability to easily penetrate a variety of materials. The simulation system consisting of linear actuators also successfully simulates the respiratory pattern of real patients.Copyright © 2021 American Association of Medical Dosimetrists",Excluded
4728,"Systematic evaluation of salivary gland damage following I-131 therapy in differentiated thyroid cancer patients by quantitative scintigraphy and clinical follow-up. Objectives Radioiodine therapy is a common adjunct to thyroidectomy in papillary thyroid cancer treatment. However, a variety of associated adverse effects have been reported. In this study, we assessed radioiodine-induced salivary gland dysfunction using quantitative scintigraphy, and evaluated the associated complications. Methods Patients were divided into five groups on the basis of the cumulative I-131 dosage received. Scintigraphic dynamic images of the salivary glands were obtained and converted into clinically relevant parameters: uptake index (UI), maximum secretion rate (%SR), and combined gland function scores. Patients were followed up for 3-66 months and interviewed for side effects including xerostomia, taste alteration, bitter taste, dental caries, xerophthalmia, and pain/swelling. Results An increase in I-131 doses resulted in a reduction in the UI and %SR and an increase in the combined scintigraphy score. Parotid glands were more affected than submandibular glands. A cumulative dosage of greater than 600 mCi resulted in complete loss of %SR in the parotid glands. No significant difference in either the UI or the %SR was observed between nontreated patients and patients receiving an I-131 dosage of up to 150 mCi. The occurrence of xerostomia was significantly correlated with the gland scintigraphic score, the number of treatment cycles, and I-131 dosage. The occurrence of pain and swelling was extremely low and only lasted for a short time. Conclusion Although the side effects associated with radioiodine treatment were apparent, they were usually small and temporary. Nevertheless, more consideration should be placed on careful dosing of I-131.Copyright © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
4729,"Treatment and prognosis of brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer: A retrospective study. Background and objective: Now the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with brain metastasis is not a standard program. The aim of this study is to summarize the factors related to survival of patients with brain metastases from NSCLC. Method(s): A total of 111 NSCLC patients with brain metastases (from September 1995-May 2004) were defined as symptomatic group (37 patients) and asymptomatic group (74 patients) according to central nervous system (CNS) symptoms. The patients in the symptomatic group were given whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT, DT 30-40 Gy/20 f) first, and then received cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The patients in the asymptomatic group were given cisplatin-based chemotherapy first, and then received WBRT. During the treatment, 49 patients received chemotherapy of BCNU or VM-26 irregularly. Result(s): The median survival time was 11 months. The 1- and 2-year survival rate was 40.79% and 13.26% respectively. The survival time was not significantly different between the symptomatic group and asymptomatic group. Median chemotherapy of asymptomatic group was 3 cycles (1-6 cycles) before WBRT. Those patients who received 3 or 4 cycles of chemotherapy before WBRT had better survival (P = 0.0188, P = 0.0035). The treatment of BCNU or VM-26 was a benefit factor for survival (P = 0.0219) in asymptomatic group. The hematologic toxicity of grade III or IV was not significantly different between the two groups (P>0.05). The number of brain metastasis (P = 0.000), extracranial metastasis (P = 0.022) and WHO performance status (P = 0.001) were independent prognostic factors. Conclusion(s): The patients with asymptomatic brain metastases receive 3-4 cycles of chemotherapy before WBRT may be reasonable. During the therapy, the patients with administration of BCNU or VM-26 may have survival benefit.",Excluded
4730,"Role of Angiogenesis in Chronic Radiation Proctitis: New Evidence Favoring Inhibition of Angiogenesis Ex Vivo. Background: Chronic radiation proctitis (CRP), a common complication after radiotherapy for pelvic malignancies, compromises patient quality of life. Vascular damage and aberrant angiogenesis in the mucosal layer are essential histological features, but changes to the submucosal layer are unclear. Thus, we evaluated the histological characteristics and distribution changes of key angiogenic factors in full-layered human CRP samples. Method(s): Thirty paraffin-embedded CRP and twenty-nine non-CRP tissues were used to evaluate histopathological changes. Immunohistochemistry with anti-CD34 antibody was performed to calculate microvascular density (MVD). Frozen tissues from eight CRP patients and five non-CRP controls were collected and analyzed by antibody array, which contained sixty human angiogenesis-related factors. Quality controls with positive and negative controls were performed during antibody array analysis. Two differentially expressed factors were confirmed by ELISA. Result(s): CRP lesions showed vasculopathy, fibrosis, mucosal ulceration, edema, and inflammatory cell infiltration. Human angiogenesis antibody array and ELISA confirmed the increased angiostatin in CRP lesions. Immunohistochemical staining showed dispersed distribution of angiostatin throughout the mucosal and submucosal layers in CRP lesions, while angiostatin accumulated within the vessel lumens in non-CRP tissues. MVD significantly decreased in the submucosal layer of CRP, suggesting a potential association with increased angiostatin. Conclusion(s): Angiostatin increased and had a distinct distribution in CRP lesions. Compensatory telangiectasia in the mucosa, vessel stenosis, and reduced MVD might attenuate blood flow in the submucosa and contribute to CRP progression. Restoration of vascular functionality by promoting angiogenesis in the submucosal layer may help alleviate CRP in clinical practice.Copyright © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Excluded
4731,"Identification of ERp29 as a biomarker for predicting nasopharyngeal carcinoma response to radiotherapy. Radioresistance continues to be a major problem in the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). This study aimed to identify novel proteins associated with NPC radio-resistance. We used a mass spectrometry driven-proteomic strategy to identify novel proteins associated with NPC radio-resistance, and differential proteins were subsequently processed by bio-informatic analysis. As a result, twelve proteins were identified with aberrant expression in radioresistant (RR) NPC tissues compare to radiosensitive (RS) NPC tissues. Among these proteins, ERp29, Mn-SOD, HSP27 and GST omega1 were found to be significantly up-regulated in RR NPC tissues, and ERp29 was selected for further validation. Immunohistochemistry analysis confirmed that ERp29 was overexpressed in RR NPC tissues compared with RS NPC tissues. To prove the role of ERp29 in the induction of NPC radioresistance, ERp29 was down-regulated in the ERp29 enriched NPC cells CNE-1 and 6-10B by specific shRNA. Radiosensitivity was measured using cell proliferation assay and clonogenic survival assay, and cell apoptosis was measured using flow cytometric analysis. We found that ERp29 knockdown attenuated CNE-1 and 6-10B cell radioresistance and enhanced cell apoptosis. These results suggest that ERp29 associates with radioresistance in NPC, and ERp29 could be a potential biomarker for predicting NPC response to radiotherapy.",Included

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of 2.45 GHz microwave (MW) radiation on dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced colon cancer in mice. The subjects were 115 Balb/c mice 4 weeks of age. The animals were divided into group A (control), group B (DMH), group C (DMH+MW), and group D [DMH + 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate (TPA)]. Radiation (10 mW/cm2) was delivered dorsally with the E field parallel to the mouse's long body axis in an anechoic chamber. Radiations were administered 3 hr daily, 6 days per week, over a period of 5 months. The average SAR was estimated to be 10-12 W/kg. During the course of radiation treatments, DMH was injected once per week. The tumor promoter TPA was administered once per week for 10 weeks, from the third week on, after the initial treatment. The incidence of tumors did not significantly differ between the three test groups (groups B, C, and D; P > 0.25). However, the number of tumors, the size of the tumors, and the incidence of protuberant and infiltrative types in tumor-bearing animals were higher in group D compared to groups B and C (P < 0.05). No difference was found between groups B and C (P > 0.25). The study indicates that 2.45 GHz microwave radiation at 10 mW/cm2 power density did not promote DMH-induced colon cancers in young mice. The study also showed that TPA could accelerate colon tumor production if a tumor was initiated.",Excluded

We examined the association between citrus consumption and subsequent incident malignant melanoma among participants in the Nurses' Health Study (1984-2010) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1986-2010). Among 105,437 participants over 2 million person-years of follow-up, we documented 1857 incident melanomas. The pooled multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio for melanoma comparing the extreme total citrus consumption categories (1.5 or more serving per day vs. less than twice per week) was 1.30 (95 confidence interval [CI], 1.08 to 1.57) (P=0.003 for trend). Grapefruit and orange juice were two individual citrus products that showed significant associations with risk of melanoma. The pooled multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios for melanoma were 1.41 (95% CI, 1.09 to 1.82) comparing the extreme consumption categories of grapefruit (three times or more per week vs. never, P=0.004 for trend) and 1.26 (95% CI, 1.02 to 1.56) comparing the extreme consumption categories of orange juice (once or more per day vs. never, P=0.001 for trend). Significant positive associations between citrus consumption and risk of melanoma were also observed for invasive melanoma and melanoma that occurred on the head, neck and extremities, and among participants who spent more time in direct sunlight since high school and resided in areas with higher solar ultraviolet radiation in the US. In conclusion, we found that consumption of grapefruit and orange juice was positively associated with risk of malignant melanoma among US women and men.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of bone cement distribution, cement leakage, and clinical outcomes with side-opening cannula for bone cement injection in percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) in treatment of Kummell disease., METHODS: A prospective study of patients with Kummell disease undergoing PVP was conducted from April 2012 to September 2017. In total, 43 patients (11 males, 32 females) with Kummell disease who received bilateral PVP were included in the study. The patients were divided into front-opening cannulas (FOC) group with front-opening cannulas and side-opening cannulas (SOC) group with side-opening cannulas. All patients were followed up for 6 months. The patient general information such as gender, age, bone density, compression ratio, operative time, and location of fracture vertebrae were recorded. Visual analogue scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), bone cement distribution, radiation exposure time, bone cement leakage rate and vertebral height, and kyphosis angle were measured and compared for two groups before surgery, 1 day and 6 months after surgery., RESULTS: A total of 43 patients were enrolled, including 11 males and 32 females, aged 61-84 years. The bone density (T value) was 2.5 +/- 0.6 in FOC group and 2.4 +/- 0.6 in SOC group (P > 0.05). The compression ratio and operative time were 36.1% +/- 13.0%, 39.3 +/- 7.9 min in FOC group and 35.2% +/- 13.7%, 40.0 +/- 10.7 min in SOC group (P > 0.05). There was no significance between FOC and SOC groups in the location of fracture vertebrae. All patients underwent at least 6 months of follow-up. At 6 months postoperatively, the VAS and ODI were significantly higher in the FOC group (3.0 +/- 0.8, 35.7% +/- 2.1%) than in the SOC group (1.3 +/- 0.4, 18.6% +/- 2.4%) (P < 0.05). The cement leakage rate of the SOC group was 4.8%, which was lower than that of the FOC group (31.8%, P < 0.05), and the bone cement distribution ratio was higher than that of the FOC group (63.1% +/- 7.9% vs 40.5% +/- 8.6%, P < 0.05). At 6 months after operation, the height of the anterior and posterior vertebral bodies of the patients in the SOC group restored better than the FOC group (anterior SOC: FOC 5.1 +/- 0.5 mm vs 4.5 +/- 0.5 mm; posterior SOC: FOC 0.6 +/- 0.1 mm vs 0.3 +/- 0.1 mm, P < 0.05), and the kyphosis correction was more obvious than patients in FOC group (SOC: FOC 8.5degree +/- 1.4degree vs 4.6degree +/- 0.8degree, P < 0.05)., CONCLUSION: Percutaneous vertebroplasty with side-opening cannula is safe and effective in avoiding bone cement leakage, improving bone cement distribution, and restoring vertebral height.

4735,"Parotid dysfunction after various methods of radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the radiation induced parotid dysfunction in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients who had received different methods of radiotherapy. METHOD(S): From January 1996 to January 2000, 380 NPC patients were divided into conventional fraction (CF-175 patients), late-course accelerated hyperfractionation (LCAF-63 patients) and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT-142 patients) groups. Conventional radiotherapy was given with a total dose of 70 Gy. Patients in the LCAF group were treated with the same fractionation as CF group until the dose of 36 - 40 Gy, then followed by LCAF radiotherapy to a total dose of 75 Gy. IMRT in the form of full-course was given to a total dose of 72 Gy. Acute parotiditis was observed during the treatment. The parotid secretory function was examined 2 years after radiotherapy. RESULT(S): The dose of parotid in IMRT was much lower than those in the other 2 groups. Extreme damage rates of parotid secretory function in CF, LCAF and IMRT groups were 81.7%, 81.0% and 69.7% (P < 0.05); acute parotiditis rates were 23.4%, 20.4% and 41.3% respectively, with the differences among the 3 groups significant (P < 0.05).

Purpose/Objective(s): To compare the effectiveness of transoral endoscopic laser microsurgery (TLM) and concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) in the management of T2N0 laryngeal cancer. Materials/Methods: This retrospective review enrolled 43 consecutive patients with T2N0 larynx cancer treated with definitive TLM (n = 25) or CCRT (n = 18) between 2005 and 2012. The tumor was located in the supraglottis in 9 patients, glottis in 31 patients, and subglottis in 3 patients. The mean cumulative radiation doses were 70 Gy for CCRT group and Cisplatin-based concurrent chemotherapies were the most commonly used regimens. Oncological outcomes were evaluated using local control (LC), regional control (RC), larynx preservation survival (LPS), disease free survival (DFS), cancer specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS). Result(s): The median follow-up time was 3.93 years for the survivors. Patients' characteristics between two groups had no statistically significant difference. The 5-year LRC rate for CCRT group was 94.4% significantly higher than the 64.1% for TLM group (p = 0.030). The 5-year DFS rate for CCRT group was significantly improved (78.5% vs 56.5%, p=0.040). There was no significant difference in LPS, CSS, and OS. The most significant risk factor for tumor recurrence was subglottic invasion with significantly poor 5-year LRC rate (50.9% vs 92.7%, p = 0.003). On multivariate analysis, subglottic invasion was the only significant factor predicting recurrence after definitive treatment. Conclusion(s): TLM and CCRT are both effective in terms of larynx preservation survival rate for T2N0 larynx cancer. However, CCRT may improve the local regional control and disease free survival rate. Tumor with subglottic invasion carries poor prognostic value for tumor control, further adjuvant therapy may be considered.",Excluded

Background: CD4+ T cells DNA hypomethylation is involved in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Recent studies showed that ultraviolet B (UVB, 290-320. nm) might induce the exacerbation of SLE by decreasing the DNA methylation level. However, the role of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) in the UVB-induced CD4+ T cells DNA hypomethylation remains unclear. Objective(s): To elucidate the role of DNMT1 in lupus CD4+ T cells global DNA hypomethylation enhanced by UVB. Method(s): 35 SLE patients and 15 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. CD4+ T cells from SLE patients and healthy controls exposed to different dosages of UVB were analyzed. The global DNA methylation measurement, real-time PCR, Western blotting and DNMT1 catalytic activity detection were employed. Result(s): The level of global DNA methylation and DNMT1 mRNA expression in CD4+ T cells from SLE patients were significantly lower than those from the control group. DNA methylation was decreased after UVB exposure in a dosage-dependent manner in SLE patients, but not in the control group. DNMT1 mRNA and protein expression level were not affected by UVB exposure in both SLE patients and healthy controls. DNMT1 catalytic activity was significantly decreased in CD4+ T cells from SLE patients after UVB exposure in a dosage-dependent manner.

BACKGROUND: To report acute and late toxicity with long-term follow-up, and to describe our experiences with pulmonary dose constraints., METHODS: Between 2002 and 2009, 150 patients with 155 histologically/cytologically proven non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; tumor stages II, IIIA, IIIB in 6, 55 and 39%, respectively) received the following median doses: primary tumors 79.2 Gy (range 72.0-90.0 Gy), lymph node metastases 59.4 Gy (54.0-73.8 Gy), nodes electively 45 Gy; with fractional doses of 1.8 Gy twice daily (bid). In all, 86% of patients received 2 cycles of chemotherapy previously., RESULTS: Five treatment-related deaths occurred: pneumonitis, n = 1; progressive pulmonary fibrosis in patients with pre-existing pulmonary fibrosis, n = 2; haemorrhage, n = 2. In all, 8% of patients experienced grade 3 and 1.3% grade 4 pneumonitis; 11% showed late fibrotic alterations grade 2 in lung parenchyma. Clinically relevant acute esophagitis (grade 2 and 3) was seen in 33.3% of patients, 2 patients developed late esophageal stenosis (G3). Patients with upper lobe, middle lobe and central lower lobe tumours (n = 130) were treated with V20 (total lung) up to 50% and patients with peripheral lower lobe tumours (n = 14, basal lateral tumours excluded) up to 42%, without observing acute or late pulmonary toxicity >grade 3. Only patients with basal lateral lower lobe tumours (n = 5) experienced grade 4/5 pulmonary toxicity; V20 for this latter group ranged between 30 and 53%. The mean lung dose was below the QUANTEC recommendation of 20-23 Gy in all patients. The median follow-up time of all patients is 26.3 months (range 2.9-149.4) and of patients alive 80.2 months (range 63.9-149.4.). The median overall survival time of all patients is 26.3 months; the 2-, 5- and 8-year survival rates of 54, 21 and 15%, respectively. The local tumour control rate at 2 and 5 years is 70 and 64%, the regional control rate 90 and 88%, respectively., DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Grade 4 or 5 toxicity occurred in 7/150 patients (4.7%), which can be partially avoided in the future (e.g. by excluding patients with pre-existing pulmonary fibrosis). Tolerance and oncologic outcome compare favourably to concomitant chemoradiation also in long-term follow-up.",Excluded

Patients had high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors such as dyslipidemia (91%), hypertension (93%) diabetes (48%), prior PCI (61%), and prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery (47%). The target CTO lesions often had proximal cap ambiguity (54%), moderate/severe calcification (73%), moderate/severe tortuosity (63%), and high J-CTO score (mean 3.2 +/- 1.1). The technical and procedural success of subsequent CTO PCI were high (83% for both) with an acceptable rate of in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular events (3.3%). Technical and procedural success were higher for repeat attempts that were performed >=60 days after the index CTO PCI (94% vs. 69%, p =.015). Median (interquartile range) subsequent procedure time was 147 (100, 215) min, contrast volume was 185 (150, 260) ml, and air kerma radiation dose was 2.5 (1.4, 4.2) Gray. Conclusion(s): Repeat CTO PCI attempts after SPM are associated with high likelihood for successful revascularization with acceptable risks.Copyright © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
4743,"'Glowing in the dark': A study of radiation received by desmoid patients undergoing multiple CT scans. Aim: Patients with FAP related intra-abdominal desmoid disease undergo multiple CT scans of abdomen, pelvis, and sometimes chest to monitor the response to treatment and assess the possibility of recurrent or new tumors. CT is generally preferred to MRI because of the better quality and more easily interpretable images. However there is concern about the cumulative dose of radiation associated with multiple CT scans. This retrospective study, was performed to assess the radiation exposure of FAP desmoid patients related to CT scans Method: Patients with intra-abdominal desmoid disease related to FAP managed in our department were accessed. The number of abdominal/ pelvic and chest CTs from the time of desmoid diagnosis to the last imaging follow-up was totaled. When available, the radiation dose was obtained, when not, an average dose was applied. Patient demographics and the worst stage of the desmoid disease were noted. In this study we report only the 22 patients with more than 13 CT scans over the time of follow-up Results: There were 22 patients 7 men and 15 women, with a mean age at desmoids diagnosis of 28.4 +/- 1.0 years. Three desmoids were Stage II, 7 were stage III and 12 were stage IV. Mean follow-up was 111 months (median 107, range 34-215). The mean total number of abdominal/pelvic CT scans was 28 (median 31, range 14-42) and chest CT scans was 4.8 (median 3.5, range 0-18). The mean frequency of scans was every 4.5 months (median 3.9, range every 1 month to every 12 months). The mean cumulative dose of radiation associated with abdominal/pelvic CTs was 491 mGy*cm, equivalent to 491 mSv (0.491Sv). The highest dose in a patient with a stage IV desmoid receiving 42 CT scans over 10.5 years was 574 mSv (0.57Sv). 1 Sv is associated with a 0.055% chance of cancer. The additional dose associated with Chest CT was a mean of 265 mSv (0.26 Sv) Conclusion(s): In patients with advanced abdominal desmoid disease, the total dose of radiation accumulated over a mean of 9 years follow up is significant in terms of predisposing to cancer. This should encourage the use of alternative forms of imaging such as MRI or at least a less frequent use of CT scans.",Excluded
4744,"The protective effects of ambroxol on radiation lung injury and influence on production of transforming growth factor beta1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha. The aim of this article was to investigate the effect of ambroxol on radiation lung injury and the expression of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1), as well as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in plasma. Totally, 120 patients with locally advanced lung cancer in radiotherapy were randomized into treatment and control groups. Patients in the treatment group took ambroxol orally at a dosage of 90 mg, three times per day for 3 months from the beginning of radiotherapy. The expression of TGF-beta1 and TNF-alpha in plasma was analyzed. The clinical symptoms and lung diffusing capacity were monitored using high resolving power computed tomography. The level of TGF-beta1 in the control group was increased (11.8 +/- 5.5 ng/ml), whereas in ambroxol-treated patients, the increase was not significant (5.6 +/- 2.6 ng/ml, P < 0.001). Radiotherapy-induced elevation of TNF-alpha levels, seen in control patients, was also abolished after treatment with ambroxol (5.1 +/- 1.0 vs. 2.4 +/- 0.8 ng/ml, P < 0.001). In the treatment group, carbon monoxide diffusion capacity was not significantly decreased at 6, 12, and 18 months post-radiotherapy, compared with the control group (P < 0.05). Ambroxol decreased the expression of TGF-beta1 and TNF-alpha, and minimized the diminishment of lung diffusion capacity after radiotherapy. © 2009 Humana Press Inc.",Excluded
4745,"Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase Upregulation by Phenylephrine Reduces Radiation Injury in Submandibular Gland. PURPOSE: Radiation therapy for head and neck cancer commonly leads to radiation sialadenitis. Emerging evidence has indicated that phenylephrine pretreatment reduces radiosensitivity in the salivary gland; however, the underlying cytoprotective mechanism remains unclear. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is not only a key enzyme for the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide salvage pathway, but also a cytokine participating in cell survival, metabolism, and longevity, with a broad effect on cellular functions in physiology and pathology. However, the regulatory events of NAMPT in response to the irradiated salivary gland are unknown., METHODS AND MATERIALS: The cell viability of primary cultured submandibular gland cells was determined using the PrestoBlue assay. NAMPT expression was measured using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting in vitro and in vivo. Silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) and phosphorylated Akt protein levels were examined by Western blotting. The cellular locations of NAMPT and SIRT1 were detected by immunohistochemistry. NAMPT promoter activity was assessed using the luciferase reporter gene assay., RESULTS: NAMPT was mainly distributed in the cytoplasm of granular convoluted tubule cells and ductal cells in normal submandibular glands. mRNA and protein expression of NAMPT was downregulated after radiation but upregulated with phenylephrine pretreatment both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, the protein expression of phosphorylated Akt and SIRT1 was decreased in irradiated glands, and phenylephrine pretreatment restored the expression of both. SIRT1 was mainly located in the cell nucleus and cytoplasm in the normal submandibular gland. Phenylephrine dramatically enhanced the expression of SIRT1, which was significantly reduced by radiation. Furthermore, phenylephrine induced a marked increase of NAMPT promoter activity., CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal the regulatory mechanisms of NAMPT expression, which help to understand the mechanism of the cytoprotective role of phenylephrine on irradiated tissues.

4746,"Long-term results of concurrent chemoradiotherapy for T3/T4 locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is one of the most commonly diagnosed head and neck malignancies. This study investigated the outcome of locally advanced NPC patients on concurrent intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and chemotherapy with docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (TPF). A total of 226 patients with locally advanced NPC received IMRT, with a total dose of 65-70 Gy and concurrent chemotherapy, with 2 cycles of TPF administered during radiotherapy, between March, 2005 and March, 2007. An additional 2 to 4 cycles of chemotherapy were administered every 21 days following radiotherapy. With a median follow-up time of 35 months (range, 7-60), the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 81.4%, with 93.6 and 75.0% for T3 and T4 lesions, respectively, (P=0.001). The 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 50.4%, with 66.7 and 46.9% for T3 and T4 lesions, respectively (P<0.001). T-classification was a significant prognostic factor for PFS and OS. The subgroup analysis revealed that pterygopalatine fossa invasion was associated with a significantly lower 5-year PFS (P=0.001) and OS (P=0.002), foramen rotundum invasion was associated with a significantly lower 5-year PFS (P<0.001) and OS (P=0.004), foramen ovale invasion was associated with a significantly lower 5-year PFS (P=0.013) and OS (P=0.024) and foramen lacerum and cavernous sinus invasion were associated with a significantly lower 5-year PFS (P<0.001 and P<0.001, respectively). Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is an advocated regimen for patients with locally advanced NPC, since it exhibits satisfactory 5-year PFS and OS rates. Our results suggest that the estimation of invasive range may identify a subgroup of patients with a higher risk of locoregional failure who may be better candidates for this treatment strategy.",Excluded
4747,"A novel aldehyde dehydrogenase-3 activator (Alda-89) protects submandibular gland function from irradiation without accelerating tumor growth. Purpose: To determine the effect of Alda-89 (an ALDH3 activitor) on (i) the function of irradiated (radiotherapy) submandibular gland (SMG) in mice, (ii) its toxicity profile, and (iii) its effect on the growth of head and neck cancer (HNC) in vitro and in vivo. Experimental Design: Adult mice were infused with Alda-89 or vehicle before, during, and after radiotherapy. Saliva secretion was monitored weekly. Hematology, metabolic profile, and postmortem evaluation for toxicity were examined at the time of sacrifice. Alda-89 or vehicle was applied toHNCcell lines in vitro, and severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice transplanted with HNC in vivo with or without radiation; HNC growth was monitored. The ALDH3A1 and ALDH3A2 protein expression was evaluated in 89 patients with HNC and correlated to freedom from relapse (FFR) and overall survival (OS). Result(s): Alda-89 infusion significantly resulted in more whole saliva production and a higher percentage of preserved acini after radiotherapy compared with vehicle control. There was no difference in the complete blood count, metabolic profile, and major organ morphology between the Alda-89 and vehicle groups. Compared with vehicle control, Alda-89 treatment neither accelerated HNC cell proliferation in vitro, nor did it affect tumor growth in vivo with or without radiotherapy. Higher expression of ALDH3A1 orALDH3A2 was not significantly associated with worse FFR or OS in either human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive or HPV-negative group. Conclusion(s): Alda-89 preserves salivary function after radiotherapy without affecting HNC growth or causing measurable toxicity in mice. It is a promising candidate to mitigate radiotherapy-related xerostomia. © 2013 American Association for Cancer Research.",Excluded
4748,"Single-nucleotide polymorphisms of TGFbeta1 and ATM associated with radiation-induced pneumonitis: A prospective cohort study of thoracic cancer patients in China. Background: We examined the effects of the rs1800469 and rs1800470 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFbeta1) gene and the rs189037 and rs373759 SNPs of the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene on the risk of radiation-induced pneumonitis (RP) in patients who underwent radiotherapy for various thoracic malignancies. Method(s): We determined the genotype and allele distributions of rs1800469 (C-509T), rs1800470 (C869T), rs189037 (A-111G), and rs373759 (126713 G>A) in 141 Han Chinese patients who underwent definitive thoracic radiotherapy (50 to 77 Gy, 5 days/wk) for lung cancer (small cell or non-small cell tumors, n = 97), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC, n = 27), or mediastinal cancer (n = 17). Clinical variables were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression models to calculate the relative risk of RP associated with the clinical variables, and a Pearson correlation analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between the SNP genotypes and alleles and the incidence of RP for the various risk factors. Result(s): The T alleles of rs1800470 (CT/TT) and rs1800469 (CT/TT) and the G allele of rs189037 (GA/GG) were associated with the risk of >= grade-2 RP in the ESCC patients (P = 0.0006, P = 0.0127, and P = 0.0412, respectively), and that the A alleles of rs189037 (AG/AA) and rs373759 (AG/AA) were associated with the risk of >= grade-2 RP in the patients with mediastinal cancer (P = 0.0063 and P = 0.0003, respectively). None of the SNP genotypes were associated with the risk of RP in lung cancer patients. Conclusion(s): The T alleles of the rs1800470 (CT/TT) and rs1800469 (CT/TT) SNPs of TGFbeta1 and the G allele of the rs189037 (GA/GG) SNP of ATM are independent risk factors for RP in Chinese ESCC patients, and the A alleles of the rs189037 (AG/AA) and rs373759 (AG/AA) SNPs of ATM are independent risk factors for RP in Chinese patients with mediastinal cancer. These SNPs might represent useful biomarkers for personalizing radiotherapy regimens for Chinese patients with ESCC or mediastinal cancer to reduce the incidence of RP. Large-cohort studies of these SNPs in thoracic cancer patients are warranted.Copyright © 2015, E-Century Publishing Corporation. All rights reserved.",Excluded
4749,"RAD18 mediates resistance to ionizing radiation in human glioma cells. Radioresistance remains a major challenge in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). RAD18 a central regulator of translesion DNA synthesis (TLS), has been shown to play an important role in regulating genomic stability and DNA damage response. In the present study, we investigate the relationship between RAD18 and resistance to ionizing radiation (IR) and examined the expression levels of RAD18 in primary and recurrent GBM specimens. Our results showed that RAD18 is an important mediator of the IR-induced resistance in GBM. The expression level of RAD18 in glioma cells correlates with their resistance to IR. Ectopic expression of RAD18 in RAD18-low A172 glioma cells confers significant resistance to IR treatment. Conversely, depletion of endogenous RAD18 in RAD18-high glioma cells sensitized these cells to IR treatment. Moreover, RAD18 overexpression confers resistance to IR-mediated apoptosis in RAD18-low A172 glioma cells, whereas cells deficient in RAD18 exhibit increased apoptosis induced by IR. Furthermore, knockdown of RAD18 in RAD18-high glioma cells disrupts HR-mediated repair, resulting in increased accumulation of DSB. In addition, clinical data indicated that RAD18 was significantly higher in recurrent GBM samples that were exposed to IR compared with the corresponding primary GBM samples. Collectively, our findings reveal that RAD18 may serve as a key mediator of the IR response and may function as a potential target for circumventing IR resistance in human GBM.

4750,"Induction chemotherapy with docetaxel plus cisplatin (TP regimen) followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy with TP regimen versus cisplatin in treating locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Background and Objective: Clinical trials on docetaxel plus cisplatin (DDP) (TP regimen) in treating nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) are still uncertain due to limited samples. This study was to compare the short-term efficacy and toxicity of induction chemotherapy with TP regimen followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy with TP regimen versus DDP in treating locally advanced NPC. Method(s): Fifty-seven patients with stage T3-4N2-3M0 NPC diagnosed pathologically from December 2005 to December 2006 were randomized into TP group (30 patients) and DDP group (27 patients). Both groups received TP regimen as induction chemotherapy with docetaxel (70 mg/m2) on Day 1 and DDP (80 mg/m2) on Day 2, repeating every 21 days for two cycles. For concurrent chemotherapy, TP group were administered docetaxel (60 mg/ m2) on Day 1 and DDP (80 mg/m2) on Day 2; DDP group were administered DDP (80 mg/m2) on Day 1. Both schedules were repeated every 21 days for two cycles. Linear accelerator was used as radioactive source. Irradiation field was designed with CT-simulation and conventional fractions. Result(s): The 57 patients received 111 cycles of induction chemotherapy, and 53 of them received 103 cycles of concurrent chemotherapy; four patients ceased induction chemotherapy and three ceased concurrent chemotherapy. All patients completed radiotherapy. The major toxicity of induction chemotherapy was hematologic toxicity; the main toxicities of concurrent chemoradiotherapy were hematologic toxicity and mucositis. The occurrence rates of Grade 3-4 leucopenia and Grade 3-4 neutropenia were significantly higher in TP group than in DDP groups (p < 0.05). In concurrent chemoradiotherapy, the application rate of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) was significantly higher in TP group than in DDP group (100% vs. 72.0%, p < 0.05). After concurrent chemoradiotherapy, the complete remission (CR) rates of the nasopharynx and regional lymph nodes were 93.3% and 92.9% in TP group, and were 96.3% and 91.3% in DDP group (p > 0.05). Conclusion(s): The short-term efficacy of induction chemotherapy with TP regimen followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy with TP regimen on locally advanced NPC is similar to that of TP regimen followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy with DDP. The toxicity of the former schedule is severer than that of the latter, but it is tolerable with the use of G-CSF. The long-term efficacy of induction chemotherapy with TP regimen followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy with TP regimen need to be further studied. © 2009 Landes Bioscience.",Excluded

4752,"PHD3-dependent hydroxylation of HCLK2 promotes the DNA damage response. The DNA damage response (DDR) is a complex regulatory network that is critical for maintaining genome integrity. Posttranslational modifications are widely used to ensure strict spatiotemporal control of signal flow, but how the DDR responds to environmental cues, such as changes in ambient oxygen tension, remains poorly understood. We found that an essential component of the ATR/CHK1 signaling pathway, the human homolog of the Caenorhabditis elegans biological clock protein CLK-2 (HCLK2), associated with and was hydroxylated by prolyl hydroxylase domain protein 3 (PHD3). HCLK2 hydroxylation was necessary for its interaction with ATR and the subsequent activation of ATR/CHK1/p53. Inhibiting PHD3, either with the pan-hydroxylase inhibitor dimethyloxaloylglycine (DMOG) or through hypoxia, prevented activation of the ATR/CHK1/p53 pathway and decreased apoptosis induced by DNA damage. Consistent with these observations, we found that mice lacking PHD3 were resistant to the effects of ionizing radiation and had decreased thymic apoptosis, a biomarker of genomic integrity. Our identification of HCLK2 as a substrate of PHD3 reveals the mechanism through which hypoxia inhibits the DDR, suggesting hydroxylation of HCLK2 is a potential therapeutic target for regulating the ATR/CHK1/p53 pathway.",Excluded
4753,"Radiation exposure to staff in intensive care unit with portable CT scanner. Background. Bedside radiological procedures pose a risk of radiation exposure to ICU staff. The perception of risk may increase the degree of caution among the health care staff and raise new barriers preventing patients from obtaining prompt care. Objective. The aim of this study was to estimate the annual cumulative radiation dose to individual ICU staff. Methods. In this prospective study, forty subjects were required to wear thermoluminescent dosimeter badges during their working hours. The badges were analyzed to determine the exposure after 3 months. Results. A total of 802 radiological procedures were completed at bedside during the study period. The estimated annual dosage to doctors and nurses on average was 0.99 mSv and 0.88 mSv (p < 0.001), respectively. Residents were subjected to the highest radiation exposure (1.04 mSv per year, p = 0.002). The radiation dose was correlated with day shift working hours (r = 0.426; p = 0.006) and length of service (r = - 0.403; p < 0.01). Conclusions. With standard precautions, bedside radiological procedures - including portable CT scans - do not expose ICU staff to high dose of ionizing radiation.

Purpose: Definitive chemoradiation therapy remains the standard of care for patients with localized esophageal carcinoma who choose nonsurgical management. However, there is no consensus regarding delineation of the nodal clinical target volume (CTVn), especially for lower cervical lymph nodes. This study aimed to map the location of metastatic supraclavicular lymph nodes in thoracic esophageal carcinoma patients with supraclavicular node involvement and generate an atlas to delineate the CTVn for elective nodal radiation of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Patients and Methods: In this study, the supraclavicular regional lymph node was further divided into four subgroups. The locations of the involved supraclavicular nodes for all patients were then transferred onto a template computed tomography (CT) image. A volume probability map was then generated with nodal volumes, and was displayed on the template CT to provide a visual impression of nodal frequencies and anatomic distribution.

4759,"Lymphopenia During Definitive Chemoradiotherapy in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma: Association with Dosimetric Parameters and Patient Outcomes. Background: The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between clinical characteristics, as well as dosimetric parameters, and the risk of treatment-related lymphopenia in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Material(s) and Method(s): Clinical characteristics and dosimetric parameters were collected from 436 patients with ESCC who received definitive CRT from 2010 through 2017. Absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs) were obtained before, during, and 1 month after CRT. Grade 4 (G4) lymphopenia was defined as ALC <0.2 x 109/L during CRT. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the effect of each factor on predicting G4 lymphopenia. The relationship between lymphopenia and overall survival (OS) was examined, and a nomogram was developed to predict OS. Result(s): G4 lymphopenia was observed in 103 patients (23.6%) during CRT. Multivariate analysis indicated that planning target volume (PTV), lung V10, heart V10, performance status, and pretreatment lymphopenia were significant risk factors for G4 lymphopenia. Patients with G4 lymphopenia had significantly worse survival than those without. Based on multivariate analysis, clinical TNM stage, radiotherapy modality, pretreatment ALC, and G4 lymphopenia were predictive of OS and were incorporated into the nomogram, yielding a concordance index of 0.71. Conclusion(s): G4 lymphopenia during definitive CRT was associated with larger PTVs, higher lung V10 and heart V10, and worse survival. Implications for Practice: The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between clinical characteristics, as well as dosimetric parameters, and the risk of treatment-related lymphopenia in 436 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who received definitive chemoradiotherapy. Grade 4 (G4) lymphopenia was observed in 23.6% of patients during radiotherapy. G4 lymphopenia was associated with larger planning target volumes, higher lung V10 and heart V10, and worse survival.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate effects on vestibular function by irradiation in the patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma., METHOD: Twenty patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma were routinely irradiated with dose of 70 Gy (3 cases > 70 Gy)., RESULT: Nine cases (45%) were abnormal in vestibular function test after radical irradiation in 20 cases (spontaneous nystagmus n = 3; unlateral canal paresis n = 4; bilateral canal paresis n = 2; bilateral vestibular function absent n = 2). The other 11 cases(55%) were normal in vestibular function test., CONCLUSION: Vestibular function may be damaged after radical irradiation in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. During professional identification, this factor must be respected and vestibular function, cochlear function and tubal function must be separately evaluated.",Excluded
4761,"Clinical Efficacy of Vertical or Parallel Technique of a Micro-Locking Plate for Treatment of Dubberley B-Type Capitellar Fractures. Objective: To evaluate the clinical efficacy of micro-locking plate through vertical or parallel technique for treatment of Dubberley B-type capitellar fractures. Method(s): A retrospective analysis was performed in 24 patients (17 males and seven females, with an average age of 44.9 years, range from 19 to 75 years) with capitellar fractures that were treated with micro-locking plate using vertical or parallel technique between January 2016 to January 2019. The inclusion criteria include closed capitellar fracture, normal anterior elbow joint movement before injury, and recent capitellar fracture with injury within past 3 weeks. Fractures classified according to Dubberley included four cases of type IB, eight cases of type IIB, and 12 cases of type IIIB. Radiographic evaluation was performed. Surgery time, blood loss, range of motion of the elbow, forearm rotation, and complications were recorded. Elbow joint function was evaluated by Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS). Result(s): The mean follow-up period was 19.6 months (range, 12-36 months). The average clinical healing time for fractures was 11.2 +/- 3.2 weeks (range, 8-20 weeks). Fracture united in all patients. Two patients showed slight delayed union, but union was achieved eventually. The mean time from injury to surgery was 6.3 +/- 3.1 days (range, 2-15 days). The average surgical time was 68.1 +/- 11.5 min (range, 50-90 min), and the mean blood loss was 75.2 +/- 26.5 mL (range, 40-120 mL). The mean range of flexion was 122.5degree +/- 10.5degree(range, 95degree-140degree). The mean range of extension was 8.5degree +/- 5.8degree(range, 0degree-20degree). The mean range of pronation was 79.7degree +/- 8.0degree(range, 65degree-90degree). The mean range of supination was 80.5degree +/- 7.1degree(range, 60degree-90degree). The mean MEPS at final follow-up was 89.8 +/- 9.0 (range, 60-100). Based on the MEPS, 18 (75%) patients had excellent, five (20.8%) patients had good, and one (4.2%) patient had fair. None of the 24 patients suffered vascular or nerve injury. One patient showed superficial infection, which was treated with surgical dressing. Conclusion(s): The vertical or parallel technique of the micro-locking plate is an excellent method for treating Dubberley B-type capitellar fractures.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

4762,"Noninvasive evaluation of radiation-enhanced glioma cells invasiveness by ultra-high-field (1)H-MRS in vitro. INTRODUCTION: Glioma is the most common type of the primary CNS tumor. Radiotherapy is an important treatment measure after surgery. However, its highly invasive character is the main reason of postoperative recurrence. The aim of the study was to probe the correlation between the invasion ability and the metabolite characteristics of glioma cells at the cellular level after irradiation by using 14.7T high-resolution nuclear proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS)., METHODS: To determine the matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) activity and metabolite ratios of glioma cells after irradiation with different doses of X-rays, U87 and C6 glioma cells were exposed to X-ray irradiation of 0, 1, 5, 10, and 15Gy. After 20h, the perchloric acid (PCA) extraction method was used to evaluate water-soluble metabolites [choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), and N-acetylaspartate (NAA)], and (1)H-MRS patterns and changes in metabolite ratios were observed in vitro by 14.7T high resolution (1)H-MRS. Matrigel invasion assays and gelatin zymography were performed to test the invasion ability of U87 and C6 glioma cells., RESULTS: Good MR spectra were obtained from PCA method extracts of U87 and C6 glioma cells. Both radiation-induced MMP-2 activity and the Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA ratios increased after irradiation, and their increase occurred in a dose-dependent manner. The MMP-2 activity and the Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA ratios of glioma cells increased after irradiation up to 10Gy and decreased thereafter. In particular, the Cho/NAA ratio of U87 cells increased from 3.55+/-0.06 (0Gy) to 9.13+/-0.30 (10Gy) and then declined to 5.94+/-0.15 (15Gy). Furthermore, the invasion ability of glioma cells had a strong positive correlation with the Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA ratios. Both the Cho/Cr ratio and the Cho/NAA ratio of U87 glioma cells were highly positively correlated with the number of invading cells in the Matrigel invasion assay. The Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) values of U87 cells were 0.89 (Cho/Cr ratio versus invasion ability) and 0.91 (Cho/NAA ratio versus invasion ability) (P<0.01). C6 cells exhibited similar changes to those of U87 cells., CONCLUSIONS: In vitro high-resolution (1)H-MRS is useful for detecting glioma invasiveness at the cellular level. Copyright © 2016.

4763,"Stereotactic body radiation therapy for post-pulmonary lobectomy isolated lung metastasis of thoracic tumor: Survival and side effects. Background: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has emerged as an alternative treatment for patients with early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or metastatic pulmonary tumors. However, for isolated lung metastasis (ILM) of thoracic malignances after pulmonary lobectomy, reported outcomes of SBRT have been limited. This study evaluates the role of SBRT in the treatment of such patients. Method(s): A retrospective search of the SBRT database was conducted in three hospitals. The parameters analyzed in the treated patients were local control, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and the treatment-related side-effects. Result(s): In total, 23 patients with single ILM after pulmonary lobectomy treated with SBRT were identified and the median follow-up time was 14 months (range: 6.0-47.0 months). Local recurrences were observed in two patients during follow-up and the 1-year local control rate was 91.3%. Median PFS and OS for the studied cohort were 10.0 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 5.1-14.9 months] and 21.0 months (95% CI 11.4-30.6 months), respectively. Acute radiation pneumonitis (RP) of grade 2 or worse was observed in five (21.7%) and three (13.0%) patients, respectively. Other treatment-related toxicities included chest wall pain in one patient (4.3%) and acute esophagitis in two patients (8.7%). By Pearson correlation analysis, the planning target volume (PTV) volume and the volume of the ipsilateral lung exposed to a minimum dose of 5 Gy (IpV5) were significantly related to the acute RP of grade 2 or worse in present study (p < 0.05). The optimal thresholds of the PTV and IpV5 to predict RP of acute grade 2 or worse RP were 59 cm3 and 51% respectively, according to the receiver-operating characteristics curve analysis, with sensitivity/specificity of 75.0%/80.0% and 62.5%/80.0%. Conclusion(s): SBRT for post-lobectomy ILM was effective and well tolerated. The major reason for disease progression was distant failure but not local recurrence. The PTV and IpV5 are potential predictors of acute RP of grade 2 or higher and should be considered in treatment planning for such patients.Copyright © 2014 Xiong et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
4764,"Involved-site radiotherapy for helicobacter pylori-independent gastric MALT lymphoma: 26 years of experience with 178 patients. Treatment options for Helicobacter pylori-independent gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma (GML) include surgery, immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy (RT). The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of RT and routine endoscopic surveillance, hypothesizing that most patients are curable with RT alone. We queried a single institution database at a tertiary referral cancer center for patients with H pylori-independent GML treated with RT between 1991 and 2017. Response was assessed by follow-up endoscopies (EGDs) starting 10 to 12 weeks post-RT. Computed tomography scans were also part of the follow-up program, and positron emission tomography was added when clinically appropriate. We identified 178 patients (median age, 63 years; range, 25-89 years); 86% had stage I disease, 7% had stage II disease, and 7% had stage IV disease. Median RT dose was 3000 cGy over 20 fractions. Ninety-five percent of patients exhibited complete pathologic response on posttreatment EGD. Two patients experienced grade 3 toxicity, and 2 patients experienced in-field secondary malignancies. Over a median follow-up of 6.2 years, 9.6% experienced local failures, and 11.8% developed distant sites of disease. Five-year and 10-year overall survival were 94% and 79%, respectively, from last date of RT. RT is a highly effective and safe treatment for GML with excellent overall survival and very rare acute or late treatment-related toxicities. Favorable outcomes from this large retrospective sample of patients provide credible and compelling support for RT as standard of care for H pylori-independent GML.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology",Excluded
4765,"Feasibility and Safety of Ultrasonography Guidance and Flank Position during Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy. Purpose: Percutaneous nephrolithotomy is generally performed using fluoroscopy, which is associated with exposure to radiation. Another drawback of fluoroscopic guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy is the prone position, which is not suitable for all patients. In this study we evaluated the feasibility, safety and efficacy of ultrasound guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy with the patient in the flank position. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 603 patients with a mean +/- SD age of 50.9 +/- 13 years were included in this study from December 2010 to July 2016. Access to the collecting system and tract dilation were performed under ultrasound guidance. Perioperative data on the stone-free rate, operative time, length of stay and complication rates were recorded. Result(s): Successful access was achieved in all but 1 patient. Mean operative time was 56.6 +/- 6.5 minutes. Complete stone clearance was achieved in 529 patients (87.7%) and Clavien-Dindo grade 3 complications were noted in 17 (2.8%). Blood transfusion was necessary in 43 patients (7.1%). However, bleeding was self-limited in all cases and did not require angioembolization. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge this is the largest series of ultrasound guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy with the patient in the flank position. Unlike in other studies we used this procedure in all patients irrespective of stone burden, renal anomaly and body habitus. Ultrasound guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy has outcomes comparable to those of conventional percutaneous nephrolithotomy and it is not associated with radiation exposure. Furthermore, anesthesia while in the flank position might be less harmful in some patients, including those with obesity or cardiopulmonary comorbidities.Copyright © 2018 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.",Excluded
4766,"A Rare Case of Odontoameloblastoma in a Geriatric Patient. Odontoameloblastoma is an extremely rare tumor derived from odontogenic epithelium and mesenchyme. In the fewer than 20 reported cases, odontoameloblastoma is described as occurring in the maxilla or mandible of young men with a history of unerupted teeth. Here we report a case of a 73-year-old woman who presented to the dentist for routine cleaning and x-rays, which displayed a mandibular lesion. After referral to multiple providers, a biopsy of two involved teeth was obtained and computed tomography of the neck was performed, revealing a large, destructive lesion of the mandible. Histology was consistent with odontoameloblastoma. The patient underwent wide segmental mandibular resection and scapula tip free flap reconstruction. She recovered uneventfully and continues to have close follow-up, given the risk of recurrence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of odontoameloblastoma in a patient over age 50. The goal of the authors is to raise awareness of this rare pathology and its diagnostic and management modalities.Copyright © 2018 SAGE Publications.",Excluded
4767,"Patients Treated with Preoperative Chemoradiation for Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma have Impaired Bone Density, a Predictor of Distant Metastasis. Background: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a lethal neoplasm that spreads to surrounding tissue or distant sites. This study investigated distant metastases in PDAC patients with or without preoperative chemoradiation therapy (CRT), focusing on vitamin D levels and bone density. Method(s): This study included 146 patients with PDAC who underwent surgery from 2007 to 2014. Bone density was evaluated using computed tomography, and the preoperative vitamin D level was calculated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for patients with available plasma (48 cases). Result(s): When the patients were divided into two groups according to the change in bone density, the group with decreased bone density had a shorter distant metastasis-free survival time (DMFS) after surgery than the other group (p < 0.05). Low vitamin D was a weak predictor of DMFS, but the difference was not significant (p = 0.08), perhaps because of the sample size. Multivariate analysis indicated three significant factors associated with distant metastasis: a decrease in bone density (hazard ratio [HR], 2.17; p = 0.04), normalization of the Dupan-2 value after surgery (hazard ratio [HR], 0.39; p = 0.02), and completion of adjuvant chemotherapy (HR, 0.29; p < 0.01). Univariate analysis showed that a low vitamin D concentration (<20 pg/ml) was a risk factor (p = 0.04) for bone density change. Multivariate analysis found that preoperative CRT was the only factor associated (+/-, OR, 5.8; p = 0.04) with bone density change, suggesting that preoperative CRT significantly decreases bone density in patients with insufficient vitamin D. Conclusion(s): Patients treated with preoperative CRT tend to have impaired bone density, which is a predictor of distant metastasis. Thus, vitamin D supplementation may decrease distant metastasis.Copyright © 2017, Society of Surgical Oncology.",Excluded
4768,"X-ray-induced sterility in Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) and male longevity following irradiation. The mosquito Aedes albopictus (Skuse, 1895) is a potent vector of several arboviral diseases, most notably chikungunya and dengue fever. In the context of the sterile insect technique (SIT), the sterilization of the male mosquitoes before their release can be achieved by gamma-ray irradiation. As gamma-ray irradiators are becoming increasingly problematic to purchase and transport, the suitability of an X-ray irradiator as an alternative for the sterilization of Ae. albopictus males was studied. The sterilization of up to 200,000 pupae at one time can be achieved with relative ease, and the sterility results obtained were comparable with those achieved by gamma irradiation, where 99% sterility is induced with a dose of 40 Gy. A significant reduction of longevity was observed in the latter stages of the males' life after irradiation treatments, especially at doses > 40 Gy, which is consistent with the negative effects on longevity induced by similar radiation doses using gamma rays. Females irradiated at 40 Gy were not only 100% sterile, but also failed to oviposit entirely, i.e., all of the females laid 0 eggs. Overall, it was found that the X-ray irradiator is generally suitable for the sterilization process for sterile insect technique programs, as it showed a high processing capacity, practicality, high effectiveness, and reproducibility.",Excluded
4769,"Incidence of dementia among atomic-bomb survivors--Radiation Effects Research Foundation Adult Health Study. Radiotherapy has been reported to cause neuropsychological dysfunction. Here we examined whether exposure to atomic bomb radiation affected the incidence of dementia among 2286 atomic bomb survivors and controls - all members of the Adult Health Study cohort. Study subjects were non-demented and aged >or=60 years at baseline examination and had been exposed in 1945 at >or=13 years of age to a relatively low dose (<or=4 Gy), compared with total dose from radiotherapy. Dementia diagnoses were made during biennial health examinations with a two-phase procedure. DSM IV criteria were used for diagnosing dementia, NINCDS-ADRDA for Alzheimer disease, and NINDS-AIREN for vascular disease. To estimate the effect of radiation on the dementia incidence rate, we applied Poisson regression analysis. Incidence per 1000 person-years was 16.3 in the <5 mGy group, 17.0 in the 5-499 mGy group, and 15.2 in the >or=500 mGy group. Alzheimer disease was the predominant type of dementia in each dose category. After adjustment for potential risk factors, radiation exposure did not affect the incidence rate of either all dementia or any of its subtypes. No case of dementia had a history of therapeutic cranial irradiation. Although we found no relationship between radiation exposure and the development of dementia among atomic bomb survivors exposed at >or=13 years old in this longitudinal study, effects on increased risk of early death among atomic bomb survivors will be considered.",Included
4770,"[Cognitive dysfunction among the elderly evaluated by the cognitive abilities screening instrument (CASI)]. The Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI) was developed by Japanese and American researchers, including the authors, to examine cognitive functions, based on previous neuropsychological tests, such as Hasegawa's Dementia Scale and the MMSE. From the Adult Health Study (AHS) population of the Radiation Effects Research Foundation, 2052 men and women aged 60 or over and living in Hiroshima were evaluated for their cognitive functions using the CASI. Dementia was diagnosed in 93 and 1,959 were considered not to suffer from dementia based on the DSM-III-R criteria using neurological examination and the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) completed by caregivers. Multivariate regression analysis not only indicated that total score was higher with lower age and higher education but that the slope of its decrease is steeper with higher age and fewer years of education. The slope of score decrease with increase of age was steeper for women than for men. Furthermore, CASI items were categorized by domains of cognitive function. Multivariate regression analysis for each cognitive domain showed clear effects of age and level of education. The effect of age for the nondementia subjects was large in cognitive domains dealing with temporal orientation, short-term memory, and list-generating fluency. The most useful cognitive domains for diagnosing dementia were temporal orientation, short-term memory, and list-generating fluency, as was indicated by high sensitivity and specificity.",Excluded

We have established a ""second-look operation"" protocol that consists of whole biopsy of surgical scar tissue following radio-hyperthermo-chemotherapy (RHC) after unplanned excision of soft tissue sarcoma. Out of 30 patients who underwent RHC for soft tissue sarcoma at our Institution, 6 were enrolled into this study to undergo a second-look operation for unplanned excision. Radiotherapy was given to a total dose of 32 Gy. Hyperthermia was conducted once a week, for a total of five sessions. Chemotherapy was performed at weekly intervals. Surgery was performed to excise the scar tissue that was enhanced on preoperative MRI. In all six cases, no residual tumors were identified in resected scar tissue; thus, no additional wide excision was performed. The average follow-up period was 10.9 years. There were no local recurrences, and all patients were alive at their final follow-up. Long-term followup confirmed that RHC can replace additional wide excision for unplanned excision of soft tissue sarcoma.",Excluded
4772,"Effects of a closed space environment on gene expression in hair follicles of astronauts in the International Space Station. Adaptation to the space environment can sometimes pose physiological problems to International Space Station (ISS) astronauts after their return to earth. Therefore, it is important to develop healthcare technologies for astronauts. In this study, we examined the feasibility of using hair follicles, a readily obtained sample, to assess gene expression changes in response to spaceflight adaptation. In order to investigate the gene expression changes in human hair follicles during spaceflight, hair follicles of 10 astronauts were analyzed by microarray and real time qPCR analyses. We found that spaceflight alters human hair follicle gene expression. The degree of changes in gene expression was found to vary among individuals. In some astronauts, genes related to hair growth such as FGF18, ANGPTL7 and COMP were upregulated during flight, suggesting that spaceflight inhibits cell proliferation in hair follicles.Copyright © 2016 Terada et al.

4773,"Effective stepwise training and procedure standardization for young surgeons to perform laparoscopic left hepatectomy. Background: Laparoscopic hepatectomy remains one of the most difficult procedures for young surgeons to perform. We recently developed a new training method and standardization procedure for teaching young surgeons to perform laparoscopic left hepatectomy (Lap-LHx). The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of our method. Method(s): In 2004, we standardized a laparoscopic procedure for Lap-LHx, using a laparoscopy-assisted method as a stepping stone. The laparoscopic training method comprised the following three steps: (1) training in fundamental procedures using a dry box and checking by mentors; (2) detailed preoperative simulation using Vincent three-dimensional software for each patient; and (3) self-assessment including understanding of relevant anatomy and completion grade for each procedure using a check sheet and feedback by both mentors and a professor. Twenty-three Lap-LHx procedures performed during the study period were divided into two groups: those performed by young non-board-certified surgeons (n = 9) and those performed by senior board-certified surgeons (n = 14). Result(s): The blood loss and operative time were similar in the young surgeon (194 g and 336 min, respectively) and senior surgeon groups (208 g and 322 min, respectively).

Background: The authors evaluated the tolerance and efficacy of carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT) as a short-course, preoperative treatment and determined the recommended dose needed to reduce the risk of postoperative local recurrence without excess injury to normal tissue. Method(s): Patients radiographically defined with potentially resectable pancreatic cancer were eligible. A preoperative, short-course, dose-escalation study was performed with fixed 8 fractions in 2 weeks. The dose of irradiation was increased by 5% increments from 30 grays equivalents (GyE) to 36.8 GyE. Surgery was to be performed 2 to 4 weeks after the completion of CIRT. Result(s): The study enrolled 26 patients. At the time of restaging after CIRT, disease progression with distant metastasis or refusal ruled out 5 patients from surgery. Twenty-one of 26 patients (81%) patients underwent surgery. The pattern of initial disease progression was distant metastasis in 17 patients (65%) and regional recurrence in 2 patients (8%). No patients experienced local recurrence. The 5-year survival rates for all 26 patients and for those who underwent surgery were 42% and 52%, respectively.

4775,"UV irradiation-induced DNA hypomethylation around WNT1 gene: Implications for solar lentigines. Wnt/beta-catenin signalling promotes melanogenesis in melanocytes and also induces melanocytogenesis from melanocyte stem cells (McSCs). Previous study reported that WNT1, a ligand which activates Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathway, was more highly expressed in the epidermis at SLs than in normal skin areas, suggesting that WNT1 causes hyperpigmentation. To elucidate the mechanism by which WNT1 expression is increased in SLs, we examined the methylation of 5-carbon of cytosine (5mC), that is 5-methylcytosine (5mC) level, in a region within the WNT1 promoter; the methylation of the region was known to negatively regulate WNT1 gene expression. We used an immortalized cell line of human interfollicular epidermal stem cells to analyse the effect of UVB irradiation on DNA methylation level of WNT1 promoter and found that UVB irradiation caused demethylation of WNT1 promoter and promoted WNT1 mRNA expression. It was also found that UVB irradiation reduced the expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), an enzyme responsible for maintaining methylation patterns during cell division. Pathological analysis of SLs and non-SL regions in the human skin revealed that both DNMT1 expression and 5mC level were decreased at SLs compared to non-SL skins. Furthermore, bisulphite sequencing showed that the methylated CpG level in WNT1 promoter was also lower at SLs than in non-SL skins. Thus, in the skin exposed to a high amount of UV rays, excessive expression of WNT1 is thought to be caused by the demethylation of WNT1 promoter, and the upregulated WNT1 promotes melanocytogenesis and melanogenesis, then resulting in SL formation.

OBJECTIVE The results of 3-stage Gamma Knife treatment (3-st-GK-Tx) for relatively large brain metastases have previously been reported for a series of patients in Chiba, Japan (referred to in this study as the C-series). In the current study, the authors reappraised, using a competing risk analysis, the efficacy and safety of 3-st-GK-Tx by comparing their experience with that of the C-series. METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study. Among 1767 patients undergoing GK radiosurgery for brain metastases at Mito Gamma House during the 2005-2015 period, 78 (34 female, 44 male; mean age 65 years, range 35-86 years) whose largest tumor was > 10 cm3, treated with 3-st-GK-Tx, were studied (referred to in this study as the M-series). The target volumes were covered with a 50% isodose gradient and irradiated with a peripheral dose of 10 Gy at each procedure. The interval between procedures was 2 weeks. Because competing risk analysis had not been employed in the published C-series, the authors reanalyzed the previously published data using this method. RESULTS The overall median survival time after 3-st-GK-Tx was 8.3 months (95% CI 5.6-12.0 months) in the M-series and 8.6 months (95% CI 5.5-10.6 months) in the C-series (p = 0.41). Actuarial survival rates at the 6th and 12th post-3-st-GK-Tx months were, respectively, 55.1% and 35.2% in the M-series and 62.5% and 26.4% in the C-series (HR 1.175, 95% CI 0.790-1.728, p = 0.42). Cumulative incidences at the 12th post-3-st-GK-Tx, determined by competing risk analyses, of neurological deterioration (14.2% in C-series vs 12.8% in M-series), neurological death (7.2% vs 7.7%), local recurrence (4.8% vs 6.2%), repeat SRS (25.9% vs 18.0%), and SRS-related complications (2.3% vs 5.1%) did not differ significantly between the 2 series. CONCLUSIONS There were no significant differences in post-3-st-GK-Tx results between the 2 series in terms of overall survival times, neurological death, maintained neurological status, local control, repeat SRS, and SRS-related complications. The previously published results (C-series) are considered to be validated by the M-series results.Copyright ©AANS 2018.",Excluded
4779,"Renal atrophy after stereotactic body radiotherapy for renal cell carcinoma. BACKGROUND: Renal atrophy is observed in an irradiated kidney. The aim of this study was to determine dose-volume histogram parameters and other factors that predict renal atrophy after 10-fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for primary renal cell carcinoma (RCC)., METHODS: A total of 14 patients (11 males, 3 females) who received SBRT for RCC at Tohoku University Hospital between April 2010 and February 2014 were analyzed. The median serum creatinine level was 1.1 mg/dl and two patients had a single kidney. Nine patients were implanted with fiducial markers. The median tumor diameter was 30 mm. SBRT was delivered at 70 Gy in 10 fractions for 7 tumors, at 60 Gy in 10 fractions for 2 tumors, and at 50 Gy in 10 fractions for 5 tumors with 6 and/or 15 MV X-ray using 5 to 8 multi-static beams. Renal atrophy was assessed using post-SBRT CT images after 12-24 months intervals. Correlations were examined by Spearman rank correlation analysis. Differences between two groups were evaluated by the Mann-Whitney test, and pairwise comparisons were made by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test., RESULTS: The median tumor volume shrunk from 14.8 cc to 10.6 cc (p = 0.12), and the median irradiated kidney volume changed from 160.4 cc to 137.1 cc (p < .01). The median peak creatinine level was 1.6 mg/dl after treatment (p < .01). Percentage volumes of the irradiated kidney receiving at least 10 Gy (V10, p = 0.03), V20 (p < .01), V30(p < .01), V40 (p = 0.01), mean irradiated kidney dose (p < .01), and magnitude of overlap between PTV and kidney volume (p = 0.03) were significantly correlated with post-treatment irradiated kidney volume in percent, and V20-V30 had strong correlation (r < -0.70, p < .01). Patients with implanted fiducial markers showed a significantly lower ratio of renal atrophy (p = 0.02)., CONCLUSIONS: Significant renal atrophic change was observed.

4780,"Reducing the Radiation Dose for CT Colonography: Effect of Low Tube Voltage and Iterative Reconstruction. Rationale and Objectives: The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of a low-tube-voltage technique and iterative reconstruction (IR) on the radiation dose and image quality of computed tomography colonography (CTC). Material(s) and Method(s): We studied 30 patients (14 women and 16 men; mean age, 64.5 +/- 13.1 years; range, 39-90 years) with colorectal cancer referred for surgical treatment. All underwent CTC with fecal tagging under a standard 120-kVp protocol in the supine position and a 100-kVp protocol in the prone position. The 120-kVp images were reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP). The 100-kVp images were postprocessed using FBP and a hybrid type of IR (adaptive iterative dose reduction 3D). The effective radiation dose (ED), image noise, and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were compared among the three protocols. The visual image quality was scored on a four-point scale. Result(s): The mean ED was significantly lower under the 100-kVp protocol than the 120-kVp protocol, resulting in a 27% radiation dose decrease (3.5 +/- 2.0 vs 2.5 +/- 1.5 mSv; P <01). Image noise decreased by 48%, and the mean attenuation of tagged fluid increased from 452 to 558 HU on images acquired at 100 kVp with IR compared to that in the 120-kVp protocol; these differences were significant. The mean CNR was significantly higher under the 100 kVp with IR than the other two protocols. We found no significant differences in the visual scores for diagnostic utility between the 100 kVp with IR and the 120 kVp with FBP protocol (P=10). Conclusion(s): Low-tube-voltage CTC reduced the radiation dose by approximately 27% while maintaining the image quality.Copyright © 2016 AUR.",Excluded
4781,"Optimal scan parameters for ct fluoroscopy in lung interventional radiologic procedures: Relationship between radiation dose and image quality. Purpose: To evaluate the relationship between radiation doses and lung computed tomographic (CT) fluoroscopic scan parameters and to determine optimal scan parameters for performance of lung interventional radiologic (IR) procedures. Material(s) and Method(s): The institutional review board approved this prospective study, which included 32 patients with a single lung tumor;written informed consent was obtained. CT fluoroscopic images were obtained with three tube voltages (80,120,135 kV) and three tube currents (10, 20, 30 mA) in each patient. The signal-to-noise ratios(SNRs) and the contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were measured quantitatively. To evaluate the feasibility of performing lung IR procedures, four readers visually scored the image quality. Acceptable CT fluoroscopic images were determined by using agreement of at least three of the four readers. The weighted CT dose index for each CT scan parameter was measured. A piecewise linear regression equation was obtained from the relationship between radiation doses and visual image scores. Result(s): Both the SNR and the CNR improved as the radiation dose increased, leading to improvement in the image quality. Acceptable image quality was achieved in 94% (30 of 32) of patients when the radiation dose was 1.18 mGy/sec (120 kV, 10 mA) and in all patients when it was greater than 1.48 mGy/sec (135 kV, 10 mA). The piecewise linear curve showed rapid improvement in image quality until the radiation dose increased to 1.48 mGy/sec (135 kV, 10 mA). When the radiation dose was increased greater than 1.48 mGy/sec, improvement in the image quality became more gradual. Conclusion(s): Results of this study can be used to guide the determination of optimal scan parameters in lung CT fluoroscopy. © RSNA, 2010.",Excluded

4783,"Taste dysfunction in patients receiving radiotherapy. BACKGROUND: Taste loss is a major cause of morbidity in patients undergoing head and neck irradiation., METHODS: In a prospective study, 51 patients undergoing radical head and neck irradiation at the Tokyo University Hospital were assessed for taste loss. Taste ability was measured by the taste threshold for the four basic tastes (sweet, sour, salt, and bitter qualities) plus another taste of ""umami"" quality using a filter-paper-disc method in patients before, during, and after radiotherapy (RT)., RESULTS: All tastes declined on the fifth week after the start of RT and improved on the 11th week. Anatomic pathologic analyses in rats revealed that taste buds diminished completely on the sixth day after irradiation of 15 Gy in a single fraction, and the appearance of taste buds returned almost to the preirradiation state on the 28th day., CONCLUSIONS: The main cause of taste disorder resulting from RT was believed to be a disappearance of taste buds and not damage to the taste nerves.",Excluded
4784,"Linear accelerator-based stereotactic body radiation therapy in the treatment of oligometastatic disease. The present study reports the clinical outcomes of hypofractionated stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for oligometastasis (OM) originating from various tumors. Between February 2012 and April 2017, 40 patients with unresectable OM were treated with SBRT. Of these patients, 92% showed a solitary nodal metastasis and the rest had up to three metas-tases. The dose prescription was 50 Gy in 10 fractions with three-dimensional conformal techniques or volumetric inten-sity-modulated arc therapy. Median follow-up was 14 months. Of the 40 patients, none showed local progression at the site of SBRT, but 20 patients showed tumor growth at distant sites during follow-up. The 2- and 3-year overall survival rates were 45.1 and 36.1%, respectively. The 2- and 3-year progression-free survival rates were 35.4 and 26.5%, respectively. The interval between diagnosis and detection of OM (<2 vs. >2 years) and primary tumor site (esophagus vs. others) emerged as significant variables affecting survival. Grade 3 subacute and grade 4 chronic toxicities were observed in 1 and 2 patients, respectively. SBRT of 50 Gy in 10 fractions for OM from various primary tumors was shown to lead to good clinical outcomes from the viewpoints of local control and toxicity frequency. However, additional studies are required to identify the patient groups likely to receive maximal benefits from such treatment.Copyright © 2020, Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.",Excluded
4785,Cord blood transplantation using minimum conditioning regimens for patients with hematologic malignancies complicated by severe infections. Patients with severe infections are thought to be ineligible for cord blood stem cell transplantation (CBT) because the conventional 5-6 day-conditioning regimens potentially makes them susceptible to fatal infections by the time neutrophil engraftment occurs. Two patients were treated with minimum conditioning regimens consisting of 30 mg/m2 fludarabin (Flu) and 2 g/m2 cyclophosphamide (CY) on day-1 and total body irradiation (TBI) of 2 or 4 Gy on day -1 or 0 followed by single unit CBT. The reasons for adopting such weak regimen were febrile neutropenia due to the rejection of the first cord blood (CB) graft given to a patient with follicular lymphoma resistant to chemotherapy and pulmonary aspergillosis in another patient with AML who relapsed after CBT. The AML patient received 40 mg/m2 of melphalan on day-2 to reduce the leukemia burden. Both patients achieved 100% donor chimerism by day 19 and day 20 after CBT without an apparent exacerbation of the infections and remained in remission at 23 and 18 months after the CBT. These findings suggest that the 1-2 day regimens excluding antihuman thymocyte globulin may be sufficiently potent to ensure engraftment of CB in immunocompromised patients and safely administered even when patients are complicated by active infections. © 2008 The Japanese Society of Hematology.,Excluded
4786,"Significance of surgical resection for the treatment of multiple brain metastases. Background: We investigated the role of surgery in the treatment of multiple brain metastases when performed with radiation therapy. Patients and Methods: One hundred and thirty-eight patients who underwent resection for brain metastases and received 30 Gy or more of adjuvant radiation therapy were entered into this study. Seventy-seven of the 138 patients (56%) had single brain metastases (Single Group), while the remaining 61 patients (44%) had multiple foci (Multiple Group). The 138 patients were divided into four subgroups; patients in Single Group treated with total or subtotal resection (Group A), those in Multiple Group who underwent total or subtotal resection and had remaining tumors smaller than 2 cm (Group B), those in Single Group treated with partial resection (Group C), and the other patients in Multiple Group (Group D). Result(s): The median survival was 8.7 and 9.2 months for the Single Group and the Multiple Group, respectively (not statistically different). The median survival was 9.6, 12.4, 3.7, and 4.5 months for Groups A, B, C, and D, respectively. Survival duration differed significantly between GroupsA/B and Groups C/D (p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Surgical reduction of tumor volume which is approximately larger than 2 cm improves the efficacy of adjuvant radiation therapy and contributes to survival even in the patients with multiple, brain metastases.",Excluded
4787,"Carotid blowout syndrome in pharyngeal cancer patients treated by hypofractionated stereotactic re-irradiation using CyberKnife: A multi-institutional matched-cohort analysis. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although reirradiation has attracted attention as a potential therapy for recurrent head and neck tumors with the advent of modern radiotherapy, severe rate toxicity such as carotid blowout syndrome (CBOS) limits its potential. The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors of CBOS after hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SBRT)., METHODS AND PATIENTS: We conducted a matched-pair design examination of pharyngeal cancer patients treated by CyberKnife reirradiation in four institutes. Twelve cases with CBOS were observed per 60 cases without CBOS cases. Prognostic factors for CBOS were analyzed and a risk classification model was constructed., RESULTS: The median prescribed radiation dose was 30 Gy in 5 fractions with CyberKnife SBRT after 60 Gy/30 fractions of previous radiotherapy. The median duration between reirradiation and CBOS onset was 5 months (range, 0-69 months). CBOS cases showed a median survival time of 5.5 months compared to 22.8 months for non-CBOS cases (1-year survival rate, 36% vs.72%; p=0.003). Univariate analysis identified an angle of carotid invasion of >180degree, the presence of ulceration, planning treatment volume, and irradiation to lymph node areas as statistically significant predisposing factors for CBOS. Only patients with carotid invasion of >180degree developed CBOS (12/50, 24%), whereas no patient with tumor involvement less than a half semicircle around the carotid artery developed CBOS (0/22, 0%, p=0.03). Multivariate Cox hazard model analysis revealed that the presence of ulceration and irradiation to lymph nodes were statistically significant predisposing factors. Thus, we constructed a CBOS risk classification system: CBOS index=(summation of risk factors; carotid invasion >180degree, presence of ulceration, lymph node area irradiation). This system sufficiently separated the risk groups., CONCLUSION: The presence of ulceration and lymph node irradiation are risk factors of CBOS. The CBOS index, including carotid invasion of >180degree, is useful in classifying the risk factors and determining the indications for reirradiation. Copyright © 2015.

4788,"Effect of thoracic irradiation on hepatocyte growth factor in rats lung and in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with thoracic malignancies. This study aimed to examine the physiological role of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) after thoracic irradiation. We analysed the changes of HGF protein levels in rat lung following 12 Gy of whole thoracic irradiation. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was then collected from 11 patients (10 lung cancer and one oesophageal cancer) after completion of radiation therapy. One month after irradiation, the HGF protein level in the lungs of irradiated rats decreased (p<0.05), followed by a remarkable elevation in HGF protein levels 2 (p<0.05) and 3 months (nonsignificant) after irradiation accompanied by the clinical appearance of radiation pneumonitis. Finally, HGF protein levels in the lung returned to their original level 6 months after thoracic irradiation. In humans, HGF protein levels in the BALF in the limited irradiated area were lower than those obtained from unirradiated areas (p<0.05). In conclusion, hepatocyte growth factor production is transiently suppressed in the irradiated area after irradiation.",Excluded

Background: To assess inter-observer variability in delineating target volume and organs at risk in benign tumor adjacent to optic tract as a quality assurance exercise. Method(s): We quantitatively analyzed 21 plans made by 11 clinicians in seven CyberKnife centers. The clinicians were provided with a raw data set (pituitary adenoma and meningioma) including clinical information, and were asked to delineate the lesions and create a treatment plan. Their contouring and plans (10 adenoma and 11 meningioma plans), were then compared. In addition, we estimated the influence of differences in contouring by superimposing the respective contours onto a default plan. Result(s): The median planning target volume (PTV) and the ratio of the largest to the smallest contoured volume were 9.22 cm3 (range, 7.17 - 14.3 cm3) and 1.99 for pituitary adenoma, and 6.86 cm3 (range 6.05 - 14.6 cm3) and 2.41 for meningioma. PTV volume was 10.1 +/- 1.74 cm3 for group 1 with a margin of 1 -2 mm around the CTV (n = 3) and 9.28 +/- 1.8 cm3(p = 0.51) for group 2 with no margin (n = 7) in pituitary adenoma. In meningioma, group 1 showed larger PTV volume (10.1 +/- 3.26 cm3) than group 2 (6.91 +/- 0.7 cm3, p = 0.03). All submitted plan keep the irradiated dose to optic tract within the range of 50 Gy (equivalent total doses in 2 Gy fractionation). However, contours superimposed onto the dose distribution of the default plan indicated that an excessive dose 23.64 Gy (up to 268% of the default plan) in pituitary adenoma and 24.84 Gy (131% of the default plan) in meningioma to the optic nerve in the contours from different contouring.

4790,"Characteristics, sources and health risk assessment of airborne particulate PAHs in Chinese cities: A review. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are organic compounds composed of at least two benzene rings. This paper reviews the characteristics, sources and health risk of airborne particulate PAHs in Chinese cities. The airborne particulate PAH concentrations varied from 3.35 to 910ngm-3, with an average of 75.0ngm-3, and the pollution level of PAHs in northern cities was generally higher than that in southern cities. The PAH concentrations in different cities underwent similar seasonal variations, with high concentrations in the winter and relatively low concentrations in the summer. Many factors, such as meteorological conditions and source emissions, influenced the spatiotemporal pattern of PAHs. High temperatures, frequent flow exchanges, abundant rainfall and strong solar radiation reduced the level of particulate PAHs in the atmosphere. The historical changes in the level of airborne particulate PAHs in four cities were analyzed. The PAH concentrations in Beijing and Taiyuan presented a trend of first increasing and then decreasing, while the level of particulate PAHs in Nanjing and Guangzhou had a decreasing tendency from year 2000-2015. The airborne particulate PAHs in cities were derived from several sources, including coal combustion, vehicle emissions, coking industries, biomass burning and petroleum volatilization. The results of a health risk assessment indicated that the incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) for people in the northern cities was higher than that for people in the other regions, especially during the cold season. Moreover, adults were at greater risk than people in other age groups, and the health risk to females was slightly higher than that to males. The potential risk of airborne particulate PAH exposure was relatively high in some cities, and controlling PAH emissions at the source should be required to prevent pollution.

4791,"A comparison between unilateral transverse process-pedicle and bilateral puncture techniques in percutaneous kyphoplasty. Study Design. A prospective comparative study. Objective. To assess the clinical and radiological outcomes for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures using unilateral transverse process-pedicle and bilateral percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP). Summary of Background Data. PKP is a widely used vertebral augmentation procedure for treating painful vertebral compression fractures. A percutaneous bilateral approach is typically used to access the vertebral body. Many previous studies have reported excellent clinical results with PKP. In contrast, numerous complications and problems have also been reported, such as puncture diffi culty, cement leakage, and adjacent vertebral fracture. Methods. This prospective study included 316 patients with singlelevel lumbar osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture, 224 females and 92 males with a mean age of 71.5 years. Randomized patients underwent PKP using 2 different puncture techniques. The patients were followed up postoperatively and were assessed mainly with regard to clinical and radiological outcomes. Clinical outcomes were evaluated mainly using the visual analogue scale for pain and 36- Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire for health status. Radiological outcomes were assessed mainly on the basis of radiation dose, bone cement distribution, vertebral body height, and kyphotic angle. Results. Patients were followed up from 12 to 28 months, with an average of 16.8 months. One hundred fi fty-eight patients were treated with unilateral method and 151 patients were treated with bilateral method. In the unilateral group, the volume of the injected cement and radiation dose were signifi cantly less than that in the bilateral group. All patients in both groups had signifi cantly less pain after the procedures, compared with their preoperative period pain. No statistically signifi cant differences were observed when visual analogue scale and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey were compared between the groups. Both unilateral and bilateral groups showed insignifi cant decrease in the kyphotic angle during the follow-ups. The kyphotic angle in the unilateral group improved more signifi cantly than in the bilateral group. In the bilateral group, 16 patients had obvious pain in the puncture sites at 1 month postoperatively caused by facet joint violation. With local block treatment, the pain disappeared in all patients at the last follow-up. Conclusion. Both bilateral and unilateral PKP are relatively safe and provide effective treatment for patients with painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture. However, unilateral PKP received less radiation dose and operation time, it also offered a higher degree of deformity correction and resulted in less complication than bilateral PKP.Copyright © 2014 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Excluded

The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic capability of hepatic dynamic CT with low-dose contrast material (420 mg I/kg body weight) at 80 kVp with that of the same modality performed with standard-dose contrast material at 120 kVp. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. We randomly assigned 111 patients (50 women, 61 men; mean age, 69.1 years) with known or suspected hepatocellular carcinoma and a body weight of 70 kg or less to one of two protocols. In the 80-kVp protocol, the contrast material (444 mg I/kg body weight) was delivered over 15 seconds at a tube voltage of 80 kVp. In the 120-kVp protocol, a contrast dose of 600 mg I/kg was delivered over 30 seconds at 120 kVp. Of the 111 patients, 38 had hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma. Using the Mann-Whitney U test, we compared the two protocols for the contrast-to-noise ratio of the tumors (difference between tumor attenuation and liver attenuation divided by noise in the liver) and the figure of merit (square of contrast-to-noise ratio divided by effective dose) of the tumors during the arterial phase of imaging. Effective doses also were compared. RESULTS. The contrast-to-noise ratio of the tumors was significantly higher with the 80-kVp than with the 120-kVp protocol (median, 5.3 vs 4.2; p = 0.04). The figure of merit also was significantly higher with the 80-kVp than with the 120-kVp protocol (10.2 vs 5.3, p = 0.02). The effective dose was significantly lower with the 80-kVp than with the 120-kVp protocol (2.97 vs 3.41 mSv, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION. With 80-kVp acquisition, the contrast-to-noise ratio and figure of merit of tumors during the arterial phase improved despite the lower contrast dose and radiation exposure. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded
4793,"Impact of 2.45 GHz Microwave Irradiation on the Fruit Fly, Drosophila melanogaster. The physiological and behavioral influences of 2.45 GHz microwaves on Drosophila melanogaster were examined. Standing waves transitioned into heat energy effectively when passing through the insect body. On the contrary, travelling waves did not transit into heat energy in the insect body. This indicated that there was no concern regarding the thermal effects of microwave irradiation for levels of daily usage. However, we detected genotoxicity and behavioral alterations associated with travelling wave irradiation, which can be attributed to the non-thermal effects of the waves. Electron spin resonance (ESR) revealed that fruit flies possessed paramagnetic substances in the body such as Fe3+, Cu2+, Mn2+, and organic radicals. The temperature dependent intensities of these paramagnetic substances indicated that females possessed more of the components susceptible to electromagnetic waves than males, and the behavioral tests supported the differences between the sexes.",Excluded
4794,"Pulmonary nodules: effect of adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) technique on performance of a computer-aided detection (CAD) system-comparison of performance between different-dose CT scans. PURPOSE: To evaluate the effects of ASIR on CAD system of pulmonary nodules using clinical routine-dose CT and lower-dose CT., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-five patients (body mass index, 22.17 +/- 4.37 kg/m(2)) were scanned by multidetector-row CT with tube currents (clinical routine-dose CT, automatically adjusted mA; lower-dose CT, 10 mA) and X-ray voltage (120 kVp). Each 0.625-mm-thick image was reconstructed at 0%-, 50%-, and 100%-ASIR: 0%-ASIR is reconstructed using only the filtered back-projection algorithm (FBP), while 100%-ASIR is reconstructed using the maximum ASIR and 50%-ASIR implies a blending of 50% FBP and ASIR. CAD output was compared retrospectively with the results of the reference standard which was established using a consensus panel of three radiologists. Data were analyzed using Bonferroni/Dunn's method. Radiation dose was calculated by multiplying dose-length product by conversion coefficient of 0.021., RESULTS: The consensus panel found 265 non-calcified nodules <= 30 mm (ground-glass opacity [GGO], 103; part-solid, 34; and solid, 128). CAD sensitivity was significantly higher at 100%-ASIR [clinical routine-dose CT, 71% (overall), 49% (GGO); lower-dose CT, 52% (overall), 67% (solid)] than at 0%-ASIR [clinical routine-dose CT, 54% (overall), 25% (GGO); lower-dose CT, 36% (overall), 50% (solid)] (p<0.001). Mean number of false-positive findings per examination was significantly higher at 100%-ASIR (clinical routine-dose CT, 8.5; lower-dose CT, 6.2) than at 0%-ASIR (clinical routine-dose CT, 4.6; lower-dose CT, 3.5; p<0.001). Effective doses were 10.77 +/- 3.41 mSv in clinical routine-dose CT and 2.67 +/- 0.17 mSv in lower-dose CT., CONCLUSION: CAD sensitivity at 100%-ASIR on lower-dose CT is almost equal to that at 0%-ASIR on clinical routine-dose CT. ASIR can increase CAD sensitivity despite increased false-positive findings. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
4795,"Radionuclide therapy in cancer patients with bone metastases. Aim: We submit our experience in the application of radionuclides for therapy of bone metastases of cancer patients with different foci of appearance of the cancer process: breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer and others. Material(s) and Method(s): In 167 patients with bone metastases we used 32-P in 71 patients and 89-Sr in 96 patients. 93 are women and 74 are men; 90 women are with cancer of the breast, 52- with prostate cancer, 24 are with lung cancer and 1 with renal cell carcinoma. All patients are observed for side effects when an application of a radiopharmaceutical is done-32-P per os and 89-Sr intravenous, as well as for the changes of haemoglobin, leucocyte and thrombocyte count. Result(s): One months after the radionuclide therapy we observed a significant reduction of the leucocyte and thrombocyte count in the group accepted 32-P (t = 3.83, p < 0.05; t = 5.29, p < 0.001). For the group, where 89-Sr is applied we did not calculate statistically significant decrease of the tested indicators mentioned above. At the same time the basic reason for which the radionuclides are applied- pain, decreases in intensity and patients return to their normal activity.This is more typical for patients with cancer of the breast and prostate cancer. Discussion(s): The serious symptom 'pain' is influenced by the not so high applied activity of 2 mCi of 32-P speaks in favour of the use of this radiophar-maceutic, although there is a resistance among authors of its application with regard to myelosuppression. According to our observations it is light, the blood indicators restore quickly even without special therapy and patients can take the advantage of this additional method to overcome pain syndrome. The intravenous applicaton of 89-Sr in activity of 4 mCi also influences pain in a very good way, but the price per patient is high and all patients wait for an reimbursement from the health insurance. This is a significant factor for wider use. The use of 32-P is cheaper but the delivery stopped and for the moment we can use only 89-Sr. Conclusion(s): The application of 32-P and 89-Sr is additional possibility for the treatment of pain due to bone metastases of cancer patients- easy and effective especially for those that are not treated effectively after local irradiation. The myelosuppressive effect is not statistically significant and both isotopes can be used successfully in the treatment of pain in cancer patients.",Excluded
4796,"Imaging quality and diagnostic reliability of low-dose computed tomography lumbar spine for evaluating patients with spinal disorders. BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Computed tomography (CT) scans of the lumbar spine (CTLS) have demonstrated a higher level of accuracy than plain films and have been used to assess patients with spinal disorder when magnetic resonance imaging is not available. Nevertheless, radiation exposure remains a serious safety concern. Iterative reconstruction (IR) decreases the CT radiation dose for diagnostic imaging. However, the feasibility of using IR in CTLS is unclear., PURPOSE: To evaluate the imaging quality and diagnostic reliability of CTLS with IR., STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study., PATIENT SAMPLE: All patients from outpatient departments who suffered from spinal disorders and were referred for CTLS., OUTCOME MEASURES: In acquired CT images, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the dural sac (DS), intervertebral disc (IVD), psoas muscle (PM), and L5 vertebral body, the contrast-to-noise ratio between the DS and IVD (D-D CNR), and the subjective imaging qualities were compared across groups. Interobserver agreement was evaluated with kappa values., METHODS: Patients receiving low radiation CTLS were divided into three groups. A 150 mAs tube current with 120 kVp tube voltage was used with Group A and a 230 mAs tube current with 100 kVp tube voltage with Group B. Intended end radiation exposure was 50% less than that of the control group. Tube modulation was active for all groups. The images of the two low-radiation groups were reconstructed by IR; those of the control group by filtered back-projection (FBP)., RESULTS: The SNRs of the DS, IVD, PM, BM, and D-D CNR of Group A were not inferior to those of the control group. All SNRs and D-D CNRs for Group B were inferior to those of the control group. Except for that of the facet joint, all subjective imaging ratings for anatomic regions were equivalent between Groups A and B. Interobserver agreement was highest for the control group (0.72-0.88), followed by Group A (0.69-0.83) and B (0.55-0.83)., CONCLUSIONS: Fifty percent tube current reduction combined with IR provides equivalent diagnostic accuracy and improved patient safety when compared with conventional CTLS. Our results support its use as a screening tool. With the tube modulation technique, further adjustments in weighting IR and FBP algorithms based on body mass index become unnecessary.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: Vertebroplasty is one of the effective methods for minimally invasive treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. Bone cement as the most commonly used filling material is disputed on its clinical effects of different viscosity. OBJECTIVE(S): To compare the efficacy and safety of different viscosity bone cement vertebroplasty in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. METHOD(S): One hundred and eighty-three patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture were randomly divided into four groups: percutaneous vertebroplasty with high viscosity bone cement group (group A), percutaneous vertebroplasty with low viscosity bone cement group (group B), percutaneous kyphoplasty with high viscosity bone cement group (group C), and percutaneous kyphoplasty with low viscosity bone cement group (group D). RESULTS AND CONCLUSION(S): (1) The operative time and X-ray exposure time were longer in the two low viscosity bone cement groups than the two corresponding high viscosity bone cement groups, respectively. (2) After operation, visual analogue scale scores and disability index scores were gradually decreased in the all the groups. Compared with the group A, the visual analogue scale score and disability index score were lower in the group C; compared with group B, the visual analogue scale score and disability index score were lower in the group D. (3) After operation, the kyphosis Cobb angle was gradually reduced and the sagittal index of injured vertebrae were gradually increased in all the groups. The postoperative Cobb angle value was ranked as follows: group A > group C > group D. (4) Compared with two low viscosity bone cement groups, two high viscosity bone cement group had lower incidence of adverse events. These findings indicate that high viscosity bone cement has better safety and effectiveness in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. The clinical efficacy of percutaneous kyphoplasty with high viscosity bone cement is the best among the four systems.Copyright © 2018, Journal of Clinical Rehabilitative Tissue Engineering Research.

BACKGROUND: Dye localization is a useful method for the resection of unidentifiable small pulmonary lesions. This study compares the transbronchial route with augmented fluoroscopic bronchoscopy (AFB) and conventional transthoracic CT-guided methods for preoperative dye localization in thoracoscopic surgery., METHODS: Between April 2015 and March 2019, a total of 231 patients with small pulmonary lesions who received preoperative dye localization via AFB or percutaneous CT-guided technique were enrolled in the study. A propensity-matched analysis, incorporating preoperative variables, was used to compare localization and surgical outcomes between the two groups., RESULTS: After matching, a total of 90 patients in the AFB group (N = 30) and CT-guided group (N = 60) were selected for analysis. No significant difference was noted in the demographic data between both the groups. Dye localization was successfully performed in 29 patients (96.7%) and 57 patients (95%) with AFB and CT-guided method, respectively. The localization duration (24.1 +/- 8.3 vs. 21.4 +/- 12.5 min, p = 0.297) and equivalent dose of radiation exposure (3.1 +/- 1.5 vs. 2.5 +/- 2.0 mSv, p = 0.130) were comparable in both the groups. No major procedure-related complications occurred in either group; however, a higher rate of pneumothorax (0 vs. 16.7%, p = 0.029) and focal intrapulmonary hemorrhage (3.3 vs. 26.7%, p = 0.008) was noted in the CT-guided group., CONCLUSION: AFB dye marking is an effective alternative for the preoperative localization of small pulmonary lesions, with a lower risk of procedure-related complications than the conventional CT-guided method.",Excluded

Method(s): Fifty cases of pancreatic carcinoma were chosen in the trial, 30 of them were treated by 125I seeds implantation accompanied with or without choledoenteroanastomosis and (or) gastrojejunostomy, and 20 cases treated with choas the choledoenteroanastomosis and (or) gastrojejunostomy. The peri-operative hepatic function, serum bilirubin, the size of the tumor, complications and the intensity of pain were observered. Result(s): The total bilirubin decreased to normal level 4 weeks after the operation, while the liver function recovered in the cases of both the groups. Nearly all the 30 of radiotherapy cases (100%) had a perfect remission of the abdominal and back painfulness, and the CR rate was 97%. No obvious complications occurred, and tumor seemed to be smaller then. Conclusion(s): 125I seeds implantation has an obvious therapeutic effect to those cases of unresectable pancreatic carcinoma. It can prolong the survival period, improve the quality of life, and relieve pain obviously.",Excluded
4801,"Convection enhanced delivery of carboplatin in combination with radiotherapy for the treatment of brain tumors. The purpose of this study was to further evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of convection enhanced delivery (CED) of carboplatin in combination with radiotherapy for treatment of the F98 rat glioma. Tumor cells were implanted stereotactically into the brains of syngeneic Fischer rats, and 13 or 17 d. later carboplatin (20 mug/10 mul) was administered by either CED over 30 min or by Alzet osmotic pumps (0.5 mug/mul/h for 168 h.) beginning at 7 d after tumor implantation. Rats were irradiated with a 15 Gy fractionated dose (5 Gy x 3) of 6 MV photons to the whole brain beginning on the day after drug administration. Other groups of rats received either carboplatin or X-irradiation alone. The tumor carboplatin concentration following CED of 20 mug in 10 mul was 10.4 mug/g, which was equal to that observed following i.v. administration of 100 mg/kg b.w. Rats bearing small tumors, treated with carboplatin and X-irradiation, had a mean survival time (MST) of 83.4 d following CED and 111.8 d following pump delivery with 40% of the latter surviving >180 d (i.e. cured) compared to 55.2 d for CED and 77.2 d. for pump delivery of carboplatin alone and 31.8 d and 24.2 d, respectively, for X-irradiated and untreated controls. There was no microscopic evidence of residual tumor in the brains of all long-term survivors. Not surprisingly, rats with large tumors had much shorter MSTs. Only modest increases in MSTs were observed in animals that received either oral administration or CED of temozolomide plus X-irradiation (23.2 d and 29.3 d) compared to X-irradiation alone. The present survival data, and those previously reported by us, are among the best ever obtained with the F98 glioma model. Initially, they could provide a platform for a Phase I clinical trial to evaluate the safety and potential therapeutic efficacy of CED of carboplatin in patients with recurrent glioblastomas, and ultimately a Phase II trial of carboplatin in combination with radiation therapy.",Excluded
4802,"Survival outcomes and patterns of failure after D2 dissection and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced gastric cancer: A retrospective study. objective: The goal of the study was to analyze the incidence and patterns of failure in patients with gastric cancer who received D2 dissection and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Method(s): From January 2004 to October 2015, 324 patients with gastric cancer who underwent radical D2 resection followed by postoperative CRT were enrolled. Clinicopathological characteristics and patterns of failure were retrospectively reviewed to identify factors associated with survival and recurrence. Result(s): After a median follow-up of 30 months, the 3-year overall survival and 3-year disease-free survival rates of these patients were 60.3 and 51.1%, respectively. 117 patients had recurrence or metastasis, with peritoneal recurrence as the most frequent (20.7%), followed by distant metastasis (14.2%). The most commonly involved distant organs were the liver (5.9%) and bone (4.9%). Locoregional failure occurred in 39 patients (12.0%), with isolated regional failure occurring in only 23 (7.1%). Further multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed N stage to be an independent risk factor for distant failure-free survival (p = 0.012). Independent risk factors for peritoneal metastasis were tumor differentiation (p = 0.022), T stage (p =0.035) and vascular invasion (p = 0.016). conclusion: Postoperative CRT has a potential effect on optimizing locoregional control, resulting in only 12.0% of locoregional failure. In patients after D2 resection and adjuvant CRT, peritoneal metastasis was the leading pattern of failure, followed by distant metastasis.Copyright © 2018 British Institute of Radiology.

4803,"Ancillary effect of three-dimensional printing technology applied in the orthopedic surgery of severe rigid kyphoscoliosis. BACKGROUND: For severe rigid kyphoscoliosis patients, due to severe spinal deformity, and high risk for orthopedic surgery, designing an individualized and precise placement and osteotomy scheme preoperatively is needed to reduce surgery risk. OBJECTIVE(S): To evaluate the clinical effect of three-dimensional (3D) printing applied in the orthopedic surgery for severe rigid kyphoscoliosis. METHOD(S): Thirty-two patients with severe rigid kyphoscoliosis from January 2015 to June 2017 were included. Sixteen cases underwent 3D-assisted osteotomy (preoperative spinal reconstruction by 3D printing, and designing rational osteotomy scheme, trial group), and other 16 cases received orthopedic surgery under X-ray (control group). The perioperative indexes, postoperative correction effect, accuracy of pedicle screw placement and incidence of complications were recorded. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION(S): The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, intraoperative fluoroscopy time, postoperative drainage, postoperative incidence of complications, postoperative scoliosis and kyphosis Cobb angle in the trial group were significantly lower than those in the control group, but the accuracy of pedicle screw placement, scoliosis and kyphosis corrective rate were significantly higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05). To conclude, based on 3D printing, an individualized and precise placement and osteotomy scheme is designed for severe rigid kyphoscoliosis, can improve the operation safety, reduce the trauma, and obtain satisfactory clinical outcomes.Copyright © 2018, Journal of Clinical Rehabilitative Tissue Engineering Research.

4804,"Impact of Radiation Dose on Survival for Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Treated With Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy. Purpose: Radiation dose used in the neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) for patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) varies in different trials and clinical practice. Methods and Materials: Data from patients diagnosed with ESCC receiving NCRT followed by esophagectomy were retrospectively collected from February 2013 to December 2017. Lower dose (LD) radiotherapy was defined as <=45 Gy, and >45 Gy was considered as higher dose (HD). Survival rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with long-rank test. Multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify variables associated with survival. Result(s): A total of 118 patients treated with NCRT were included in our analysis: 62 patients received LD radiotherapy, and 56 patients received HD radiotherapy. The median follow-up time was 24.3 months (0.67-65.3 m). Two-years overall survival (OS) rates were 75.0 and 79.0% in HD and LD group, respectively (P = 0.360), and complete pathological remission (pCR) rates in two groups were 42.9 and 30.6%, respectively (P = 0.17). The incidences of toxic effects including post-operative complications were not significantly different between two groups. Multivariate analysis showed that tumor T stage, M1a disease, smoking history, and pCR rate were significantly associated with OS. Conclusion(s): In ESCC patients treated with NCRT followed by surgery, higher radiation dose was not significantly associated with a higher pCR rate and longer survival. Lower radiation dose might be a preferable time-dose fraction scheme. Our finding needs to be further validated by randomized trials.© Copyright © 2020 Yang, Xu, Zhou, Bao, Zhang, Gu, Du, Chen and Qiu.",Excluded
4805,"Potential Functional Variants in DNA Repair Genes Are Associated with Efficacy and Toxicity of Radiotherapy in Patients with Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer. Background. Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths. Radiotherapy, either alone or with chemotherapy, is still the primary treatment for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). There are variations in how patients with NSCLC respond to radiotherapy and how toxic the therapy is. DNA repair gene polymorphisms are related to cancer development; however, their association with radiotherapy outcomes remains unknown. We hypothesized that gDNA repair gene variation could affect the efficacy and toxicity of radiotherapy in patients with NSCLC. Methods. A total of 486 histologically confirmed patients with NSCLC were recruited from the Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University from July 2015 to September 2019. Eleven potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in four DNA repair genes (XRCC1, XRCC2, XPD, and MSH2) were genotyped in these patients. A multiple factor logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between these SNPs and the efficacy and toxicity of radiotherapy. Results. Three SNPs, rs25487 (XRCC1), rs3218556 (XRCC2), and rs13181 (XPD), were all significantly associated with the efficacy of radiotherapy. The allele frequencies of the rs25487 CC genotype (OR = 0.457, 95% CI = 0.259-0.804, p=0.006) and the rs3218556 AG or AA genotypes (AG genotype: OR = 0.664, 95% CI = 0.442-0.999, p=0.049; AA genotype: OR = 0.380, 95% CI = 0.181-0.795, p=0.008) were both significantly higher in the response group than in the nonresponse group. For rs13181, the radiotherapy efficacy was associated with the heterozygous genotype GT (OR = 1.663, 95% CI = 1.057-2.614,p=0.027). Statistically significant associations between radiation-induced toxic reactions and rs25487 (XRCC1), rs3218556 (XRCC2), and rs13181 (XPD) were also observed. The rs13181GT genotype was associated with lower toxic reactions than the TT genotype (OR = 1.680, 95% CI = 1.035-2.728,p=0.035). Conclusions. The variants rs25487 (XRCC1), rs3218556 (XRCC2), and rs13181 (XPD) all contribute to the efficacy and toxicity of radiotherapy in patients with NSCLC. Our findings may clarify the predictive value of DNA repair genes for prognosis in patients with NSCLC after radiotherapy. Further investigation of more genes and samples should be performed to confirm our findings.Copyright © 2020 Zhiguang Yang and Zhaoyu Liu.",Excluded
4806,"Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound induces osteogenic differentiation of human periodontal ligament cells through activation of bone morphogenetic protein-smad signaling. OBJECTIVES: Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (US) can accelerate fracture healing and osteogenic differentiation. The aim of this study was to investigate the osteogenic effect of low-intensity pulsed US on human periodontal ligament cells and to determine whether bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-Smad signaling was involved., METHODS: Human periodontal ligament cells were exposed to low-intensity pulsed US at a frequency of 1.5 MHz and intensity of 90 mW/cm(2) for 20 min/d. Osteogenic differentiation was determined by assaying alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and calcium deposition. Expression of BMP-2, BMP-6, and BMP-9 was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. Phosphorylated Smad was detected by western blotting; Smad in the cells was labeled by an immunofluorescent antibody and observed by laser-scanning confocal microscopy., RESULTS: The optical density of ALP stimulated by US at 1.5 MHz and 90 mW/cm(2) for 20 min/d was significantly higher than in other groups (P < .01); therefore, this dosage was considered optimal for promoting osteogenic differentiation. After 13 days of US exposure, ALP increased gradually after 5 days, peaked at 11 days, and decreased at 13 days, with a significant difference compared with the control group (P < .05). Osteocalcin production increased from 9 to 13 days and peaked at 15 days, with a significant difference compared with the control group (P < .05). BMP-2 and BMP-6 increased dynamically after exposure for 13 days. BMP-2 increased 6.07-fold at 3 days, 6.39-fold at 11 days, and 5.97-fold at 13 days. BMP-6 expression increased 6.82-fold at 1 day and 51.5-fold at 3 days and decreased thereafter. BMP-9 was not expressed. Phospho-Smad1/5/8 expression was significantly increased after exposure (P< .05) and transferred from the cytoplasm into the nuclei., CONCLUSIONS: Low-intensity pulsed US effectively induced osteogenic differentiation of human periodontal ligament cells, and the BMP-Smad signaling pathway was involved in the mechanism.",Excluded
4807,"The biomechanical effects of 1.0 to 1.2 Mrad of gamma irradiation on human bone-patellar tendon-bone allografts. Recent data suggest that anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with irradiated allograft tissue may lead to increased failure rates. Low-dose (1.0-1.2 Mrad) gamma irradiation does not significantly alter the preimplantation biomechanical properties of bone-patellar tendon-bone (BTB) allografts. Controlled laboratory study. Cyclic and failure mechanical properties were evaluated for 20 paired central-third human BTB allografts, with and without 1.0 to 1.2 Mrad of gamma irradiation. Testing included cyclic loading at 0.5 Hz for 100 cycles from 50 to 200 N and failure testing at a strain rate of 10% per second. Cyclic elongation did not change significantly (P = .151) with irradiation, increasing from a mean +/- SD of 9.4 +/- 2.1 mm to 11.3 +/- 3.4 mm. Cyclic creep strain approached a significant increase with irradiation (1.3% +/- 0.8% to 2.6% +/- 1.5%; P = .076). Failure testing was not affected with irradiation with regard to maximum load (1680 +/- 417 mm to 1494 +/- 435 mm), maximum stress (40.8 +/- 10.6 MPa to 37.5 +/- 15.7 MPa), elongation (7.85 +/- 1.35 mm to 8.67 +/- 2.05 mm), or strain at maximum stress (0.158 +/- 0.03 to 0.175 +/- 0.03). Graft stiffness significantly decreased by 20% with irradiation (278 +/- 67 N/mm to 221 +/- 50 N/mm; P = .035). Low-dose (1.0-1.2 Mrad) gamma irradiation decreases BTB graft stiffness by 20%, but it does not affect other failure or cyclic parameters. Aside from graft stiffness during load to failure testing, low-dose (1.0-1.2 Mrad) gamma irradiation of central-third human BTB allografts is not deleterious to preimplantation biomechanical properties.",Included
4808,"Prevalence of incidental or unexpected findings on low-dose CT performed during routine SPECT/CT nuclear medicine studies. INTRODUCTION: In nuclear medicine, single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) is often combined with 'simultaneous' low-dose CT (LDCT) to provide complementary anatomical and functional correlation. As a consequence, numerous incidental and unexpected findings may be detected on LDCT. Recognition of these findings and appropriate determination of their relevance can add to the utility of SPECT/CT. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence and categorise the relevance of incidental and unexpected findings on LDCT scans performed as part of routine SPECT/CT studies., METHODS: All available LDCT scans performed as part of SPECT/CT studies at St. Vincent's Hospital Melbourne in the year 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Two qualified radiologists independently reviewed the studies and any previous available imaging and categorised any detected incidental findings., RESULTS: A total of 2447 LDCT studies were reviewed. The relevance of the findings was classified according to a modified version of a scale used in the Colonography Reporting and Data System: E1 = normal or normal variant (28.0%); E2 = clinically unimportant (63.5%); E3 = likely unimportant or incompletely characterised (6.2%); E4 = potentially important (2.5%)., CONCLUSION: Imaging specialists need to be cognisant of incidental and unexpected findings present on LDCT studies performed as part of SPECT/CT. Appropriate categorisation of findings and communication of potentially important findings to referring clinicians should form part of routine practice. The overall prevalence of potentially significant incidental and unexpected findings in our series was 8.7% (E3, 6.2%; E4, 2.5%) and was comparable to rates in other published imaging series.

4810,"Comparison of a safety strategy using transradial access and dual-axis rotational coronary angiography with transfemoral access and standard coronary angiography. Objectives We sought to investigate the radiation exposure and contrast utilization associated with using a strategy of transradial access and rotational angiography (radial-DARCA) compared to the traditional approach of transfemoral access and standard angiography (femoral-SA). Background There is an increased focus on optimizing patient safety during cardiac catheterization procedures. Professional guidelines have highlighted physician responsibility to minimize radiation doses and contrast volume. Dual axis rotational coronary angiography (DARCA) is the most recently investigated type of rotational angiography. This new technique permits complete visualization of the left or right coronary tree with a single injection, and is felt to reduce contrast and radiation exposure. Methods A total of 56 consecutive patients who underwent radial-DARCA were identified. From the same time period, an age- and gender-matched group of 61 patients who had femoral-SA were selected for comparison. Total volume of contrast agent used, fluoroscopy time, and 2 measures of radiation dose (dose area product and air kerma) were recorded for each group. Results Mean contrast agent use and patient radiation exposure of the radial-DARCA group were significantly less than that of the femoral-SA group. There was no significant difference in fluoroscopy time between the 2 groups. Conclusions Physicians can successfully employ an innovative safety strategy of transradial access combined with DARCA that is feasible and is associated with lower radiation doses and contrast volume than femoral artery access and traditional coronary angiography approach. © 2013, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded

Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of stereotactic radiotherapy combined with bevacizumab (SRT-Bv) compared with Bv treatment for recurrent high-grade gliomas (HGGs). Method(s): Data for patients with recurrent HGGs who received SRT and Bv (n = 29) or Bv (n = 29) between June 2014 and September 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients received conventional radiotherapy (total, 60 Gy) before this study. SRT was administered at a median dose of 42 Gy in 3-7 fractions. The recurrence pattern was classified into 3 groups: in-field, marginal, and out-field. Result(s): The median overall survival in the SRT-Bv group was significantly longer than that in the Bv group (10.4 vs. 5.6 months; P = 0.02). In patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type tumors, the SRT-Bv treatment significantly prolonged survival more than the Bv treatment (10.9 vs. 8.2 months; P = 0.01). The World Health Organization grade and presence or absence of SRT were significant prognostic factors in the univariate analysis. Besides brain edema in 2 cases and asymptomatic subdural hematoma in 1 case, no other severe adverse effect due to SRT-Bv treatment was recorded. The pattern of recurrence was as follows: in-field, 2 cases (7%); marginal, 8 cases (28%); out-field, 11 cases (38%); no recurrence on radiologic findings, 6 cases (21%); and uncertain, 2 cases (7%). Conclusion(s): SRT-Bv treatment significantly prolonged survival duration more than Bv treatment and provides good local control in patients with recurrent HGGs, especially those with isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type tumors.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
4813,"Differentiation between recurrent gliomas and radiation necrosis using arterial spin labeling perfusion imaging. Arterial spin labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion imaging has been proposed as an effective method to measure brain tumor perfusion. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the utility of this technique in the differentiation of recurrent gliomas from radiation necrosis. Twenty-one patients with surgically treated primary gliomas, including 16 cases of recurrent glioma and 5 of radiation necrosis were examined using 3.0T MR imaging (MRI). ASL and dynamic susceptibility contrast-weighted (DSC) perfusion MRI scans were performed. Maps of normalized cerebral blood flow (CBF) in ASL imaging and cerebral blood volume (CBV) in DSC imaging were computed and analyzed in the regions of interest. In cases of glioma recurrence, the normalized ASL-CBF ratio (4.45+/-2.72) was higher than that in cases of radiation injury (1.22+/-0.61) (P<0.01). The normalized DSC-relative CBV ratio was also significantly higher in glioma recurrence (3.38+/-2.08) than it was in radiation injury (1.09+/-0.55) (P<0.05). A close linear correlation was found between the ASL and DSC MRI techniques (linear regression coefficient, R=0.85; P=0.005) in the differentiation of recurrent glioma from radiation injury. The results indicate that ASL perfusion is an accurate method of distinguishing between glioma recurrence and radiation necrosis.Copyright © 2016, Spandidos Publications.

4814,"Improved discrimination between benign and malignant LDCT screening-detected lung nodules with dynamic over static 18F-FDG PET as a function of injected dose. Lung cancer mortality rate can be significantly reduced by up to 20% through routine low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening, which, however, has high sensitivity but low specificity, resulting in a high rate of false-positive nodules. Combining PET with CT may provide more accurate diagnosis for indeterminate screening-detected nodules. In this work, we investigated low-dose dynamic 18F-FDG PET in discrimination between benign and malignant nodules using a virtual clinical trial based on patient study with ground truth. Six patients with initial LDCT screening-detected lung nodules received 90min single-bed PET scans following a 10 mCi FDG injection. Low-dose static and dynamic images were generated from under-sampled list-mode data at various count levels (100%, 50%, 10%, 5%, and 1%). A virtual clinical trial was performed by adding nodule population variability, measurement noise, and static PET acquisition start time variability to the time activity curves (TACs) of the patient data. We used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to estimate the classification capability of standardized uptake value (SUV) and net uptake constant K i from their simulated benign and malignant distributions. Various scan durations and start times (t *) were investigated in dynamic Patlak analysis to optimize simplified acquisition protocols with a population-based input function (PBIF). The area under curve (AUC) of ROC analysis was higher with increased scan duration and earlier t *. Highly similar results were obtained using PBIF to those using image-derived input function (IDIF). The AUC value for K i using optimized t * and scan duration with 10% dose was higher than that for SUV with 100% dose. Our results suggest that dynamic PET with as little as 1 mCi FDG could provide discrimination between benign and malignant lung nodules with higher than 90% sensitivity and specificity for patients similar to the pilot and simulated population in this study, with LDCT screening-detected indeterminate lung nodules.",Excluded
4815,"Change of cathepsin K activity in human skin in vivo after chronic ultraviolet damage. Objective: Photoaging is histologically characterized by the accumulation of abnormal elastin-containing material and disorganization of decreased bundles of collagen fibers. The fundamental mechanisms are still poorly understood. So far, most of the photoaging studies are focused on matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). It was described that cathepsin K (catK) might play an important role in mediating intracellular elastin degradation.We hypothesize that catK may be related to ECM homeostasis in photoaging. We therefore studied the activity of catK in human skin in response to chronic SSR. Method(s): Eight healthy Chinese volunteers (4 males and 4 females) were enrolled in the study after signing an informed consent that was approved by the medical ethics committee in our hospital ([2009]2-2). They were 21 to 26 years old with Fitzpatrick skin phototypes III or IV. The untanned upper buttock region was used as the site for exposure. The random side of upper buttock region was exposed to 1 MED of SSR (spectrum of 290-400 nm, 30% UVA + 70% UVB) per exposure every day for 5 successive days/week for 6 weeks. The other side of the upper buttock received no irradiation as control.The specific cathepsin K substrate, z-Leu-Arg-7-amido-4-methyl coumarin, was used. The fluorescence which the cleavage product emitted was recorded at 360 nm. The activity of catK was determined by the intensity of the fluorescence. All measurements were done in triplicate. Statistical significance was determined by using the paired samples t test. Calculations were performed using SPSS 17.0. Statistical significance was set at P<.05. Result(s): Chronic SSR exposure for 6 weeks induced a significant clinical and histologic change of chronic photodamage. The result showed that the average activity of the SSR-induced group was (8.09 +/- 5.22) 3 10-3 (nmol/mg * min) while that of the control group was (117.54 +/-39.01) x10-3 (nmol/mg * min). These data suggest that catK activity of the SSR-induced skin was obviously decreased compared to the normal control skin (P<.001). Conclusion(s): Our data suggest that catK is related to photoaging, probably the process of solar elastosis.We propose that the decrease of catK activity might lead to a decline of elastin degradation and subsequent accumulation of elastin in the extracellular space.",Excluded

OBJECTIVES: The local control of patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma is still unsatisfactory. This prospective study was designed to evaluate the treatment outcomes and treatment-related complications of patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated with escalated radiation doses., METHODS: A total of 118 consecutive patients with T4 classification (1992 American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system), histology-proven nonmetastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma were treated with radiotherapy alone between 1992 and 1997 in a medical center in southern Taiwan. Thirty-two of them were enrolled into a prospective study of dose escalation and were irradiated to a total of 81 Gy. The other 86 patients received a total of 70.2 Gy. Potentially significant patient-related and treatment-related parameters were analyzed for their prognostic significance. Radiation-related complications were recorded and analyzed., RESULTS: The 5-year local progression-free rates were 61%, and 61% for patients receiving 70.2 Gy and 81 Gy, respectively (P > 0.05).

4818,"Sexual Function, Quality of Life, and Mood After Radiation Therapy in Patients with Anal Cancer. PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE(S): Definitive chemoradiation (CRT) results in high cure rates of anal cancer, with advanced radiation (RT) techniques improving toxicity. However, there is limited data regarding these patients' sexual function (SF), quality of life (QOL), and mood. We hypothesized that anal cancer treatment would result in detrimental effects on SF, QOL, and mood., MATERIALS/METHODS: We prospectively surveyed patients with anal cancer treated with definitive CRT. We assessed SF for women with the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and for men with the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). For all patients, we assessed QOL using EORTC QLQ-C30 and CR29 and mood using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). We reported descriptive statistics for SF, QOL, and mood and used univariate analysis to evaluate predictors of SF for women., RESULTS: Of 50 eligible patients, 84% completed the surveys. Median time from RT until survey was 36 months (1-97 months). Women (n = 34) reported poor SF overall (mean FSFI score = 15, scale 2-36, standard deviation (SD) 10.4). Most women reported poor SF related to satisfaction, desire, orgasm, arousal, pain, and lubrication. Men (n = 8) also had poor overall satisfaction (mean IIEF score = 6.1, scale 2-10, SD 3.6). Men reported poor erectile function and lower satisfaction with intercourse. Mean QLQ-C30 QOL score was 86.5 (SD 16.3). Results from EORTC QLQ-CR-20 demonstrated patients experienced poor sexual interest.

4819,"Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes protein 1: Role in Genome Stability and Tumorigenesis. SMC1 (Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes protein 1), well known as one of the SMC superfamily members, has been explored to function in many activities including chromosome dynamics, cell cycle checkpoint, DNA damage repair and genome stability. Upon being properly assembled as part of cohesin, SMC1 can be phosphorylated by ATM and mediate downstream DNA damage repair after ionizing irradiation. Abnormal gene expression or mutation of SMC1 can cause defect in the DNA damage repair pathway, which has been strongly associated with tumorigenesis. Here we focus to discuss SMC1's role in genome stability maintenance and tumorigenesis. Deciphering the underlying molecular mechanism can provide insight into novel strategies for cancer treatment.",Excluded
4820,"Optic radiation tractography and visual field deficits in laser interstitial thermal therapy for amygdalohippocampectomy in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Background/Aims: Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) has become an alternative to open-resective surgery for refractory mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). Occurrence of visual field defects (VFDs) following open surgery for MTLE is reported at 52-100%. We examined the rate of VFDs following LITT for amygdalohippocampectomy (AHE) and correlated the occurrence of VFDs with damage to the optic radiations, assessed by diffusion tensor tractography (DTI). Method(s): We performed a retrospective analysis of 5 patients who underwent LITT-AHE for medically refractory MTLE. We examined the association between VFDs and optic radiation damage by correlating postprocedural visual field testing with qualitative assessment of optic radiation fiber tracts. Result(s): Postoperative assessments showed that 4 patients had normal visual field testing, and 1 had a right superior quadrantanopsia (20%). We performed 3-dimensional reconstruction of the optic radiation, laser probe trajectory, and ablation volume. Damage to Meyer's loop was determined consistent with the VFD. Conclusion(s): Short-term follow-up in our series suggests that laser ablation AHE may be associated with a lower rate of VFD than has been reported for open AHE. Our results suggest that incorporating optic radiation mapping through DTI may preoperatively help to minimize the risk of VFD following laser ablation AHE.Copyright © 2017 S.

4821,"Damage of nasal mucociliary movement after intensity-modulated radiation therapy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Radiation usually results in paranasal sinusitis in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), which influences patients' quality of life. This study aimed to determine the relationships between dose distribution in the nasal cavity and nasal mucous injury in patients with NPC treated by intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and to find the tolerable radiation dose for the nasal mucous., METHODS: Sixty-six patients with NPC treated by IMRT between October 2006 and November 2008 were enrolled. The irradiation dose in the nasal cavity was determined by the computer with the IMRT work platform. Mucociliary transport rate (MTR) was detected by modified saccharine test before IMRT, at the end of IMRT, and at 3, 6, and 12 months after IMRT., RESULTS: The data were available for 129 nasal cavities. The cavities receiving a mean dose below or equal to 37 Gy showed substantial preservation of nasal mucous after IMRT. The MRT decreased to (62.82 +/- 38.59)%, (56.78 +/- 37.79)%, (64.05 +/- 39.37)%, and (71.13 +/- 39.55)% of pre-IMRT value at 4 time points after IMRT, with significant differences among the data (P < 0.05). In contrast, when the cavities received a mean dose higher than 37 Gy, no significant differences in MTR among the time points were observed. At 3 months after IMRT, the MTR was the lowest (38.27% of pre-RT value)., CONCLUSIONS: A mean radiation dose of <= 37 Gy for the nasal cavity is an optimal dose to protect the nasal cavity function.",Excluded
4822,"Numerical simulation of pressure waves in the cochlea induced by a microwave pulse. The pressure waves developing at the cochlea by the irradiation of the body with a plane wave microwave pulse are obtained by numerical simulation, employing a two-step finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) algorithm. First, the specific absorption rate (SAR) distribution is obtained by solving the Maxwell equations on a FDTD grid. Second, the temperature rise due to this SAR distribution is used to formulate the thermoelastic equations of motion, which are discretized and solved by the FDTD method. The calculations are performed for anatomically based full body human models, as well as for a head model. The dependence of the pressure amplitude at the cochlea on the frequency, the direction of propagation, and the polarization of the incident electromagnetic radiation, as well as on the pulse width, was investigated.Copyright © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
4823,"Salvage stereotactic radiosurgery with adjuvant use of bevacizumab for heavily treated recurrent brain metastases: a preliminary report. It is not uncommon for brain metastasis (BM) treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to demonstrate radiographic enlargement, with the patient developing neurological deficits attributable to a lesion at the site of SRS. The management of both local recurrence and radiation-induced necrosis (RN) poses a significant therapeutic dilemma, if surgical resection is not feasible, and effective therapies have yet to be established. This preliminary study introduces our initial experience with salvage SRS using adjuvant bevacizumab for this refractory entity. We retrospectively reviewed five patients who had received salvage SRS using adjuvant bevacizumab for recurrent BM complicated by RN. The diagnosis was based on clinical features, serial imaging studies and/or histopathological findings. Patients underwent salvage SRS followed by the first cycle of bevacizumab (7.5-10 mg/kg intravenous). Bevacizumab was repeated every 3-4 weeks until tumor progression or significant toxic events. The number of bevacizumab doses ranged from 2 to 16 (median 4). Follow-up MR imaging demonstrated a clear radiographic response in all lesions. Neurological symptoms improved in three patients and stabilized in two. In two patients, bevacizumab treatment was discontinued due to anemia and gastrointestinal bleeding, respectively. At the time of data analysis, four patients had died and the other was still alive. The causes of death were neurological decline and systemic disease progression in two patients each. Salvage SRS with adjuvant bevacizumab use appeared to provide an adequate radiographic response as well as neurological palliation for selected patients with heavily treated recurrent BM complicated by RN.Copyright © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Excluded

Purpose The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels in improving the performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the prediction of pathologic response after the neoadjuvant chemoradiation (NCRT) for patients with rectal cancer. Materials and Methods We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 524 rectal cancer patients who underwent NCRT and total mesorectal excision between January 2009 and December 2014. The performances of MRI with or without CEA parameters (initial CEA and CEA dynamics) for prediction of pathologic tumor response grade (pTRG) were compared by receiver-operating characteristic analysis with DeLong s method. Cox regression was used to identify the independent factors associated to pTRG and disease-free survival (DFS) after NCRT. Results The median follow-up was 64.0 months (range, 3.0 to 113.0 months). On multivariate analysis, poor tumor regression grade on MRI (mrTRG; p < 0.001), initial CEA (p < 0.001) and the mesorectal fascia involvement on MRI before NCRT (mrMFI; p=0.054) showed association with poor pTRG. The mrTRG plus CEA parameters showed significantly improved performances in the prediction of pTRG than mrTRG alone. All of mrTRG, mrMFI, and initial CEA were also identified as independent factors associated with DFS. The initial CEA further discriminated DFS in the subgroups with good mrTRG or that without mrMFI. Conclusion The CEA parameters significantly improved the performance of MRI in the prediction of pTRG after NCRT for patients with rectal cancer. The DFS was further discriminated by initial CEA level in the groups with favorable MRI parameters.Copyright ©2020 by the Korean Cancer Association.",Excluded
4826,"Alterations in expression and structure of the DNA repair gene XRCC1. The repair-associated gene XRCC1 was previously cloned by complementing the hamster mutant EM9, which has a high rate of spontaneous SCE and hypersensitivity to DNA damaging agents. In analyzing XRCC1 gene expression, similar levels of steady-state mRNA were found in normal cells, Bloom's syndrome cells with altered SCE, and in squamous carcinoma cells with differential X-ray sensitivity. An EcoRI restriction fragment-length polymorphism previously identified in XRCC1 did not correlate with the repair phenotypes of these cells. The mRNA of XRCC1 decreased to 20-40% after treatment of cells with a DNA damaging agent. XRCC1 also showed tissue specific expression in rats. The mRNA levels were high in testis (7-8 fold), ovary (3-4 fold) and brain (4-5 fold), when compared with those in intestine, liver and spleen (1-2 fold). These data and the high levels of XRCC1 protein detected in testis indicate that XRCC1 may play an important role in DNA processing during meiogenesis and recombination in germ cells.",Excluded

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of autologous platelet and plasma adhesives (APA) on postoperative drainage and soft-tissue fibrosis following neck dissections., DESIGN: This was a blinded comparative prospective cohort study done as two parts: part one evaluated early post-surgical outcomes and part two evaluated late tissue fibrosis., METHOD: Salvage neck dissections were stratified into two groups based on severity of prior treatment. High risk patients were defined as those who had previously undergone chemoradiation therapy and autologous platelet adhesives were administered to the surgical wound intraoperatively. The low risk group consisted of patients undergoing salvage neck dissections following radiation only and acted as controls. Part one evaluated postsurgical wound drainage as the primary outcome as well as length of hospital stay and complications. Part two evaluated late postoperative tissue fibrosis by comparing neck skin using the Cutometer. R2 and F0 were the specific Cutometer parameters for quantifying the viscoelastic properties of the skin., RESULTS: Postoperative wound drainage was significantly less (253.7 vs. 345.8) in the autologous platelet adhesive group as compared to the control group (p less than 0.03). Length of stay in the APA group versus the control group was 3.13 and 3.86 days respectively (p less than 0.004). Both R2 and F0 measurements showed improved viscoelastic properties of the skin in the APA group (R2 p less than 0.05, F0 p less than 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: APA application following salvage neck dissections may reduce early postperative wound drainage and improve long-term skin quality.",Excluded
4828,"Reproducibility of trial-based functional MRI on motor imagery. The investigation of the reproducibility in functional MRI (fMRI) is an important step in the quantification and analysis of paradigm-related brain activation. This article reports on reproducibility of cortical activation characterized by repeated fMRI runs (10 times) during the performance of a motor imagery and a passive auditory stimulation as a control task. Two parameters, the size of activation and BOLD signal contrast, were measured from regions-of-interest for 10 subjects across different threshold conditions. The variability of these parameters was normalized with respect to the mean obtained from 10 runs, and represented as the intrasession variability. It was found that the variability was significantly lower in the measurement of BOLD signal contrast as compared to the measurement of the size of activation. The variability of the activation volume measurement was greater in the motor imagery task than in the auditory tasks across all thresholds. This task-dependent difference was not apparent from the measurement of the BOLD signal contrast. The presence of threshold dependence in the variability measurement was also examined, but no such dependency was found. The results suggest that a measurement of BOLD signal itself is a more reliable indicator of paradigm-related brain activation during repeated fMRI scans.",Excluded

We investigated their use as potential biomarkers to identify individuals exposed to ionizing radiation. We collected exfoliated oral epithelial cell samples from 100 healthy individuals undergoing routine dental radiographic examination (2.34 cGy) both before and after the radiograph using a non-invasive technique. The expression levels of pChk2 and gamma-H2AX in oral cells were assessed by immunohistochemical assay. Both biomarkers showed statistically significant increases in levels of expression after the radiation exposure (P < 0.001). This suggests that pChk2 and gamma-H2AX may serve as sensitive indicators of low-dose radiation exposure.",Included

Purpose: To prospectively evaluate accuracy of arterial phase multi-detector row helical computed tomography (CT) for detection and localization of acute massive gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, with angiography as reference standard. Material(s) and Method(s): Institutional review board approved this study; written informed consent was obtained from each patient or patient's family after procedures, including radiation dose, were explained. Twenty-six consecutive patients (17 men, nine women; age range, 18-89 years) had acute massive GI bleeding (defined as requirement of transfusion of at least 4 units of blood during 24 hours in the hospital or as hypotension with systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg) and underwent arterial phase multi-detector row CT before angiography. Scans were obtained during arterial phase to identify extravasation of contrast material with attenuation greater than 90 HU within bowel lumen; this finding was considered diagnostic for active GI bleeding. Presence of contrast medium extravasation in each anatomic location was recorded. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy of multi-detector row CT for detection of acute GI bleeding were assessed. Accuracy for localization of acute GI bleeding was assessed by comparing locations of active bleeding at both multi-detector row CT and angiography in each patient who had active bleeding. Result(s): Arterial phase multi-detector row CT deplicted extravasation of contrast material in 21 of 26 patients. Overall location-based sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive and negative predictive values of multi-detector row CT for detection of GI bleeding were 90.9% (20 of 22), 99% (107 of 109), respectively. Overall patient-based accuracy of multi-detector row CT for detection of acute GI bleeding was 88.5% (23 of 26). The location of contrast material extravasation on multi-detector row CT scans corresponded exactly to that of active bleeding on angiograms in all patients with contrast medium extravasation at both multi-detector row CT and angiography. Conclusion(s): Arterial phase multi-detector row CT is accurate for detection and localization of bleeding sites in patients with acute massive GI bleeding. © RSNA, 2006.",Excluded

Background: The prognostic value of the tumor burden characterized by the metabolic tumor volume (MTV) remains under investigation in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and MTV according to metabolic volume threshold as measured by positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT), and other clinical factors, in patients with NPC. Method(s): This study was a retrospective chart review. We evaluated the association of SUVmax, MTV2.5, MTV3.0, and other clinical factors with overall survival (OS) using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression models. (MTV2.5 and MTV3.0 are the volume of hypermetabolic tissue within the regions of gross tumor volumes with a SUV value greater than the threshold values of 2.5 and 3.0, respectively.) Results: Higher MTV2.5 of 31.45 cm3 and MTV3.0 of 23.01 cm3 were associated with an increased risk of death (hazard ratio [HR] = 5.028; p = 0.029), although no significant relationship was found between SUVmax and OS. Interestingly, MTV3.0 was associated with OS in both the differentiated and undifferentiated groups, although MTV2.5 was only associated with OS in the undifferentiated group. Among the clinical parameters, only radiotherapy was associated with longer OS (HR = 12.124; p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): The MTV and radiotherapy could be prognostic values associated with OS. Particularly, MTV2.5 and MTV3.0 might be valuable metabolic parameters for predicting long-term survival in patients with NPC. Furthermore, MTV3.0 may be more useful because it can be applied irrespective of pathologic subtype.Copyright © 2014 ARS-AAOA, LLC.",Excluded
4832,"Radiation-dose response of glycophorin A somatic mutation in erythrocytes associated with gene polymorphisms of p53 binding protein 1. Information on individual variations in response to ionizing radiation is still quite limited. Previous studies of atomic-bomb survivors revealed that somatic mutations at the glycophorin A (GPA) gene locus in erythrocytes were significantly elevated with radiation exposure dose, and that the dose response was significantly higher in survivors with subsequent cancer development compared to those without cancer development. Noteworthy in these studies were great inter-individual differences in GPA mutant fraction even in persons with similar radiation doses. It is hypothesized that persistent GPA mutations in erythrocytes of atomic-bomb survivors are derived from those in long-lived hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) populations, and that individual genetic backgrounds, specifically related to DNA double-strand break repair, contribute to individual differences in HSC mutability following radiation exposure. Thus, we examined the relationship between radiation exposure, GPA mutant fraction in erythrocytes, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the key gene involved in DNA double-strand break repair, p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1). 53BP1 SNPs and inferred haplotypes demonstrated a significant interaction with radiation dose, suggesting that radiation-dose response of GPA somatic mutation is partly dependent on 53BP1 genotype. It is also possible that 53BP1 plays a significant role in DNA double-strand break repair in HSCs following radiation exposure. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded

To investigate the influence of a 3D image-based treatment-planning method for high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy (HDR-ISBT) for mobile tongue cancer, we analyzed dose-volume histogram results for the clinical target volume (CTV) and the mandible. Between October 2010 and November 2011, one and four patients having T2 and T3 tumors, respectively, were treated with HDR-ISBT. Multiplane implantation using 9-15 treatment applicators was performed. Lugol's iodine staining, metal markers, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging were used to identify the contours of the gross tumor volume (defined as the CTV). The results of the image-based treatment plan were compared with those of the conventional simulated plan on the basis of a reference point 5 mm from the applicator position. The mean D90(CTV) and V100(CTV) were 112% of the prescribed dose (PD) and 98.1%PD, respectively, for the image-based plan, and 113%PD and 97.2%PD, respectively, for the conventional plan.

Background: For esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) with submucosal (SM) invasion, surgery is the standard treatment. Definitive chemoradiotherapy (D-CRT) is a less invasive alternative option, but sometimes results in locoregional failure. Aim(s): To examine whether endoscopic resection for primary lesion removal combined with chemoradiotherapy (ER-CRT) reduces locoregional failure rates in cases of ESCC with SM invasion. Method(s): We retrospectively compared clinical outcomes between ER-CRT and D-CRT in patients diagnosed with ESCC with SM invasion between 2003 and 2014. Twenty-one patients underwent ER-CRT based on a pathological diagnosis, and 43 patients underwent D-CRT based on a clinical diagnosis. Result(s): Locoregional failure developed in 26% of patients in the D-CRT group, and in no patients in the ER-CRT group (p < 0.01). Thus, the 5-year relapse-free survival in the ER-CRT group was significantly more favorable than that in the D-CRT group (85.1% vs 59.2%; p < 0.05), although there was no difference in overall survival (85.1% vs 79.1%) nor in cause-specific survival (90.5% vs 87.2%) between the groups. There were no instances of perforation or hemorrhage associated with ER.

The study included 15 patients. The prescribed doses included a standard dose (50.4 Gy) and a high dose (60 Gy) for the planning target volume (PTV) of the involved lesions. The objective of the whole lung volume receiving >= 20 Gy (V20Gy) was < 30%, and the mean lung dose (MLD) was < 20 Gy. The volumes of the lung receiving 5 Gy (V5Gy) and the heart receiving 30-50 Gy (V30-50Gy) were kept as low as reasonably achievable. As a result, SIB-VMAT showed superior dose conformity for the PTV (p<0.001). Although the lung V5Gy was significantly increased (p<0.001), the V20Gy and MLD showed no significant increase.

GroupB had lower image noise, higher attenuation, higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and higher subjective score than did group A (each P < 0.01). Computed tomographic values had negative correlations with BMI for the head, neck, and shoulders in both groups A and B (each P < 0.01). Image noise, SNR, and CNR had no correlations with BMI for the head and neck in both groups (each P > 0.01). On the contrary, image noise had a positive correlation, and SNR and CNR had a negative correlations with BMI for the shoulders in group A (each P < 0.01), but in contrast, no such correlations were found in group B (each P > 0.01). Conclusion(s): In craniocervical CTA, ASIR can improve the image quality and reduce radiation dose in patients. Furthermore, ASIR reduced the variances of image quality of different body sizes in the shoulders.Copyright © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
4843,"The in situ repair kinetics of epidermal thymine dimers and 6-4 photoproducts in human skin types I and II. We assessed the in situ time-dependent loss of epidermal thymine dimers and 6-4 photoproducts in skin types I and II after exposure to two minimal erythema doses of solar-simulating radiation on previously unexposed buttock skin. Using quantitative image analysis, we evaluated biopsy sections stained with monoclonal antibodies. We then made comparisons, in the same volunteers, with unscheduled DNA synthesis, which is a direct marker of overall excision repair. Removal of thymine dimers was slow (half-life = 33.3 h), with high levels of lesions still present 24 h post-irradiation; some lesions were still present at 7 d. In contrast, removal of 6-4 photoproducts was rapid (half-life = 2.3 h), the decay kinetics of which correlated better with the decline in epidermal unscheduled DNA synthesis (half-life = 7.1 h). These data show that as in mouse, monkey, and in vitro models, the 6-4 photolesion is repaired preferentially in human epidermis in situ. They also raise the possibility that poor thymine dimer repair may be a feature of skin types I and II, who are more prone to skin cancer than are types III and IV. There was an inverse relationship between the onset of erythema and 6-4 photoproduct repair, suggesting that this repair process initiates erythema.",Excluded
4844,"Generation of boundary manikin anthropometry. The purpose of this study was to develop 3D digital 'boundary manikins' that are representative of the anthropometry of a unique population. These digital manikins can be used by designers to verify and validate that the components of the spacesuit design satisfy the requirements specified in the Human Systems Integration Requirements (HSIR) document. Currently, the HSIR requires the next generation space suit to accommodate the 1st percentile American female to the 99th percentile American male. The manikin anthropometry was derived using two methods: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Whole Body Posture Based Analysis (WBPBA). PCA is a statistical method for reducing a multidimensional data set by using eigenvectors and eigenvalues. The goal was to create a reduced data set that encapsulates the majority of the variation in the population. WBPBA is a multivariate analytical approach that was developed by the Anthropometry and Biomechanics Facility (ABF) to identify the extremes of a population for a given body posture. WBPBA is a simulation-based method that finds extremes in a population based upon anthropometry and posture; whereas PCA is based solely on anthropometry. Both methods yielded a list of subjects and their anthropometry from a target population; PCA resulted in 20 female and 22 male subjects' anthropometry and WBPBA resulted in 7 subjects' anthropometry representing the extreme subjects in the target population. The subjects' anthropometry was then used to 'morph' a baseline digital scan of a person with the same body type to create a 3D digital model that can be used as a tool for designers.

4845,"Tactile influences on astronaut visual spatial orientation: human neurovestibular studies on SLS-2. Human spatial orientation in spaceflight is initially disturbed by the absence of usable graviceptor information from the otolithic organs. Experiments measuring astronaut visually induced motion (vection) strength on various flight days during the first 10 days of the Spacelab Life Sciences-2 mission demonstrated two new phenomena in addition to confirming the initial increased weighting of visual and localized tactile cues. The reliance on tactile and visual noninertial cues apparently declined after a week in space, as the crew became able to utilize their internal reference frame. Subjects also showed that even nondirectional tactile cues served as a direction anchor and inhibited visually induced roll sensation relative to a new loosely tethered test condition. Individual perceptual styles were again revealed among the four astronauts tested. The readaptation to 1 G similarly shows a period of reinterpretation of inertial and visual cues to spatial orientation. The results are discussed in terms of an internal-model representation of body orientation, with time-varying weights applied to extrinsic and intrinsic signals.",Excluded

Eustachian tube function tests were performed in 34 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma before and after irradiation. Tubal dysfunction prior to irradiation in these patients was due to functional impairment. However, tubal dysfunction after irradiation was due to both organic obstruction and functional impairment. Organic obstruction of the tube was found to be severe with higher dosages of irradiation (to 80 Gy) resulting in subsequent otitis media. In our experience, higher doses of irradiation should be avoided if possible, but insertion of a ventilation tube should be done if a high dose of irradiation is planned.",Excluded

This study aims to determine the mean posterior condylar angle (PCA) in the included population and its relation to coronal alignment; and to know the clinical importance of the use of preoperative computed tomography (CT) scan in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). We randomized 50 patients with primary knee osteoarthritis into 2 groups. We used CT scan axial images to measure the PCA. In the first group we followed the CT scan plan (group 1), but in the second we did not follow the plan and adjusted rotation to the standard three degrees (group 2). The mean age of the included patients was 63 years. The radiological data of the included patients showed 5 patients with valgus deformity and 45 patients with varus deformity with the mean coronal alignment of 7.5 degrees. CT scan showed the mean PCA of 3.7 degrees (1.3 degrees). The axial knee postoperative X-ray showed the mean patellar tilt angle of 2.1 degrees (0.5 degrees) and 1.9 degrees (0.5 degrees) in groups 1 and 2, respectively. The congruence angle was 4 degrees (2.6 degrees) in group 1 and 5.5 degrees (3.2 degrees) in group 2. The median Knee Society functional score in group 1 was 85 (12), while it was 84 (7.5) in group 2. The median postoperative Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index score in group 1 was 84 (18.6) whereas 80.2 (13.6) in group 2.

4848,"YWHAZ amplification/overexpression defines aggressive bladder cancer and contributes to chemo-/radio-resistance by suppressing caspase-mediated apoptosis. The objective of this study was to characterize the oncogenic actions of a recently identified cancer-associated gene YWHAZ (also named as 14-3-3 zeta/delta) in urothelial carcinomas of the urinary bladder (UCUB). A genome-wide study revealed YWHAZ to be involved in the amplicon at 8q22.3, and its genetic amplification was detected predominantly in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). Immunohistochemical staining confirmed the association of YWHAZ overexpression with higher tumor stages, lymph node/vascular invasion, and mitotic activity. Univariate and multivariate analyses further indicated the prognostic potential of YWHAZ for more aggressive cancer types. Both gene set enrichment analysis and STRING network studies suggested involvement of YWHAZ in regulating caspase-mediated apoptosis. Ectopic expression of YWHAZ in bladder cells with low endogenous YWHAZ levels boosted cell resistance to doxorubicin and cisplatin, as well as to ionizing radiation. Conversely, YWHAZ-knockdown using specific shRNA in cells with high endogenous YWHAZ levels diminished survival activity, suppressing cell growth and increasing cell death. Our findings confirm the essential role played by YWHAZ in sustaining cell proliferation during chemo/radiotherapy. Treatments based on anti-YWHAZ strategies may thus be beneficial for UCUB patients overexpressing YWHAZ. © 2019 The Authors.

4849,"Schwann cell engraftment into injured peripheral nerve prevents changes in action potential properties. Peripheral nerve injury results in changes in action potential waveform, ion channel organization, and firing properties of primary afferent neurons. It has been suggested that these changes are the result of reduction in basal trophic support from skin targets. Subcutaneous injections of Fluro-Gold (FG) in the hind limb of the rat were used to identify cutaneous primary afferent neurons. Five days after FG injection, sciatic nerves were ligated and encapsulated in a silicon tube allowing neuroma formation. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing Schwann cells (SCs) were injected proximal to the cut end of the nerve. Thirteen to 22 days after injury and SC injection, the L4 and L5 dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were prepared for acute culture. Whole cell patch-clamp recordings in current clamp mode were obtained and action potential properties of medium-sized (34-45 microm) FG+ DRG neurons were characterized. In the neuroma group without cell transplantation, action potential duration and spike inflections were reduced as were the amplitude and duration of spike afterhyperpolarizations. These changes were not observed after transection by nerve crush where axons were allowed to regenerate to distal peripheral targets. In the transplantation group, GFP(+)-SCs were extensively distributed throughout the neuroma, and oriented longitudinally along axons proximal to the neuroma. Changes in action potential properties were attenuated in the GFP(+)-SC group. Thus the engrafted SC procedure ameliorated the changes in action potential waveform of cutaneous primary afferents associated with target disconnection and neuroma formation.",Excluded
4850,"Prevalence of anxiety in patients awaiting diagnostic procedures in an oncology center in Brazil. Objective: Anxiety disorders have been shown to undermine the quality of life of cancer patients. Unfortunately, medical professionals often neglect to screen for anxiety in their patients. The aim of the present study was to describe the prevalence of anxiety in patients awaiting diagnostic procedures in an oncology center waiting room, and to investigate possible relationships between anxiety and demographic and clinical variables. Method(s): A cross-sectional study was performed with 398 patients who completed a self-administered questionnaire containing the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Result(s): Results of the HADS indicated that 38% of participants had anxiety, while data from the STAI showed that 46% had either high state or trait anxiety. The most frequently cited source of anxiety was concern over test results. Age, gender, employment status, and education level were correlated with anxiety. Conclusion(s): The prevalence of anxiety is high among patients awaiting diagnostic procedures. Patients in the waiting room should be routinely screened for anxiety. Careful assessment and treatment of anxiety are important components in the care of patients with cancer. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Excluded
4851,"Simultaneous integrated boost intensity-modulated radiotherapy in esophageal carcinoma: early results of a phase II study. PURPOSE: The safety and efficacy of using simultaneous integrated boost intensity-modulated radiotherapy (SIB-IMRT) for patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma were evaluated in a single-institution phase II setting., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between June 2007 and October 2009, 45 patients underwent concurrent chemoradiotherapy (n = 27) or radiotherapy alone (n = 18). Two planning target volumes (PTV) were defined for the SIB: PTVC and PTVG, with prescribed doses of 50.4 Gy to the PTVC (1.8 Gy/fraction) and 63 Gy to the PTVG (2.25 Gy/fraction), both given in 28 fractions., RESULTS: At a median follow-up interval of 20.3 months, the 3-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 42.2 and 40.7 %, respectively. The median overall survival time was 21 months; locoregional control rates were 83.3 % at 1 year and 67.5 % at 3 years. According to CTCAE (version 3.0) criteria, none of the patients developed grade 4-5 toxicity. The most common grade 2 and 3 radiation-related toxicity was radiation esophagitis, occurring in 64 % of all patients (but only 13 % as grade 3). No patient developed grade > 2 pulmonary complications., CONCLUSION: SIB-IMRT is a feasible therapeutic approach for esophageal carcinoma patients and provides encouraging locoregional control with a low toxicity profile. Further investigations should focus on dose escalation and optimization of the combination with systemic therapies.",Excluded
4852,"A model to predict the risk of lethal nasopharyngeal necrosis after re-irradiation with intensity-modulated radiotherapy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients. BACKGROUND: For patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) who undergo re-irradiation with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), lethal nasopharyngeal necrosis (LNN) is a severe late adverse event. The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors for LNN and develop a model to predict LNN after radical re-irradiation with IMRT in patients with recurrent NPC., METHODS: Patients who underwent radical re-irradiation with IMRT for locally recurrent NPC between March 2001 and December 2011 and who had no evidence of distant metastasis were included in this study. Clinical characteristics, including recurrent carcinoma conditions and dosimetric features, were evaluated as candidate risk factors for LNN. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent risk factors and construct the predictive scoring model., RESULTS: Among 228 patients enrolled in this study, 204 were at risk of developing LNN based on risk analysis. Of the 204 patients treated, 31 (15.2%) developed LNN. Logistic regression analysis showed that female sex (P = 0.008), necrosis before re-irradiation (P = 0.008), accumulated total prescription dose to the gross tumor volume (GTV) >=145.5 Gy (P = 0.043), and recurrent tumor volume >=25.38 cm(3) (P = 0.009) were independent risk factors for LNN. A model to predict LNN was then constructed that included these four independent risk factors., CONCLUSIONS: A model that includes sex, necrosis before re-irradiation, accumulated total prescription dose to GTV, and recurrent tumor volume can effectively predict the risk of developing LNN in NPC patients who undergo radical re-irradiation with IMRT.",Excluded

Keloid resection followed by adjuvant radiotherapy is the most efficacious treatment for keloids. However, for earlobe keloids, an optimal protocol for the total dose and fractions of adjuvant radiation has not yet been established. We retrospectively analyzed the efficacy and safety of immediate three-fraction electron radiotherapy after operation for resistant earlobe keloids. From 2011 to 2017, three-fraction electron radiotherapy with single dose of 5 Gy was given postoperatively to 23 patients with 30 keloids in our hospital. The first fraction of adjuvant radiotherapy was administered within 2 h of surgery, and the other two sessions were completed within the next day or two. Five (16.7%) primary keloids and 25 (83.3%) recurrent keloids were examined in this study. The primary endpoint was the local control rate, which was 86.7% after a median follow-up of 26 months (14-93 months). Secondary endpoints were acute and late procedure-related complications, and no severe complications were observed after combination therapy. Our results suggest that three-fraction electron radiotherapy after excision within 2 days of surgery is a safe and effective protocol for the prevention of earlobe keloid recurrence that can also improve patient compliance and comfort.Copyright © 2019, The Author(s).",Excluded

Method(s): Aprospective analysis of 49 consecutive patientswith x-ray-confirmed PASDwas performed.All patients were followed at an average of 6.9 days (ranged from4 to 10 days) in the emergency department. On the day of follow-up, 9 physical tests (namely, Jobe test, external rotation lag sign test, infraspinatus muscle strength test, dropping test, drop test, liftoff test, internal rotation lag sign test, belly-press test, and belly-off test) followed by shoulder ultrasound scan were performed to detect FTRCT. Result(s): The prevalence of FTRCT after PASD is 37%(95% confidence interval [CI], 24%-52%). Fourteen percent of the patients with PASD were complicated with isolated supraspinatus tendon tear, whereas 22% were complicated with supraspinatus tendon tear combined with subscapularis and/or infraspinatus tendon tear. Jobe test has the highest sensitivity among the 9 physical tests being evaluated. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, likelihood ratio for positive test, and likelihood ratio for negative test of Jobe test as a screening test for FTRCT after PASD are 89% (95% CI, 64%-98%), 55%(95%CI, 36%-72%), 53%(95%CI, 35%-71%), 89% (95%CI, 65%-98%), 1.97 (95% CI, 1.29-2.99), and 0.20 (95% CI, 0.05-0.79), respectively.

4858,"DNA double strand breaks but not interstrand crosslinks prevent progress through meiosis in fully grown mouse oocytes. There is some interest in how mammalian oocytes respond to different types of DNA damage because of the increasing expectation of fertility preservation in women undergoing chemotherapy. Double strand breaks (DSBs) induced by ionizing radiation and agents such as neocarzinostatin (NCS), and interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) induced by alkylating agents such as mitomycin C (MMC), are toxic DNA lesions that need to be repaired for cell survival. Here we examined the effects of NCS and MMC treatment on oocytes collected from antral follicles in mice, because potentially such oocytes are readily collected from ovaries and do not need to be in vitro grown to achieve meiotic competency. We found that oocytes were sensitive to NCS, such that this ionizing radiation mimetic blocked meiosis I and caused fragmented DNA. In contrast, MMC had no impact on the completion of either meiosis I or II, even at extremely high doses. However, oocytes treated with MMC did show gamma-H2AX foci and following their in vitro maturation and parthenogenetic activation the development of the subsequent embryos was severely compromised. Addition of MMC to 1-cell embryos caused a similarly poor level of development, demonstrating oocytes have eventual sensitivity to this ICL-inducing agent but this does not occur during their meiotic division. In oocytes, the association of Fanconi Anemia protein, FANCD2, with sites of ICL lesions was not apparent until entry into the embryonic cell cycle. In conclusion, meiotic maturation of oocytes is sensitive to DSBs but not ICLs. The ability of oocytes to tolerate severe ICL damage and yet complete meiosis, means that this type of DNA lesion goes unrepaired in oocytes but impacts on subsequent embryo quality.",Excluded
4859,"Utilization of chest CT for injured patients during visits to U.S. emergency departments: 2012-2015. Introduction: Increased use of computed tomography (CT) during injury-related Emergency Department (ED) visits has been reported, despite increased awareness of CT radiation exposure risks. We investigated national trends in the use of chest CT during injury-related ED visits between 2012 and 2015. Method(s): Analyzing injury-related ED visits from the 2012-2015 United States (U.S.) National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS), we determined the percentage of visits that had a chest CT and the diagnostic yield of these chest CTs for clinically-significant findings. We used survey-weighted multivariable logistic regression to determine which patient and visit characteristics were associated with chest CT use. Result(s): Injury-related visits accounted for 30% of the 135 million yearly ED visits represented in NHAMCS. Of these visits, 817,480 (2%) received a chest CT over the study period. The diagnostic yield was 3.88%. Chest CT utilization did not change significantly from a rate of 1.73% in 2012 to a rate of 2.31% in 2015 (p = 0.14). Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated increased odds of chest CT for patients seen by residents versus by attendings (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.41-3.08). Patients aged 18-59 and 60+ had higher AORs (5.75, CI 3.44-9.61 and 9.81, CI 5.90-16.33, respectively) than those <18 years of receiving chest CT.

Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic performance, image quality, artifacts, and radiation doses of virtual non-contrast (VNC) images, relative to true non-contrast (TNC) images, in patients with surgically clipped aneurysms. Method(s): Seventy-six patients who underwent unenhanced computed tomography (CT) and dual-energy (DE)-CT angiography after surgical clipping of 85 intracranial aneurysms were included in the study. Diagnostic performances of VNC and TNC images were compared with respect to sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values. The results of quantitative and qualitative analyses were compared between VNC and TNC images. Radiation doses were also compared between VNC and TNC images. Result(s): Diagnostic performance of VNC images was lower than that of TNC images; however, addition of contrast-enhanced images improved diagnostic performance. Image noise and mean attenuation of VNC images were significantly higher than those of TNC images in the centrum semiovale, cerebellum, and pons. The quality of VNC images was excellent or sufficient (85.5% for observer 1, 85.5% for observer 2), and complete acceptance of VNC images was achieved in 64.5% for observer 1 and in 71.0% for observer 2; however, the addition of contrast-enhanced images increased the level of acceptance (92.0% for observer 1, 90.9% for observer 2). Clip artifacts were significantly lower in VNC images than in TNC images. CT dose index, dose-length product, and effective dose were significantly lower without TNC images. Conclusion(s): VNC images showed lower diagnostic performance and image quality, and higher image noise than TNC images; however, VNC images could reduce clip artifacts and radiation doses.Copyright © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded

4862,"Manual adjustment of tube voltage from 120 to 100 kVp during abdominal CT in patients with body weights <=75 kg: assessment of image quality and radiation dose in a prospective, randomised trial. AIM: To assess image quality and radiation dose in patients with body weights <=75 kg undergoing abdominal computed tomography (CT) with a tube voltage of either 120 or 100 kVp., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty patients weighing <=75 kg were prospectively assigned to receive either 120 or 100 kVp abdominal CT in the portal-venous phase. Attenuation values of abdominal organs and image noise were measured, and the contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were calculated. Subjective image quality was assessed by three independent radiologists. Radiation exposure was assessed by size-specific dose estimate (SSDE)., RESULTS: The mean attenuation of the kidney increased by 20% at 100 kVp (p<0.0001), and the mean image noise was 27% higher in the 100 kVp (p=0.003). The CNR did not significantly differ between the groups (120 kVp, 6.6+/-2.8; 100 kVp, 7.4+/-3.6; p=0.26). Except for subjective image noise (p<0.001), no other subjective quality parameters (e.g., contrast, artefacts) were significantly different between the two groups (p between 0.094 and 0.761). The mean SSDE in the 100-kVp group (9.8+/-1.8 mGy) was reduced by 19% compared to the 120-kVp group (12.1+/-1.8 mGy; p<0.0001)., CONCLUSION: Manual reduction of tube voltage from the standard 120 to 100 kVp for portal-venous phase CT in patients with body weights <=75 kg resulted in a 19% dose reduction while maintaining objective and subjective image quality.

This study sought to determine if the findings can be expanded to obese patients. Method(s): Fifty obese patients (>100 kg) referred for MPI underwent stress-rest or rest-stress studies with a half dose of Tc-99m sestamibi in a 1-day protocol using OSEM-RR processing. Image quality and clinical results were compared with matched patients (by age, sex, weight, presence/probability of coronary artery disease) evaluated with standard ""full-dose"" Tc-99m sestamibi, mostly in a 2-day protocol. Dose activities were adjusted individually by weight. Result(s): Mean Tc-99m activity was 33.4 +/- 13.9 mCi in the half-dose group and 60 +/- 10 mCi in the full-dose group (P <.0001).

Overall image quality was good-to-excellent in 94% of the half-dose group and 80% of the full-dose group (P <.045). There was no between-group difference in rate or size of ischemia or infarction, except for stress left ventricular ejection fraction. Conclusion(s): MPI with half the radiation dose is feasible in obese patients. Image quality is better than for full-dose MPI, and the procedure can be performed in 1 day. © 2012 American Society of Nuclear Cardiology.",Excluded
4864,"Surgeon-performed Ultrasound for the Staging of Acute Diverticulitis: Preliminary Results of a Prospective Study. INTRODUCTION: Although contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CEACT) is still considered the gold standard for the assessment of suspected acute diverticulitis, in recent years the use of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has been spreading more and more in this setting. The aim of this study is to compare CEACT to POCUS for the diagnosis and staging of suspected acute diverticulitis. METHOD(S): This is a prospective study conducted on 55 patients admitted to the Emergency Department of two Italian Hospitals with a clinical suspicion of acute diverticulitis between January 2014 and December 2017. All the patients included underwent POCUS first and CEACT immediately afterwards, with the diagnosis and the staging reported according to the Hinchey (H) classification modified by Wasvary et al. Three surgeons performed all the POCUS and the same two radiologists retrospectively analyzed all the CEACT images. The radiologists were informed of the clinical suspicion but unaware of the POCUS findings. The CEACT was used as the gold standard for the comparison. RESULT(S): The final cohort included 30 (55%) females and 25 (45%) males. The median age was 62 (24-88) and the median body mass index was 26 (19-42).Forty-six out of 55 patients had a confirmed diagnosis of acute diverticulitis on both POCUS and CEACT, whereas in seven patients the diagnosis was not confirmed by both methods. POCUS sensitivity and specificity were 98% and 88% respectively. POCUS positive and negative predictive values were 98% and 88% respectively. POCUS accuracy was 96%.POCUS classified 33 H1a, 11 H1b, 1 H2 and 1 H3 acute diverticulitis. This staging was confirmed in all patients but three (93%) by CEACT. CONCLUSION(S): Point-of-care ultrasound appeared a reliable technique for the diagnosis and the staging of clinically suspected H1 and H2 acute diverticulitis. It could contribute in saving time and resources and in avoiding unnecessary radiation exposure to most patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.

4865,"Induction chemotherapy with cisplatin and ifosfamide in locally advanced inoperable squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: A single-institution experience. BACKGROUND: Induction chemotherapy (ICT) in patients with head and neck cancer has been studied since a long time. The addition of taxanes to the cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5FU) (PF) regimen results in superior antitumor activity. We did this study to see the response and toxicity of ICT with cisplatin and ifosfamide followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in locally advanced, unresectable squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN). AIMS: The aim of this study was to see the results of ICT using cisplatin and ifosfamide regimen in locally advanced unresectable SCCHN in terms of acute and chronic toxicity and response to treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with Stage III and IV, nonmetastatic SCCHN were enrolled in the study. They were given two cycles of ICT with cisplatin and ifosfamide followed by CRT. RESULT(S): After ICT, the overall response rate (ORR) was 75.0% at the primary site and 70.0% at the nodal site. ORR for combined primary and nodal disease was observed to be 67.5%. The complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) for combined primary and nodal site were seen in 4 (10.0%) and 23 (57.5%) patients. Of 32 patients who received CRT after ICT, CR was 53.1% and PR was 31.3%. Mucositis, skin reaction, and pharyngeal and laryngeal toxicities were the most common but tolerable. CONCLUSION(S): ICT with cisplatin and ifosfamide gives comparable results to the standard paclitaxel, PF regimen. We conclude that this combination regimen for ICT is not only an economical alternative of taxol-based regimen but also well tolerated by the patients.Copyright © 2017 Indian Journal of Cancer.",Excluded
4866,"Biochemical and hematologic values for 18 clinically healthy radiated tortoises (Geochelone radiata) on St Catherines Island, Georgia. BACKGROUND: The radiated tortoise (Geochelone radiata) is a critically endangered species in its native land, the southern portion of the island of Madagascar. Captive breeding programs have generated data on the breeding behavior and ecology of G radiata; however, hematologic and biochemical data also are critically important in managing populations. OBJECTIVE(S): The purpose of this study was to evaluate sex and seasonal effects on hematologic and biochemical data from captive radiated tortoises. METHOD(S): Whole blood was collected in January and August 2001 from 18 radiated tortoises (10 male, 8 female) housed at the Wildlife Survival Center on St Catherines Island, Georgia, as part of a routine health assessment. Routine hematologic and plasma biochemical analyses and electrophoresis were done using standard methods. Data from male and female tortoises were compared within and between seasons using 2-way ANOVA. RESULT(S): RBC and HCT values were significantly higher in summer than in winter and were higher in males than in females. Total protein concentration did not differ significantly between males and females; however, female tortoises had significantly higher concentrations of alpha1- and beta-globulins in winter and summer compared to males. Male tortoises had significantly higher sodium and uric acid concentrations and LDH activity during winter, and higher urea concentration and LDH and CK activities in summer, compared with females. Female tortoises had significantly higher triglyceride and phosphorus concentrations in winter, and higher phosphorus, cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations in summer, compared with males. CONCLUSION(S): Sex and seasonal differences in hematologic and biochemical values for radiated tortoises likely reflect vitellogenesis and egg production in females, and altered hydration status and activity in summer. Data from the tortoises in this study will be useful for the seasonal health assessment of this species.",Excluded

4868,"Reduced intensity VEPEMB regimen compared with standard ABVD in elderly Hodgkin lymphoma patients: Results from a randomized trial on behalf of the Fondazione Italiana Linfomi (FIL). Survival rates for elderly Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) have not improved substantially in recent years, mainly because of a lack of prospective randomized studies, due to difficulties in enrolling patients. Between 2002 and 2006, 54 untreated HL patients, aged between 65 and 80 years and considered 'non-frail' according to a comprehensive geriatric evaluation, were enrolled into a phase III randomized trial to compare a reduced-intensity regimen (vinblastine, cyclophosphamide, procarbazine, prednisone, etoposide, mitoxantrone, bleomycin; VEPEMB) with standard ABVD (adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine). Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Seventeen patients were in early stage (I-IIA), while 37 were advanced stage. Median age was 72 years and median follow-up was 76 months. Five-year PFS rates were 48% vs. 70% [adjusted Hazard ratio (HR) = 2.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.94-5.10, P = 0.068] and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 63% vs. 77% (adjusted HR = 1.67, 95% CI = 0.69-4.03, P = 0.254) for VEPEMB compared to ABVD. Overall treatment-related mortality was 4%. World Health Organization grade 4 cardiac and lung toxicity occurred in four patients treated with ABVD versus no cases in the VEPEMB arm. Standard ABVD regimen resulted in better PFS and OS than the VEPEMB, although the differences were not statistically significant. The low toxicity of both treatments was probably attributable to stringent selection of patients based on a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment that excluded frail patients.Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Excluded
4869,"RADIATION DOSE DURING PELVIC RADIOGRAPHY IN RELATION TO BODY MASS INDEX. The purpose of this research was to investigate the impact of body mass index (BMI) on dose area product (DAP), effective dose (E), dose to the organs and image quality (IQ) on 200 patients referred to pelvic radiography. Patients were classified into three groups according to BMI: normal (<24.99), overweight (25.0-29.99) and obese (>30). The results showed 52% and 135% higher DAP for overweight and obese patients compared to normal-weight patients (p < 0.001). A 46 and 123% rise of E for overweight and obese patients compared to normal-weight patients (p < 0.001) was discovered. Overweight patients received 37% higher dose and obese patients 107% higher dose to the organs compared to normal-weight patients. There were no statistically significant differences between IQ, except between normal weight and overweight patients. A strong correlation (r = 0.733) was found between BMI and DAP and between BMI and E (r = 0.776).Copyright © The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

4870,"Establishment of national diagnostic reference levels for radiotherapy computed tomography simulation procedures in Slovenia. PURPOSE: To propose national diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) for radiotherapy (RT) computed tomography (CT) localization purposes, compare both CT units used in the largest RT department in the country and to compare gathered results with other published DRLs in order to discover any need of optimization., METHODS: In total, 1631 patient data (time spend of 4 months) regarding sex, examination type, total dose-length product (DLP) and CTDIvol was collated on two CT units. Those simulation procedures account for more than 80 % of all simulation procedures performed nationwide. Then, total DLP and CTDIvol was calculated and mean, median and 3rd quartile for both units together were presented to determine national DRLs for simulation procedures. The same data was later compared between both units to discover any potential need for optimization., RESULTS: 3rd quartile values of DLP for abdomen, breast, chest, head, head and neck, pelvis and spine were 1116.2, 606.6, 832.4, 1942.4, 969.2, 677.1 and 1042.4 mGy.cm, respectively. 3rd quartile CTDIvol values for the same sequence of procedures were 18.7, 13.3, 19.2, 76.9, 22.6, 17.9 and 22.2mGy, respectively. Among the two units, the mentioned dose values were on average significantly higher on one CT unit than on the other unit., CONCLUSIONS: When comparing collected dose values with other studies, RT CT DRLs showed that radiation doses from our institution were similar or even lower. Some variations were found between both CT units in certain protocols, so exposure parameters should be reviewed and optimized. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded
4871,"Lung cancer and cigarette smoking in Europe: An update of risk estimates and an assessment of inter-country heterogeneity. Ten case-control studies have been carried out in 6 European countries to investigate the major risk factors for lung cancer. Carcinogenic effect from cigarette smoke was the most relevant interest in our study, which has included 7,609 cases of lung cancer and 10,431 controls, mainly population based. The results indicate elevated odds ratios (ORs; 23.9 among men and 8.7 among women) with attributable risks exceeding 90% for men and close to 60% for women. A large, and statistically significant, variability of the results across countries was detected after adjusting for the most common confounding variables, and after controlling, at least in part, for the instability of the ORs due to the small number of non-smokers in some of the study subsets. This pattern of lung cancer risk associated with cigarettes smoke, across different European regions, reflects inherent characteristics of the studies as well as differences in smoking habits, particularly calender periods of starting, and it is likely to have been influenced by effect modifiers like indoor radon exposure, occupation, air pollution and dietary habits. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Excluded

4874,"Irradiation of male mammary gland for the prevention of hormone induced gynecomastia. Treatment of carcinoma of the prostate with female sex hormones causes not only impotence but also swollen, painfully mammary glands. The radiobiological response of the mammary glands renders it possible to prevent hormone induced gynecomastia by means of radiotherapy. On this indication, 121 patients treated with female sex hormones between 1961 and 1972 for carcinoma of the prostate were subjected to irradiation of both mammary glands. On 4 successive days, daily doses of 300 r surface dose were administered to each mammary gland, corresponding to a focal dose of 840 r at 3 cm tissue depth. The parameters were: roentgen radiation, 150 kV, 20 mA, 0.5 mm Cu, focus skin distance 40 cm, field size 6 x 6 m. 84 patients could be followed up more than 6 mth after the treatment. In 67 cases (79.8%), development of gynecomastia was completely suppressed, while in 16 cases, a slight degree of gynecomastia had occurred in spite of the irradiation. In one case, the gynecomastia that had already been completely developed at the time of the radiotherapy, had remained uninfluenced apart from a mitigation of the sensation of tension. In 6 of the patients who were free from gynecomastia (8.9%) the hormone treatment had been started prior to the radiotherapy. This proportion was considerably larger among the patients with mild gynecomastia, viz. 75% (12 cases). The lesser effect of the radiotherapy is considered to be correlated with the duration and dosage of the hormone treatment started prior to the radiotherapy, and may also be correlated with the duration of the interval between the end of the hormone treatment and the start of the irradiation.",Excluded

PURPOSE: Quantitative evaluation of the lung parenchyma might be impaired or unreliable by use of reduced-dose CT protocols. Aim of the study was to define the threshold where reduced dose has significant impact on quantitative emphysema parameters., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients with severe centrilobular emphysema underwent multidetector computed tomography (120 kV, 150 mAs). Original CT raw data were simulated using 10 mAs settings (10-100 SIMmAs). Quantitative analysis provided lung volume, emphysema volume, emphysema index, mean lung density, and 4 emphysema volume classes. Simulated low-dose results were compared with original acquisition., RESULTS: Emphysema index showed no clinical relevant variation down to 30 SIMmAs. The large emphysema volume class was significantly different below 50 SIMmAs. The intermediate and small classes showed an overproportional variation below 50 SIMmAs., CONCLUSIONS: Dose reduction down to 30 SIMmAs is possible for clinical routine. Settings below 50 SIMmAs significantly alter the in-detailed 3-dimensional emphysema quantification.",Excluded
4876,"Improved clinical outcome in indolent B-cell lymphoma patients vaccinated with autologous tumor cells experiencing immunogenic death. Increasing evidence argues that the success of an anticancer treatment may rely on immunoadjuvant side effects including the induction of immunogenic tumor cell death. Based on the assumption that this death mechanism is a similar prerequisite for the efficacy of an active immunotherapy using killed tumor cells, we examined a vaccination strategy using dendritic cells (DC) loaded with apoptotic and necrotic cell bodies derived from autologous tumors. Using this approach, clinical and immunologic responses were achieved in 6 of 18 patients with relapsed indolent non - Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The present report illustrates an impaired ability of the neoplastic cells used to vaccinate nonresponders to undergo immunogenic death on exposure to a cell death protocol based on heat shock, gamma-ray, and UVC ray. Interestingly, when compared with doxorubicin, this treatment increased surface translocation of calreticulin and cellular release of high-mobility group box 1 and ATP in histologically distinct NHL cell lines. In contrast, treated lymphoma cells from responders displayed higher amounts of calreticulin and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) compared with those from nonresponders and boosted the production of specific antibodies when loaded into DCs for vaccination. Accordingly, the extent of calreticulin and HSP90 surface expression in the DC antigenic cargo was significantly associated with the clinical and immunologic responses achieved. Our results indicate that a positive clinical effect is obtained when immunogenically killed autologous neoplastic cells are used for the generation of a DC-based vaccine. Therapeutic improvements may thus be accomplished by circumventing the tumor-impaired ability to undergo immunogenic death and prime the antitumor immune response. ©2010 AACR.",Excluded
4877,"Serum Zinc Level in beta-Thalassemia Major: A Retrospective Study in Southwest Iran. Thalassemia, which is associated with compound complications, is the most common hereditary anemia in the world. The zinc level is different in patients with thalassemias. This study aimed to determine the zinc status and its relationship with demographic factors and chelation therapy in beta-thalassemia major (beta-TM) patients. This cross-sectional study was conducted on 102 beta-thalassemia (beta-thal), patients. Zinc level was evaluated in subjects using the atomic absorption method. The results were analyzed through descriptive statistics, chi 2 and Mann-Whitney U tests. Of 102 cases, 92 patients were eligible and evaluated. The mean age was 23 (minimum 11, maximum 43) years. Forty-six percent of cases were males and 54.0% were females. Of the 92 patients taking iron chelators, 29.3% used deferoxamine (DFO), 16.3% deferasirox (DFX), 20.6% DFO and deferiprone (DFP), and 33.8% DFO and DFP. All cases had zinc deficiency, 89.1% had zinc levels <40.0 mg/dL, and 10.9% with zinc levels >40.0 mg/dL. There was a significant relationship between gender and group with zinc levels greater than 40.0 mg/dL and those with less than 40.0 mg/dL. Zinc deficiency is highly prevalent among patients with thalassemia in the city of Yasuj, Iran. There was a significant relationship between zinc levels and gender although no significance was observed between zinc level and age, body mass index (BMI), ferritin, and chelation factors; it is recommended that these patients be periodically evaluated for zinc level. In case of a lack of laboratory evaluation, the use of prophylactic zinc supplementation should be considered for these patients.Copyright © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Excluded
4878,"Normal tissue complication models for clinically relevant acute esophagitis (>= grade 2) in patients treated with dose differentiated accelerated radiotherapy (DART-bid). BACKGROUND: One of the primary dose-limiting toxicities during thoracic irradiation is acute esophagitis (AE). The aim of this study is to investigate dosimetric and clinical predictors for AE grade >= 2 in patients treated with accelerated radiotherapy for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)., PATIENTS AND METHODS: 66 NSCLC patients were included in the present analysis: 4 stage II, 44 stage IIIA and 18 stage IIIB. All patients received induction chemotherapy followed by dose differentiated accelerated radiotherapy (DART-bid). Depending on size (mean of three perpendicular diameters) tumors were binned in four dose groups: <2.5 cm 73.8 Gy, 2.5-4.5 cm 79.2 Gy, 4.5-6 cm 84.6 Gy, >6 cm 90 Gy. Patients were treated in 3D target splitting technique. In order to estimate the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP), two Lyman models and the cutoff-logistic regression model were fitted to the data with AE >= grade 2 as statistical endpoint. Inter-model comparison was performed with the corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc), which calculates the model's quality of fit (likelihood value) in relation to its complexity (i.e. number of variables in the model) corrected by the number of patients in the dataset. Toxicity was documented prospectively according to RTOG., RESULTS: The median follow up was 686 days (range 84-2921 days), 23/66 patients (35 %) experienced AE >= grade 2. The actuarial local control rates were 72.6 % and 59.4 % at 2 and 3 years, regional control was 91 % at both time points. The Lyman-MED model (D50 = 32.8 Gy, m = 0.48) and the cutoff dose model (Dc = 38 Gy) provide the most efficient fit to the current dataset. On multivariate analysis V38 (volume of the esophagus that receives 38 Gy or above, 95 %-CI 28.2-57.3) was the most significant predictor of AE >= grade 2 (HR = 1.05, CI 1.01-1.09, p = 0.007)., CONCLUSION: Following high-dose accelerated radiotherapy the rate of AE >= grade 2 is slightly lower than reported for concomitant radio-chemotherapy with the additional benefit of markedly increased loco-regional tumor control. In the current patient cohort the most significant predictor of AE was found to be V38. A second clinically useful parameter in treatment planning may be MED (mean esophageal dose).",Excluded
4879,"Intraoperative radiotherapy for parotid cancer: A single-institution experience. Purpose: Our practice policy has been to provide intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) at resection to patients with head-and-neck malignancies considered to be at high risk of recurrence. The purpose of the present study was to review our experience with the use of IORT for primary or recurrent cancer of the parotid gland. Methods and Materials: Between 1982 and 2007, 96 patients were treated with gross total resection and IORT for primary or recurrent cancer of the parotid gland. The median age was 62.9 years (range, 14.3-88.1). Of the 96 patients, 33 had previously undergone external beam radiotherapy as a component of definitive therapy. Also, 34 patients had positive margins after surgery, and 40 had perineural invasion. IORT was administered as a single fraction of 15 or 20 Gy with 4-6-MeV electrons. The median follow-up period was 5.6 years. Result(s): Only 1 patient experienced local recurrence, 19 developed regional recurrence, and 12 distant recurrence. The recurrence-free survival rate at 1, 3, and 5 years was 82.0%, 68.5%, and 65.2%, respectively. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rate after surgery and IORT was 88.4%, 66.1%, and 56.2%, respectively. No perioperative fatalities occurred. Complications developed in 26 patients and included vascular complications in 7, trismus in 6, fistulas in 4, radiation osteonecrosis in 4, flap necrosis in 2, wound dehiscence in 2, and neuropathy in 1. Of these 26 patients, 12 had recurrent disease, and 8 had undergone external beam radiotherapy before IORT. Conclusion(s): IORT results in effective local disease control at acceptable levels of toxicity and should be considered for patients with primary or recurrent cancer of the parotid gland. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
4880,"Knee medial and lateral contact forces in a musculoskeletal model with subject-specific contact point trajectories. Contact point (CP) trajectory is a crucial parameter in estimating medial/lateral tibio-femoral contact forces from the musculoskeletal (MSK) models. The objective of the present study was to develop a method to incorporate the subject-specific CP trajectories into the MSK model. Ten healthy subjects performed 45 s treadmill gait trials. The subject-specific CP trajectories were constructed on the tibia and femur as a function of extension-flexion using low-dose bi-plane X-ray images during a quasi-static squat. At each extension-flexion position, the tibia and femur CPs were superimposed in the three directions on the medial side, and in the anterior-posterior and proximal-distal directions on the lateral side to form the five kinematic constraints of the knee joint. The Lagrange multipliers associated to these constraints directly yielded the medial/lateral contact forces. The results from the personalized CP trajectory model were compared against the linear CP trajectory and sphere-on-plane CP trajectory models which were adapted from the commonly used MSK models. Changing the CP trajectory had a remarkable impact on the knee kinematics and changed the medial and lateral contact forces by 1.03 BW and 0.65 BW respectively, in certain subjects. The direction and magnitude of the medial/lateral contact force were highly variable among the subjects and the medial-lateral shift of the CPs alone could not determine the increase/decrease pattern of the contact forces. The suggested kinematic constraints are adaptable to the CP trajectories derived from a variety of joint models and those experimentally measured from the 3D imaging techniques.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
4881,"A retrospective review of pain control by a two-step irradiance schedule during topical ALA-photodynamic therapy of non-melanoma skin cancer. Background and Objective Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with topical delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) of non-melanoma skin cancers is often associated with treatment-limiting pain. A previous study on basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) at Roswell Park Cancer Institute evaluated a two-step irradiance scheme as a means of minimizing pain, preserving outcomes, and limiting treatment time. We used an initial low irradiance until 90% of the protoporphyrin IX was photobleached, followed by a high irradiance interval until the prescribed fluence was delivered. Success of this pilot investigation motivated integration of the protocol into routine practice. Here, we present a retrospective review of recent clinical experience in a broad patient population. Study Design/Materials and Methods This was a retrospective review of an existing dermatology database. Fourteen caucasion patients - nine men and five women, ages 18-80, with a total of 51 superficial and 73 nodular BCCs, and three Bowen's disease lesions - were included. ALA was applied to each lesion for approximately 4 hours. Lesions received an initial irradiance of 30-50 mW/cm2 for 20 J/cm2, followed by 150 mW/cm2 for a total fluence of 200-300 J/cm2. Pain was assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS). Clinical outcome was determined at 6-12 months. Results Median VAS scores were 1.0 for both irradiances. Five of 127 lesions required pain control with 1% xylocaine. Pain was strongly influenced by lesion location but not by lesion type, number, or size. Complete responses were achieved in 84.1% of BCCs, which compares favorably with reported results for single ALA-PDT treatments. Two of three Bowen's disease lesions showed a complete response. Complete responses for nodular BCCs were 37%, which are also within the range of reported outcomes. Conclusions A two-step irradiance protocol in ALA-PDT effectively minimizes pain, maintains excellent clinical outcomes in superficial lesions, and adds minimal treatment time. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
4882,"Prognostic factors in set of limited disease small-cell lung cancer patients treated with chemoradiotherapy. Background: Combined chemoradiotherapy is the standard treatment for patients with limited disease small cell lung cancer (LD SCLC). Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is recommended in case of complete remission (CR) since late 90' and for partial remissions last few years. Early concurrent radiation (RT) has been found as slightly beneficial at cost of higher toxicity. Use of granulocyte colonystimulating factor (G-CSF) for prophylaxis of febrile neutropenia is controversial in SCLC. We analyzed patients and treatment related variables for prognostic significance in long term follow-up of regional treatment protocol since 2000 in VFN, University Hospital Prague. Method(s): The planned treatment consisted of 4 to 6 courses of platinum/etoposide chemotherapy (CT) and thoracic irradiation of 45 to 66 grays with one daily fraction. Patients with CR or later with PR were assigned to PCI (30Gy in 15 fractions) at the end of treatment. Sequential strategy was preferred due to age over 70 or worse performance status. In some patients G-CSF prophylaxis was used. Influence of factors as sex, age, timing and dose of RT, dose and regimen of CT, G-CSF delivery, treatment response and PCI yes or not, were tested for survival impact. Result(s): Eighty consecutive patients were treated between Jan-2000 and Sep-2010, 49 men, 31 women, median age 62 years (range 49 - 80). CT in median dose of 5 cycles was predominantly cisplatin based, RT in median dose of 57.6 Gy was given concurrently in 56% and sequentially in 33% of patients. Thoracic RT was omitted in 9 patients, for poor performance status or progressive disease in 6 and due to radical surgery in 3 subjects. Esophagitis grade 3-4 occurred in 42%, significantly more often in concurrent RT (60% vs. 19%, p< 0.01). Response rate (RR) 90% and CR 62% in concurrent group did not differ significantly from sequential one (RR 88%, CR 52%). The median survival was 19.5 months and 3- and 5-year survival was 27% in all the patients. Survival differences in groups according to sex, age, stage, carbo or cisplatin and partial versus complete treatment response did not differ significantly. Significantly longer survival was observed in groups with PCI, with concurrent radiation or in patients treated with G-CSFs. Median time to progression was 14 months for the whole group. Significantly longer time to progression was in CR patients, concurrent RT, PCI patients and G-CSF delivery. Conclusion(s): Concurrent early chemoradiotherapy, PCI delivery and G-CSF treatment have shown significant impact on time to progression and overall survival in our group of LD SCLC patients.",Excluded
4883,"Feasibility study of single agent cisplatin and concurrent radiotherapy in Japanese patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: Preliminary results. Background: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with the single agent cisplatin (CDDP + RT) has been recognized worldwide as the standard treatment for unresectable locally advanced SCCHN. The objective of this study was to clarify the feasibility of CDDP + RT in Japanese patients. Patients and Methods: Patients with unresectable squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were given single daily fractionated radiation (70 Gy at 2 Gy/day) and chemotherapy consisting of a 2 h infusion of CDDP 100 mg/m2 on days 1, 22 and 43. The primary endpoint was the rate of completion of CDDP + RT. Result(s): Between November 2005 and January 2007, 20 patients were enrolled, 19 males and one female with a median age of 61.5 years (range 50-74). One patient had recurrent unresectable disease after surgery and the remaining 19 had stage IV disease. No grade 4 hematologic toxicities were observed. The incidence of grade 3 mucositis was 55% and no treatment-related death occurred. Full-dose irradiation was performed in all patients, with a median duration of radiotherapy of 50 days (range 48-54). Although all patients received the first two administrations of CDDP, the third dose was administed in 17 patients (85%). The rate of completion of CDDP + RT was 85% and the dose intensity of CDDP was 28.9 mg/m2/week (relative dose intensity 89%). Overall complete response rate was 50% and the rate of primary complete response was 90%. Conclusion(s): Concurrent chemoradiation therapy with the standard dose ofCDDP is feasible in Japanese patients.

4884,"Proton pencil beam scanning for mediastinal lymphoma: treatment planning and robustness assessment. BACKGROUND: Modern radiotherapy (RT) for lymphoma is highly personalized. While advanced imaging is largely employed to define limited treatment volumes, the use of proton pencil beam scanning (PBS) for highly conformal lymphoma RT is still in its infancy. Here, we assess the dosimetric benefits and feasibility of PBS for mediastinal lymphoma (ML)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten patients were planned using PBS for involved-site RT. The initial plans were calculated on the average four-dimensional computed tomography (4D-CT). PBS plans were compared with 3D conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT), intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), and proton double scattering (DS). In order to evaluate the feasibility of PBS and the plan robustness against inter- and intra-fractional uncertainties, the 4D dose was calculated on initial and verification CTs. The deviation of planned dose from delivered dose was measured. The same proton beamline was used for all patients, while another beamline with larger spots was employed for patients with large motion perpendicular to the beam., RESULTS: PBS provided the lowest mean lung dose (MLD) and mean heart dose (MHD) for all patients in comparison with 3D-CRT, IMRT, and DS. For eight patients, internal target volume (ITV) D98% was degraded by <3%; and the MLD and MHD deviated by <10% of prescription over the course of treatment when the PBS field was painted twice in each session. For one patient with target motion perpendicular to the beam (>5 mm), the degradation of ITV D98% was 9%, which was effectively mitigated by employing large spots. One patient exhibited large dose degradation due to pericardial effusion, which required replanning across all modalities., CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that PBS plans significantly reduce MLD and MHD relative to 3D-CRT, IMRT, and DS and identifies requirements for robust free-breathing ML PBS treatments, showing that PBS plan robustness can be maintained with repainting and/or large spots.",Excluded
4885,"CT-derived abdominal adiposity: Distributions and better predictive ability than BMI in a nationwide study of 59,429 adults in China. Background: Although abdominal adiposity is associated with an altered cardiometabolic risk profile, the specific contribution of abdominal adipose tissue distribution remains not fully understood. Computed tomography (CT) is a well-established and precise method to measure abdominal adipose tissue distribution. The present study investigated abdominal adiposity assessed by CT in a large-scale Chinese population. Method(s): A total of 59,429 adults who underwent a low dose chest CT for lung cancer screening at one of 13 health checkup centers throughout China were evaluated. Abdominal visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) areas were measured at the center of the 2nd lumbar vertebra with Mindways quantitative CT software using the existing CT dataset without any additional radiation exposure. The ratio of visceral to total adipose tissue (TAT) areas (VAT/TAT ratio) was calculated and expressed as a percentage. Anthropometric indices including body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference were also obtained. Result(s): BMI, waist circumference, VAT area, SAT area, and the VAT/TAT ratio were 25.0 +/- 3.0 kg/m2, 90 +/- 8 cm, 194 +/- 77 cm2, 85 +/- 41 cm2, and 69.5 +/- 9.1%, respectively, in men and 23.3 +/- 3.1 kg/m2, 79 +/- 8 cm, 120 +/- 57 cm2, 123 +/- 53 cm2, and 48.9 +/- 9.7% in women. With increasing age, VAT area and the VAT/TAT ratio increased in both sexes whereas SAT area decreased in men (P < 0.001 for all). After adjustment for BMI and waist circumference, older individuals showed higher VAT area and higher VAT/TAT ratio than younger subjects (P < 0.001 for all). Adjusted VAT areas in participants aged 75 or older was 45 cm2 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 41 cm2, 50 cm2) higher in men and 43 cm2 (95% CI: 37 cm2, 49 cm2) higher in women compared with participants aged 31-44 years. Additionally, differences in VAT area across age groups increased as BMI or waist circumference increased. VAT and SAT areas, but not the VAT/TAT ratio, were positively associated with BMI and waist circumference in every age group. Conclusion(s): In a nationwide study conducted in China, distributions of CT-derived measures of visceral and subcutaneous adiposity were found to vary significantly between sex and age groups. Our study also revealed that the proportion of VAT (an important driver of cardiometabolic risk) could not be predicted from BMI in a Chinese population.Copyright © 2020 The Authors",Excluded
4886,"Effectiveness of postoperative radiotherapy on atypical meningioma patients: A population-based study. Purpose: It is controversial whether atypical meningioma patients undergoing gross-total resection (GTR) can benefit from postoperative radiotherapy (PORT). This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of PORT on atypical meningioma patients. Method(s): Patients diagnosed with atypical meningioma from 2008 to 2015 were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated, and the log-rank test was used to compare the differences among groups. Univariable and multivariable COX regressions were conducted for survival analyses. Result(s): A total of 1,014 patients were enrolled. The 5-years survival rate of the overall patients was 79.0%. PORT was performed in 315 (31.1%) patients. The utilization rates of PORT in patients undergoing GTR and undergoing subtotal resection (STR) were 26.7% and 42.2%, respectively. For patients undergoing STR, log-rank test showed that overall survival (OS) time was significantly longer in patients receiving PORT than those not (p = 0.026). For patients undergoing GTR, OS time did not show significant association with PORT (p = 0.339). In addition, patients undergoing STR with PORT had no significantly different OS time compared with those undergoing GTR with PORT (p = 0.398). Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that receipt of PORT (p = 0.187) was not an independent predictor of OS after adjustment. Conclusion(s): PORT may not prolong the OS in atypical meningioma patients undergoing GTR. However, patients undergoing STR may benefit from PORT and achieve similar OS to those undergoing GTR.Copyright © 2019 Zeng, Shi and Guo.",Excluded
4887,"Radiation exposure of computed tomography imaging for the assessment of acute stroke. Purpose: To assess suspected acute stroke, the computed tomography (CT) protocol contains a non-contrast CT (NCCT), a CT angiography (CTA), and a CT perfusion (CTP). Due to assumably high radiation doses of the complete protocol, the aim of this study is to examine radiation exposure and to establish diagnostic reference levels (DRLs). Method(s): In this retrospective study, dose data of 921 patients with initial CT imaging for suspected acute stroke and dose monitoring with a DICOM header-based tracking and monitoring software were analyzed. Between June 2017 and January 2020, 1655 CT scans were included, which were performed on three different modern multi-slice CT scanners, including 921 NCCT, 465 CTA, and 269 CTP scans. Radiation exposure was reported for CT dose index (CTDIvol) and dose-length product (DLP). DRLs were set at the 75th percentile of dose distribution. Result(s): DRLs were assessed for each step (CTDIvol/DLP): NCCT 33.9 mGy/527.8 mGy cm and CTA 13.7 mGy/478.3 mGy cm. Radiation exposure of CTP was invariable and depended on CT device and its protocol settings with CTDIvol 124.9-258.2 mGy and DLP 1852.6-3044.3 mGy cm. Conclusion(s): Performing complementary CT techniques such as CTA and CTP for the assessment of acute stroke increases total radiation exposure. Hence, the revised DRLs for the complete protocol are required, where our local DRLs may help as benchmarks.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded
4888,"Intensity-Modulated Proton and Carbon-Ion Radiation Therapy in the Management of Head and Neck Sarcomas. Purpose: We report our experience of intensity-modulated proton and carbon-ion radiotherapy (IMPT/IMCT) for head and neck sarcomas (HNS). Methods and Materials: An analysis of the ongoing prospective data registry from the Shanghai Proton and Heavy Ion Center (SPHIC) for patients with HNS was conducted. The 12- and 24-month rates of local recurrence-free, overall, distant metastasis-free, progression-free survival (LRFS, OS, DMFS, and PFS), and acute/late toxicities were calculated. The prognostic factors for the effectiveness of the treatment were also analyzed. Result(s): Between 7/2014 and 5/2018, 51 consecutive patients with HNS received definitive doses of IMCT (41 cases), IMPT (two cases), or their combination (eight cases). One patient had R0 resection and another treated on the Chinese Food and Drug Administration registration trial received IMPT only. Twenty-seven patients were treated according to various dose escalation trials or institutional protocols using IMCT or IMPT + IMCT boost. Twenty-two patients with locoregional recurrence (10 and four patients failed surgery or surgery followed by radiotherapy, respectively) or radiation-induced second primary sarcomas (eight patients) received salvage particle radiotherapy. With a median follow-up time of 15.7 months, four patients with second primary sarcoma died. The 1- and 2-year OS, PFS, LRFS, and DMFS rates for the entire cohort were 92.9% vs 90%, 73.6% vs 57.4%, 88.4% vs 78.9%, and 84.6% vs 76.5%, respectively. Those rates for patients without prior radiotherapy were 100% vs 100%, 82.1% vs 65.8%, 93.6% vs 85.3%, and 88.4% vs 79.5%, respectively. Multivariate analyses revealed that re-irradiation was an independent prognostic factor for both LRFS and PFS (P = 0.015 and 0.037, respectively). In addition, gross tumor volume (GTV) was an independent prognostic factor for PFS (P = 0.048). One patient experienced Grade 3 acute toxicity (oral mucositis); another experienced Grade 4 acute event (hemorrhage) which required embolization. He lately died from hemorrhage (Grade 5) at 3.4 months after the completion of treatment. No patient experienced radiation-induced acute/late toxicity of >= Grade 2 otherwise. Conclusion(s): With few observed acute/late toxicities, IMPT/IMCT provided effective short-term tumor control in our patients with HNS. Further investigations, preferably in a prospective fashion, will be required to confirm the efficacy and toxicities of IMPT/IMCT in this group of patients.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

4889,"Possible involvement of the facial nucleus in regulation of respiration in rats. The facial nucleus (FN) has been known as a motor nucleus to control the activity of the facial skeletal muscles by its efferent somatic motoneurons. Much less, however, is known about the non-motor control functions of its interneurons. The present study was designed to investigate if the interneurons of the FN participate in controlling rhythmic respiration in the sodium thiopental-anesthetized and vagotomized Sprague-Dawley rats with facial motoneurons retrogradely degenerated with techniques of electrical and chemical stimulation of the FN and extracellular recording of discharge of neurons in the FN. Single pulse stimulation (75-100 microA, 0.2 ms) of the FN during inspiration caused a transient restrain in phrenic discharge. Short train stimulation (75-100 microA, 0.2 ms, 100 Hz, 3-5 pulses) delivered during the early- or mid-term of inspiration augmented the inspiratory duration, but switched the inspiration off when delivered during the later stage of inspiration. Short train stimulation delivered during expiration prolonged the expiratory duration. Continuous stimulation could inhibit the inspiration. Microinjection of kainic acid into the FN caused an augmentation in inspiratory duration and amplitude and in expiratory duration. These data indicate that the interneurons of the FN might participate in the modulation of respiration. Different discharge patterns of interneurons in the FN, interestingly some respiratory related patterns, were observed, which provide a possible structural basis for the role of the FN in respiratory regulation.",Excluded
4890,"DNA damage-induced PARP1 activation confers cardiomyocyte dysfunction through NAD+ depletion in experimental atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common clinical tachyarrhythmia with a strong tendency to progress in time. AF progression is driven by derailment of protein homeostasis, which ultimately causes contractile dysfunction of the atria. Here we report that tachypacing-induced functional loss of atrial cardiomyocytes is precipitated by excessive poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) activation in response to oxidative DNA damage. PARP1-mediated synthesis of ADP-ribose chains in turn depletes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), induces further DNA damage and contractile dysfunction. Accordingly, NAD+ replenishment or PARP1 depletion precludes functional loss. Moreover, inhibition of PARP1 protects against tachypacing-induced NAD+ depletion, oxidative stress, DNA damage and contractile dysfunction in atrial cardiomyocytes and Drosophila. Consistently, cardiomyocytes of persistent AF patients show significant DNA damage, which correlates with PARP1 activity. The findings uncover a mechanism by which tachypacing impairs cardiomyocyte function and implicates PARP1 as a possible therapeutic target that may preserve cardiomyocyte function in clinical AF.Copyright © 2019, The Author(s).",Excluded
4891,"Efficacy and safety of primary surgery with postoperative radiotherapy in head and neck mucosal melanoma: A single-arm phase II study. Background: There still remains no well-established treatment strategy for head and neck mucosal melanoma (HNMM). We aim to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of primary surgery with postoperative radiotherapy for this disease. Patients and Methods: A single-arm, Phase II clinical trial was conducted at Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center. Patients with nonmetastatic, histologically proven HNMM were prospectively enrolled. Patients received primary surgery followed by intensity-modulated radiotherapy with an equivalent dose at 2 Gy per fraction of 65-70 Gy to CTV1 (high-risk regions including tumor bed) and 50-55 Gy to CTV2 (low-risk regions). Additional use of adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) depended on consultation from a multidisciplinary team. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03138642. Result(s): A total of 33 patients were enrolled and analyzed between July 2010 and November 2016. There were 18 (54.5%) patients with T3 disease and 15 (45.5%) patients with T4a disease. The median age at diagnosis was 58 years (range 27-83 years), and 61% of the cohort were males. The overall median follow-up duration was 25.3 months (range 5.3-67.1 months). The 3-year overall survival (OS), local relapse-free survival (LRFS), regional relapse-free survival (RRFS), and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) rates were 44.4, 91.7, 78.1, and 41.7%, respectively. Patients with T4a disease showed significantly inferior OS (P=0.049) and DMFS (P=0.040) than those with T3 disease. Prophylactic neck radiation (PNR) was nearly associated with superior RRFS (P=0.078). However, there was no significant difference in OS, LRFS, RRFS, and DMFS for patients treated with or without AC (P>0.05 for all). Toxicities were generally mild to moderate. Conclusion(s): Primary surgery with postoperative radiotherapy yielded excellent local control and acceptable toxicity profile for HNMM. Nevertheless, high rates of distant metastases resulted in limited survival.Copyright © 2018 Yao et al.",Excluded
4892,"Direction-changeable cage reduces x-ray exposure in treating isthmic lumbar spondylolisthesis: A retrospective study. In spite of a variety of designs for the lumbar interbody fusion cage, there is no consensus on the optimal design so far. Different cage designs may cause different extent of X-ray exposure to visualize the cage positon intraoperatively. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the X-ray exposure and clinical outcomes of the direction-changeable cage in transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF). The patients were divided into the direction-changeable cage group (group A, n=79) and non-direction-changeable cage group (group B, n=84). Intraoperative implantation duration, cage position adjustment times, implantation fluoroscopy times, fluoroscopy exposure time of cage implantation, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores were recorded before and after operation at the last follow-up. CT scanning was performed to evaluate lumbar fusion. All the patients underwent single-level TLIF and were followed up for 12 to 18 months. In the group A, intraoperative implantation duration, cage position adjustment times, implantation fluoroscopy times, and fluoroscopy exposure time of cage implantation were 6.7 +/- 3.6 min, 1.2 +/- 0.4 times, 2.5 +/- 0.6 times, 7.84 +/- 1.83 s, retrospectively. In the group B, these parameters were 11.5 +/- 5.9 min, 2.6 +/- 1.3 times, 5.8 +/- 1.7 times, and 15.31 +/- 5.16 s retrospectively, which were higher than those in the non-direction-changeable cage group with statistical significance (P<0.05). In terms of ODI and VAS scores, there was no statistical difference between the two groups before or after operation at the last follow-up (P>0.05). Regarding to the complications, there were 4 cases (4.49%) in the group A, with 3 cases of non-union and 1 case of dural laceration. Eight cases (10.53%) showed complications in the group B, with 7 cases of non-union and 1 case of infection. There was a significant difference between the groups in terms of the complication rate (P<0.05). In conclusion, the direction-changeable cage has merits like lower radiation exposure and fewer complications compared to the non-direction-changeable cage in treating isthmic lumbar spondylolisthesis. Both cages could yield equal clinical outcomes.Copyright © 2019, E-Century Publishing Corporation. All rights reserved.",Excluded

There were 12 men and 5 women with a median age of 56 years (range 24-83 years). There were 10 lung carcinomas, 4 esophagus carcinomas , 1 liver cancer, 1 breast cancer, and 1 kidney carcinoma . 6 had squamous cell carcinoma, 8 were adenocarcinoma, 3 others respectively. All patients suffered varying degrees of pain before seed implantation, ranging from 1 to 9 on the NRS. Mean NRS scores before implantation was 6.88 +/- 2.25 respectively. Regarding neurologic function, 2 grade Bs, 2 grade Cs, 3 grade Ds and 10 grade Es. All patients with recurrent spinal bone metastases had received conventional EBRT. During the procedure, patients remained in a prone position to facilitate CT guidance. We measured the pedicle angle and the distance of the puncture point. The depth of the puncture point to the pedicle was also borne in mind. Needles were inserted through the anterior portion of the lateral images, in the interval between the pedicle and the vertebral body, or with a pedicle or paraspinal approach, respectively. Seeds were implanted 1.0 cm from the spinal cord, to minimize radiation damage. Immediately after the procedure, a CT scan was obtained to confirm the location of the seeds in case of any need for supplementary implantation. The number of 125I seeds implanted ranged from 18 to 62 (median 30) with specific activity of 0.5-0.8 mCi (median 0.75 mCi). The post-plan showed that the actuarial D90 of 125I seeds were 60.5-154 Gy(median 106 Gy). The follow-up period ranged from 1 to 59 months (median 7 months).

Feature selection was based on the prognostic performance and feature stability in the training cohort. Radscores were generated using the Cox proportional hazards regression model with the selected features in the training cohort and then validated in the internal and external validation cohorts. We also constructed a nomogram for predicting local recurrence-free survival (LRFS). Finding(s): Eleven features were selected to construct the Radscore, which was significantly associated with LRFS. For the training, internal validation, and external validation cohorts, the Radscore (C-index: 0.741 vs. 0.753 vs. 0.730)outperformed clinical prognostic variables (C-index for primary gross tumor volume: 0.665 vs. 0.672 vs. 0.577; C-index for age: 0.571 vs. 0.629 vs. 0.605)in predicting LRFS.

Objective: To investigate the image quality and nodules detectability using ultra-low dose (ULD) protocol with iterative model reconstruction (IMR) algorithm when compared to routine low dose (LD) chest CT in lung cancer screening. methods: Chest CT scans were acquired using a 256-slice scanner for 300 subjects. The scan protocol for the ULD group was 120 kVp/17 mAs while for the LD group was 120 kVp/30 mAs. All images were reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP), hybrid iterative reconstruction (HIR) and IMR algorithms. Effective dose was recorded. Image quality assessments were performed by two radiologists. SD of CT attenuation was measured as objective image noise. The number of non-calcified nodules detected in both groups with different reconstruction algorithms were calculated and compared. Result(s): The effective dose of ULD group (0.67 +/- 0.08mSv) was about 44% reduced compared with LD group (1.20 +/- 0.08mSv) (p < 0.01). IMR improved image quality and reduced image noise significantly than HIR and FBP in both groups (all, p < 0.01). IMR enabled a higher number of nodule detected compared to FBP and HIR in both LD and ULD groups, especially for solid nodules less than 4mm. conclusion: IMR may improve the diagnostic accuracy of ULD CT lung screening with potential nodule detectability improvement. advances in knowledge: IMR enables significant reduction of the image noise and improvement of image quality in sub-mSv (66% reduction) chest scans.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

A total of 15 patients with thoracic EC were selected for participation between October 2016 and July 2017 at the Hangzhou Cancer Hospital. Regional lymph nodal stations were contoured according to 3D CT-based images of the Japan Esophageal Society Guidelines. All patients were treated with 60 Gy using VMAT, 5F-IMRT and 3D-CRT plans. Dose-volume histograms of planning target volume (PTV), lung, heart, spinal cord and incidental nodal irradiation were compared between the three plans. 5F-IMRT was superior in PTV_V95% (the volume of the PTV receiving 95% of the prescription dose, P=0.003) and the VMAT plan was best in terms of conformal index (P=0.005). V20 and V30were reduced by 10.7-22.6% (P=0.002) and 12.8-21% (P=0.026), respectively, in normal lung tissue using the VMAT plan. 5F-IMRT demonstrated the lowest maximum dose (Dmax) for the spinal cord (P=0.037). For the INI, 3D-CRT exhibited the highest equivalent uniform dose (EUD) values for 106pre (P=0.014) and 106tb-L (P=0.03) in upper-thoracic EC. The mean EUD of all lymph nodal regions in middle-thoracic EC were >40 Gy in VMAT and 5F-IMRT plans; the VMAT plan had higher EUD values in lower-thoracic EC compared with 5F-IMRT, 3D-CRT plans for INI. VMAT were comparable to the 5F-IMRT plan with respect to dosimetric characteristics for planning and INI doses to thoracic nodal levels NO 105-112 are considerable for thoracic EC.Copyright © 2020 Spandidos Publications.

We developed a new type of scaffold made of a Mg-Zn-Ca alloy with a shape that mimics cortical bone and can be filled with morselized bone. We evaluated its durability and efficacy in a rabbit ulna-defect model. Three types of scaffold-surface coating were evaluated: group A, no coating; group B, a 10-mum microarc oxidation coating; group C, a hydrothermal duplex composite coating; and group D, an empty-defect control. X-ray and micro-computed tomography(micro-CT) images were acquired over 12 weeks to assess ulnar repair. A mechanical stress test indicated that bone repair within each group improved significantly over time (P < 0.01). The degradation behavior of the different scaffolds was assessed by micro-CT and quantified according to the amount of hydrogen gas generated; these measurements indicated that the group C scaffold better resisted corrosion than did the other scaffold types (P < 0.05). Calcein fluorescence and histology revealed that greater mineral densities and better bone responses were achieved for groups B and C than for group A, with group C providing the best response. In conclusion, our Mg-Zn-Ca-alloy scaffold effectively aided bone repair. The group C scaffold exhibited the best corrosion resistance and osteogenesis properties, making it a candidate scaffold for repair of bone defects.",Excluded
4899,"Robot-Assisted Versus Fluoroscopy-Guided Pedicle Screw Placement in Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion for Lumbar Degenerative Disease. OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical accuracy and perioperative outcomes for pedicle screw placement in transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) between the robot-assisted (RA) technique and fluoroscopy-guided (FG) technique., METHODS: Seventy-seven patients scheduled to undergo RA (n = 43) and FG (n = 44) TLIF surgery were included. Patient demographics, radiographic accuracy, and perioperative outcomes were recorded and compared. The accuracy of pedicle screw placement was according to the Gertzbein and Robbins scale and facet joint violation. Perioperative outcomes mainly included operative time, radiation exposure, and revisions., RESULTS: Of the 176 screws in the RA group, 164 screws were grade A, and 9, 2, and 1 screws were grades B, C, and D, respectively. Of the 204 screws in the FG group, 175 screws were grade A, with 16 screws scored as grade B, 8 screws scored as grade C, 3 screws scored as grade D, and 2 screws scored as grade E. The rate of perfect screw position (grade A) was higher in the RA group than in the FG group (93.2% vs. 85.8%, respectively; P = 0.020). In the FG group, 191 screws (93.6%) were clinically acceptable (groups A and B), whereas more acceptable screw positions were achieved in the RA group (98.3%; P = 0.024). Fewer screws in the RA group violated the proximal facet joint (5 vs. 24 screws, respectively; P = 0.001). The radiation dose was lower in the RA group (25.9 +/- 14.2 vs. 70.5 +/- 27.3 muSv, respectively; P < 0.001). Two screws in the FG group required a revision, but no revision was required in the RA group., CONCLUSIONS: RA pedicle screw placement is an accurate and safe procedure in TLIF for lumbar degenerative disease.

4900,"A retrospective study of concurrent chemoradiotherapy plus S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy on curative effect for treatment of patients with N3 stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Introduction: The purpose of this study was to analyze the efficacy and safety of concurrent chemoradiotherapy plus S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy for N3 stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Method(s): This study included 44 N3 stage NPC patients treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy plus S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy. The intensity-modulated radiation therapy doses were planning target volume (PTV) 70-72 Gy for gross disease in the nasopharynx and 66-70 Gy for positive lymph nodes. The doses for high-risk-and low-risk region PTV were 60-62 and 54-56 Gy in 31-33 fractions. All patients received a concurrent chemotherapy program consisting of cisplatin 100 mg/m2, day 1, and the cycle repetition was every 21 days. The adjuvant chemotherapy program consisted of 4 cycles of S-1. The dose of S-1 was determined according to the body surface area (BSA): 40 mg twice a day for BSA <1.25 m2; 50 mg twice a day for 1.25 m2<=BSA<1.5 m2; and 60 mg twice a day for BSA >=1.5 m2. S-1 was given on days 1-28, given 6 weeks apart. Result(s): All 44 patients completed at least 2 cycles of concurrent chemotherapy and 4 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy. The total efficiency of therapy was 100.0%. The 3-year overall survival (OS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), local-regional control, and progression-free survival rates were 86.4%, 84.1%, 97.7%, and 81.8%, respectively. There were no differences in the OS, DMFS, and efficiency between fast-fading group (reaching partial response before the second cycle of concurrent chemotherapy) and general-fading group (the rest of the group). The incidence of rash in the entire group was low, and there was also no association with prognosis. Conclusion(s): In patients with N3 stage NPC, concurrent chemoradiotherapy plus S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy yielded an excellent survival benefit, and the toxicities were mild and tolerable. Distant metastasis was the main cause of treatment failure.Copyright © 2018 Zhang et al.",Excluded
4901,"TWO FACTORS INFLUENCING DOSE RECONSTRUCTION IN LOW DOSE RANGE: THE VARIABILITY OF BKG INTENSITY ON ONE INDIVIDUAL AND WATER CONTENT. A fast and accurate retrospective dosimetry method for the triage is very important in radiation accidents. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) fingernail dosimetry is a promising way to estimate radiation dose. This article presents two factors influencing dose reconstruction in low dose range: the variability of background signal (BKG) intensity on one individual and water content. Comparing the EPR spectrum of dried and humidified fingernail samples, it is necessary to add a procedure of dehydration before EPR measurements, so as to eliminate the deviation caused by water content. Besides, the BKGs of different fingers' nails are not the same as researchers thought previously, and the difference between maximum and minimum BKG intensities of one individual can reach 55.89 %. Meanwhile, the variability of the BKG intensity among individuals is large enough to impact precise dose reconstruction. Water within fingernails and instability of BKG are two reasons that cause the inaccuracy of radiation dose reconstruction in low-dosage level.Copyright © The Author 2015.

4902,"Efficacy and safety of intensity-modulated radiotherapy following transarterial chemoembolization in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy in combination with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has been beneficial in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). There have been few clinical reports on the use of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in combination with TACE for these patients. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy and toxicity of IMRT following TACE in unresectable HCC. The medical records of consecutive patients with unresectable HCC, who underwent IMRT following TACE from January 2009 to June 2014, were retrospectively reviewed in order to assess the overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), tumor response, and treatment-associated toxicity. A total of 64 lesions in 54 patients were included in the analysis. IMRT was delivered at a median dose of 50 Gy (range 44-70 Gy) at 1.8 to 2.0 Gy per fraction. The overall response rate was achieved in 64.8% of patients with complete response in 20.4% of patients at 3 months after completion of IMRT. The median OS was 20.2 months (95% CI=8.6-31.9), and the actuarial 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS rates were 84.6%, 49.7%, and 36.7%, respectively. The median PFS was 10.5 months (95% CI=7.3-13.7) and the 1-, 2-, and 3-year PFS rates were 44.2%, 23.4%, and 14.6%, respectively. The responders had a significantly higher OS rate than the nonresponders (3-year OS 48.0% vs 14.4%, P=0.001). During and the first month following IMRT, 10 (18.5%) patients developed grade 3 hematological toxicity, and 3 (5.6%) developed grade 3 hepatic toxicity. No patient experienced grade 4 or 5 toxicity. Radiation-induced liver disease was not observed. Our findings suggest that IMRT following TACE could be a favorable treatment option for both its safety profile and clinical benefit in patients with unresectable HCC.Copyright © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",Excluded
4903,"Inferior colliculus stimulation causes similar efferent effects on ipsilateral and contralateral cochlear potentials in the guinea pig. The inferior colliculus (IC) is a processing center in both the ascending and descending auditory pathways. It has been demonstrated anatomically to send descending projections to the region of the medial olivocochlear (MOC) neurons in the auditory brainstem. Activation of MOC system produces reductions in cochlear neural activity. Individual MOC fibers innervate relatively restricted regions of the cochlea. Recent studies have shown that selective electrical stimulation within the IC central nucleus (ICC) produces frequency-specific reductions of neural activity in the contralateral cochlea (Ota, Y., Oliver, D.L., Dolan, D.F., 2004. Frequency-specific effects on cochlear responses during activation of the inferior colliculus in the guinea pig. J. Neurophysiol. 91, 2185-2193). This efferent effect is likely mediated through selective activation of MOC cells. In this study, we investigated the effects of selective stimulation of one ICC on cochlear output in both ears in anesthetized and paralyzed guinea pigs to explore possible differences in the effective efferent innervation of the two ears. ICC stimulation had a similar tonotopically tuned effect on the distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) and the cochlear whole-nerve action potential (CAP) in each cochlea. The bandwidth of the efferent effect in each ear was measured and compared at different stimulation levels. For a given ICC stimulation site, the efferent effects were larger for the CAP response. The effect on each response measure was greater in the contralateral than the ipsilateral ear. The effective bandwidth of the efferent effect on the CAP was current-level-dependent but less so for the DPOAE. The results of transections at various locations within the brainstem suggest that the effects were mediated by the MOC system. From the results presented here, the descending efferent system, which originates in the auditory cortex, has frequency-specific, spatially restricted, bilateral effects. The effects are greater in the contralateral ear.",Excluded
4904,"Percutaneous argon-helium cryoablation for small hepatocellular carcinoma located adjacent to a major organ or viscus: A retrospective study of 92 patients at a single center. Background: Cryoablation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) close to major organs or viscus is challenging because it can cause complications. This retrospective study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of percutaneous argon-helium cryoablation of small HCC located adjacent to major organs or viscus. Material/Methods: Ninety-two patients who underwent percutaneous argon-helium cryoablation between February 2012 and December 2018 at the Fifth Medical Center of the Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital were included. Treatment efficacy was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging or triphasic computed tomography scan within 1 week after each cryoablation procedure. Local tumor progression, distant recurrence, and overall survival were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. Result(s): A total of 92 patients with small HCC located adjacent to major organs or viscus who underwent cryoablation were retrospectively reviewed. The number of patients with tumors adjacent to the gallbladder, portal or hepatic vein, diaphragm, stomach, heart, and intestine was 22, 1, 39, 6, 8, and 16, respectively. Cumulative local tumor progression rates at 1 and 2 years were 2.8% and 7.3%, respectively. Cumulative distant recurrence rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 11.1%, 17.6%, and 20.7%, respectively. The overall survival rates at 1, 2, and 4 years were 100%, 93.6%, and 74.9%, respectively. Major complications were observed in 5 (5.4%) patients. Minor complications were observed in 85 (92.4%) patients. Conclusion(s): This experience from a single center showed that percutaneous argon-helium cryoablation was safe and effective in the management of small HCC that is located adjacent to major organs or viscus.Copyright © 2021 International Scientific Information, Inc..

4905,"Seeds screening aqueous synthesis, multiphase interfacial separation and in situ optical characterization of invisible ultrathin silver nanowires. We report a multi-step synthetic method to obtain ultrathin silver nanowires (Ag NWs) from an aqueous solution with a ~17 nm diameter average, and where some of them decreased down to 9 nm. Carefully designed seed screening processes including LED irradiation at high temperature for a short time, and then continuous H2O2 etching, and relative growth mechanisms of high-yield five-twinned pentagonal seeds and ultrathin Ag NWs in aqueous environment are detailed. Then, a rapid and simple multiphase interfacial assembly method particularly suitable for the separation of ultrathin Ag NWs from various by-products was demonstrated with a clear mechanism explanation. Next, a unique optical interaction between light and individual AG NWs, as well as feature structures in the AG NWs film, was investigated by a micro-domain optical confocal microscope measurement in situ together with a theoretical explanation using modal transmission theory. That revealed that the haze problem of AG NWs films was not only arising from the interaction between light and individual or crossed Ag NWs but was also greatly dependent on a weak coupling effect of leaky modes supported by adjacent Ag NWs with large distances which had not been considered before. We then provided direct experimental evidence and concluded how to obtain haze-free films with 100% transparency in the whole visible range based on ultrathin Ag NWs. This breakthrough in diameter confinement and purification of Ag NWs is a highly expected step to overcome the well-focused light diffusion and absorption problems of Ag NWs-based devices applied in various fields such as flexible electronics, high-clarity displays, visible transparent heaters, photovoltaics and various optoelectronic technologies.",Excluded
4906,"Reducing contrast medium dose with low photon energy images in renal dual-energy spectral CT angiography and adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the value of using low energy (keV) images in renal dual-energy spectral CT angiography (CTA) and adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) to reduce contrast medium dose. METHOD(S): 40 patients with renal CTA on a Discovery CT750HD were randomly divided into two groups: 20 cases (Group A) with 600mgI kg-1 and 20 cases (Group B) with 300mgI kg-1. The scan protocol for both groups was: dual-energy mode with mA selection for noise index of 10 HU, pitch 1.375:1, rotating speed 0.6s/r. Images were reconstructed at 0.625mm thickness with 40%ASIR, Group A used the conventional 70keV monochromatic images, and Group B used monochromatic images from 40 to 70 keV at 5 keV interval for analysis. The CT values and standard deviation (SD) values of the renal artery and erector spine in the plain and arterial phases were measured with the erector spine SD value representing image noise. The enhancement degree of the renal artery (DELTACT = CT(arterial) -CT(plain)), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR=CTrenal-artery/SDrenal-artery) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR=(CTrenal-artery-CTerector spine)/SDerector-spine) were calculated. The single factor analysis of variance was used to analyze the difference of DELTACT, SNR and CNR among image groups with p < 0.05 being statistically significant. The subjective image scores of the groups were assessed blindly by two experienced physicians using a 5-point system and the score consistency was compared by the kappa test. RESULT(S): Contrast medium dose in the 300mgI kg-1 group was reduced by 50% compared with the 600mgI kg-1 group, while radiation dose was similar between the two groups. The subjective scores were 4.00 +/- 0.65, 4.50 +/- 0.60and 3.70 +/- 0.80 for images at 70 keV (600mgI kg-1 group), 40 keV (300mgI kg-1 group) and 45 keV (300mgI kg-1 group), respectively with good consistency between the two reviewers (p > 0.05). The 40 keV images in the 300mgI kg-1 group had similar DELTACT (469.77 +/- 86.95HU vs 398.54 +/- 73.68HU) and CNR (15.52 +/- 3.32 vs 18.78 +/- 6.71) values as the 70 keV images in the 600mgI kg-1) group but higher SNR values (30.19 +/- 4.41 vs 16.91 +/- 11.12, p < 0,05). CONCLUSION(S): Contrast dose may be reduced by 50% while maintaining image quality by using lower energy images combined with ASIR in renal dual-energy CTA. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Combined with ASIR and energy spectrum, can reduce the amount of contrast dose in renal CTA.",Excluded
4907,"Hydrogen Gas: A Novel Type of Antioxidant in Modulating Sexual Organs Homeostasis. Sex is a science of cutting edge but bathed in mystery. Coitus or sexual intercourse, which is at the core of sexual activities, requires healthy and functioning vessels to supply the pelvic region, thus contributing to clitoris erection and vaginal lubrication in female and penile erection in male. It is well known that nitric oxide (NO) is the main gas mediator of penile and clitoris erection. In addition, the lightest and diffusible gas molecule hydrogen (H2) has been shown to improve erectile dysfunction (ED), testis injuries, sperm motility in male, preserve ovarian function, protect against uterine inflammation, preeclampsia, and breast cancer in female. Mechanistically, H2 has strong abilities to attenuate excessive oxidative stress by selectively reducing cytotoxic oxygen radicals, modulate immunity and inflammation, and inhibit injuries-induced cell death. Therefore, H2 is a novel bioactive gas molecule involved in modulating sexual organs homeostasis.Copyright © 2021 Yaxing Zhang et al.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: To analyze the clinical and dosimetric risk factors of acute esophagitis (AE) in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with concomitant chemoradiotherapy., METHODS: Seventy-six NSCLC patients treated with concomitant chemoradiotherapy were retrospectively analyzed. Forty-one patients received concomitant chemoradiotherapy with vinorelbine/cisplatin (VC), 35 with docetaxel/cisplatin (DC). AE was graded according to criteria of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG). The following clinical and dosimetric parameters were analyzed: gender, age, clinical stage, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), pretreatment weight loss, concomitant chemotherapy agents (CCA) (VC vs. DC), percentage of esophagus volume treated to >= 20 (V20), >= 30 (V30), >= 40 (V40), >= 50 (V50) and >= 60 Gy (V60), and the maximum (Dmax) and mean doses (Dmean) delivered to esophagus. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to test the association between the different factors and AE., RESULTS: Seventy patients developed AE (Grade 1, 19 patients; Grade 2, 36 patients; and Grade 3, 15 patients). By multivariate logistic regression analysis, V40 was the only statistically significant factor associated with Grade >= 2 AE (p<0.001, OR = 1.159). A V40 of <23% had a 33.3% (10/30) risk of Grade >= 2 AE, which increased to 89.1% (41/46) with a V40 of >= 23% (p<0.001). CCA (p =0.01; OR = 9.686) and V50 (p<0.001; OR = 1.122) were most significantly correlated with grade 3 AE. A V50 of <26.5% had a 6.7% (3/45) risk of Grade 3 AE, which increased to 38.7% (12/31) with a V50 of >= 26.5% (p = 0.001). On the linear regression analysis, V50 and CCA were significant independent factors affecting AE duration. Patients who received concomitant chemotherapy with VC had a decreased risk of grade 3 AE and shorter duration compared with DC., CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant chemotherapy agents have potential influence on AE. Concomitant chemotherapy with VC led to lower risk of AE compared with that using DC. V40 and V50 of esophagus can predict grade >= 2 and >= 3 AE, respectively.",Excluded

4912,"Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for tumor staging and definition of tumor volumes on radiation treatment planning in nonsmall cell lung cancer A prospective radiographic cohort study of single center clinical outcome. We investigate the impact of magnetic resonance (MR) on the staging and radiotherapy planning for patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A total of 24 patients with NSCLC underwent MRI, which was fused with radiotherapy planning CT using rigid registration. Gross tumor volume (GTV) was delineated not only according to CT image alone (GTVCT), but also based on both CT and MR image (GTVCT/MR). For each patient, 2 conformal treatment plans were made according to GTVCT and GTVCT/MR, respectively. Dose-volume histograms (DVH) for lesion and normal organs were generated using both GTVCT and GTVCT/MR treatment plans. All patients were irradiated according to GTVCT/MR plan. Median volume of the GTVCT/MR and GTVCT were 105.42cm3 and 124.45cm3, respectively, and the mean value of GTVCT/MR was significantly smaller than that of GTVCT (145.71+/-145.04 vs 174.30+/-150.34, P<0.01). Clinical stage was modified in 9 patients (37.5%). The objective response rate (ORR) was 83.3% and the l-year overall survival (OS) was 87.5%.

Background: Multiple knee ligament injuries combined with extensor apparatus rupture are serious and complex knee injuries that are rare in clinical practice. The management is extremely challenging and controversial. The aim of this study is to describe a patient collective with multiple knee ligament injuries combined with extensor apparatus injuries in detail and to report the mid-term outcomes of a one-stage surgical treatment regarding subjective outcome scores, complications, knee instability, and ROM. Method(s): Eleven of 425 patients with multiple knee ligament injuries combined with extensor apparatus injuries admitted to our hospital were reviewed from July 2008 to May 2017. All patients underwent one-stage repair and reconstruction of multiple knee ligaments and extensor apparatus. The Lysholm knee score and the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score were adopted to evaluate the surgical effect preoperatively and at a minimum of 2 years' follow-up. Clinical data, including range of motion and knee stability, were also recorded at the final follow-up. Result(s): Ten patients were followed up with a mean time of 40 (range, 24-60) months. At the last follow-up, 8 patients had joint flexion range of motion greater than or equal to120 degrees, 2 patients had joint flexion range of motion of 100-120 degrees, and 1 patient had active knee extension limitation of 5 degrees. Stress radiographs showed that the mean differences in posterior displacement were reduced from 10.8 +/- 3.0 mm preoperatively to 2.0 +/- 2.5 mm at the last follow-up. There were significant improvements in stress radiographs from pre- to postoperative states for all patients with multiple knee ligament injuries. The Lysholm score ranged from 85 to 96, with a mean of 92.1 (compared with 33 before surgery, P < 0.05). The final IKDC scores were A in 2 patients (20%), B in 7 (70%), and C in 1 (10%). Nine of the 10 patients (90%) returned to their former activity level. Conclusion(s): Multiple knee ligament injuries combined with extensor apparatus rupture are rare.

Background: Coarctation of aorta (CoA) may progressively develop aortic dilation at other site of the aorta and can lead to fatal aortic diseases. We aimed to evaluate the occurrence of aortic dilation and related predictors in patients with CoA using dual-source computed tomography (DSCT). Method(s): Fifty-three patients with CoA identified by DSCT were retrospectively reviewed. Aortic diameters were measured at six different levels and standardized as z-scores based on the square root of body surface area. Coarctation site-diaphragm ratio (CDR) was used to describe the degree of narrowing. A total of 26 patients were included in mild group (CDR > 50%) and 27 in severe group (CDR < 50%) according to the severity of coarctation. Student's t-test and Spearman correlation coefficients, univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to assess the risk factors including age, degree of narrowing and other malformations for aortic dilation. Result(s): Severe group had significantly larger z-scores of ascending aorta (2.41 +/- 0.39 vs. 2.10 +/- 0.57, p < 0.05) and post-coarctation aorta (2.17 +/- 0.48 vs. 1.68 +/- 0.43, p < 0.001) compared with mild group.

Collateral circulation was related to the z-scores of ascending aorta (r = 0.375, p < 0.05). Increased severity of coarctation was independent predictor of ascending (odds ratio 7.46; 95% CI 1.19-46.76; p < 0.05) and post-coarctation aortic dilation(odds ratio 8.42; 95% CI 1.84-38.56; p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Ascending and post-coarctation aortic diameters or dilations were both associated with the degree of coarctation. By comprehensively evaluating the aortic diameters and associated malformations including collateral circulation, DSCT can aid in stratification of risk for aortic dilation in patients with CoA.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).",Excluded
4915,"[Late radiation brain necrosis: a brain tumor like mass]. 7 cases of late radiation brain necrosis, most of them were diagnosed as intracranial brain tumor at admission, were reported. Histological confirmation was obtained on 4 cases through craniotomy. Generally this disease is occurred 1 to 3 years after radiation therapy. CT and MR image show a low-density (Long T1) with variable mass effect. It is generally not possible to differentiate it from brain tumor on radiological and clinical grounds. Steroid therapy and drugs which promote brain cell metabolism and provide nourishment for nerve tissue have been effective in the treatment of this disease. 3 to 4 weeks after medication, symptoms recovered remarkably and long -term prognosis was good. In this article, we have a discussion about the treatment and diagnosis of this disease.",Excluded
4916,"Effectiveness of salvage radiation therapy following subtotal and gross total resection of atypical meningiomas. Purpose/Objective(s): Postoperative management of WHO Grade II (atypical) meningioma remains controversial. Radiation therapy (RT) has been shown to improve local control in several retrospective studies, but outcomes of adjuvant versus salvage RT after a gross total resection (GTR) are not well understood.We reviewed the outcomes of patients treated with RT after GTR and subtotal resection (STR) at our institution, where radiation therapy (RT) has typically been reserved for salvage. Materials/Methods: Between 1997 and 2014, 76 patients with WHO Grade II meningiomas were treated at our institution. One patient with NF2 was excluded from this analysis. Of the 75 remaining patients, 62 underwent GTR (Simpson grade I e III) and 13 STR (Simpson IV-V). No patient with GTR received adjuvant RT. A total of 22 patients received RT: 10 as salvage of recurrence following GTR, 10 as salvage following STR, and 2 adjuvantly, each after biopsy only. Fractionated RT was employed in 18 patients, with doses ranging from 50.4-60 Gy (median 59.4 Gy) in 28-33 fractions, and stereotactic radiosurgery in 4 patients, with a single fraction of 15-18 Gy (median 17 Gy). Result(s): Extent of surgery was significantly predictive of progression-free survival (PFS). Following GTR and STR respectively, 2-year PFS was 75% versus 33%, and 4-year PFS 68% versus 17% (P = 0.0008). Despite a significant improvement in PFS after GTR, patients who recurred following GTR had a poor response to salvage RT, with 6 of the 10 patients continuing to progress despite RT. Conversely, none of the 12 patients who had undergone STR or biopsy experienced progression following RT. Respectively for GTR and STR, PFS following RT was 77% and 100% at 1 year, and 39% and 100% after 2 years (P = 0.04). Radiation dose was not significantly different between patients who progressed (median 56.7 Gy) and those who did not (median 60 Gy) following RT (P = 0.42). Likewise there was no difference in RT dose for those with GTR versus STR (median 60 Gy versus 59.4 Gy respectively, P = 0.94). Conclusion(s): In our patient cohort, salvage RT for recurrence following GTR was associated with a high rate of failure (61% at 2 years), whereas salvage or adjuvant RT following STR was effective, with no failures at 2 years. This data suggests that tumors recurring after GTR are biologically distinct from tumors that progress following STR. While extent of resection is predictive of PFS, the 4-year local failure following GTR alone was still 32%; therefore, adjuvant RT should be considered in this setting. Whether routine adjuvant RT following GTR of Grade II meningioma will significantly reduce subsequent failures remains to be determined. A randomized, prospective comparison of adjuvant RT after GTR is needed to resolve this question.",Excluded
4917,"A Comparison of the Image Quality and Radiation Dose Using 100-kVp Combination of Different Noise Index and 120-kVp in Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to compare the image quality and radiation dose of computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) in patients with different body mass indexes using 100-kVp combination of different noise indexes (NIs) and 120-kVp scan protocol with the adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction 2.0 algorithm (ASiR 2.0)., METHODS: A total of 120 patients who had undergone a CTPA were divided into 4 groups (A, B, C, and D), with 30 patients in each group. Group A underwent 120-kVp CT scan protocol in combination with NI = 25, while groups B, C, and D underwent 100-kVp CT scan protocol in combination with NI = 30, 35, and 40, respectively. All images were restructured using ASiR 2.0. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of all images were calculated when the CTPA was completed. Each subjective image evaluation used a 5-point scoring method and was conducted by 2 independent radiologists. The CT dose index of volume and dose-length product were recorded, and the mean value was calculated. The dose-length product was converted to the effective dose., RESULTS: There were no significant differences in SNR, CNR, and subjective image quality among the groups A, B, C, and D. The effective dose of group D decreased by 48.33% and 27.27% relative to groups A and B, respectively (P < 0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: The 100-kVp CT scan protocol in combination with NI = 40 can more effectively reduce the radiation dose than can the 120-kVp CT scan protocol in combination with NI = 25 for a CTPA while still maintaining diagnostic image quality.",Excluded
4918,"Cutaneous viral infections associated with ultraviolet radiation exposure. The complex interplay between ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and cutaneous viral infections in the context of cancer etiology is challenging to unravel, given the limited information on the independent association between UVR and cutaneous viral infections. Using multiple biomarkers of infection with 24 types of cutaneous human papillomavirus (HPV) and 4 types of polyomaviruses (HPyV), we investigated cross-sectional associations with recent UVR exposure, using skin pigmentation measured by spectrophotometer. Age- and sex-adjusted associations between UVR and viral seropositivity, viral DNA present in eyebrow hairs (EBH) and skin swabs (SSW) were estimated using logistic regression. Beta-HPV seropositivity was associated with viral DNA positivity in EBH (OR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.05-1.88) and SSW (OR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.25-2.74). Similar associations were observed for Merkel cell polyomavirus. Participants in the highest tertile of UVR exposure were more likely to be seropositive for beta-HPV (OR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.16-2.38), and have beta-HPV DNA in EBH (OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.06-2.33) and SSW (OR = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.25-3.96), compared to participants with the lowest tertile of UVR exposure. UVR exposure was positively associated with three different markers of beta-HPV infection. Therefore, future studies of HPV associated KC development should address more directly the role of HPV and UVR exposure as potential co-carcinogens.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

4919,"Guided Punctures with Ultrasound Volume Navigation in Percutaneous Transforaminal Endoscopic Discectomy: A Technical Note. Objective: Ultrasound volume navigation (UVN) has been widely used for accurate guidance and decreased radiation exposure. However, few studies have focused on the clinical significance of UVN in guiding percutaneous puncture in percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy (PTED). We evaluated UVN to guide percutaneous puncture in PTED. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 12 patients (8 men and 4 women), who had undergone PTED with the help of UVN or fluoroscopic guidance for lumbar disc herniation from November 2017 to December 2017. Result(s): The age of these 12 patients range was 26-71 years, and the body mass index range was 18.19-26.91 kg/m2. Of the 12 patients, 6 were in UVN group and 6 were in fluoroscopy group. The mean number of punctures was 1.00 in UVN group and 3.83 in fluoroscopy group. The mean exposure time was 3.60 and 13.80 seconds in UVN and fluoroscopy groups, respectively. The mean operation time was 48.17 minutes and 61.33 minutes in UVN and fluoroscopy groups, respectively. A positive relationship was found between operation time and exposure time (P < 0.05). All patients achieved excellent or good clinical outcomes. The Oswestry Disability Index and visual analog scales for leg pain and back pain all showed significant improvement after the procedure (P < 0.05). None of patients experienced a complication. Conclusion(s): UVN decreased the number of puncture attempts, radiation exposure, and operation time compared with fluoroscopic guidance in PTED. Therefore, UVN is a feasible and efficient method for guiding percutaneous puncture in PTED.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

Objective: To investigate the low-dose chest computed tomography (CT) presentation and dynamic changes in patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to improve understanding of this highly infectious disease. Method(s): The clinical and CT data of 16 patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed. Dynamic CTs were performed continuously after admission. Result(s): Of the patients, 14 were moderate cases, and 2 were severe. Twelve patients underwent CT at the early onset stage. Single nodules or ground-glass opacities (GGOs) were found in 2 patients and multiple bilateral pulmonary lesions in 8 (consolidation-like opacities with or without small nodules in five and large GGOs with interlobular septal thickening in three). Ten had lesion growth and enlargement on the second CT. Fourteen patients underwent CT during the progressive stage, which revealed GGOs and focal consolidation in 6 of them, lung consolidation opacities in 5, and simple, large GGOs with interlobular septal thickening in 3. In both severe cases, the lesions continued to enlarge and grow, and the extent of consolidation continued to expand. Conclusion(s): Low-dose chest CT can clearly reflect the morphology, density, and extent of COVID-19 nodules, and is beneficial for observing dynamic nodule changes and disease screening and monitoring.Copyright © 2020 Beijing You'an Hospital affiliated to Capital Medical University",Excluded
4921,"Late-onset radiation-induced optic neuropathy after radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Radiation-induced optic neuropathy (RION) is a rare but devastating late complication of radiotherapy, usually manifesting months to years after cancer treatment of the head and neck, resulting in rapidly progressive blindness in one or both eyes. The incidence of radiation-induced complications following radiotherapy, especially RION, is correlated with survival time of patients. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), the most common type of cancer in southern China, has been primarily treated with radiotherapy, with associated neural injuries. To our knowledge, there are few reports of RION among patients with NPC who have undergone radiotherapy. To study this further, we reviewed nine patients with NPC and RION after radiotherapy and examined the clinical manifestations of RION, characteristics of the ophthalmologic examination, MRI results and the treatments used. Of the nine patients with RION, the most frequent clinical presentation was a decline of vision with visual field defects in one or both eyes. Ophthalmologic examinations showed flame hemorrhages in the retina, optic nerve atrophy and cotton wool spots. T1-weighted enhanced MRI showed enhancement of the optic nerve and optic chiasm in six patients. Treatment with corticosteroids, anticoagulation and hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment did not reduce visual loss or blindness in patients. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

4922,"Predictors of the therapeutic effect of corticosteroids on radiation-induced optic neuropathy following nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Radiation-induced optic neuropathy (RION) is a severe visual complication resulting from radiotherapy of the head and neck, which mostly occurs in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in the southern part of China. The mechanism of RION is unclear. Therefore, identifying risk factors for RION is an important step towards enhancing our understanding. In the current study, we retrospectively reviewed patients with NPC who were admitted to Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital for visual loss between 2006 and 2017. The study included 38 participants (68 eyes) in the corticosteroid-effective group and 35 participants (64 eyes) in the corticosteroids-ineffective group. We analyzed potential risk factors for RION and developed a prediction model for the therapeutic effect of corticosteroid effect based on a random forests method. The prediction model showed a high accuracy with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.932 (95% confidence interval = 0.889-0.975). Our results revealed that blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was significantly associated with RION and that RION patients with higher BUN levels responded better to corticosteroid treatment. Altogether, these results suggest that a prediction model, based on clinical factors, could be applied to estimate the therapeutic effect of corticosteroids on RION. Further investigation, however, is needed to confirm the study conclusion.Copyright © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
4923,"Less efficient g2-m checkpoint is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer in African Americans. Cell cycle checkpoints play critical roles in the maintenance of genomic integrity. The inactivation of checkpoint genes by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms is frequent in all cancer types, as a less-efficient cell cycle control can lead to genetic instability and tumorigenesis. In an on-going case-control study consisting of 216 patients with non-small cell lung cancer, 226 population-based controls, and 114 hospital-based controls, we investigated the relationship of gamma-radiation-induced G2-M arrest and lung cancer risk. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were cultured for 90 hours, exposed to 1.0 Gy gamma-radiation, and harvested at 3 hours after gamma-radiation treatment. gamma-Radiation-induced G2-M arrest was measured as the percentage of mitotic cells in untreated cultures minus the percentage of mitotic cells in gamma-radiation-treated cultures from the same subject. The mean percentage of gamma-radiation-induced G2-M arrest was significantly lower in cases than in population controls (1.18 versus 1.44, P < 0.01) and hospital controls (1.18 versus 1.40, P = 0.01). When dichotomized at the 50th percentile value in combined controls (population and hospital controls), a lower level of gamma-radiation-induced G2-M arrest was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer among African Americans after adjusting for baseline mitotic index, age, gender, and pack-years of smoking [adjusted odd ratio (OR), 2.25; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.97-5.20]. A significant trend of an increased risk of lung cancer with a decreased level of G2-M arrest was observed (P(trend) = 0.02) among African Americans, with a lowest-versus-highest quartile adjusted OR of 3.74 (95% CI, 0.98-14.3). This trend was most apparent among African American females (P(trend) < 0.01), with a lowest-versus-highest quartile adjusted OR of 11.75 (95% CI, 1.47-94.04). The results suggest that a less-efficient DNA damage-induced G2-M checkpoint is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer among African Americans. Interestingly, we observed a stronger association of DNA damage-induced G2-M arrest and lung cancer among African Americans when compared with Caucasians. If replicated, these results may provide clues to the exceedingly high lung cancer incidence experienced by African Americans.",Included
4924,"A useful intraoperative technique for transiliac-transsacral screws: a point-to-point coaxial guide apparatus. BACKGROUND: The transiliac-transsacral screw placement is a clinical challenge for surgeons. This study explored a point-to-point coaxial guide apparatus assisting the transiliac-transsacral screw insertion and aimed to investigate the feasibility and accuracy of the guide apparatus in the treatment of posterior ring unstable pelvic fracture compared with a free-hand technique. METHOD(S): A retrospective study was performed to evaluate patients treated with transiliac-transsacral screws assisted by the point-to-point coaxial guide apparatus or free-hand technique. The intraoperative data of operative time and radiation exposure times were recorded. Postoperative radiographs and CT scans were performed to scrutinize the accuracy of screws position. The quality of the postoperative fracture reduction was assessed according to Matta radiology criteria. The pelvic function was assessed according to the Majeed scoring criteria at 6 months postoperatively. RESULT(S): From July 2017 to December 2019, a total of 38 patients were included in this study, 20 from the point-to-point guide apparatus group and 18 from the free-hand group. There were no significant differences between the two groups in gender, age, injury causes, pelvic fracture type, screws level, and follow-up time (P > 0.05). The average operative time of the guide apparatus group for each screw was significantly less than that in the free-hand group (25.8 +/- 4.7 min vs 40.5 +/- 5.1, P < 0.001). The radiation exposure times were significantly lower in the guide apparatus group than that in the free-hand group (24.4 +/- 6.0 vs 51.6 +/- 8.4, P < 0.001). The intraosseous and juxtacortical rate of screw placement (100%) higher than in the free-hand group (94.4%). CONCLUSION(S): The point-to-point coaxial guide apparatus is feasible for assisting the transiliac-transsacral screw in the treatment of posterior unstable pelvic fractures. It has the advantages of simple operation, reasonable design and no need for expensive equipment, and provides an additional surgical strategy for the insertion of the transiliac-transsacral screw.",Excluded

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility and validity of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) and active breath control (ABC) by long breath-holding in hypofraction radiotherapy of liver tumor., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-four patients received hypofraction radiotherapy of liver tumor with long breath-holding at end-inhale; four prescriptions were used: 6 Gyx7 (n=8), 10 Gyx4 (n=7), 5 Gyx9 (n=6), 4 Gyx10 (n=3). For each fraction, all patients received pre-correction CBCT scans with ABC, some patients received post-correction and post-treatment CBCT. The interfraction and intrafraction liver positioning errors on medial-lateral (ML), cranial-caudal (CC) and anterior-posterior (AP) directions were obtained. The theoretic margin from clinical target volume (CTV) to planning target volume (PTV) was calculated based on post-treatment error. The dosimetric parameters of PTV and normal tissue were compared between ABC and free breathing (FB)., RESULTS: The interfraction error in liver positioning showed system errors (SIGMA) of 3.18 mm (ML), 6.80 mm (CC) and 3.05 mm (AP); random error (sigma) of 3.03 mm (ML), 6.78 mm (CC) and 3.62 mm (AP). These errors were significantly reduced with CBCT guided online correction. The intrafraction systematic error was 0.72 mm (ML), 2.21 mm (CC), 1.49 mm (AP), and random error was 2.30 mm (ML), 3.58 mm (CC), 2.49 mm (AP). Dosimetric parameters such as PTV, the liver's volume included by 23, 30 Gy isodose curve (V23, V30), mean dose to normal liver (MDTNL) and mean dose to cord were significantly larger for FB (P<0.05)., CONCLUSION: Liver radiotherapy with long time breath-holding at end-inhale is an effective method to reduce liver motion, PTV and dose to normal tissue. Interfraction and intrafraction liver positioning errors were substantial. CBCT guided online correction of positioning error is recommended for liver radiotherapy with end-inhale ABC.

Background: Early screening and diagnosis of radiation-induced heart disease (RIHD) is difficult in patients with chest radiation exposure. sST-2 is involved in myocardial stress or injury. We evaluated the relationship between heart dose parameters and sST-2 changes in chest malignant tumor patients who received chest radiation. Method(s): We prospectively collected thoracic malignancy cancer patients who had received chest radiotherapy. Heart dosimetry parameters were extracted from the treatment planning system. sST-2 was measured at baseline, the middle stage, and after radiotherapy (recorded as pre-ST-2, mid-ST-2, and post-ST-2). sST-2 change rate was calculated. Scatter plots showed the relationship between cardiac dose parameters and ST-2 change rate. Multiple regression was used to analyze the relationship between cardiac dose parameters and ST-2 change rate. Result(s): Totally, 60 patients were enrolled.

4930,"Cerebellar modulation of feeding-related neurons in rat dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus. Cerebellum has newly been implicated in many more nonsomatic functions other than motor control. Previous studies indicate that the cerebellum is involved in feeding regulation and that the gastric vagal nerves transmit short-term meal-related visceral signals, including cholecystokinin (CCK), into the hypothalamus. Recently, the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMN) has been thought to play an important role in feeding control. Here we investigate whether the inputs from cerebellar interpositus nucleus (IN) can reach and converge onto single DMN neurons with some feeding-related visceral signals, including gastric vagal inputs, CCK, and blood glucose, whose concentration is closely linked to food intake. Among the 259 DMN neurons recorded, 120 (46.3%) and 169 (65.3%) responded to the cerebellar IN and gastric vagal stimulations, respectively. Within the 120 DMN neurons responsive to the cerebellar IN stimulation, 98 (81.7%) also responded to the gastric vagal stimulus, and a summation of the responses was observed further (n = 20), suggesting a convergence and interaction of cerebellar and gastric vagal inputs on the cells. Moreover, among the 98 cells receiving convergent inputs from cerebellar IN and gastric vagal nerves, 69 (70.4%) were identified to be glycemia sensitive, and 22 (68.8%) of the 32 tested neurons were also sensitive to systemic CCK. These results demonstrate that the DMN integrates somatic information forwarded by the cerebellar IN and visceral signals related to food intake, including gastric vagal, CCK and glycemia, and electrophysiologically reveal a novel cerebellohypothalamic IN-DMN pathway through which the cerebellum may actively participate in short-term feeding regulation.",Excluded

Parameters (TD(50), n, and m) of the LKB NTCP model predicting for>grade 2 AE (RTOG grading) were identified using maximum likelihood analysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses using a binary regression logistic model were performed to identify patient, tumor and dosimetric predictors of AE., RESULTS: Grade 2 or 3 AE occurred in 24% and 52% of pts in group 1 and 2, respectively (p<0.001). For the 93 group 1 pts, the fitted LKB model parameters were: m=0.15, n=0.29 and TD(50)=46 Gy. For the 64 group 2 pts, the parameters were: m=0.42, n=0.09 and TD(50)=36 Gy.

4933,"Statistical analysis of observational study of the influence of radon and other risk factors on lung cancer incidence. An observational study is a type of epidemiological study when the researcher observes the situation but is not able to change the conditions of the experiment. The statistical analysis of the observational study of the population of Lermontov city (North Caucasus) was conducted. In the initial group, there were 121 people with lung cancer diagnosis and 196 people of the control group. Statistical analysis was performed only for men (95 cases and 76 controls). The use of logistic regression with correction on age gives the value of odds ratio 1.95 (0.87/4.37; 90% CI) per 100 working levels per month of combined (occupational and domestic) radon exposure. It was demonstrated that chronic lung diseases are an additional risk factor for uranium miners but it is not a significant risk factor for general population. Thus, the possibility of obtaining statistically reliable results in the observational studies when using the correct methods of analysis is demonstrated.Copyright © The Author 2014.

4934,"Thyroid nodules in the population living around semipalatinsk nuclear test site: Possible implications for dose-response relationships study. The risk of radiation-induced nodules is higher than the risk for radiation-induced cancer. Risk factors and specific modifiers of the dose-response relationship may vary among different populations and not be well recognized. Many thyroid studies have considered thyroid nodularity itself, but not specific morphological types of thyroid nodules. There are many specific types of thyroid nodules which follow a morphological classification of thyroid lesions, including some congenital and tumor-like conditions. Modern equipment and technique can help us to identify particular specific types of thyroid nodules. In this study we report some results of a clinically applicable approach to materials derived from three studies. From 1999 through 2002, we have screened 571 current residents from 4 exposed and 1 control village near the Semipalatinsk Nuclear Test Site area, who were of similar ages (<20) at the time of major radiation fallout events at the SNTS. Prevalent nodules were identified by ultrasound and fine-needle aspiration biopsy, cytopathology results. Analysis of ultrasound images and cytopathology of thyroid lesions among exposed and non-exposed population allowed us to distinguish some interesting ultrasound features for specific types of thyroid nodules. We believe that it would be interesting and possibly more informative for thyroid dosimetry studies to consider specific morphological types of thyroid nodules. We need more detailed research to clarify the feasibility of applying these findings for study of the dose-response relationship.",Included
4935,"Risk of stomach cancer incidence in a cohort of Mayak PA workers occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation. Stomach cancer is a widespread health condition associated with environmental and genetic factors. Contribution of ionizing radiation to stomach cancer etiology is not sufficiently studied. This study was aimed to assess an association of the stomach cancer incidence risk with doses from occupational radiation exposure in a cohort of workers hired at main Mayak production association facilities in 1948-1982 taking into account non-radiation factors including digestive disorders. The study cohort comprised 22,377 individuals and by 31.12.2013 343 stomach cancer diagnoses had been reported among the cohort members. Occupational stomach absorbed doses were provided by the Mayak Worker Dosimetry System- 2008 (MWDS-2008) for external gamma ray exposure and by the Mayak Worker Dosimetry System- 2013 (MWDS-2013) for internal exposure to plutonium. Excess relative risks (ERR) per Gy for stomach cancer were estimated using the Poisson's regression. Analyses were run using the AMFIT module of the EPICURE software. The stomach cancer incidence risk in the study cohort was found to be significantly associated with the stomach absorbed dose of gamma rays: ERR/Gy = 0.19 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.44) with a 0 year lag, and ERR/Gy = 0.20 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.45) with a 5 year lag. To estimate the baseline risk, sex, attained age, smoking status and alcohol consumption, chronic diseases (peptic ulcer, gastritis and duodenitis) were taken into account. No modifications of the radiogenic risk by non-radiation factors were found in the study worker cohort. No association of the stomach cancer incidence risk with internal exposure to incorporated plutonium was observed.Copyright: © 2020 Zhuntova et al.

4936,"Low dose ionizing radiation exposure and cardiovascular disease mortality: cohort study based on Canadian national dose registry of radiation workers. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of our study was to assess the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in a Canadian cohort of 337 397 individuals (169 256 men and 168 141 women) occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation and included in the National Dose Registry (NDR) of Canada. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation, such as those received during radiotherapy, leads to increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. The emerging evidence of excess risk of CVDs after exposure to doses well below those previously considered as safe warrants epidemiological studies of populations exposed to low levels of ionizing radiation. In the present study, the cohort consisted of employees at nuclear power stations (nuclear workers) as well as medical, dental and industrial workers. The mean whole body radiation dose was 8.6 mSv for men and 1.2 mSv for women. RESULT(S): During the study period (1951-1995), as many as 3 533 deaths from cardiovascular diseases have been identified (3 018 among men and 515 among women). In the cohort, CVD mortality was significantly lower than in the general population of Canada. The cohort showed a significant dose response both among men and women. Risk estimates of CVD mortality in the NDR cohort, when expressed as excess relative risk per unit dose, were higher than those in most other occupational cohorts and higher than in the studies of Japanese atomic bomb survivors. CONCLUSION(S): The study has demonstrated a strong positive association between radiation dose and the risk of CVD mortality. Caution needs to be exercised when interpreting these results, due to the potential bias introduced by dosimetry uncertainties, the possible record linkage errors, and especially by the lack of adjustment for non-radiation risk factors.",Included
4937,"Patient-Centered Outcomes Related to Imaging Testing in US Primary Care. Background: Imaging tests are one of the most sophisticated types of diagnostic tools used in health care, yet there are concerns that imaging is overused. Currently, tests are typically evaluated and implemented based on their accuracy, and there is limited knowledge about the range of patient-centered outcomes (PCOs) that imaging tests may lead to. This study explores patients' experiences and subsequent outcomes of imaging tests most notable to patients. Method(s): Adult patients from four primary care clinics who had an x-ray, CT, MRI, or ultrasound in the 12 months before recruitment participated in a single semistructured interview to recount their imaging experience. Interview transcripts were analyzed thematically. Result(s): Four themes related to PCOs were identified from 45 interviews. Participants' mean age was 53 years (25-83 years), 30 had undergone a diagnostic imaging test, and 15 underwent imaging for screening or monitoring. Themes included knowledge gained from the imaging test, its contribution to their overall health care journey, physical experiences during the test procedure, and impacts of the testing process on emotions. Conclusion(s): Patients identified various imaging test outcomes that were important to them. Measurement and reporting these outcomes should be considered more often in diagnostic research. Tools for providers and patients to discuss and utilize these outcomes may help promote shared decision making around the use and impact of imaging tests.Copyright © 2018",Excluded
4938,"Radioiodine therapy in Graves' disease patients with large diffuse goiters treated with or without carbimazole at the time of radioiodine therapy. We S ought to ascertain how high the success rates of radioiodine therapy are for Graves' disease patients with large diffuse goiters when aiming for a constant absorbed dose of 250 Gy. Thirty-six patients with a thyroid volume of 50-110 mL were evaluated for changes in thyroid function and appearance 3, 6, and 12 months after radioiodine therapy. Success was defined as definitive elimination of hyperthyroidism following therapy (hypothyroidism corrected with thyroxine on diagnosis); failure as persistent/recurrent hyperthyroidism after 12 months. Overall success rate was 50%. However, a subgroup of 20 patients without simultaneous carbimazole (carbimazole-off) showed a highly significantly larger success rate (85%) than the 16 patients with simultaneous carbimazole (carbimazole-on) at the time of radioiodine therapy (6.3%, p< 0.000005). Successful cases showed a significantly higher volume reduction after radioiodine than failures (75.5% vs. 35.4%, p < 0.00005). Stepwise logistic regression showed that therapy failure was related to administration of carbimazole during radioiodine therapy (p < 0.0250 and absorbed dose (p < 0.05), but not thyroid function (free triiodothyronine [FT3] and free thyroxine [FT4]), initial thyroid volume or thyrotropin-receptor antibody (TRAb) value. However, a significant correlation of therapy success to absorbed dose (r = 0.69, p < 0.005) could be shown only for carbimazole-off patients, but not for the others. Finally, multivariate favor analysis consistently showed that therapy success was correlated only to absorbed dose and antithyroid drugs, not to initial thyroid volume, TRAb value, or thyroid function. Thyroid volume per se is not responsible for the lower success rate in Graves' disease patients with large goiters because even a comparable group of 32 Graves' disease patients with small thyroid glands (<=20 mL) and without simultaneous carbimazole showed a success rate of 87.5%. The high failure rate in the carbimazole-on patients (absorbed dose comparable to carbimazole-off) is due to the simultaneous administration of carbimazole. Therefore, if clinically feasible, we recommend discontinuing carbimazole at least one day before beginning radioiodine therapy.",Excluded

4940,"Radio-guided localization of a small pulmonary nodules during thoracoscopic resection. Introduction: Today Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery (VATS) is the procedure to prefer for diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary nodules. However, small or not peripheral nodules can be invisible or impalpable during toracoscopy, so difficult to localized. Many techniques have been developed to solve such problem. Herein we report our 13-years experience with Radio-guided One. Material(s) and Method(s): Patients with pulmonary nodules smaller than 1cm and/or deeper, below the visceral pleura, underwent CT-guided injection, into the nodule a solution composed by 0,2 ml 99Tc- labelled human serum albumin microsphers and 0,1 ml non-ionic contrast. Then, during the toracoscopic procedure, a 11 mm diameter-collimated probe connected to a gamma ray detector is introduced to scan the lung surface. The area of major radioactivity is resected. Result(s): From 1997 to 2009, 450 patients underwent toracoscopic resection of a small pulmonary nodules, 155 with the radio-guided technique. The patients were men and women, with average age of 60,6 (range: 12-83). Mean duration of surgical procedure was 43 min (range: 20 -100). The procedure was successful in 150/155 cases. Five cases (3,2%) required conversion to minithoracotomy approach. The mean length of pleural dreinage and hospital stay was 2,3 and 4 respectively.

4941,"Epidemiological features of brain tumors. Brain tumors account for 1.4% of all cancers and 2.4% of all cancer-related deaths. The incidence of brain tumors varies and it is higher in developed countries of Western Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand. In Serbia, according to data from 2009, malignant brain tumors account for 2.2 of all tumors, and from all cancer-related deaths, 3.2% is caused by malignant brain tumors. According to recent statistical reports, an overall incidence of brain tumors for benign and malignant tumors combined is 18.71 per 100,000 persons/year. The most common benign brain tumor in adults is meningioma, which is most present in women, and the most common malignant tumor is glioblastoma, which is most present in adult men. Due to high mortality, especially in patients diagnosed with glioblastoma and significant brain tumor morbidity, there is a constant interest in understanding its etiology in order to possibly prevent tumor occurrence in future and enable more efficient treatment strategies for this fatal brain disease. Despite the continuously growing number of epidemiological studies on possible factors of tumor incidence, the etiology remains unclear. The only established environmental risk factor of gliomas is ionizing radiation exposure. Exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields via cell phone use has gained a lot of attention as a potential risk factor of brain tumor development. However, studies have been inconsistent and inconclusive, so more definite results are still expected.",Excluded

4945,"[The aqueous humour antioxidative capacity in different types and color of the age-related cataract]. BACKGROUND/AIM: Oxidative stress results from increased oxidative processes, decreased antioxidative protection, or both processes simultaneously. Photooxidative stress, as a form of oxidative stress, induced by the energy of solar radiation, today is considered as crucial in the age-related cataractogenesis. Other known and unknown, endogenous and egsogenous factors that contribute to the oxidative stress intensity, can influnce the cataract type and brunescence. Thus the oxidative stress intensity and its form might determine the cataract type and brunescence, and also make the efforts in cataract prevention more complex. Hence, the objective of the present paper was to investigate the current amount of antioxidative capacity in aqueous humour during the cataract genesis of different types and pigmentation of cataract., METHODS: Transversal review of 80 samples of humour aqueous obtained during extracapsular cataract extraction. Aqueouses were analyzed by tiobarbituric acid (TBA) method for the total antioxidant activity estimation, expressed as %iMDA, and by using 0.1 ml of aqueous., RESULTS: The mixed type of cataract showed the statistically significantly lower values of the intensities of antioxidative protection in aqueous humour compared to cortical and nuclear cataracts (p < 0.001, respectively). Between pure nuclear and cortical cataracts we found the small differences of the investigated parameter, but they pointed to the decreased level of antioxidative protection, i.e. the increased intensity of the aqueous humour oxidative stress in the cortical cataract type. A significant correlation betweer the cortical cataract maturation and the %iMDA (p < 0.05) was found., CONCLUSIONS: The role of the oxidative stress, here expressed as the antioxidative capacity of aqueous humour, could not be the same for all the cataract types. The lower level of antioxidative protection of aqueous in brunescent and mixed cataracts may point to the higher intensity of oxidative stress in those cataract types. The correlation betweer the cortical cataract maturity and %iMDA points to the significant decrease of the aqueous antioxidative protection in the cataract progression.",Excluded

The present study assessed whether exhaled breath analysis using proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) could screen for radiation exposure. As the intensity of proton transfer reaction reagent ion H3(16)O(+) can be calculated with the intensity of H3(18)O(+), the intensity of H3(18)O(+) was monitored to observe the stability of the PTR-MS instrument during the experiment. The PTR-MS was applied for detecting the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the exhaled breath from 42 radiotherapy patients and other 61 patients who had not received radiotherapy. All patients were enrolled in the local cancer hospital. In the experiment, the subjects breathe slowly to the PTR-MS through a direct inlet system without any sampling bag or tube. The breath mass spectrometric data was statistically analyzed using Mann-Whitney U test and stepwise discriminant analysis to find the characteristic ions of radiation exposure. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was applied for a combination of the characteristic ions. The PTR-MS instrument was stable as the intensity of reaction ion H3(16)O(+) was maintained in 1.1%. Through statistically analysis, we found 6 kinds of characteristic ions of radiation exposure, specifically mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) 93, m/z 41, m/z 102, m/z 79, m/z 131, and m/z 143. The sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) were 78.6% and 82.0% respectively. The integrated area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.869.

Background Although intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is a standard of care for many head and neck cancers, its use for carotid-sparing (CS) therapy in early-stage laryngeal carcinoma is controversial. Methods 330 consecutive patients with early-stage laryngeal carcinoma were treated from 1/1989 to 5/2011, including 282 conventional radiotherapy (CRT) and 48 CS-IMRT patients. The median follow-up was 43 (CS-IMRT) and 66 (CRT) months. Results There was no difference in local failure rates comparing patients undergoing CS-IMRT with CRT, with 3-year local control rates of 88% vs. 89%, respectively (p = 0.938).

4949,"Histopathological examination of spine tumors after treatment with radiosurgery. OBJECTIVE Increased survival time after diagnosis of neoplastic disease has resulted in a gradual increase in spine tumor incidence. Radiosurgery is frequently a viable alternative to operative management in a population with severe medical comorbidities. The authors sought to assess the histopathological consequences of radiosurgery in the subset of patients progressing to operative intervention. METHODS Eighteen patients who underwent radiosurgery for spine tumors between 2008 and 2014 subsequently progressed to surgical treatment. A histopathological examination of these cases was performed. Indications for surgery included symptomatic compression fractures, radiographic instability, and symptoms of cord or cauda equina compression. Biopsy samples were obtained from the tumor within the radiosurgical zone in all cases and were permanently fixated. Viable tumor samples were stained for Ki 67. RESULTS Fifteen patients had metastatic lesions and 3 patients had neurofibromas. The mean patient age was 57 years. The operative indication was symptomatic compression in 10 cases (67%). The most frequent metastatic lesions were breast cancer (4 cases), renal cell carcinoma (3), prostate cancer (2), and endometrial cancer (2). In 9 (60%) of the 15 metastatic cases, histological examination of the lesions showed minimal evidence of inflammation. Viable tumor at the margins of the radiosurgery was seen in 9 (60%) of the metastatic cases. Necrosis in the tumor bed was frequent, as was fibrotic bone marrow. Vascular ectasia was seen in 2 of 15 metastatic cases, but sclerosis with ectasia was frequent. No evidence of malignant conversion was seen in the periphery of the lesions in the 3 neurofibroma cases. In 1 case of neurofibroma, the lesion demonstrated some small areas of remnant tumor in the radiosurgical target zone. CONCLUSIONS This case series demonstrates important histopathological characteristics of spinal lesions treated by SRS. Regions with the highest exposure to radiation appear to be densely necrotic and show little evidence of tumor growth, whereas peripheral regions distant from the radiation dosage are more likely to demonstrate viable tumor in malignant and benign neoplasms. Physiological tissue appears to be similarly affected. With additional investigation, a more homogenized field of hypofractionated radiation exposure may allow for tumor obliteration with relative preservation of critical anatomical structures.",Excluded

In crew members who flew 2-6 months on the International Space Station, in-flight and postflight plasma phylloquinone concentrations were unchanged from the preflight mean. Consistent with this finding, urinary I-carboxyglutamic acid (GLA), a measure of vitamin K-dependent protein turnover, did not change in response to flight. Serum undercarboxylated osteocalcin (%ucOC), a measure of vitamin K function, was generally unchanged in response to flight. Spaceflight findings were corroborated by findings of no changes in phylloquinone, urinary GLA, or %ucOC during or after bed rest in three separate bed rest studies (21-90 days in duration) or after a 14-day saturation dive.

4951,"Risk of oxidative damage and bone resorption from increased iron stores during space flight. An increased amount of stored iron from neocytolysis of red blood cells and a high dietary intake of iron during space flight have raised concern about the risk of excess iron causing oxidative damage, particularly in bone. To investigate this risk, biomarkers of iron status, oxidative damage, and bone resorption during space flight were analyzed for 23 (16 M/7 F) International Space Station crewmembers. As many as 5 in-flight blood samples and 24-h urine pools were collected from each crewmember. Serum iron increased slightly during space flight and decreased at landing (P < 0.0004). An increase in serum ferritin early in flight (217% in women and 68% in men, P < 0.0004), returning to preflight concentrations at landing, and a decrease in transferrin and transferrin receptors during flight indicated that a transient increase in iron stores occurred. No inflammatory response was observed during flight. The oxidative damage markers 8-hydroxy-2'- deoxyguanosine and prostaglandin F2alpha were positively correlated (both P < 0.001) with serum ferritin. A greater area under the curve for ferritin during flight was correlated with greater changes in bone mineral density of several bone regions after flight. The results suggest that increased iron stores do constitute a risk factor for oxidative damage and bone resorption, during space flight and on Earth.",Excluded
